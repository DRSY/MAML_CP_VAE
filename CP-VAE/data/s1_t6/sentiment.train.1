he went on ; the words spilled out of him , which is a feature of such heavenly paroxysms of joy : i ’ m so happy to see you !
it all depends on where the concierge draws the boundary line , for the pickings may be big or small , according to the whim of whoever is sweeping the rubbish into a pile
a feather crushes the man who lifted fauchelevent ’ s cart
i spoke to the porter and his missus , who ’ s a lovely stout woman , they don ’ t know anything about him !
jean valjean bent down and kissed the little girl ’ s hand
tell him that someone wants to talk to him in private but don ’ t give the name
he ’ s let ’ imself get played for a sap by some flatfoot , maybe even by a stool pigeon , and they ’ ve pulled a fast one on him
he had grabbed le cabuc ’ s collar , smock , and braces in his left hand
he grabbed the pistol and a faint clicking sound announced that he had cocked it
the expressionism of a l\tlnster , born of the labour of a science delibcrately deprived of a conscience
what was that about ?
the house in the rue plumet still belonged to cosette , having been taken out on a lease
the beginning of a shadow
in the blink of an eye and with all the suppleness of a young man , he was back at the hole in the wall
at the time people were just beginning to follow the innovative practices of laënnecnumber in the study and treatment of chest diseases
what have cartridge pouches to do with the venus de médicis ?
he wanted marius to understand , but marius did not understand , which made the old man furious
the expression that truth is stranger than fiction ’ takes on its full meaning here
he told himself he ’ d done everything he could and that now all he had to do was go back the way he ’ d come , quietly
to end the duel , to meld the pure ideal with human reality , to peacefully rub right into might and might into right—this is the work of the wise
on the one hand , a sacred tomb , on the other , white hair
this is why he simplified fantine ’ s burial and reduced it to the bare necessity known as the potter ’ s field
there , opportunities to get lost abounded
progress is the end ; the ideal is the model
a moment later , he turned the corner of the rue des prêcheurs
murmured cosette , i can ’ t believe i ’ m seeing you again
the whole convent thought he was stupid
all of them here are right
as for marius ’ s inner political revolution , monsieur mabeuf was wholly incapable of understanding it , of wanting it , or of directing it
that , as he went off , he was very sweet as usual and that all he said to the concierge was not to wait up for him that night
the objector will swiftly reply that the evils of the day before yesterday do not justify those of yesterday , which , in any case , were worse
come on , look at me , mate !
in the corner of the fireplace , a leather strap hung from a nail
the saying non pluribus imparnumber cropped up again in the stone rays representing a sunburst on the façade of the quai d ’ orsay barracks
this cavernous hold knows no philosophers ; its daggers have never whittled quills
it ’ s a crown tempered with a cotton cap
in , two years before the lumiere brothers invented cinema , munch had tried to puff up the painted image with a sort of sound relief , which was until that moment the sale province of music and its attendant notations
monsieur mabeuf could grow only a few rare plants that like rain and shade there
there is also such a thing as moral greatness ; we cling to it
forests are apocalypses ; and the beating of a little soul ’ s wings makes an agonizing sound under their monstrous vault
fantine had left her province about twelve years before and montreuil-sur-mer had changed
he still had the apple branch in his hand
all of a sudden , cosette cried : father , it looks like someone ’ s coming over there
mother thénardier was taking care of supper , which was roasting over a good strong fire ; old man thénardier was drinking with his customers and talking politics
the following week , thirty thousand cartridges were distributed
when he felt he was far away from all human habitation , he raised his eyes and looked around him
the house he lived in , as we ’ ve said , consisted of a downstairs and an upstairs : three rooms at street level , three bedrooms on the upper floor , and an attic above
after this average unknown man , who decreed the protest of dead bodies , had spoken , expressing how they all felt , a strangely satisfied and terrible cry arose from everyone ’ s lips , deadly in meaning and yet triumphant in tone : long live death !
here it is on its feet heading for us
the captive went on : do what you like with me
to start with , it ’ s a white sheet
very well , but madness too
she muttered to herself on a forlorn note : none of that , lisette !
happiness wants everyone to be happy
of the german battalion defending it , only forty-two men survived ; all the officers , minus five , were dead or taken
the revolution majestically taking back possession of france and telling the world : to be continued tomorrow !
from the second year on , bruneseau took on his son-in-law , nargaud , as his assistant
he was sleeping peacefully , untroubled
caesar , said combeferre , rightly fell
at times a death rattle interrupted her
he bristled hideously ; nothing is as awful to see as a wild animal , startled ; their frightened look is frightening
initial sketch of two shady characters
perhaps at this juncture it is worth remembering paul celan , the german poet vho committed suicide in paris in , the same year that painter mark rothko did in nev york but why stop there in art 's death roll , featuring as it does a constant suicide rate from the self-destruction of vincent van gogh , 'the man with the missing ear ' ?
she let him address her formally
only , when a child passed near a nun and spoke to her , the nun never replied
the thing is—and it ’ s a strange phenomenon , one that could not occur outside the situation he was now in—in stealing the money from that child , he had done something he was already no longer capable of
he jotted down a few figures in pencil on a scrap of paper
the love life of marius !
he had to be carted away and replaced
i put on my gruff voice for him , i frightened him with my cane , but he knew very well that it was all just in fun
if you like , you could say the hôtel de rambouillet meets the cour des miraclesnumber duchesses have their slang , too , as is attested by this sentence that occurs in a love letter written by a very great lady , and a very pretty one , of the restoration : you will find in such palaver a spate of reasons why i should want to fly the coop ( for : you will find in that gossip many reasons why i wish to free myself )
jean valjean had worked on cosette
she shall be brought to you
he had not thought for single moment about the girl since the day she had taken him to the rue plumet , he had not seen her again , she had completely gone out of his mind
the time has come , it seems to me
the day their eyes first met and at last blurted out those first obscure and unspeakable things that a look stammers , cosette did not at first understand
this street is so quiet !
then , as is the way with such black clouds , calm returned , and hope , and a sort of unconscious smile expressing trust in god
as unashamedly light as he was and without detracting in any way from his gaiety , he had a certain way of being , imposing , dignified , honest , and arrogant in a bourgeois sort of way ; and his great age added to the effect
cosette curled up into a ball of anguish in the corner of the fireplace , trying to gather up and conceal her poor half-naked limbs from view
the father replied : that would be imprudent
here , feel that , give me your hand , don ’ t be frightened , there it is
it felt as though someone had collared him as he fled and brought him back
he had put an old maid the curé had passed on to him in charge of it and had complete confidence in this overseer , an impeccably respectable person , firm , fair , full of the charity that consists in giving , but not so full of the charity that consists in understanding and forgiving
the heart of europe , after waterloo , was black
all kinds of rubbish had been wheeled in from all directions and thrown on , making the exterior even more tangled
i ’ m no sleazy sluggard , that i am not !
his ruddy , fresh colouring , the full set of pearly white teeth that he ’ d held on to and that his laugh showed off , gave him that open , easygoing air that prompts people to describe a young man as a good lad and an old man as a good old stick
we could compete with what is known as berlin jewellery
this was , as you will recall , in number
who will plant the flag back on the barricade ?
he ’ s coming in a cab
monsieur gillenormand thought he saw a slight frown on marius ’ s brow , though marius , we have to say , was actually no longer listening to him , floating off as he was in ecstasy , with his mind a lot more on cosette than on number the grandfather , trembling at having introduced andré chénier so clumsily , rushed on : his throat cut ’ is not the right way to put it
in the last century , the worthy natoire , number one of the masters of whimsy now scorned by the school of rigidity , having got tipsy several times in this tavern at the very table where régnier got plastered , had painted a bunch of corinth grapes on a rose pink post out of gratitude
how he would have kissed his old white head , flooded his hair with tears , admired his scar , squeezed his hands , adored his clothes , kissed his feet !
they went to the convent : the best information and the most respectable testimonials abounded ; the good sisters had little aptitude or inclination for delving into questions of paternity , and without meaning any harm , had never really known exactly which of the two fauchelevents little cosette was the daughter of
where love stutters in such charming argot !
jean valjean said nothing
this is why the torch of europe , that is , of civilization , was carried first by greece , who passed it on to italy , who passed it on to france
the changer only catered to normal men
a brass lamp lit a tablecloth of coarse white cotton , a pewter pitcher that gleamed like silver , and a smoking brown soup tureen
he left with immense despair
on top of this , it is good
do we have to think waterloo was a good thing ?
rip up his shirt and carve up his sheets to twist himself a hangman ’ s friend , belt a few portholes in the door , cook up some false dog tags , knock up a few open sesames , snip his fetters , chuck his twister outside , lie low , keep under cover , you ’ ve got to be smart to last !
he walked slowly , with his head down , in an attitude of reflection and sadness
the day looked brighter again to her mind
he had a superior , one monsieur gisquet ; till that day he had barely given a thought to that other superior , god
second , where is it coming from ?
he had thought long and hard the whole night , he had thought long and hard the whole day ; the only thing he could still hear inside him was a voice that said : woe is me !
they headed once more toward the bastille
there was ash in his teeth
the darkness was serene
this man is extremely dangerous
he had not given up at the first sign of trouble ; he had just done all he could to continue on his way
it was midday before bülow ’ s advance guard could get even as far as chapelle-saint-lambert
you even had a parcel of clothes in your hand just like here , this morning !
she turned on the tap ; the child had lifted her head and was following her every move
if you only knew !
what you lot call progress ’ runs on two engines , people and events
he took hold of the chair and with a swift thrust of his heel , kicked the straw out
an intercepted letter went like this : the day is not far off when , at four by the clock , eighty thousand patriots will be armed
i was pretty desperate there , myself !
i ’ ve still got people to see
dawn and resurrection are synonyms
he studied the cul-de-sac genrot ; that way was blocked
a good hour passed in the deepest silence
to go to war at every summons and every time utopia desires it is not the way of the peoples of the world
give us back our fathernumber
she slept in her coffin for twenty years , with the express permission of our holy father , pius vii
only , he meant to put you in a convent for men and he got it wrong
she was as one with old gillenormand ; while he elevated joy into aphorisms and maxims , she gave off love and goodness like a perfume
when there were no more than a few houses between himself and this street that seemed to draw him like a magnet , his steps would slow down to such an extent that at times you could be forgiven for thinking he had stopped walking
she was handling the flower instinctively , innocently , without suspecting that pulling the petals off a daisy is to pluck a heart
if the wardens had spotted them , they ’ d have chased the ragamuffins away
cosette emerged from the nook in which she had been hiding
she doesn ’ t know anything about anything , it would appall her
his hat had been tossed a few feet away in the bushes
down there , the bottom of a bottle avows drunkenness , the handle of a basket tells of domesticity ; there , the apple core that once gave itself literary opinions goes back to being an apple core ; the head on the five-franc piece frankly turns to verdigris , caïaphas ’ s spit meets falstaff ’ s vomit , number the gold louis from the gambling den bumps into the nail with the suicide ’ s bit of rope still hanging off it , a livid foetus rolls by wrapped in the sequins that danced at the last mardi gras at the opéra , a judge ’ s wig that has judged men grovels next to a bit of rot that was once maggie ’ s skirt
was he trying to issue a warning or to launch a threat ?
the young mother spent the night at the inn , handed over her money and left her little girl behind , buckled up her overnight bag , emptied of its bundle of clothes and now light , and set out the following morning , counting on returning soon
jean valjean , doing violence to his habits , took cosette to see the festivities to distract her from the memory of the day before and to erase the abominable thing that had passed before her in the laughing tumult of le tout-paris
he no longer walked close by them as he used to do before ; he would sit far away and remain in ecstasy ; he would have a book with him and pretend to read it ; but who was he pretending for ?
they elect those they obey
it is for sale
they are pale and serious
but you didn ’ t cry out , which was nice of you , my compliments ; and i ’ ll tell you what i conclude from that fact : my dear monsieur , when a man cries out , who comes ?
it never crossed jean valjean ’ s mind
for everything , he knew all the best places ; he also knew how to kickbox and make his way around a gymnasium and a dance floor , and he was a natural with a singlestick in stickfighting
she went to the salon window , which was shut and shuttered , and pressed her ear against it
she sewed , she slept on a camp bed , she lived with a flowerpot for company , she was content
it is deduced from this that the victim was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time , through sheer bad luck , and paid the price in someone else 's place
is this an inn ?
the vault under the altar !
obviously he was just passing through
equal parceling out abolishes emulation
javert leaned on the parapet with both elbows , his chin in both hands , and while his nails mechanically raked through his thick sideburns , he reflected
it has been estimated that in salvos , royal and military shows of politeness , exchanges of courteous din , signals of etiquette , formalities of harbour and citadel , sunrises and sunsets , saluted daily by all the fortresses and all the warships , openings and closings of gates , etc , etc , the civilized world all over the globe fires off number , number pointless cannon shots every twenty-four hours
at first , and especially at first sight , he hardly seemed to be anything more , indeed , than a good old stick
he had already laid a number of them in the hour he had been in the garden
monsieur leblanc did not cut him off , but when he cut himself off , he said : i don ’ t know what you are talking about
children of the thénardiers , rented out to mother magnon , attributed to monsieur gillenormand , and now leaves dropped by all those rootless trees and tumbled along the ground by the wind
people would say : now there ’ s a rich man who doesn ’ t give himself airs
had breakfast at the tête-noire , to which castaingnumber had not yet been , treated themselves to a game of quoits on the paths by the main pool , climbed up to diogenes ’ lantern , bet macaroons on the roulette wheel at the pont de sèvres , picked bunches of flowers at puteaux , bought toy reed pipes at neuilly , number ate apple turnovers everywhere they went , and were perfectly happy
he wrote in silence
as they were downing their first oysters , a head appeared at the stairwell hatch and a voice said : i was just passing when i caught a heady whiff of brie from the street
one grave symptom was that they had caused unconsciousness and you don ’ t always recover from unconsciousness of the kind
she had a bit of a beard
fantine could not write , could scarcely read ; as a child , she had only been taught to sign her name ; she had paid a public letter-writer to write one letter to tholomyès , then a second and a third
the bench of the circuit court had had to make do with two underlings , panchaud , alias printanier , alias bigrenaille , and demi-liard , alias deux-milliards , who had been sentenced in the presence of the parties involved to ten years in the galleys
this was now the toned-down translation of his initial expressions of outrage
this awful situation , which had already gone on for more than an hour , was changing every second
gavroche , shot at , was taunting the shooting
am sick since my last lye-in , abandoned by my husband for five months not haveing any ressorse in the world in the most awfull indigance
columns were sent out into the fermenting streets , sweeping the main ones , sounding out the small ones , right and left , sometimes slowly and cautiously , other times charging along
because a man was at waterloo , that doesn ’ t make him a monster ; you don ’ t separate a father from his son for that
all the cartridges having been made and all the powder having been used , this table was now free
the whole rathole was lit up by the glare from a big cast-iron stove parked in the fireplace and filled with burning charcoal—the stove that mother jondrette had worked on that morning
on top of that , he had in his favour that great promotion to the throne , exile
cicero was tough on caesar and he was right
then the revolution broke out
never in the animal kingdom does a creature born to be a dove turn into a rapacious white-tailed eagle
all flight should be a smooth slide
o , second step , how black you are !
who ’ s turned up so early in the morning ?
there was no longer anything in his face or in his attitude other than a pity beyond words
on june number , number , he was counting more than ever on the artillery because he had the numbers in his favour
what did this splendid ignoramus mean when , with everyone against him , no one for him , without provisions , without munitions , without cannons , without shoes , almost without an army , with a handful of men against masses , he ran at allied europe and carried absurd—impossible—victories against all the odds ?
every step he took going from one piece of furniture to the other wore him out and he was forced to sit down
progress marches onward ; it makes the great human and earthly journey toward the heavenly and the divine ; it has its halts where it rallies the flock lagging behind ; it has its stops where it meditates beside some splendid canaan that suddenly unveils its promised land ; it has its nights where it sleeps ; and one of the poignant preoccupations of the thinker is to see shadow over the human soul and to grope around in the dark without being able to wake dozing progress up
so what is progress ?
these were the mirages of those bygone days
the pure idea turns into assault and battery
the guilty party is not he who has sinned but he who created the darkness in the first place
the man took the four sous
in this frame of mind he had encountered petit-gervais and stolen his forty sous from him
he held his glass out to joly , who refilled it , then he drank , and proceeded , almost without having been interrupted by this glass of wine which no one noticed , not even himself
in their dreams , the fervent females were chosen by and possessed christ
a child can get away where a man is sunk
you will recall that he pretended he had served in the army ; with a good deal of embellishment , he would tell how , at waterloo , being a sergeant in a numberth or a numberth light something-or-other , he alone , against a squadron of hussars of death , had covered a dangerously wounded general with his body , saving him from grapeshot
he opened his eyes again , promptly sat up , shot out his arm , and groped for his haversack , which he had thrown into the corner of the alcove , then swung his legs over the side of the bed and placed his feet on the floor and found himself sitting up straight on the bed , not knowing how he ’ d got into that position
thénardier pushed the table in toward monsieur leblanc , took the inkwell , a pen , and a sheet of paper from the drawer , which he left slightly open , and where the long blade of a knife gleamed
the bridle gate and the pedestrian gate were two iron gates standing side by side next to a gate-house built by the architect perronet , where the cemetery gatekeeper lived
let ’ s see , father , said the old maid
that whole fortune really did belong to him !
certainly , as we ’ ve said before , adversity sharpens the wits and calamity is the highest form of education ; yet it is doubtful that jean valjean was in any state to unravel all the strands we have singled out here
his mind had two modes , one to do with man , the other to do with god ; he was either studying or meditating
so , ve will no t be talking about profane art versus sacred art but we may well tackle the profanation of forms and bodies over the course of the twentieth century
i ’ m an honest man , you see
he did not see monsieur leblanc and his daughter leave and decided that they must have gone out through the rue de l ’ ouest gate
old man thénardier retreated in good order
on one of the pallets , marius glimpsed a sort of skinny whey-faced girl sitting , almost naked , with her feet dangling , looking as though she couldn ’ t hear or see , and was not , in fact , alive
you decline , you descend , you dwindle , you even drop without being particularly aware of it
monsieur boulard , number whom i knew , never walked around without a book either , and that way he always had a book close to his heart
either the fairies or the police had something to do with this
in a week we will be in england
x the bishop before an unknown light
and on top of that , there was wainscoting from our grandmothers ’ day
the privilege of the cinematographic image is that it derives naturally ’ from this indeterminate significance which , in the age of history and of aesthetics – in the romantic age , in short – turns any life whatever into the stuff of absolute art
fourteen years for trying to escape four times
it ’ s true , the husband added softly
how abandon his friends who were waiting for him !
did you go to the other joint , rue de chauffaut ?
between cold water and hot water , it is the party of lukewarm water
you ask me what ’ s forcing me to speak ?
by the time you read this , five fiery steeds will be bringing us back to our mamas and papas
at every jolt from the pavement , a drop of blood fell from marius ’ s hair
the bishop looked at her in amazement
that is , come in
on that note , i say quite frankly , nowadays people marry but they no longer know how to marry
this one thinks he owns the pont-neufnumber and stops society strolling along the cornice outside the parapets ; that one is always pulling a person ’ s ears , and so on , and so forth
there are three of us
where had he come from ?
we will try here to describe these poetics , independently of the specific schools ’ they have come to be embodied in and the monopolies over particular names or concepts those schools have laid claim to
the man did not look all that much less ferocious or frightening than jondrette ; a mastiff is occasionally no less alarming to run into than a wolf
his feet were already dead and cold but his head was alive with all life ’ s potency and seemed powerfully illuminated
he made a good two thousand francs a year from it ; that was more or less the sum total of his fortune
she also noted that there were all sorts of things in the pockets , not just the needles , scissors , and thread that she had seen , but a fat wallet , a very big knife , and , a most suspect detail , several wigs of various colours
the mill is no longer standing , but the wind ’ s still there , blowing away
after a few seconds ’ rest , she set off again
he thought the poor soul had departed
i have only one god , one king , one sou , and one boot
maybe he would come out in some sunny stretch of a public square
like foy , his predecessor , number he upheld liberty after having upheld command
after a pause , he added : i ’ m asking you questions but you ’ re right not to answer
at the same moment , javert made it to the thénardier couple
how he regretted his self-sacrifice and his insanity in bringing cosette back into the world , poor hero of renunciation , seized and felled by his very devotion !
they ’ re all in jail now and can do no more harm , he thought , but what a lamentable family in distress !
it recognizes by the imprint of a fingernail on a piece of parchment the difference that distinguishes the jewry of the judengasse from the jewry of the ghettonumber it retrieves from what remains what has been , the good , the bad , the false , the true , the bloodstain of the law court , the inkblot in the cave , the blob of tallow in the house of ill repute , the ordeals endured , the welcome temptations , the orgies spewed out , the kink that people have acquired in abasing themselves , the trace of prostitution in souls their own coarseness made them capable of , and on the jacket of the porters of rome , the mark of messalina ’ s dignumber in the ribs
he saw the bed , and on the mattress this young man covered in blood , white with a waxy whiteness , eyes closed , mouth agape , lips pale , naked to the waist , slashed to ribbons with dark red wounds , lying there motionless under harsh light
she listened , bewildered , she watched , alarmed , and at each word that monsieur madeleine uttered , she felt the awful blackness of hate dissolving and evaporating inside her and she felt something indescribably warm and wonderful well up in her heart ; it was joy , trust , and love
in exchange for reality , you have been given a perfect outer show , a good semblance of a life
when fantine saw she was making a living , she had a moment of sheer exhilaration
oh , what an unbeatable promise !
that is where they skip school all day , permanently
jean prouvaire was only timid at rest
where the devil have i seen that man before ?
what moved the carpenter to show this to his neighbours was that , a few steps farther on , he picked up another note , also ripped up and even more interesting
the thing is , i ’ m cured
don ’ t you realize you ’ d have given anyone who didn ’ t know you quite a fright ?
to observe the urban outskirts is to observe the amphibian
éponine , who had not taken her eyes off them , saw them turn back the way they had come
then she dropped back onto the pallet
in any case , the solitude he found himself in was so strangely calm that this appalling racket , so furious and so near , did not ruffle it in the least
take this , you respectable people
the english occupied the french camp , it being the usual observance of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished
anyone who was hungry could show up and was sure of finding work and something to eat there
the man added : you can keep this note as your receipt
the -st stuck in his throat
they chatted between themselves in a quiet , oblivious sort of way
she said to him
say the children ’ s clothes
the greasy spoon was doing badly
so he had to go to arras , free the false jean valjean , denounce the true one !
the secrets of the rich are sponges full of gold ; you have to know how to squeeze them
a circle was drawn around the hearse
rather than borrow , he went without eating
this is not some fat-arsed bookworm , a student who actually studies , some pimply pedant , strong in science , literature , theology , and sapience , one of those ninnies dressed to the nines , with a different outfit for each faculty
though it ’ s dark already
in america , in a region close to panama , there is a village called la joya
to see such imagination at work , devising schemes that are nothing more than the wild and reckless inventions of the galleys , to surface from his peaceful surroundings and get mixed up in what he called the quiet chugging along of the convent was as amazing to fauchelevent as it would be to a person out walking if he saw a seagull fishing in the gutter of the rue saint-denis
monsieur leblanc approached with his kind sad eyes , and said to father jondrette : monsieur , you will find new clothes , woolen stockings , and blankets in this parcel
can you fix the wheel right away ?
this heaven was the internal light of his conscience
with the rest , i ’ ll buy something for dinner
we weren ’ t very happy
how long is the coffin ?
young man , said laigle de meaux , let this be a lesson to you
it is , as you will recall , at the opposite spot , going toward the genappe road , that the cuirassiers collapsed
so that is the formidable man we are dealing with
it is hard to tell what we see
the virgin mary next to my stove
people come and go , they chat , crack jokes , sit around
but he didn ’ t have time to relate anything
a cloister is not a building site
jean valjean was from a poor peasant family from brienumber as a child he had not learned to read
the code was now a mere stub in his hand
as for her finery , that airy toilette of muslin and ribbons put together so gaily , with such whimsy and poetry , full of tinkling baubles and the scent of lilacs—it had evaporated like the lovely sparkling frosts that you can mistake for diamonds in the sun and that melt , leaving only the black branches behind
jean valjean was still , for her , monsieur le maire
despite the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments meted out , when the wind shook the trees they sometimes managed to furtively grab a green apple or a half-rotten apricot or a worm-riddled pear
if the woman squatting had stood up , her height and her bearing , which were those of an ambulatory colossus fit for the fairground freak show , might very well have frightened off the traveller , derailed her confidence , and caused what we are about to relate to vanish into thin air
as far as anguish went , this was the last straw
why didn ’ t the man give marius some sign of life , when marius was in his eternal debt ?
whence , if the times are hard enough , those alarming commotions once known as jacqueries , peasants ’ revolts , next to which purely political turbulence is child ’ s play
in the fualdès affair , number which dates from around that time , number , they sided with bastide and jausion because fualdès was a buonapartist
what he had on his forehead was not the wrinkles of age , but the mysterious mark of death
they would serve him quietly , and if compliance meant making themselves scarce , they disappeared
hero refuses to wash leander ’ s dead body
he heard , so slowly he could grasp them one after the other , latin words that he could not understand rising and falling away : qui dormiunt terrae pulvere , evigilabunt ; alii in vitam aeternam , et alii in opprobrium , ut videant sempernumber
there was indeed no trace of a wound
what part of the country are you from ?
jean valjean had before him something resembling the two branches of a y which one should he choose ?
hurtling headlong into death is sometimes the only way to escape going down with the ship ; the coffin lid can become a lifeline
all the stoves were burning ; a great fire blazed merrily in the fireplace
as we have seen , prayer , celebration of religious offices , charity , consoling the afflicted , cultivating a little patch of ground , fraternity , frugality , hospitality , self-denial , trust , study , and work filled every day of his life
unless you ’ ve got a silver chin , tholomyès observed
i walked into a village i saw
she didn ’ t dare promise herself anything and didn ’ t want to deny herself anything , either
cosette tagged along without asking any questions
did he have any idea what monsieur fauchelevent ’ s political views were ?
here and there , over the grey surface , invisible arrow slits that looked like black threads could be made out
a moment ago , in book four , we saw one of the chambers of the upper mine , of the great sap of politics , revolution , and philosophy
the wall behind the rotunda was like milton glimpsed behind berquinnumber
for now marius distinctly saw that episode again , resurfacing like indelible ink over a flame
this very serious matter was being tackled by two people talking in low voices with their heads together : let ’ s start by finding the names
the plague was born in them , despots died in them
wellington was waiting for blücher ; he did
sometimes the things you see grab you and hold you in place
then , instantly calming down , he gave vent to a whole inner world of ideas in a flurry of monosyllables spat out with almost ironic emphasis : well !
marius , i ’ ve got an idea
after all , he was making this trip of his own free will
some said : they ’ re columns taking a break
whenever she had been chasing butterflies , she would run up to him out of breath and say : ah !
he suddenly turned to the old man , folded his arms , and fixing his host with a savage glare , cried out in a hoarse voice : hah !
'the n uremburg code estab- lished the conditions under which tests on human beings could be conducted ; it is a fundamental text for modern medical ethics ' , as axel kahn rightly reminds us
if only forty sous
perhaps he failed to consider what that dark side might hide from him
thénardier shoved his shoulder again
she spoke in picardy dialect , to the great delight of the boarders
in short , one day monsieur mabeuf left the rue mézières , abdicated his duties as churchwarden , gave up saint-sulpice , sold not his books but part of his prints—what he prized least—and set himself up in a little house in the boulevard montparnasse , where he only stayed three months , in any case , for two reasons : first , the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs and he did not dare put more than two hundred francs aside for his rent ; second , being next to the fatou shooting range , he had to listen to pistol shots all day long , which he found unbearable
there were in fact two men there leaning against the wall , squatting in the snow and talking in whispers to each other
one of louis-philippe ’ s daughters , marie d ’ orléans , number placed the name of her race among the artists as charles d ’ orléans had placed it among the poets
that whole tempest , that whole cloud , the war and after it the peace , the whole shadow-play , did not darken for a moment the gleam of the immense eye before which an aphid hopping from one blade of grass to another is equal to the eagle flying from spire to spire among the towers of notre-dame
the garden was enclosed by a fairly low white wall , easily scaled
at the same time as the two guns were relentlessly battering the redoubt in the rue de la chanvrerie , two other pieces of ordnance , one positioned on the rue saint-denis , the other on the rue aubry-le-boucher , were peppering the barricade saint-merry
then the old man had gone bankrupt and he no longer had anything but a horse and a cart to his name ; being without family and without children , he had turned himself into a cart driver in order to survive
the two generals had carefully studied the plain of mont-saint-jean , known today as the plain of waterloo
not everybody has a house to come into the world in
crucible into which fate hurls a man , whenever it wants to make a mongrel or a demigod
he no longer laughed his childlike laugh , he had grown morose and no longer received visitors
the driver wrapped himself up in his coat
you had to go quite a way to get it
number petite rue picpus without carrying away a cheery idea of it
what ’ s more , the riot was conducted according to the soundest military tactics
she sang it in a voice so sad and so sweet that it would make even a nun weep
pull yourself together , he said
no army or nation was responsible for these creatures ; they spoke italian and followed the germans ; they spoke french and followed the english
they polish and varnish the surface ; they are all turned out immaculately , washed , soaped , raked , shaved , combed , waxed , smoothed down , rubbed , brushed , cleaned outwardly , irreproachable , polished like a pebble , discreet , neat and tidy , and at the same time , by my true love ’ s virtue !
he was covered in blood
he started to understand , and as always happens in such cases , his understanding went further
he left the town behind , hoping to find a tree or a haystack somewhere in a field where he could take shelter
get going pronto and come back ditto
the man grumbled without ceasing to write : mongrels !
he is not , by nature , especially academic
a traveller had already come and reserved a seat on topnumber i saw his name on the sheet
you , warm cold feet in the name of principles !
heads down , get back to the wall !
cinema , says manoel de oliveira , as reprised by jean-luc godard , is an overload of magnificent signs bathing in the light of the lack of any explanation for them ’
he thought of cosette
on top of this , he was an impressive poacher and renowned as an excellent shot
he interrupted marius in a gruff tone : so why are you here ?
a name had fallen upon her the same way water from the clouds fell on her head when it rained
in the imminent peril jean valjean found himself in , this grim building had something lonely and uninhabited about it that tempted him
they hire a cheesemaker that they call a grurin
those men did not amaze one another
cosette had come out from under the table
a furniture dealer in the rue moreau asked : so , then , when do you attack ?
so he wore a disguise ?
the silence that the prisoner had maintained , the wariness he had shown that went as far as completely disregarding his own safety , the way he had resisted the natural impulse of anyone whose life is in danger , which is to cry for help—all this , we have to say , since it had now been called to his attention , posed a real problem for marius and came as a painful shock
they go to bed early in the marais , especially on days when there ’ s a riot on
i tell you , the senator began again , that the marquis d ’ argen , pyrrhon , hobbes , and monsieur naigeonnumber are no slouches
but behind babeuf , the people could smell gisquetnumber
old man gillenormand had now long since turned ninety-one
a rope was what was needed
coming out of the station , he found the same mud that the young konstantin paustovsky met with , in february , when sent on an assignment by his newspaper
she thrashed about completely oblivious to her nakedness
the girl looked at him in amazement and received the shawl in silence
tholomyès brought up the rear , dominating the group from behind
to be lying down side by side in the same grave , hand in hand , and from time to time gently to stroke each other ’ s fingertip in the dark , that will do for my eternity
what emerges from the graveyard intimidates and disconcerts what emerges from the lair ; the ferocious is frightened of the sinister ; wolves back away when they come upon a ghoul
you go , too , if we ’ re going !
that was his nature
give yourself a round of applause !
nothing comes more naturally to staggering drunks than elliptical expressions
and in the back of his mind , he would add , i owe him a visit
it was too much for the bauduin brigade to force hougoumont to the north , and the soye brigade could only make a hole in it to the south without taking it
gavroche shrugged his shoulders and answered : a kid like yours truly is a proper jock , and jocks like you lot are kids
he made himself a target
those are dolorous days ; for there is always a certain amount of justice even in such madness , there is suicide in such a duel ; and these words that are intended as insults , scum , rabble , mob rule , plebs , alas !
you are a baron now ?
a big fair-headed fellow on the boulevard says to me : do you know mother hucheloup ?
we will restrict ourselves to noting an incident that , although unnoticed by the wedding party , marked the trip from the rue des filles-du-calvaire to the church of saint-paulnumber
his instinct served him well
suddenly he raised his voice
he told fantine in his gentlest and calmest voice : stay calm
for pity ’ s sake , the man cried , a glass of water
hence a conversation between a barber and a soldier which prudhomme , number had he been there , would have embellished with a flourish or two and called dialogue of the razor and the sabre
the rubble fell on brujon ’ s bed without a sound
he placed the pile of five-franc coins on the old servant ’ s night table and went back to his room without saying a word
the emblazoned carriages of the peers of france and the ambassadors stuck to the middle of the road where they could come and go untrammelled
i believe you , said marius
say you make twelve sous in shirts ; if that drops to nine sous , you can ’ t live
he felt an impulse to use the gruff familiarity common enough with doctors and priests , which was not at all his usual bedside manner
in the twinkling of an eye we have , on the one hand , the birth of the portrait in all its humility , its discretion
who were her parents ?
how could anyone expect those nails to do any work ?
she broke off and , leaping over the sombre hurdles that were no doubt in her mind , she went on with a heartbreaking smile : you found me ugly , didn ’ t you ?
that ’ s the fault of voltaire ,
from time to time she bent over and took a peek at it , then she looked at the man
we say nothing of the mighty exile of patmosnumber who , too , shatters the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal world , turns vision into an enormous satire , and casts over rome-nineveh , over rome-babylon , over rome-sodom , the flaming reflection of the apocalypse
he was what was called in the ancien régime two-handed , signalling equal dexterity in handling a sabre or a musket as a soldier and a squadron or a battalion as an officer
in the crowd surrounding and cheering lafayette , people noticed a german named ludwig snyder and pointed him out to each other
at all points the struggle was escalating on a gigantic scale and the outcome of all the disarming , the house-to-house visits , the brisk invasion of armourers ’ , was that combat that had kicked off with stone-throwing moved on to an exchange of gunfire
in that second , a fifth uniform fell , as though from the sky , on top of the four others
what is the sun ?
and jean valjean did well to keep quiet and not to move
this went on for some little time
he did not much believe in god
javert ’ s face tensed the way it did whenever anyone believed him capable of some concession
at a certain look from the man , the mother shut up
the omnibus shaft , though truncated by the fusillade , was still standing upright enough to have a flag hung from it
there is such a thing as fine peasant talk and the following is an example : father so-and-so , your wife has died of her illness ; why didn ’ t you send for a doctor ?
the same formidable lightning flashes from the torch of prometheus to cambronne ’ s stunted pipenumber
i ’ ve made my choice
hougoumont and la haie-sainte continued to burn , sending up two great flames , one in the west , one in the east , to which the ring of fires of the english bivouac , laid out in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon , had just linked up like a loosened ruby necklace with two red garnets at each end
answer me , you nincompoop !
at the start , as we saw , she paid the thénardiers punctually
what sections were there ?
ask them what they do with their money
they ’ re ugly in nanterre ,
this was more than a transformation , it was a transfiguration
he promptly relit his candle
but if you then spent a few hours with him , and saw him in a thoughtful mood , the good old stick was gradually transfigured and took on an ineffably imposing quality ; his broad and serious forehead , made noble by a full head of white hair , was also ennobled by meditation ; grandeur emanated from his goodness , but without that goodness ceasing to shine
then the little girl began to laugh and , though her mother held her back , slid to the ground with the indomitable energy of a small being who wants to run
bossuet , said marius , but i thought you said your name was laigle
dark and deserted space lay before her
these same young men also met up , as we said , in a cabaret-restaurant near the rue mondétour that was called corinthe
so it was you , you little rascal ?
the rag mounted guard over the treasure
if there is to be a trophy , it is to the english people that it should go
what came from monsieur fauchelevent ?
what is this empty coffin ?
it ’ s not a few days in the lockup anymore , it ’ s the galleys in perpetuity
no bat can brave the dawn
the row of shops exposed to the wind that started at the church extended , as you will recall , right to the thénardiers ’ tavern
the two boys cuddled up together
yes , monsieur , if they take your fancy , we could give you these stockings for five francs
i say you haven ’ t , missus , retorted the merchant
a noise could be heard in the house ; it was the lark sweeping the stairs
but he could not provide himself with an answer , except that he looked like someone who had left a dim trace in his mind
good day , mamselle back-of-a-bus , gavroche said to her
she watched him for a long time without daring to interrupt
the walls , which had been washed with a yellow ochre limewash , were peeling off in big chunks of plaster
he could not have said
when the workers come tomorrow to patch up the hole they ’ d have found the poor sucker left there , for sure , and bit by bit , one way or another , they ’ d have been able to sniff you out and track you down
another cannonade could be heard some distance away
it 's about an internal conflict as well , over the duty incumbent upon the poet not indecorously to step over the carpet of the scourge ’ of which he must understand the mystery and judge the duty ’
most of the wounded were able and willing to fight still
there , more than ever , he would see that star and , less than ever , savigny and gans
there they are , all the kings of europe , the happy generals , the thundering jupiters , there are one hundred thousand victorious soldiers and behind the hundred thousand , a million ; their cannons , wicks lit , are gaping ; they have the imperial guard and the grande armée under their heels ; they have just crushed napoléon and there is only cambronne left ; there is no one left to protest except this earthworm
you know how it is , you sometimes get these funny ideas
it was more random banter than conversation
and that was monsieur myriel ’ s budget
maybe god is dead , gérard de nervalnumber said one day to the writer of these lines , confusing god with progress and taking the interruption in movement for the death of the supreme being
even at the dark depth to which he had already descended , he could still feel ecstasy in gazing at cosette
the man had thrown himself into the blaze and , at the risk of his own life , had saved two children who turned out to belong to the captain of the gendarmerie—which meant that no one thought to ask him for his passport
that ’ s the fault of—number
this had given her , while she was still very young , and even a bit later on , a sort of wondering attitude toward her husband , who was a dyed-in-the-wool rotter with a certain depth , a thug who knew his grammar , almost , a man both gross and refined at once , but who , when it came to sentimentalism , read pigault-lebrunnumber and who , when it came to anything to do with sex , as he so quaintly put it , was a thorough and unmitigated lout
he marched up to the tollhouse and handed the man a sou
you may think you are indifferent to the death penalty , number can ’ t say whether you are in favour of it or not—as long as you haven ’ t clapped eyes on a guillotine
you had no father and no mother of your own , feuilly ; you adopted humanity as mother , and as father you adopted justice
for marius to reach this state of prosperity had taken years
they had thrown the doll on the ground and éponine , who was the elder , was wrapping the little cat up despite its meowings and contortions , in a whole pile of old red and blue rags
they fell into the frightening error of mistaking the soldier ’ s obedience for the nation ’ s consent
simplice of sicily , as we know , was the saint who preferred to have both breasts ripped off rather than say that she was born in segesta , when she was born in syracuse—a lie that would have saved her
the idea that there is someone there with something to tell me—i laugh just thinking about it
he opened his mouth , turned to the judge and said : first off …
she followed this up in an elegiac and lamenting tone : oh , monsieur !
monsieur le baron , i will tell you all , leaving the reward to your generosity
for if certain works speak , those that shout and scream - their pain or hate - would soon abolish all dialogue and rule out any form of questioning
monsieur , he said , where are we up to ?
the mattress was a straw mat , the cover was a fairly voluminous loose skirt of coarse grey wool that was very warm and almost new
thénardier rapidly unfolded the note and brought it over to the candle
the writing had left its imprint on the blotter
just then a light came on at the end of the street ; a pine branch , hanging from an iron stand , stood out against the white sky of twilight
the proprietor had a great nickname ; they called him rousseau , the aquatic
after that , what is left of adorno 's pompous pronouncement about the impossibility of writing a poem after auschwitz ?
we might even go so far as to say , a dark light
science , having groped about for a long time , now knows that the most fertilizing and the most effective of manures is human manure
she begged for the child to at least be allowed to put her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it
sludge ’ s load-bearing capacity varies with its density
except for the two or three streets we will be dealing with , it was all walls and vacant lots
a leg of exquisite shape was revealed
this ideal had been kept alive in sister simplice
he said he begged to be excused
he seemed to be thinking
yes , of course he did , his exhilaration
out of piety for his father , marius had almost come to feel aversion for his grandfather
it always achieves its aim , strangely
one is a spirit , one will be an angel , one will sprout blue wings from one ’ s back
and it will really take you a day to fix the wheel ?
the mother cried impetuously : you always have to go one better than everyone else , don ’ t you !
is it midday or midnight ?
you lie on a bed of purple , my dear senator
monsieur mabeuf opened his bookcase , but there was nothing left there
marius examined the man more and more intensely as he listened to him
marius steps into the shadows
executioner , le taule ; forest , le sabri ; fear , flight , taf ; lackey , le larbin ; general , prefect , minister , pharos ; the devil , le rabouin
she would give me a smile , she would have a word with me
monsieur mabeuf now had only his books , his garden , and his indigo ; these things were , for him , the three forms happiness , pleasure , and hope had taken
sometimes a stream abruptly causes a vault under construction to cave in and floods the workers ; or a marl slide occurs , moving with the fury of a waterfall and shattering the great wooden support beams like glass
i did rob monseigneur the bishop , it ’ s true ; i did rob petit-gervais , it ’ s true

it was in the garden of the convent of the rue du temple that a chestnut tree from india , said to be the most beautiful and the tallest in france , stood ; among the good folk of the eighteenth century it had the reputation of being the father of all the chestnut trees in the realm
it was this man who had just stumbled on cosette
night had well and truly fallen , but nothing happened
montfermeil is in the country
cosette ’ s pace slowed jean valjean down
the seventh art thus becomes a ventriloquist art delivering its own oracles
she bit her lip ; she seemed to hesitate as though in the grip of some sort of inner struggle
it is especially in the faubourgs , we must insist , that the parisian race appears
how do you expect them to live ?
all this explains why the first revolutions were content just to find a man , a cromwell or a napoléon ; and why the next revolutions insisted on finding a family , a house of brunswicknumber or a house of orléans
i made him pay two sous , said the toll-keeper
a few days later , it might have been about eight at night , he was in his room getting cosette to spell out loud , when he heard the street door open and then shut again
being evil is not enough for a person to prosper
my faith , it suits me down to the ground !
a terrible water flows there in which bloody hands have been washed
that must be the deal they were referring to
under the guise of 'new technologies ' , surely
sometimes it happened that some blundering officious person would speak to him of marius and ask him : what is monsieur , your grandson , doing now , what ’ s become of him ?
description of jean valjean
by a roundabout way , he came to a little street that he thought must be the rue de la poterie ; about halfway along , he ran into an obstacle

every man for himself
the little boys nudged each other ; the urchin frightened them and reassured them at the same time and then , it was raining hard
one day , following the example of the campaign to combat nicotine addiction , it may well be necessary to put up signs of the 'silence - hospital ' variety at the entrance to museums and exhibition halls to get all those 'communication machines ' to shut up and put an end to the all too numerous cultural exercises in sound and light
there , he stopped in his tracks , stunned
they assumed that indefinably dazed , mechanical quality peculiar to despair
monsieur gillenormand turned to all those in the room and shouted : talk among yourselves , the rest of you !
at issue was one of the questions of the moment , namely the artillery of the national guard and a conflict between the minister of warnumber and the citizen militia over some cannons parked in the courtyard of the louvre
this is the romantic principle of indeterminate significance or determined insignificance
he hoped , too , that from this violent encounter between jondrette and monsieur leblanc some light would be shed on all it was in his interests to find out
let a notary rise to become a deputy , let a sham corneille write tiridate , number let a eunuch come into possession of a harem , let some military prudhommenumber accidentally win the decisive battle of an era , let an apothecary invent cardboard soles for the sambre-et-meuse armynumber and let him , with this cardboard sold as leather , build himself four hundred thousand livres a year in income , let a hawker get into bed with usury and cause it to give birth to seven or eight million of which he is the father and she the mother , let a preacher become a bishop by talking through his hat , let an intendant of a great estate be so loaded on leaving the service that he is made minister of finance—people call that genius , just as they call mousqueton ’ s face beauty and claude ’ snumber bearing majesty
all this grass was sopping wet with blood
and what do nettles need ?
my name is jean valjean
you ’ ve killed the man ; fine
it ’ s impossible to imagine that god made us for anything else but this : to idolize , to bill and coo , to strut and plume , to be pigeons , to be cocks , to peck at our loves from morning to night , to gaze at our reflections in our little woman , to be proud , to be triumphant , to puff ourselves up ; that ’ s what life is all about
bahorel answered : what do you expect ?

number , climbed to the top of the stairs , guided by the instinct that always leads the poor man to the attic , and knocked in the gloom on the door of a garret
jean valjean , feeling that he ’ d been seen and that javert was on his trail , realized that cosette and he were finished if they went back to paris
come out of there !
that ’ s good , reverend mother
truly , my dear bishop , i tell you , i have my philosophy and i have my philosophers
a minute later , i feel around and there ’ s nothing there

she moved like a bird darting its head out of its nest , looked first at her husband , then at jean valjean , and cried to them with a laugh , so that you felt as if you saw a smile deep inside a rose : i bet you ’ re talking politics !

the bishop listened to all this in silence
the biggest of them all , a kind of colossus , marched on gavroche with his bayonet thrust forward
two facts , two pieces of proof , said thénardier
the embarkation for cythera !
now , is it possible to be in constant contact , day and night , with every kind of distress , every kind of calamity , every kind of destitution , without some of this saintly misery rubbing off on oneself , like dirt from hard work ?
you didn ’ t have to tell me who you were
my child , said the man , take this and go and get dressed quickly
accused of congenital weakness , the silence of forms and figures suddenly turns into mutism : the mutism of abstraction or that of an indeter- minate figurative art whose victims were to be giacometti , bacon and co 'the less you think , the more you talk ' , mon- tesquieu pointed out
i did knock , madame
nuns are buried in white
well , then , shut up , capital r !
the man trying to escape was a scrawny skinny-necked weed , the man going after him was a tall strapping man who looked hard as nails , and would no doubt be hard as nails if you went up against him

churning things over all the while , he whipped the horse , which was trotting along at a strong and steady pace that enabled them to make two and a half leagues an hour
the second rope whipped the dormer window
only his face could be made out , calm and grave , but strangely sad
i was in my mother ’ s arms

and then , how the hell does he do the rounds by post chaise in such mountainous terrain ?
the stable boy and the wheelwright answered at the same time , shaking their heads
from that moment on , mother plutarch watched a sombre veil come down over the old man ’ s candid face , and it never lifted again
since you were wounded , she has passed her time weeping and making lint

there was some mysterious rehabilitation already at work there , and to all appearances , for a long time already , scruples had had this man under strict control
i want to know
there are moments when your brain is like a furnace burning in your skull
it migh t be appropriate at this juncture to remember joseph beuys whose work , silence , parallels , not to say echoes , edvard munch 's painting , the scream

vvithout harking back to jacques callot or even francisco de goya and 'the miseries of war ' of the napoleonic era , we might remember what picasso said when a german interrogated him in about his masterwork , guernica : ( that 's your doing , not mine !

the hateful maxim live off your enemy produced that leper that only strong discipline could cure

javert did not recognize jean valjean , who , as we say , did not look himself at the moment
my husband beats me

he had known neither one nor the other and he had deliberately kept himself in the dark
summer , i salute you

on either side a double row of guards marched , looking pretty scruffy under tricorn hats like those worn by the soldiers of the directoire , stained , riddled with holes , dirty , decked out in the uniforms of the war disabled and the breeches of undertakers ’ assistants , half grey , half blue , practically in tatters , with red epaulets , yellow cross-belts , sheath knives , muskets , and clubs ; a ragtag lot of soldier-thugs

this has two results : the soil is impoverished and the water is contaminated
how can he not hit the roof ?
when you go up the rue saint-jacques , and cross over the barrière side and follow the old inner boulevard on the left for a while , you come to the rue de la santé , followed by la glacière and , shortly before you get to the little gobelins stream , you find a sort of field that is , in the whole , long , monotonous belt of the boulevards around paris , the only spot where ruisdaelnumber would be tempted to sit down
monseigneur , the man ’ s gone !
he had turned up for bed and board at jacquin labarre ’ s but labarre had refused to take him in

including the upper galleries , which it loathes
in this case , you die before the month is out
just as he was going upstairs , he saw on the other side of the boulevard , walking along by the deserted wall of the rue de la barrière-des-gobelins , jondrette wrapped up in the coat of the philanthropist , talking to one of those disturbing-looking men who are appropriately known as prowlers of the barrières ; rough men with ambiguous faces , given to dubious monologues and evil schemes , who routinely sleep during the day , from which you have to assume they work at night
whether you ’ re sardanapalus or vincent de paul , number it comes to the same old nientenumber that ’ s the real situation , if you want to know
such two-faced rogues exist
that about sums up the glory of greece
why hadn ’ t he even mentioned the thénardiers to her and , especially , the day he had run into éponine ?
it cut short that more often
he said to the postilion : keep up the pace and you get double the tip
so , as you can see , it was not for no reason that the passport described jean valjean as a very dangerous man
you ’ re taking your life in your hands
a lot of good it ’ s done being two old men if all we are is two old lunatics
and so the emblematic figure emerges not so much of marcel duchamp as charlie chaplin or bannard , pitiful painter par excellence , as was claude monet , that miracle-worker of a rising sun , which is not quite the same as the one rising over the laboratories of los alamos
the mirror reflected the writing
jean valjean planted a kiss on this forehead with its heavenly reflection
he kissed the hankie , inhaled its perfume , placed it over his heart , on his bare skin , during the day and slept with it under his lips at night
at that instant , the horse of a national guard lancer riding past came crashing down , gavroche laid his pistol on the ground and pulled the man up , then he helped pull up the horse
drag your yoke , there you go , you ’ re a beast of burden in the harness from hell !
were all of them actually dead ?
at times , he thought so , and he shuddered
how can i do that ?
and the world will let you fall and die because the world lets everything fall and die that is nothing but self-interest , everything that does not represent for mankind some virtue or idea
it was punchinello who hit the cat
two napoléons , that could come in handy
this respite was dragging on , a sign that the government was taking its time and gathering its forces
having an immense reserve of fury to vent and not knowing what to do with it , he continued to address his daughter coldly as vous for over three months
you can hardly see
mother thénardier went every so often to the other end of the room , where her man was , to soothe her soul , as she put it
he resumed : he lives in the marais , rue des filles-du-calvaire , with his grandfather—i forget the name
when thénardier had got his breath back , he trained his bloodshot eyes on monsieur leblanc and said to him in a tight , low voice : what have you got to say before we get to work on you ?
yet he had to look inside his conscience after such a series of shake-ups and give an account of himself
they ’ re in the way
she saw clearly and was never wrong about anything
a streak of daylight comes in around noon
nil sub sole novum , number as solomon says—nothing new under the sun ; amor omnibus idem , number says virgil—love is the same for all of us
as for himself , he thought the barricade was ripe for the taking , and since what is ripe must fall , he decided to have a go
alarming details made the rounds , ominous news was spread like wildfire
jean valjean leaned his elbow on the bedpost at the head of the bed , his forehead in his hand , and began to contemplate fantine , motionless and distended
he who knows the answer to that , sees the darkness as a whole
not bad just now
reverend mother , the lever ’ ll need to be at least six feet long
after that , nothing left for the poor
he felt as though he had just woken up from some strange sleep , to find himself sliding down a slope in the middle of the night , on his feet , shivering , scrabbling backward in vain , on the extreme brink of an abyss
it did not even occur to him to speak to her about the episode that night in the old gorbeau building , the thénardiers , the burn , or her father ’ s strange attitude and incredible escape
the cesspit had its christopher columbus
to everything that they suggested to him , gently but persistently , he would reply : what ’ s the use ?
the boy stood with his back to the sun , which shot through his hair , turning it to threads of spun gold and flushing the savage face of jean valjean with a blood-red glow
i ’ ll get down here , said the man
six months making seven sous a day !
he was a foster father to the poor
he had a small but well-stocked library
no way you can go any further
if he fired a shot , monsieur leblanc would be saved and thénardier sunk ; if he didn ’ t shoot , monsieur leblanc would be sacrificed and , who knows ?
he cast a glance at the bill and could not repress a start of surprise
while dreaming and while chattering away , while putting together little trousseaux and little layettes , while sewing little frocks , little bodices , and little tops , the little girl becomes a young girl , the young girl becomes a big girl , the big girl becomes a woman
in , larry rivers , the son of jewish immigrants and the same man who had demystified washington 's iconography , painted two quietly symbolic portraits of primo levi , the witness to the camps
when a sewer slumped under pressure from houses , the chaos occasionally translated at street level as a sort of sawtoothed split between paving stones ; this rent would snake all the way along the cracked vault and then , since the problem was visible , it could be promptly fixed
it 's a nice turn of phrase , but it needs to be completed
meanwhile , no halt , no hesitation , no pause in the grand forward march of minds
the officer théodule gillenormand , now captain , had come up from chartres , where he was in charge of the garrison , to attend the wedding of his cousin pontmercy
the old concierge who had served him was one of them
i civilized you , says the convent
i do have to laugh
by virtue of what right ?
the field of the lark
there are people who have nothing !
an hour later , when she was back in her room , she cried
knowing the peaceful and more than shy habits of the old churchwarden bookworm , and amazed to see him in the midst of all the mayhem , two feet from the cavalry charges , almost in the middle of a fusillade , bareheaded in the pouring rain and strolling among the bullets , he went over to him , and the twenty-five-year-old rioter and the octogenarian had exchanged this dialogue :
whatever you say , treasure
in his adolescence he had sported a jacket made of light wool fabric known as nain londrin , which he never tired of talking about , effusively
you ’ ve got your poor old mother
a worker was tying a broad-brimmed straw hat of mother hucheloup ’ s on his head with some string , for fear of sunstroke , he said
it was that dark moment when two clouds merge
just remember , you ’ ve got two hundred thousand francs on you
a wedding should be royal and fabulous ; it should take its ceremony for a stroll from the cathedral of rheims to the pagoda of chanteloupnumber i can ’ t stand a halfhearted wedding
after the work ’ s done , not a moment before
after studying the man for a moment , the way you would study a viper , the man of the house came back to the door and said : on your way
in short , reestablish social truth , give liberty back its throne , give the people back to the people , give man back his sovereignty , remove the purple from the head of france , restore reason and equity in all their fullness , suppress all forms of antagonism by restoring each person to themself , do away with the obstacle that royalty constitutes to vast universal harmony , put the human race on equal footing with the law—what cause could be more just and , consequently , what war greater ?
jean valjean , at that very moment , was in the grip of a frightening upheaval
social philosophy is essentially the science of peace
any other child would have started screaming ages before this
where are you off to , you fellows ?
he had erudition and wit , but he always misfired
he was wearing a crimson waistcoat and he was swearing like a trooper
the grandfather caused jean valjean to evaporate
he went to find gavroche , who had settled in to making cartridges in the downstairs room by the dubious light of two candles , placed on the bar out of harm ’ s way as a precaution due to the powder spread over the tables
every time the clock struck , fantine pushed herself up and looked toward the door , then fell back again
just tie the rope to the wall
her stock of wedding presents appeared to her held aloft by seraphim
even though the season was fairly advanced , there were still a few late-blooming flowers here and there in the hedges , and as he walked along , clouds of perfume brought back childhood memories
the dining room doubled as an antechamber and divided the two bedrooms
would you like me to carry your box ?
we wouldn ’ t even have muzzled you
he did not know what had become of cosette ; the whole business of the rue de la chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory ; almost indistinct shadows flitted through his mind , éponine , gavroche , mabeuf , the thénardiers , all his friends grimly mixed up with the smoke of the barricade ; the strange cameo rôle of monsieur fauchelevent in that gory episode struck him as a riddle in a tempest ; he did not understand a thing about his own life , he did not know how or through whom he had been saved and no one around him knew , either ; all they had been able to tell him was that he had been brought back to the rue des filles-du-calvaire at night in a fiacre ; past , present , future , everything inside him was now no more than the fog of a vague idea , but in this mist there was one fixed point , a clear and precise outline , something carved in stone , a resolution , a desire : to find cosette again
the burial of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar , the removal of cosette , the smuggling of jean valjean into the room of the dead—all had gone smoothly and without a snag
the old woman was in the room doing the cleaning
he was surrounded on all sides by empty space
what it is to have met a churchwarden
civilized peoples , especially in our day , are not raised up or brought down by the good or bad luck of a captain
at that instant something occurred to him for the first time and he found it odd that he hadn ’ t thought of it before : that it was perhaps pointless , all this trouble he was going to ; that he didn ’ t even know what time the trial was on ; that he might , at least , have found out about that ; that it was mad to go on like this without knowing if it would serve any purpose
who has not felt all these things ?
yet , whatever the contrast , all these workers , from the uppermost to the most nocturnal , from the wisest to the most unhinged , have one thing in common and it is this : disinterestedness
well , what of it ?
mix two unhappy people together and you get happiness
marius left the house
he didn ’ t have an inkling of their address
he had been walking for about half an hour , at least according to his inner reckoning , and had not yet thought about resting
it was obvious that thénardier was avoiding naming the young girl in question
the left downstroke of the letter a is the road from nivelles , the right downstroke is the road from genappe , and the horizontal stroke is the sunken road from ohain to braine-l ’ alleud
he has horrible teeth because he is malnourished and his stomach suffers , but he has beautiful eyes because he has wit
after dinner , he would chat for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire before returning to his room and writing a bit more , sometimes on loose sheets of paper , sometimes in the margins of one of his folios
it was sister simplice
these gifts of a world to civilization are such increments of light that any resistance to them is criminal
this vessel , disabled as it was , for the sea had treated it badly , made quite an impression when it limped into harbour
her whole body trembled as if from some indescribable deployment of wings ready to fan out and carry her away , which you could feel quivering , but which you could not see
the redoubt in the rue de la chanvrerie , we repeat , seemed incredibly calm inside
and so he possessed her every dream , too
cosette ran off with her bucket as fast as her legs would carry her
and this , due to javert !
just then , an unbelievable and marvellous stroke of luck , marius saw a cab for hire going past on the boulevard , empty
there was a sort of cloudy swirling in his brain
we still have the indigo !
each of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible according to his nature
it created a real scandal
neither this note nor the medallion could ever be found
the stars are like little paper lanterns all lit up , you ’ d say they were smoking and that the wind then snuffs them out , it gives me the shivers , as if i had horses breathing in my ear all of a sudden
let ’ s see , if i don ’ t give myself up ?
you feel that it will never end
cosette and marius shuddered
too much zeal kills the grace and joy of a fine meal
indeed , a new character had just entered the stage
as for myself , forced to do what i did , but abhorring it , i have judged myself as well and you will soon see what i have sentenced myself to
he went over to the bed where she was sleeping and he trembled with joy ; he felt the pangs of a mother and he did not know what they were ; for it is so extremely obscure and so extremely sweet , this grand and strange lurch of the heart when it begins to love
they let me go !
it had gone white in the hour he had been there
between the two of them , they ’ ll put fear into the place
the racket brought all the officers running out of the café ; passersby gathered , and a great circle , laughing , jeering , and clapping , formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings hard to recognize as a man and a woman , the man thrashing around , his hat on the ground , the woman kicking and punching and screaming , bareheaded , toothless and hairless and livid with rage , truly horrible
a bit below the point where the horizontal stroke of the a meets and divides the right downstroke is la haie-sainte
the care he had himself taken to get her to let go of him was doing its work on her
but what wo not he forget ?
naturally , each one had his mistress
this one played the good apostle when he first turned up
in her youth , smack bang in the middle of ’ number , she had married a monk who ’ d escaped from the cloister in a red cap and switched from the bernardins to the jacobinsnumber dried-up , bitter , cantankerous , shrill , prickly , virtually poisonous , she lived off memories of her monk , who was now dead , and who had ruled her with an iron fist and broken her
the name mondétour wonderfully conjures up the way the whole of this road network snaked around
the first deep rumble of war stirred in her
the quai was deserted
since they ’ ve got their money
this substitution of a half-throne for a full throne was the work of number
what were these words ?
you remember her fluffy blue hat
he took advantage of their indecision ; time lost for them , time gained for him
thoughtful people rarely use the terms , the happy and the unhappy
he was bareheaded , sitting on his doorstep
gavroche had taken a bottle carrier from the tavern , had gone out through the exit , and was busy quietly emptying into his carrier the full cartridge pouches of the national guards who had been killed on the talus of the redoubt
he was full of sly caution and clumsy recklessness
what was bizarre was the way their roles seemed to be reversed now
much later , at the end of the century , action and reaction sini- larly would be put into instant interaction thanks to the feats of 'tele-action ' , this time , and not just radiophonic 'tele-listening ' or 'tele-vision '
he was in that place , the last phase of desolation , where sorrow no longer flows down like a fountain ; it has , so to speak , coagulated ; the soul is blocked by a sort of clot of despair
jean valjean , who had reloaded his gun , aimed at the newcomer and sent the officer ’ s helmet flying off to join the soldier ’ s
i go along with the pastoral and with the fairyland enchantment of marble and gold , too
provided , of course , that we separate the power of fiction from the mere construction of the anecdote portraying individual loves and sorrows against a backdrop of collective grand passions and grand catastrophes
the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other , even though the street was very short
jean valjean , on the other hand , was in the shadow , his iron spike in hand , standing erect , rigid , terrified at this luminous old man
everyone there was buzzing with it , to borrow the very expression of one of those taking part
of the young lady !
she was called whatever the first person who had happened along felt like calling her when they ran across her as a tiny toddler padding around the streets barefoot
within humanity , he chose france ; within the nation , he chose the people ; within the people , he chose women
go and get yourself hanged somewhere else !
once , in the moonlight , cosette had bent down to pick something up off the ground , and her bodice gaped open to reveal a glimpse of her cleavage ; marius averted his eyes
give him a chunk of wall , and with the tension of his back and his knees , with his elbows and heels jammed into the rough edges of the stone , he would hoist himself up three stories , as though by magic
now , no death , that of the body as late as possible , that of the soul never—that is what we would like
suddenly he had a jolt
actually he no longer had views as such , he had sympathies
in other words , they were subjects not of saint bernard but of saint benedict
the old man bored the lancer and the lancer disgusted the old man
a fat marmot , flanked by white partridges and grouse , was turning on a long spit in front of the fire ; on the stoves were two huge carp from the lac de lauzet and a trout from the lac d ’ alloz
if he were the only one who had been in the wrong in his fateful story ?
the bishop had had all the locks and bolts removed and now , night and day , this door was closed only by a latch
it ’ s today that paris is pantinnumber
he was a tall man , half peasant , half artisan
basque said again , giving himself his second ah !
was this because of cosette ?
you might go so far as to say that catastrophe came to napoléon from that shake of a peasant ’ s head
they eat it , that ’ s what they do with it !
the other armchair remained empty
cochepaille rolled up his sleeve , as all eyes around him were riveted to his bare arm
the girl was back in a flash
a rout is the worst kind of mêlée ; friends kill each other in their bid to get away , squadrons and battalions smash and send each other flying , sending up a sea foam of battle
she was modesty taken to a bleak extreme
the new tenant had ordered a few repairs , added what was missing here and there , replaced some cobblestones in the courtyard , some bricks on the floor , some steps on the stairs , some strips of wood in the parquet floor and panes of glass in the casement windows , and had finally moved in with a young girl and an old servant , noiselessly , more like someone stealing in than a man entering his own home
the prioress is expecting you
the few bourgeois who still ventured into the rue saint-denis at that point in the riot shot a glance down the rue de la chanvrerie , saw the barricade , and stepped lively on their way
today , they ’ re so serious
the smaller boy huddled close to his brother and said in a little voice : it ’ s dark
but you have to tell me !
you ’ ll go in at twenty and you ’ ll come out at fifty !
i ’ ll be happy with a thousand écus
monsieur le maire , do you think she ’ s pretty ?
the croaking would be more or less the same
they were coming to the village
a certain alertness was beginning to rouse the squad , and heads were lifting from off camp beds
then he crossed the room with steady tread and went and planted himself beside enjolras in front of the raised guns
like those membranes that flare up in certain inflammations and spread through the human body , the network of secret societies began to spread throughout the country
to have a decent room !
\t\tith architecture , alas , the jig is already up
that ’ s the duty i carried out in relation to cosette
he looked utterly distraught
a cold wind blew off the plain
there is the shameful holocaust denial that says that it simply did not take place
the fact is that the contents of the epistle had glanced off marius
the laws of septembernumber are as clear as day
the burgher of six was holding a big brioche
we have confidence in you
he had given up that refuge
master bourgaillard , the wheelwright , was standing on his doorstep
at that moment the crowd broke into applause ; hardened galley-wardens wept , women hugged each other along the quai , and everyone could be heard shouting in a sort of softened fury : give this man a pardon !
being sucked down is the sepulchre turned into the watery grave of a tide rising up from the ends of the earth to attack the living
i dressed like a turk of the levantine levant , he would say
trembling with joy , he showed the letter to old mother plutarch
geniuses blaze away there , red tails prosper
someone was indeed behind him , just as there had been a moment ago
he put out beaters , as hunters say , and sent one of his men to run round by a detour to guard this exit
me , i ’ ll keep an eye on her for you to make sure she doesn ’ t run away
a squadron of magnificent gardes du corps , bugler at the head , was passing down the avenue de neuilly ; the white flag , faintly pink in the setting sun , floated over the dome of the tuileriesnumber the place de la concorde , by that time once more the place louis xv , number was crawling with happy strollers
which they then injected into the developing wings of a chicken embryo to test the function of the gene
they stopped in the middle of the square and formed a huddle as though conferring together
four new travellers had turned up
some time passed in this way
a wigmaker ’ s just indignation
the man went on : isn ’ t there some kind of servant at madame thénardier ’ s ?
from the depths of this bier he had been able to follow and was following all the phases of the formidable drama that he was playing with death
the nook was quite simply the space beneath the stairs
on june number , number , at around eleven o ’ clock in the morning , solitary and empty of people , the luxembourg was lovely
javert owed the position he occupied to the protection of monsieur chabouillet , the secretary of the minister of state , comte anglès , then prefect of police in paris
they would swap caesar for prusias , and napoléon for the king of yvetotnumber—what a good little king he was !
the emperor gave him the cross
this was accompanied by all kinds of sharp little cries
were stewed like two grubs ;
i tread very softly so you won ’ t hear me , for you would perhaps be frightened
the corpses removed from the barricade made a terrible mound a few feet away
i ’ ll find out which parish this particular parishioner hails from
this is the sticks , here
louis xiv , to go no further back in time , wanted to build a naval fleetnumber for very good reason—nothing wrong with the idea
scarcely had he said those words full of peace than suddenly and without any transition , he made a strange movement that would have chilled the two saintly women to the bone with horror if they had witnessed it
meanwhile madame magloire had served supper
it ends in one of two holes , suicide or crime
what ’ s the meaning of this ?
and so he held tenure in good faith
after locating a gene that seemed to play a decisive role in the formation of a chicken 's hindlimbs , logan and tabin took the radical step of introducing the gene into the genome of a virus
we forgot to say that on the boulevard du temple , the boy was known as petit-gavroche
they see something other than themselves
you only have to hear them utter a word or see them make a move and you get a glimpse of the dark secrets in their past and the dark mysteries in their future
the impression that he had earlier had falling from the street into the convent came back to him
nonetheless , apart from the man ’ s identity , which he could not quite put his finger on , boulatruelle made some connections and calculations
god is a monstrous bit of balderdash
we are absolutely determined to be deliriously happy
i need to talk to you
the bride and groom disappeared
this strange battle was like a duel between two determined wounded men who , both fighting and fending off all the while , lose all their blood
he had a square face , with a thin mouth and strong , wild , bushy greying sideburns and a gaze that could turn your pockets inside out
she is , no doubt , with that poor woman
he watched the girl with a feeling of well-being
cried a voice from the door
it ’ s breaking my ribs !
tell me what it is
gavroche looked with satisfaction at the cover
and how much might this pair of stockings be worth , when they ’ re done ?
javert had never seen the unknown except down below
the doctors of the middle ages who , to say carrot , radish , and turnip , said : opoponach , perfroschinum , reptitalmus , dracatholicum angelorum , post-megorem , were talking slang
a stone , what for ?
he had to get through it
or else he examined the ceiling
marriage is like a grafted plant ; it either takes well or not at all ; shun the risk
he had made a second mistake , not staying in the luxembourg when monsieur leblanc came there on his own
but having said that , it is of course essential that the little people , the barefoot tramps , the small-timers , all those poor bastards , be given a few fables to swallow , chimeras , the soul , immortality , heaven , the stars
sometimes the people twist fidelity to themselves
towed along , it towed in turn
her great big eyes , set deep in a sort of shadow , were almost lifeless because of all the crying they had done
crossed arms are at work , joined hands are doing something
a tiny kitten was playing under the chairs
yes , answered the doctor
but , we have to say , this is just a start
he stopped , and said to her gently : all right , i won ’ t come any closer , but there ’ s no need to shout
i ’ m well aware there ’ s a chapel set apart in church and there ’ s a lot of hot air about the sorority of the virgin ; number but , heavens above , a pretty husband , a brave boy , and , after a year , a big blond nipper that sucks heartily on your nipples , one with nice rolls of fat on his thighs , that gropes and grabs fistfuls of your breast with his little pink paws , laughing like the dawn—surely that ’ s better than holding a candle at vespers and singing turris eburnea ! number
there he was on the street with his wife and kids without a scrap of bread
philosophy after a drink or two
we could almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet
you could sense the statue beneath the ribbons and glad rags , and in this statue , a soul
they said to him
the bernardine-benedictines of this order abstain from meat all year round , fast during lent and on plenty of other days that have special meaning for them , get up out of their first sleep to say the breviary and chant matins from one o ’ clock till three o ’ clock in the morning , sleep in serge sheets and on beds of straw whatever the season , do not have baths , never light fires , scourge themselves every friday , observe the rule of silence , only talking to each other during recreation periods , which are extremely short , and wear hair shirts for six months of the year , from september number , which is the exaltation of the holy cross , to easter
fauchelevent answered : everyone in the family is
but in this light , jondrette looked more like a demon than a blacksmith
we do not think so
on top of that , laigle de meaux , that baldy , hurts my eyes
he took a scourge and scoured the temple
a severe façade dominated this doorway ; a wall perpendicular to the façade came right up to the door , almost touching it , and flanked it with an abrupt right angle
you ’ ll say to me : what !
those who have never been through the whirlwind of this kind of war can ’ t begin to imagine the strange moments of tranquillity that are part and parcel of the convulsions
what are called honours and dignities , and even real honour and dignity , are generally fake gold
she had the courage she needed , and bore up bravely
tall municipal guards were coming in , some by leaping over the omnibus , the others via the opening , driving before them the gamin who fell back but did not run away
i don ’ t want to play any dirty tricks on you
the nuns were in raptures having her there
you are part of us
he could now see without being seen
before we go any further , and in the interests of being fully understood , we must insist on an essential observation
i won ’ t mention the holes you ’ ll have to cover up , the stones you ’ ll have to take out and put back twenty times a day , the rubble you ’ ll have to hide in your straw pallet
there are places that have a calming effect that works more or less mechanically on the mind
since the fever and delirium had left him , he no longer uttered that name , and a person could be forgiven for thinking that he no longer thought about her
comte beugnotnumber was received there as a matter of good manners
a man went into a cabaret , had a drink , and went out again , saying : wine seller , what is owing will be paid by the revolution
this illusion , which he would shake his head at a moment later , still managed to cast a ray of light into his soul that sometimes resembled hope
at certain moments , you lose your footing ; at other times , the ground gives way
who was this old man ?
he heard the high , hard voice of jondrette utter these words full of strangely intense interest for him : i tell you i ’ m sure of it
perhaps monsieur fauchelevent was a republican
when you support your nearest and dearest through your labour , you no longer have the right to sacrifice yourself
at the hour that jangles , the innkeeper isn ’ t worth a bent sou !
a harmless old fellow !
he murmured : the proof that god is good , is that she is here
no one would have me
europe has samples from asia and africa , but in a smaller format
meanwhile , the third man piped up : what ’ s the hurry ?
we ’ re not letting go of that kid
hence the heads bowed in horror ; hence all those great souls yielding up their swords
thénardier recognized him and that was all he needed : he understood
how does he look ?
before the presiding judge and the counsel for the prosecution could say a word , before the gendarmes and the ushers could make a move , the man everyone still called monsieur madeleine at the time had advanced toward the witnesses cochepaille , brevet , and chenildieu
as soon as he recognized jean valjean , the fearsome convict , beyond a doubt , he remembered that there were only three of them and he asked for reinforcements from the prefect of police in the rue de pontoise
no other man , apart from the police doctor , can go into the room of the dead
get ready to work
down with the tyrant !
you don ’ t remember anymore
are you what is known as a lucky man ?
jean valjean felt himself caught in a net that was slowly tightening
in the small world of digne , g—— the conventionist was spoken of in the hushed tones of horror
there are no secrets in my woods without me sticking my nose in
my father was a porter at the prytanéenumber he intended me for literature
talk about sumptuousness and splendour !
there was too much ignorance in jean valjean for him not to remain fairly unclear , even after so much misery
i tore up the altar cloth , it ’ s true , but only to bandage the wounds of my homeland
on top of this , as it always seeks to conceal itself , as soon as it feels understood it transforms itself
at the bottom of this chasm they could see a sentry ’ s fusil gleaming in the darkness
in that heart where there once was a wound , was now a scar
he was careful to stick to the dark side of the street at all times
the scaffold is not a framework , the scaffold is not a machine , the scaffold is not some inert mechanism made of wood , iron , and rope
let ’ s stop there for a moment
you ’ re strong and fit
for marius , monsieur fauchelevent was the condition on which he saw cosette
it was all organized like a conspiracy ; they stepped out before first light , and this made it all the merrier for cosette
jean valjean went over to him and placed his usual alms in his hand
there were no stars in the sky
indeed , coughing fits were interrupting fantine at very nearly every word
bonsoir , monsieur marius , she said suddenly , brusquely , then turned and left
up to that point , it wasn ’ t much more than petty larceny—a matter for the magistrate
fantine , as we will see , was fiercely courageous in the face of life
between one popular movement and another popular movement , we make a distinction
to be useless , that is , noxious !
you can see reddish gleams in the corners
in three of them , madame magloire grew vegetables ; in the fourth , the bishop had planted flowers
this one had not only grown , she had been perfected
above its shadow sat the open sky
marius haggard , javert laconic
was it a drunken orgy ?
it seemed to her that if she touched the doll , thunder would roll out of it
i asked my brother for the information you requested concerning the faux family
to do anything else struck him as positively dimwitted
his whole face was luminous with a vague expression of contentment , hope , and bliss
little by little , the old man stopped going as far as the corner of the rue des filles-du-calvaire ; he would stop halfway down the rue saint-louis ; sometimes a bit farther away , sometimes a bit closer

the night breeze was up , which indicated that it had to be between one and two in the morning
we find a heap of tiny seeds in them and we haven ’ t got time to amuse ourselves picking ’ em out , so of course we have to let ’ em go under the millstones ; there ’ s rye grass , there ’ s alfalfa , corn cockle , common vetch , hempseed , foxtail , love-lies-bleeding , and a lot of other stuff , not counting the pebbles that collect in certain types of wheat , especially in breton wheat
at the same time , he felt something like remorse and he despised himself for acting this way
packs chose leaders for themselves ; one man , armed with a perfectly visible pair of pistols , seemed to be passing others in review as the files moved out of the way in front of him

a cord attached to a bell hung to the right of the grate

all that had happened to him seemed absurd ; all that surrounded him did not seem possible

he can read the soul of a policeman like an open book and will tell you frankly and without batting an eyelid : so-and-so is a traitor … so-and-so is a nasty piece of work … so-and-so is terrific … so-and-so is a joke—all these terms , traitor , nasty piece of work , terrific , a joke , have a specific , accepted meaning in his mouth
they ’ ve got pink tights that get all wrinkled , and you can see that their elbows are darned with white thread

the past , it is true , is very strong at the point we have reached
this relentless persecution by fate had made him inventive
at the start , the insurrection is a riot , just as the river is a torrent
and i tell you , you are thénardier
in this way , he did himself more good than the devil did him harm
he said to himself : she is so beautiful !
it is thereby impossible to stop at these self-proclaimed solutions
he had climbed over the garden wall at the rue polonceau corner , the hymn of angels that he had heard in the middle of the night was the nuns singing matins ; the room he had glimpsed in the dark was the chapel ; the ghost he had seen stretched out on the ground was a sister making atonement ; the little bell whose ringing had so strangely startled him was the gardener ’ s bell tied around father fauchelevent ’ s knee
what do you want ?
suddenly he fished inside his redingote , took out his pocketbook , pulled out a pencil , ripped out a page , and swiftly wrote the following line : monsieur madeleine , mayor of montreuil-sur-mer

the two new arrivals accordingly advanced somewhat tentatively , barely making out the dim shapes around them , while being seen and examined perfectly well by the garret residents , whose eyes were accustomed to this eternal twilight
gazing at the same planet in space or the same worm glistening in the grass ;
i wandered with you , squeezing your soft arm
we know very well that your souls are full of the joy and the glory of giving your lives for the great cause ; we know very well that you feel you ’ ve been handpicked to die usefully and magnificently and that each of you is clinging to his part in the triumph

he called marius monsieur le baron
fauchelevent thought : i ’ m finished

victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished
a little beyond the barricade , he thought he caught a glimpse of something white up ahead
in this conceptual environment , jean valjean looked disfigured and repulsive to him
instinct told him : run !
you were whispering it amongst yourselves
the counterfeits of the past assume false identities and happily call themselves the future

there is corruption under illustrious tyrants , but moral pestilence is more hideous still under infamous tyrants
year 's day , thoroughly convinced of the lethal character of the works of oskar kokoschka , emil nolde or the sculptor , lehmbruck , gimpel goes on to tell us that there never has been any such thing as old-master art or modern or contemporary art , but that the 'old master ' shaped us , whereas the 'contemporary ' artist shapes the perception of the next generation , to the point where no one is 'ahead of their titne for they are their time , each and every day '
there is something grand about making a serious mistake a duty

that yell put an end to the speech
there had been in the utterance of that repeated sentence the tone that distinguishes the question mark from the exclamation mark
put the fire out
no , you ’ ve got it mixed up !
he would have been sunk
with the indictment of silence , contemporary art ca not quite shake off the acccusation of passivity , indeed , of pointlessness the case instituted against silence , citing the evidence of the works , then ends in out and out condemnation of that profane piety that was still an extension of the piety of bygone sacred art
she got her breath back for a moment , lifted the handle again and started walking once more , this time for a little longer
all of a sudden , he stopped in his tracks
what is the world coming to ?
the flowers fell to the florists as of right
a trickle of light fell from the air vent through which he had slipped and his eyes adjusted to the vault
marius comes home these days at one in the morning !
everything then comes tumbling down

in the other , the movement of his hand unfurls the camps ' landscape of walls and victims ' silhouettes
apart from throwing himself in the seine , what was he going to do ?
my feet are cold , he said
he spent hours watching her dress and undress her doll and listening to her chirping away
the child was speechless

the gravedigger sent the fourth shovelful into the grave
dirt is the same thing as man
how do you get in ?
it is a strange thing , you know ?
marius looks to be dead to one who knows
some little time after the events we have just related , old boulatruelle experienced a strong emotion
later , number showed how towns can get some sense into them
at six francs a shot , that means that nine hundred thousand francs a day , or three hundred million a year , goes up in smoke

it is hard to say what he was thinking , if anything , in taking them with him
all that time the clouds passed over their heads
suicides like the ones about to be committed here are sublime , but suicide is limited and won ’ t tolerate being extended ; the moment suicide hurts your nearest and dearest , it ’ s known as murder

he answered : yes , madame
he felt irresistibly that cosette was escaping him
babet had carried out his part of the business that same day , as we saw according to the story montparnasse told gavroche
a favourable circumstance that allowed marius not to lose any of this conversation was that the fallen snow muffled the noise of carriages on the boulevard

jean had no work
night had closed in
dupuytren and récamiernumber argued in the amphitheatre of the école de médecine and virtually came to blows over the divinity of jesus christ
when the hearse had driven away , when the priest and the choirboy had climbed back into the carriage and gone , fauchelevent , who didn ’ t take his eyes off the gravedigger , saw him bend down and grab hold of his shovel , which was sticking straight up in the pile of dirt

he ’ s not from any of the villages around here , is he ?
he would say , let ’ s see how this sin came to pass
the man gave her back the bucket
after that momentary flash of light , complete extinction was achieved
nothing is too awful for her now
then marius added in a whisper as though to himself : he is a man who never changes his habits and he has never received anyone except at night
that night , before going to bed , he went on to say , never be afraid of thieves and murderers
the father of a woman that we love is never a stranger for us
the thoughts cosette had , her tender preoccupations , the image of marius that filled her soul , in no way detracted from the incomparable purity of her beautiful chaste and smiling face
does it stop martin of toursnumber from being a saint and from having given half the coat off his back to a pauper ?
at first , before he had time to think , lost as he was , like a drowning man clutching at straws he had tried to find the child to give him back his money ; then , when he realized that this was pointless and impossible , he gave way to despair
how many times have we seen jean valjean seized in the dark in hand-to-hand combat by his conscience and fighting desperately against it !
fauchelevent ’ s wild eyes went automatically to this pocket and stayed there
at night , dripping with sweat , shattered by fatigue , the green cap over his eyes , to mount two by two , under the sergeant ’ s whip , the gangway of that floating prison !
it weighs down , it crushes

laigle ’ s coat was threadbare , but joly was dapper
it wouldn ’ t come to me at first
he would ’ ve had to talk then , and say where his daughter is , and say where the loot is !
jean valjean could see the way out
yet on the way back to the rue de babylone with cosette , jean valjean did not notice that she asked him other questions about what they had just seen ; maybe he was too absorbed in his own utter dejection to register what she said and to respond
the house in the rue plumet

it was falling into decay

the taverner went over to him
none had shoes ; those who didn ’ t have socks were barefoot
this self below is the soul ; the self above is god
at the end of the bill thénardier had put : received in part payment three hundred francs
this was not true

only one of her wooden clogs was lying next to the bed
let ’ s learn how to use this vast blaze of principles and virtues that crackles and flames out and occasionally sputters
but we will eat you !
all of a sudden a carrier ’ s cart , heavily loaded , rattled past on the boulevard and shook the old hovel like a roll of thunder , causing it to shudder from top to bottom
loved by cosette , he felt himself healed , rested , soothed , fulfilled , rewarded , crowned
that was the way he spoke
that cesspool offered its engulfment to the city and the world
this , said gavroche , is what summer nights are good for

she waved him away , a superior dismissing an inferior
the identical nature of the concession that each makes to all is known as equality
this house has been torn down and rebuilt since and the number has probably changed in these numbering revolutions the streets of paris undergo
wherever there are fewer houses and fewer streets , the sewer has fewer air vents
the mass bristling with bayonets hurled themselves forward like gymnasts , irresistibly , and the dense battlefront of the attacking column appeared through the smoke at the top of the steep slope
the light from the air vent died out ten or twelve feet in front of jean valjean and barely cast a wan whiteness over a few metres of the damp sewer wall
he had not exactly voted for the death of the king , but as good as

when he reached the first floor , he paused
this was the only window in the house , so there was no neighbour ’ s gaze to fear , either to the side or directly opposite

jean valjean reappeared and cried out : done
he ’ s a stool pigeon
the old man said goodbye to the fauboug saint-germain and to the salon of madame de t—— and went and set up in the marais , in his house on the rue des filles-du-calvaire
there was someone there ; but that someone was not among those the human eye can see
that great need of mankind ’ s , the finite , which allows itself to be embraced , is something they know nothing about
he remembered his giddy exhilaration , his intoxication with cosette , how love absorbed everything , how they ’ d kidnapped each other and carried each other off into the ideal , and perhaps , also , as the imperceptible dose of reason mixed in with that violent and wonderful state of the soul , a vague and nameless instinct to hide and to wipe from his memory that fearful episode he did not want to go near , in which he did not want to play any kind of rôle , which he himself shunned and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without also being accuser
a subterranean edifice built together by all the miserable outcasts
sometimes he would allude to his ninety years and say : i do hope i won ’ t see ninety-three twice
in the broadest and most absolute sense of the words , you could say that , cut off from everything by tomb walls , jean valjean was a widower just as cosette was a little orphan girl
he rarely went to church , did not go hunting , and never went to the opera
yet there are theorists for those very theories
great combatants must rise up , illuminate nations by their audacity , and shake up this sad humanity that is covered in darkness by divine right , caesar-style glory , force , fanaticism , irresponsible power , and absolute majesty ; a throng busy gazing idiotically at these dismal triumphs of the night in all their crepuscular splendour
she ran into her father from time to time and he would say hello
besides , all the windows of this silent abode had thick iron bars on them , even the dormer windows in the roof
she asked toussaint : is my father back yet ?
having no reason to be on his guard , and actually thinking for the first time in his life , montparnasse didn ’ t feel a thing
moreover , fauchelevent was puzzled
just as birds will make a nest out of anything , children can make a doll out of anything at all
brutus strikes him with a knife , and god strikes him with a cometnumber hey presto !
thénardier , i ’ ve told you what your name is
jean valjean was crushed by this sadness and shattered by this softness
the rear courtyard was wrapped around by fairly high walls with only a few gardens beyond them for a vista
we ’ re at it too , good as
the counsel for the prosecution took the floor : gentlemen of the jury , this very strange and unexpected incident that has disturbed this hearing inspires in us , as in you , only a feeling we have no need to express
to hoodwink the police ?
ah , but you ’ re alive—that ’ s the best part about it !
he had something divine about him at that moment , a quality that forces the multitudes to draw back and make way before a man
you may well be a saint
'that is a terrible thing to say ' , j anouch said
disorder gets diminished and becomes inane
they ’ d have stuck me in bicêtre
this , we will try to do
the clusians are ours
several municipal guards , wounded in the rue des lombards , turned back
he turned to his daughter and said to her : nothing
those who had declared the newcomer an ambitious man eagerly seized the opportunity everyone longs for to say : there !
they stare at the dark , they get down on their knees and bring their hands together
the world is a great fat diamond !
armed men surged up at street corners and then vanished , shouting : go home !
she was definitely wondrously beautiful
enjolras gave him a disdainful glare : grantaire , you are not capable of believing , thinking , wanting , living , or dying
paris has an aesop and it is mayeux , and a canidia and it is mademoiselle lenormand , number the fortune-teller
dying is nothing , what is unbearable is dying without seeing her
in that sweet month of may , marius and cosette discovered what triggered even more immense happiness :
that way they had twelve hours of darkness ahead of them and they worked out how to put them to use
the sun has sneezed hummingbirds
one of its moans has come down to us : je n ’ entrave que le dail comment meck , le daron des orgues , peut atiger ses mômes et ses momignards et les lochre criblant sans être atigé lui-même—i can ’ t make head or tail of the fact that mack , the king of the heap , can knock his kids and his kids ’ kids around and cop them singing out without him being knocked around himself
only an artist could come up with a line like that
one of the defeated
the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other a hand
they ’ ll leave me alone
aunt gillenormand came and went , aghast , clutching her hands , unable to do anything but mutter : god , is it possible ?
the cannon spewed out its bundle of buckshot with a roar
there a fourth bullet also missed him
being the idiom of corruption , slang is corrupted fast
this cry , which was famous around number , was a strategic warning telegraphed from gamin to gamin ; it scans like lines of homer , with a notation almost as inexpressible as the eleusinian lamentations of the panathenaea , number and it brings the antique evoe to mind
the two little abandoned boys had almost got as far as the big pond , but they were a bit overwhelmed by all this light , and they tried to hide—an instinct of the poor and weak in the face of magnificence , even when impersonal ; they ducked behind the swans ’ shelter and stayed there
to suddenly see blossoming in the middle of all her misery the fruits of paradise !
set an example , for heaven ’ s sake !
you should sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece
the grandfather smiled his poor old smile for nothing
whether out of terror or out of courage , there had not been a peep from cosette
well now , you ’ ve been through a revolution since the last time i had the honour of seeing you
professed nuns also have a rosary at the side
the rue de la chanvrerie
a good old stick , one of the old school
yet her eyes danced all around her and she began to speak in a barely audible voice as though talking to herself : set me free !
what ’ re we coolin ’ our ’ eels in this ’ ole icigo for ?
in conversation , he was affable and cheery
without going further into issues that only indirectly touch on the subject of this book , we will simply say this : it would have been a good thing if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his gaze had not been turned for a single moment from that serene contemplation where we see , shining clearly above the stormy hustle and bustle of human affairs , those three pure lights , truth , justice , and charity
; she had swept her two children into her arms and swiftly taken refuge behind her husband , gazing at the stranger in horror , her throat bare , her eyes wild with fright , murmuring almost inaudibly in french alpine patois : tso-maraude—chat de maraude , or cat of a thief
that ’ s where marius is going , then ?
you ’ ll just have to wait
he took good care not to be useless ; having books did not stop him from reading , being a botanist did not stop him from being a gardener
i voted for the demise of that particular tyrant
i ’ ve made my choice
jean valjean had killed javert
i had myself wheeled outside so i could cast my eyes over everything one last time
there is the same promiscuity , only even more amazing , between things of the intellect and the facts of substance
your fairy princess , éponine , had a bit of a sniff around , babet went on
he felt safe and alone ; with the bolt in place , he felt impregnable
its gaiety is like lightning and its farce holds a sceptre
what does the trojan war turn on ?
look me in the face a little , why don ’ t you
in critical moments , on the big days , people did not so much listen to leaders as to their own instincts
at the same time , a sort of young workman , thin , pale , small , freckled , dressed in a torn smock and patched-up corduroy trousers , who looked more like a girl playing a boy than a man , came out of the lodge and told courfeyrac in a voice that was certainly not in any way like a woman ’ s voice : monsieur marius , please ?
to see is to devour
marius cast his eyes wildly around him ; the last , automatic resort of despair
she was happy , but more than anything else , she was stupefied
being virtuous , we obey them
why does she always take the backstreets ?
his range goes merrily from high comedy to farce
if i see them batting an eyelid !
he stayed where he was , petrified like the proverbial pillar of salt , not daring to make a move
jean valjean himself suspected nothing
he had a pipe clamped in his mouth and was puffing on it
which of the two would drop first ?
the counterrevolution was unintentionally liberal the same way that , through a corresponding phenomenon , napoléon was unintentionally revolutionary
it always causes your heart to lurch , seeing these clusters of men in black murmuring among themselves sotto voce on the threshold of courts of law
gloomy face-off of the egoists and the miserable
jean valjean made no changes to the furniture that was there the first day ; only , he had replaced the glass door of cosette ’ s small side room with a solid door
the cold , the worry , the anxiety , the anguish of the night were giving him a real fever and all these ideas were crashing around in his brain
he slipped through a breach and was back inside the town
i think i ’ m going to die
who has not felt ridiculous joy like that in moments of horror ?
my dear bishop , the immortality of man is a fabulous fairy tale
grave and obscure questions , to the last of which any physiologist would probably have answered no , and without hestitating , if he had seen—in toulon , in hours of rest , which were for jean valjean hours of reverie , as he sat , arms crossed , on the bar of some capstan , the end of his chain stuffed in his pocket to stop it from dragging—this forlorn galley slave , number grave , silent , and pensive , a pariah of laws that look on man with anger , one of civilization ’ s damned , who looked so harshly on the heavens
for the requirements of this battle , misery has invented a language of combat and that language is slang
grass had invaded half of them and green mildew covered the rest
my children , don ’ t cry , i ’ m not going far
he went from black to red , from red to purple , and from purple to a dangerous flare
at an anniversary te deum celebrating the return of the bourbons , seeing monsieur de talleyrandnumber go by , he said : there goes his excellency , evil
jean valjean threw himself fully dressed onto his bed and did not sleep a wink all night
you must have thought i was a real idiot when you went off with the lark !
this presented onlookers with a vision not unlike a pipe of young girls , a sort of living pan ’ s pipe made up of angels
he dimly remembered his other nocturnal trip on the great plain not far from digne
this man , as we already know , was a tramp who had been found in a field , carrying a branch laden with ripe apples , torn off an apple tree in a neighbouring enclosure known as pierron close
didn ’ t you tell me a hundred and nine francs ?
every spring , in the stand of acacias outside your windows , a nightingale comes
the part of the village on the gagny side drew its water from the glorious ponds in the woods ; but the other end , surrounding the church on the chelles side , only found drinking water at a little spring halfway up a hill close to the chelles road , about a quarter of an hour away from montfermeil
red , he said as he came in , eyeing enjolras steadily
miner ’ s spikes were made of solid iron , with a point at the bottom end for hoeing into the rock
the bishop remained silent for a moment , then he looked up with a grave expression on his face and spoke softly to madame magloire : to start with , was the silver really ours ?
quot libras in duce ? number
he said to his majesty : there ’ s a man with a mean mug for you
they saw gavroche totter , then he crumpled
meanwhile , as he continued up the street , he noticed a girl of about thirteen or fourteen , frozen stiff under a porte cochère and begging , her clothes so short you could see her knees
what would your aunt have said ?
when gavroche had disappeared at the turn of the rue des ballets , babet took thénardier aside : did you get a good look at that shaver ?
they also found a little blue steel saw that could be hidden in the retooled sou
we are fleeing in the arms of laffitte and on the wings of caillard
all god ’ s works are made to serve love
he probably made a point of not going too far in certain issues and conundrums reserved to a certain extent for towering and terrifying minds
her amazement had nothing aggressive about it ; it was not in the least the scandalized , envious attitude of an owl gazing upon two turtledoves ; hers was the dazed eye of a poor innocent of fifty-seven ; it was life that had missed out gazing on that triumph , love
father , he silently prayed , forgive me !
slow and measured footsteps reverberated along the channel for a while , but they were more and more dampened the farther away they got ; the pack of black shapes slunk into the gloom , a glimmer of light wavered and fluttered , turning the curved arch of the vault a kind of red , before dwindling and disappearing ; silence once more fell , profound , blindness and deafness again took hold of the darkness , and jean valjean , not yet daring to move again , stayed for a long time with his back to the wall , ears pricked , eyes wide open , watching the vanishing phantom patrol
'such a conception of information leads to a disturbing fascination with images filmed live , with scenes of violence and gruesome human interest stories ' , ignacio ramonet writes on the impact of television on the print media
they wouldn ’ t let the boy come into the printer ’ s because he got in the way , they said
javert was perfectly certain that he would not get away

a poor woman must croak in the hospital !
overwhelmed with shame even more than despair , she left the workshop and went back to her room

it was only seven or eight minutes from the clearing in the woods to the spring
he watched the revolt going on around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge
he was wearing his workingman ’ s jacket and trousers of coarse grey cotton , and his cap with the long peak hid his face
the main leaders , as they said in the faubourg , kept out of sight
so then i said : i can ’ t live anywhere but here
neither monsieur leblanc nor the young girl had set foot in the luxembourg again
this gentleman was already old when they were young
demolition may be useful ; but i don ’ t trust any demolition that ’ s caught up in rage
perhaps they had escaped from some unlocked guardhouse ; perhaps , somewhere in the neighbourhood—at the barrière d ’ enfer or on the esplanade of the observatoire or in the neighbouring square overlooked by the pediment on which you can read : invenerunt parvulum pannis involutumnumber—there was some run-down booth set up by street players that they had run away from ; perhaps , the night before , they had managed to evade the garden keepers at closing time and had spent the night in one of those huts where people sit around reading the newspapers
thénardier had discreetly snuck off , without daring to say good night , not wanting to show excessive cordiality to a man he was planning to fleece royally the following morning
you can still count forty-three balusters in place on their bases ; the rest are lying in the grass
courfeyrac said to bahorel : would you believe it ?

marius was vaguely amazed
bawl your eyes out !
misery is like anything else
the man everyone forgets , but whom we have named , bruneseau
it feels like the gloom-laden door of winter has remained ajar and that that is where the wind is coming from
history will take his loyalty into account
they were giant men on colossal horses
it preys on women , meaning on grace , on weakness , on beauty , on the maternal
tongues were loosened ; a firestorm of jeering and swearing and singing erupted
everything bows down before success , even grammar
madame magloire , the bishop replied , you are mistaken
in any case , our despair has the peculiarity of wrapping itself around others as it does us , so it seemed only logical to him that everybody had come to die
monsieur , said marius , with the look of a man knowing he is about to plummet over a precipice , i ’ ve come to ask your permission to marrynumber
they were just sitting there
the next day jean valjean had decamped
why in hell did i think it was javert ?
i am not in
monsieur myriel was the son of a councillor of the aix parliament , a member of the noblesse de robenumber they reckoned his father had put him down to inherit his position and so had married him off very early in the piece when he was only eighteen or twenty , as they used to do quite a lot in parliamentary families

two or three of them had a straw rope tied to the struts of the wagon , which hung down under them like a stirrup and supported their feet
you decide on the amount yourself , and you will have it
the new history , the history involving the time of history ’ ( the mid-to-late nineteenth century ) , can only maintain what it is saying at the cost of endlessly transforming monuments into documents and documents into monuments

i am no longer a royalist except when it comes to that particular royalty
but i kept it
as for the number and length of their prayers , the best we can do to give some idea of this is to cite the guileless words of one of the nuns : the prayers of the postulants are frightening , the prayers of the novices are even worse , and the prayers of the professed nuns are worse still
for , o mesdames , there were bombardas in greece and egypt
but the hand relaxed and released him
the whole thickness of a house and a host of vacant rooms separated this rathole from the boulevard , and its only window looked out on vast wastelands blocked off behind walls and paling fences

later , some weeks afterwards , when he thought about it , he had no idea where he had dined that particular evening

silence in front of jean-jacques !
double shackles for nothing
a number of batteries were scattered around unhorsed

i say cunningly , for , through a donation of the kind , to slip into an honourable household , the comforts of which he will share , and , by the same token , cover up his crime , to enjoy the fruits of his theft , bury his name , and create himself a family—that would not be particularly inept
where did he go ?
the two little boys were playing in the backyard at the time and saw nothing of the raid
he felt like he was already an immense distance away from life
jondrette had let his pipe go out , a serious sign of intense preoccupation , and had come and sat back down again

a very skinny poodle had just walked past
it has its main centres where it holds steady
and the old man let go of montparnasse and put his purse in montparnasse ’ s hand
he put on his presentable coat , tied a scarf around his neck , grabbed his hat and went out , without making any more noise than if he had been walking barefoot on moss
a biscuit , answered babet
but had she forgotten him ?
did they persist in some fatal vice that sank them ?
as the secondhand book and bric-a-brac dealers could see that he was forced to sell , they bought off him for twenty sous what he had paid twenty francs for—sometimes to the same booksellers
to come out of nowhere and take the reins , to march and to triumph , to have all the capitals of europe as stops along the way , to take his grenadiers and turn them into kings , to decree the downfall of dynasties , to change the face of europe as you charge on , for people to feel , when you threaten them , that you have your hand on the hilt of the sword of god , to follow hannibal , caesar , and charlemagne in the person of one man , to be the nation of a man who greets you every dawn with the glorious announcement of a battle won , to have the cannon of the invalides as your alarm clock , to hurl into the endless light mighty words that blaze out for all time , marengo , arcola , austerlitz , jena , wagram !
he was pale and shaking slightly

how are things , monsieur montparnasse ?

he didn ’ t know how to fall
behind this star , moving around confusedly , were eight or ten black shapes , erect , indistinct , terrifying
what a nice respectable notice i ’ d chuck him then !
yes , an honest man
what had gone on in his soul ?
but what could she do about it ?
we can only relate what we ’ ve heard , but generally he spent his life doing the same thing at the same time every day
madame fabantou looks to me to be much better ?
every time that fate , which gets mixed up in the promenades of people whose eyes are turned inward , took marius into this path , which was practically every day , he would find this couple there
no one had seen her , except the traveller , who was slowly eating his meagre supper

he owed gratitude on several sides ; he owed some to his father , he owed some to himself

that terrifying lowest common denominator , shame , had passed over these foreheads ; at this level of debasement , the final transformations were undergone by all in the final depths , absolute rock bottom ; and ignorance turned to stupor was indistinguishable from intelligence turned to despair

that god is hard up

what was remarkable about the champ de mai celebration was that it was held on the champ de mars and in the month of june
these ghouls start out as larvae in dire poverty and then move on to crime—a fatal line of descent , a dizzying begetting , the logic of the dark
the lame old man who was following it was , of course , none other than fauchelevent

i ’ ll take you to see the executioner
the young girls spent hours listening to it , the vocal mothers were incensed , brains became overwrought , punishments rained down
there , he heard a very faint little sound that was like a child breathing

if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a room at the inn , there would have been no witnesses , no one would have heard it , things would have been left at that , and it is quite likely that we would not have to relate any of the events you are going to read about
i didn ’ t know any and i didn ’ t acknowledge any
in the course of this tale , the author of this book has come across this curious moment in contemporary history on his travels ; he could not help but cast a glance at it in passing and outline some of the singular features of that long-lost social world

thénardier tried in vain to hide among the branches , but there was nothing he could do to stop the man from seeing him

he did not disdain servant girls and so his wife did not have any anymore
there is , at the extreme of all debasements and all personal disasters , one last form of misery that rebels and decides to do battle with the whole raft of happy facts and reigning rights ; an appalling battle where , now cunning , now violent , at once morbid and wild , it attacks the social order through the pin-pricks of vice and through the club blows of crime

jean valjean looked down at the window outlined on the parquet floor at his feet by the sun
but children are innocent of the crimes of their fathers
thirty-two parishes , forty-one vicarages , and two hundred and eighty branch parishes
anyone for a game of skittles ?
his wealthy female penitents and the devout women of digne had chipped in to provide a fine new altar for the monseigneur ’ s oratory ; he had taken the money every time and given it to the poor
this retooled sou was one of those marvels of patient industry that the galleys foster in the dark and for the dark , marvels that are nothing less than the instruments of escape
on the following days , he returned as usual to the luxembourg ; as usual , he found the father and daughter there , but he no longer took any notice of them
he turned out to be an old émigré gentleman , blind and ruined , who played the flute in his garret to while away the time
be lucky and the rest will fall into place
what a man was convinced of was crumbling !
get out of there !
joy is the backward surge of terror
whenever she passed by the factory at times when the workers were hanging around the doors , she would put on an act , laughing and singing
she had not been to bed
now , in broad daylight , in that wide-mouthed street , surprise was decidedly impossible , the gloves were off , the cannon had begun roaring , the army was hurling itself at the barricade
the tread was heavy and reverberated like a man ’ s tread , but the old woman wore thick shoes and nothing sounds more like a man ’ s tread than the tread of an old woman
you are too young to have taken on the serious business of attacking the government on your own

monsieur le maire , i have come to beg you to be so kind as to see to it that the authorities dismiss me
did you lose it , the fifteen-sou coin ?
no you ’ re not , marius replied in an imploring tone
come and choose pitchers and jugs ,
in number , as the ultimate disasters were in the air , number as france shuddered at their sinister approach , as waterloo could dimly be perceived opening up before napoléon , the sorrowful acclaim of the army and of the people , cheering on a man who had been condemned by destiny , had nothing laughable about it , and with all our reservations about the despot , a heart like the bishop of digne ’ s should not , perhaps , have been so impervious to all that was noble and moving , at the edge of the abyss , in the tight embrace of a great nation and a great man
at that very moment , a loud knock was heard at the door
they broke into houses where the women were , made them hand over the absent husband ’ s sabre and fusil , and wrote over the door in spanish white : weapons have been handed over
monsieur , he said , i ’ m the one who got you this cart
because he was still in doubt
your sister-in-law is still here with her young family
'we are trying to get a background of ambient sound ' , explains a spokesman for the british station
it was a seigneurial garden in the first french style that preceded le nôtre ; number today , nothing but ruins and brambles
the statues under the trees , naked and white , had frocks of shade riddled with light ; these goddesses were all in tatters of sunshine ; sunbeams hung from them on all sides
only maternal instinct , that admirable intuition into which the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman enter , knows how and with what this half-light should be made
what direction would he take ?
the most lighthearted became solemn in pronouncing that date : number their flesh-and-blood fathers were , or had been , feuillants , royalists , doctrinaires ; number it didn ’ t matter much ; this mishmash that came before them , the young , did not concern them ; the blue blood of principles ran in their veins
there are such things as magic spells
the emperor straightened up and gathered himself together
the fathomless pit of the social unknown had silently closed over those beings
you know what , monsieur marius ?
it is more than great , it is immense
this last book fascinated him even more because his garden had been one of the places once haunted by goblins
mademoiselle gillenormand was a kind of crepuscular soul
grantaire was getting stuck into his second bottle and perhaps his second harangue when a new creature emerged from the square hole at the top of the stairs
gavroche had to admire the man ’ s cunning
scarcely one day in a hundred of unbounded joy and unbounded sunshine
use of monsieur leblanc ’ s five-franc piece
whenever there was someone staying in the alcove , a big heavy serge curtain was drawn from one side of the oratory to the other , and it hid the altar
if , by the deformity of certain terms , we recognize that it has been chewed up by the outlaw mandrin , number by the splendour of certain metonyms we can feel it has been spoken by villonnumber
he took no notice of the concierge ’ s words , went to bed and went to sleep
what was happening inside javert was the diverting of a rectilinear conscience , the throwing off course of a soul , the smashing of a probity irresistibly launched straight ahead and shattering against god
is there a mutt in the garden ?
it ’ s hell , i tell you !
where are we going ?
this was a vast shapeless set of horizontal planks , the top ones wider than the bottom ones , held together by long transverse iron bands
he withdrew with his head down , crossed the antechamber , and slowly went back down the stairs , as though hesitating at every step
if he felt like a walk : yes , my darling father
the porter did not finish his sentence
it was also whispered that he had immense sums of money deposited at laffitte , with one peculiar stipulation , which was that the money was always immediately available , so that , it was added , monsieur madeleine could turn up any morning at laffitte ’ s , sign a receipt , and cart off his two or three million in ten minutes flat
she ran to her transom and opened it
you see , it ’ s over nine years that i ’ ve had her by my side
ulm , wagram , jena , friedland , number died with them
i have the portrait !
the man walking hunched over was an ex-convict and what he was lugging on his shoulders was a corpse
dust was safe there
no one should worry on his account
there was a time , in the s , when the power of illusion ’ of cinema , the conjunction of the eye that records and the eye that draws , of machinic radiography and symphonic montage , was viewed as defining a supreme art , one that buried the stale old notions of psychological man and representational fiction , and was up to speed with manufacturing man and the new collective
it is no longer made up of anything but what is pure ; it no longer relies on anything but what is elevated and grand
the ordinary everyday metaphor answers : voir trente-six chandelles , to see thirty-six candles—to see stars
then he began the monotonous and grim pacing that troubled the dreams of the man below him and woke him with a start from his sleep
the zeal sometimes went as far as extermination
as for jondrette , he had not quit the overcoat , new and far too big for him , that monsieur leblanc had given him , and his outfit continued to offer that contrast between overcoat and trousers that constituted the ideal of the poet in courfeyrac ’ s view
we will remake eden by learning what a + b equals
mother thénardier threw a look at the bandits who had got themselves tied up and growled in a raucous gutteral voice : cowards !
is there another wheelwright ?
the lieutenant , little accustomed to encountering such venerable personages , stammered rather timidly , hello , uncle , and performed a mixed salutation consisting of an involuntary and mechanical attempt at a military salute finishing in a bourgeois bow
how does it manage to suddenly stop everyone in their tracks ?
marius blamed himself and almost hated himself for not getting anywhere in his searches
i like that name , he said
he put the suitcase on a chair by his bed and he carried the key to it on him always
cosette had resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting
yes , the people , roughly sketched out by the eighteenth century , will be completed by the nineteenth
and they fell irresistibly into each other ’ s arms
he looked as though he was ready either to smash the old man ’ s skull in or to kiss his hand
at certain moments , she saw him as a burning candle ; at others , she felt him as a claw
you look like you had a pretty face until someone accidentally sat on it
did he have wings ?
seven vehicles were moving in single file along the road
he circled himself , over and over again ; he felt himself to be puny and he wept many times
the likes of us , we ’ ll only know two hours beforehand on the day
what could a man hold on to ?
neither jean valjean , nor cosette , nor toussaint ever came in or went out except through the door on the rue de babylone
if my son should meet up with him , he will do whatever he can for thénardier
as he had been a mayor , he knew how to resolve a delicate problem that he alone was in on the secret of : cosette ’ s civil status
the winds of revolution are not easily controlled
she resorted to the expedient of children who are always frightened ; she lied
is there anything the blind man is deprived of ?
cosette piped up : that is , there are two little girls
hours all white , almost all alike
anyone who had seen her a quarter of an hour earlier would not have believed their eyes
the soldiers began searching the surrounding houses and going after the fugitives
he said to marius : we are the two leaders
nothing can beat a pile of stones for longevity—unless it is a paling fence
little by little you ’ ll see its whiskers and you ’ ll get a shock
he was eighteen years old at the time
i ’ m well aware that this seems unlikely
it was at this time , when six months had gone by , that marius saw her again at the luxembourg
are they crazy , these damned peasants ?
a mason going home after a day ’ s work left a small packet on a bench near the pont d ’ austerlitz
when we ’ ve put the baby to bed , said the gravedigger
just like a yellowed photograph of the deceased mounted on their tomb , the monochro ma tic segment merely signals the obscurantism of a bygone era , the dvvindling of a heroic age in
he weighed , he reflected , he considered the alternatives presented by the mysterious balance of light and shadow
do not we therefore need to refine fortini 's pronouncement and the marxism of straub and huillet ?
all right , look alive !
liberty being assured , power must be looked to
we must have pity on animals
he gathered the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her to the farthest corner of the shed , behind a pile of old furniture that was no longer in use
there were two wicker prie-dieu chairs in the oratory , and an armchair also made of wicker in the bedroom
this sort of thing will keep happening as long as they go off and read the newspapers under the arches of the odéon
the man had sat down there to let cosette have a little rest
and so this sorry soul went on debating with himself in anguish
fire lapped at his feet , which can now only be seen as blackened stumps , then it stopped
they ’ d sing out : look !
as he turned round , he realized that marius was watching him pace
she was an orphan
the sixteenth it is !
how could he get her warm again ?
but marius ’ s convalescence had become a habit and the rue des filles-du-calvaire armchairs , better for tête-à-têtes than the straw-bottomed chairs of the rue de l ’ homme-armé , had firmly established it
in her anxiety , cosette had looked through the gate and spotted éponine in her man ’ s getup , now prowling endlessly about the garden
you would have said that the man who had died was studying those who were about to die
in those days , galleys were to the navy what steamers are today
these considerations exhausted , he moved on to jean valjean himself
marius could find no words and jean valjean spoke again : thank you
kempt , on the left wing , called for reinforcements
i hold the secret at your disposal desiring to have the honour of being yuseful to you
maybe i was wrong to get annoyed
the moment the hanoverian lieutenant wilda took hold of the handle to seek refuge inside the farmhouse , a french sapper chopped his hand off with an axe
it sedates the sometimes high fevers of the overwrought brain at work and produces a soft fresh vapour in the mind that smooths out the oversharp points of pure thought , fills up the gaps and holes here and there , binds things together and blunts the jagged corners of ideas
the bush having been viewed , tholomyès shouted : donkeys , everyone—my treat !
cosette was just as horrified but in a slightly different way
on one body , which was that of a corporal , he found a powder horn
it has as its aim , and should have as its result , the dissolving of anger through the study of antagonisms
he waited , hoping for some incident , no matter what , unable to gather his wits and not knowing whose side to take
elsewhere , they merely show , merely provide a record for posterity
i an old-world salon
intentionally and beyond what was intended
he remained silent for a moment before adding : look at the happiness of others
in the twinkling of an eye , before javert had time to turn round , he was collared , laid out , tied up , frisked
and that poor mother can bring up her daughter !
the cart had been freed
they were witty , but they were a little too silent ; their political dogma was properly starched with arrogance , but they were a little too driven
for cosette , listening to marius talk politics ;
send my daughter in
cosette was standing in her own shadow , as marius was in his , all ready to take fire and blaze
in that case , sell me a pair of wheels
wherever telepresence has taken over
some of her words were lost in the journey from larynx to lips as on a keyboard that is missing some notes
he stood there for a few minutes with his head down , drawing in the sand with a stick
the next day at the usual time , marius dug his new coat out of his wardrobe , along with his new trousers and his new boots ; he donned the complete panoply , pulled on gloves , an extravagant luxury , and took himself off to the luxembourg
the government paid them a small pension ; the ladies of petit-picpus had rushed to take them in
that shone out clear as the light of day
and monsieur bombarda , the magnificent restaurateur , gives you these three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs fifty centimes !
cosette , seeing her father sick and wounded , had deserted the villa , regaining her taste for the little cottage and the backyard
in the circuit court
they knew , by a wonderfully subtle instinct , that certain kinds of concern can get in the way
as in the ocean , the diver can disappear there
in , speaking about his film without images , vvhich mounted a defence of the marquis de sade , debord claimed he wanted to kill the cinema 'because it was easier than killing a passer-by '
the fall was such a bad one that his chest was taking the whole weight of the cart
you do what you like
you ’ ve done the right thing , coming to see a man who is about to die
the dazzle of success is goading biologists implacably on , each obstacle overcome leading them to take up the next challenge - a challenge even greater , even more insane ?
a man in the cart taking him to the gallows is listening to his confessor
there aren ’ t many people out walking on this boulevard , especially in winter
this was the barricade of the faubourg du temple
i don ’ t let myself be hoodwinked by make-believe
there ’ s a proud old war veteran for you !
this is what we have called the third substage—the dregs , rock bottom
old boulatruelle is the montfermeil road-mender we have already caught sight of in the dark sections of this book
once , on the subject of education , which marius thought should be free and compulsory , spread far and wide in all its forms , lavished on all like the air and the sun , in a word , breathable by the whole population , they were in complete agreement and almost chatted
chatting away perfectly naturally and quietly all the while , she pressed on marius all the longings of a virginal and passionate gaze
marius ’ s great pleasure was to take long walks alone along the outer boulevards or in the champ de mars or along the less frequented allées of the luxembourg gardens
this road was and still is a trench for most of its length ; a trench sometimes twelve feet deep , whose too steep embankments would collapse here and there , especially in winter , in the rain
cosette , as we ’ ve said , had not been sick
he anticipated that he would perhaps not return to the rue plumet , and he could not leave toussaint behind or tell her his secret
its deceptive resemblance to merit has people fooled
pleasing a bishop is a foot in the door for a subdeaconnumber after all , a person has to carve out a niche for himself and so clerics never disdain sinecures
not many of the paths were paved , not many of the streets were built on
this peace based on 'the balance of terror ' not only between east and west but also between the forms and figures of an aesthctics of disappear- ance that would come to charactcrize the whole fin de siecle
the arch was sealed off by a heavy gate and this gate , which , to all appearances , rarely turned on its oxidized hinges , was held fast in its stone frame by a heavy lock , red with rust , that looked like an enormous brick
a voice replied : this is a prison , not an inn
the cabarets of the rue de charonne were serious and stormy , though the conjunction of the two adjectives seems odd when applied to cabarets
none of the young recluses could get a look at him because of the serge curtain , but he had a soft and slightly reedy voice that they had come to recognize and distinguish
i don ’ t know if the man who gave them to me is pleased with me up there
a harsh thought , oddly emerging from the clatter of words , suddenly pierced through the verbal free-for-all in which grantaire , bahorel , prouvaire , bossuet , combeferre , and courfeyrac were chaotically clashing swords
monsieur thénardier , you are right , he definitely owes that , mumured the wife , who was thinking of the doll given to cosette in front of her girls
we saw a man go past completely naked , the colour of ash , mounted on a horse the colour of dirt
lieutenants have themselves crowned kings ; foremen play at being manufacturers
he had no more suspicion of his splendid reputation than has a steer from durham or surrey whose portrait is published in the illustrated london news with this caption : the steer that won first prize in the cattle show
dating from that moment , was it purely by chance ?
with twenty-five thousand men , we can face them
the first lot were men ; these were women
if so-called old-master art remained denzonstrative right up until the nineteenth century with impres- sionism , the art of the twentieth century became amonstrative ' in the sense that it is contemporary with the shattering effect of mass societies , subject as they are to the conditioning of opinion and niass media propaganda - and this , with the same mounting extrelnism evident in terrorism or total war
why didn ’ t he attack right away ?
the poor woman shuddered
no one moved a muscle in that stoical audience
little by little he developed the habit of staying longer
at one extreme the artist , like the journalist , is red undant in the face-off between performer and viever
he wrote a letter which he then sealed , and wrote an address on the envelope that you could have read , had you been in the room at the time : to monsieur laffitte , banker , rue d ’ artois , at paris
serious men wondered what monsieur de trinquelague would do on such and such an occasion ; monsieur clausel de montals differed , on this or that point , with monsieur clausel de coussergues ; monsieur de salaberry was not happynumber the actor picard , number who belonged to the académie , which molière had never been able to get into , put on les deux philibert at the odéon , number on the pediment of which , though the letters had been torn off , you could still clearly read : thétre de l ’ impératrice
thénardier made a move toward her
he bowed his head ; when he raised it again , they were almost upon him
the old man kept his eyes on the ground but decided to reply : what , mother plutarch ?
the evening of the day she had delivered her two little boys to mother magnon , with the firm intention of giving them up for good , mother thénardier had , or pretended she had , a scruple
a kind of slide occurs as a result of this mannheim terrorist manifesto , just as it does with the exhibition 'sensation ' in london and new york : it will not be long before we are forced to acknowledge that the german expressionists who called for murder were not the only avant-garde artists
the stranger turned to face him and replied mildly : ah !
war can be appallingly beautiful and we have not tried to hide this ; it can also be , i think we all agree , somewhat ugly
this encounter worried him for a few days , then faded
all of a sudden , he stopped and smacked his forehead the way a man will when he has forgotten something fundamental and is ready to retrace his steps
the insouciant bustling man on foot disappeared
he took the main street
i saw one once , a little thing , knee-high to a grasshopper
and so i despise the human race
he got cosette out of all difficulties , though
it was a sign of elegance for all to see
at that moment , she struck marius as even more frightening than her husband
the terrified child looked at him and then began to quiver from head to toe and , after a few seconds of standing there stunned , he ran away as fast as his little legs would carry him , not daring to look back or to let out a whimper
what was this figure of darkness whose sole concern had been to protect a rising star from all shadow and from all cloud ?
the name romainville kept endlessly recurring , along with two lines of a song he ’ d once heard
in ten years , i ’ ll have earned ten million , i give it back to the community , i keep nothing myself , what ’ s it to me ?
they wore plumeless helmets and cuirasses of beaten iron , with cavalry pistols in their holsters and long sabres
this always finishes , it is true , in an awakening , but a tardy one
men are so lucky !
prejudices are the real thieves , vices are the murderers
i had a strong notion , as soon as you were better , to plant her right here at your bedside , but it ’ s only in novels that one sticks young girls without further ado by the beds of the pretty wounded lads they ’ ve got their eye on
marius looked at this man
jean valjean went on : monsieur pontmercy , have no fear , i implore you
to sum up , we might agree that when you see those paving stones , you think of the bear in its pit , the monster in its lair , and that is the sort of goodwill that raises society ’ s hackles
in his dread of what was being set up and in the horror into which the jondrettes had plunged him , he felt a kind of joy that it might perhaps be given to him to do a great service to the one he loved
and that dear portrait of the divine shakespeare
he remained pensive for a moment , mechanically running the tip of his forefinger over the nail of his thumb , then he spoke up : that just about does it
as for imagining that you ’ ll make me talk , that you ’ ll make me write anything i don ’ t want to write , that you ’ ll make me say anything i don ’ t want to say—
then he added in a lowered voice : the mousetrap ’ s set
and he was one of the students who had got the most out of his studies in paris ; he knew that the best coffee was in the café lemblin and that the best billiard table was in the café voltaire ; that you got good cakes and good girls at l ’ ermitage on the boulevard du maine , spatchcock chickens at mother saguet ’ s , excellent fish stews at the barrière de la cunette , and a certain light white wine at the barrière du combat
two women , an old man who lives out the back ; there are plenty of good curtains at the windows
be that as it may , a mighty leap had been taken
raising eyes to heaven is an opus
brujon was deft ; gueulemer was strong
someone ’ s come through the sewer ?
every day jean valjean took cosette ’ s arm and took her out for a stroll
naïveté has taken refuge there , basil ’ s mask is found down there , but you can see the pasteboard and strings and the inside as well as the outside , and it is enhanced by honest muck
but this particular camera changed purpose and the images it shot match up with other images , taken behind other windows , to converge on this central point where the images of official television show us the romanian leader , the conducator , haranguing his usual audience but being interrupted by the spectacle and dissonant noise coming from the far end of the square
death has its own way of harassing victory , sending pestilence hot on the heels of glory
in the unfathomable depths of abstraction and pure speculation that , for all intents and purposes , lie beyond dogma , geniuses offer up their ideas to god
he was austere in his pleasures
one observer , a dreamer , the author of this book , who had gone to see the volcano up close , found himself caught in the crossfire in the arcade
she was at that age when a virgin carries her love the way an angel carries its lily
would you let me have the bucket again now ?
opposite these men , wild , we admit , and frightening , but wild and frightening for the good , there are other men , smiling , prettily primped up , gilded , beribboned , spangled , in silk stockings , white feathers , yellow gloves , brightly polished shoes , who , leaning on velvet tables at the corners of marble fireplaces , gently insist on the maintenance and preservation of the past , of the middle ages , of divine right , of fanaticism , ignorance , slavery , the death penalty , war , politely glorifying in hushed voices the sabre , the stake , and the scaffold
the sheet of water is healthy ; it comes from the sky first of all , then from the ground ; the sheet of air is unhealthy , it comes from the sewer
the secular leaders who followed suit had proclaimed : you have no right to live among us
smock frocks , smocks , caps , bristling heads caked with dirtnumber this mob undulated confusedly in the nocturnal fog
said the old man in a tone of reproach
someone ran right past him
in this hell-like tomb , what did they do ?
it seemed that this was some sort of agreement
he saw two roads before him , both equally straight , but he saw two of them ; and this terrified him , for he had never in his life known more than one straight line
opinions go through phases
a wart lives up her nose , so risky—true ;
the 'son et lumiere ' phenomenon has been followed most recently by the craze in museums as venues for live shows , though you would be hard- pressed to beat the calamitous night of the l\illennium , when the mists of the nile valley suddenly broke up a jean-michel j arre concert
in a word , fantine was known to have a child
all these questions that today remain unanswered make enigmas of contemporary ethics and aesthetics
how long have you been back ?
his shirt of coarse yellow twill , fastened at the neck with a small silver anchor , gaped open , exposing his hairy chest ; he had a cravat that looked like twisted rope , trousers of blue drill , worn out and threadbare , with one knee frayed white and one knee in holes , a tattered old grey peasant ’ s smock , with one elbow patched with a bit of green sheeting sewn on with string ; on his back , a brand-new soldier ’ s knapsack crammed to bursting and tightly buckled up ; in his hand , an enormous knotted stick ; on his stockingless feet , hobnailed shoes
by saying no to progress , it is not the future they condemn , it is themselves
the convict is no longer the like of the living , so to speak
the clamour of visits and congratulations does not begin till later
now and then , a glimmer of light flashed in those dizzying depths and dimly snaked along , the water having the power , on the blackest of nights , to take the light who knows where and turn it into a death adder
any allusion to that old rotter g—— caused him to lapse into a strange meditative trance
ushers , said the president , call the room to order
the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism
this is how he posed the problem of his life : to work as little as possible at material work in order to work as much as possible at immaterial work ; in other words , to give a few hours to real life and to pour the rest into infinity
in front of the camera lens
the unbelievably generous squabbling began again
sometimes he came on his own
my name is cosette
it was no longer montfermeil , it was the open country
at the word monsieur , the man turned around
cosette was dreaming forlornly , for , although she was only eight years old , she had already suffered so much that she dreamed with the mournful air of an old woman
as soon as he gets home , his mother says : oh , lord !
theatres are like upside-down ships with the hold on top
you ’ re much better off with him than with me
his bedroom was fairly big and fairly hard to heat up in winter
her maternity ended there , her hatred of the human race began with her sons
he was a brazen bastard
it ’ s rather urgent to go and have a word with them—a firm word
he chatted volubly ; he had recovered the excitement of the disembarkation of march number , when he pointed out to the grand maréchal the enthusiastic peasants of the juan gulf , shouting : there you go , bertrand , here ’ s some reinforcements , already !
but , of course , it did so after its own fashion , as a double agent faithful to two masters : the one behind the camera who actively directs the shot , and the one in front of the camera who passively directs the camera 's passivity
now and then she lifted her eyes up to the man with a sort of inexpressible tranquillity and abandon
it took him nearly a quarter of an hour to get back to the garden shed
my dear mayor , said the bishop , isn ’ t that just the point ?
mother plutarch doesn ’ t mind explaining a phenomenon
that the incommutable , the direct , the correct , the geometric , the passive , the perfect , could bend !
he behaved like the great captains at the decisive moment that they alone know how to recognize
wonderful chestnut hair streaked with gold , a forehead that looked made of marble , cheeks that looked made of rose petals , a pale incarnadine , a flushed whiteness , an exquisite mouth with a smile like a flash of light and a voice that was sheer music , a head that raphael would have given mary , placed on a neck that jean goujonnumber would have given venus
as they walked along , the burgher said to him : if monsieur is hoping to sit in on a trial , he ’ s a bit late
on the contrary , her state seemed to worsen from one week to the next
at around five o ’ clock , toussaint , who was bustling about , very busy with this little move , had laid out cold chicken on the dining table , which cosette , out of deference to her father , had consented to look at
it was only after a couple of hours that she snapped out of her reverie and cried : heavens !
fantine moved away from the door and watched in stupefaction as he went past her
an onlooker able to see him and observe him in that instant would no doubt have imagined that the letter seemed most curious to him , for he couldn ’ t take his eyes off it and read it over and over again
monsieur fauchelevent was not there
once the province of advertising , this adage surely now belongs to the realm of art , the desire to consume yielding to the desire to rape or kill
he acknowledged that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished
a convict and a prostitute
he had approached and registered that it was a very young child , loaded with an enormous bucket of water
strip the straw off the chair !
they were breaking the law
knowingness of the young !
rust had coated the wheels , rims , hubs , axle , and shaft with a layer of mud—a hideous yellowish distemper not unlike the colour wash deliberately applied to cathedrals
just as he had done that morning , he watched the trees go by , the thatched roofs , the fields under cultivation , and the vanishing stretches of the landscape shifting at every bend in the road
asking myself all those questions in the days when i was so poor !
jean valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys
the four paws of the jackal are just right for certain purposes
every day , he left his place at the same time , he set out on the same route , but he no longer finished it and , without perhaps realizing it , he made it shorter and shorter all the time
the finite , which allows that sublime travail , progress , is not something they ever think about
he stood them to ten sous ’ worth of wine and said : you got a job ?
and so , june number , on a day of mixed rain and sunshine , general lamarque ’ s funeral procession crossed paris with all official military pomp and state , somewhat enhanced as a precautionary measure
you are the child !
she sent the forty francs to montfermeil
he barked at marius , without adding monsieur
the good lord consulted his book of due dates
to save yourself by using what has sunk you , that is the masterpiece of a great man ; gavroche was able to sum up the whole situation at a glance
the wall was capped by flat stone without any zigzagging chevrons
cosette , you see your little dress , over there on the bed ?
that door is walled up now !
and she turned to marius : my brother ’ s here
you would have said it looked like a spider coming to grab a fly ; only here the spider was bringing life , not death
if a giant had sifted through this cloaca , he would have collected the riches of centuries in his sieve
they need someone to talk to them about the good lord from time to time
as soon as they realize that they are starting to become attached to this object , they must give it away
the desperate gaze of jean valjean lit on the lamppost in the cul-de-sac genrot
and yet , we might just say in passing , there is still a gulf between this species of men and the murderous city-dwelling criminal
in the twinkling of an eye , montparnasse had become unrecognizable
you know very well they won ’ t give me any
you never notice me , but i know you , monsieur marius
the faubourg saint-germain and the pavillon marsannumber wanted monsieur delavaunumber as chief of police because of his devoutness
in so doing , they threatcn science itself with disappearance
but he could not resist that mysterious and imperious rush of blood to the head we might name the call of the abyss
then he began to amuse himself
marius , who was perhaps dead , weighed heavily as inert bodies do
at the back , through a glass door , you could see two tiny , very white twin beds
of course , i approve of politial opinions , but some people just don ’ t know where to draw the line
one afternoon—it was one of the first days of april , already hot , still fresh , that time of the year when the sun is so jaunty , the gardens around marius and cosette ’ s windows seemed visibly to be waking up , the hawthorn was about to break out , a jewelled array of wallflowers was spreading out over the old walls , pink snapdragons yawned in the cracks between the stones , lovely little daisies and buttercups were just starting to push up through the grass , white butterflies made their first appearance of the year , and the wind , that fiddler at life ’ s eternal wedding , tried out in the trees the first notes of that great dawn symphony the old poets used to call renewal—marius said to cosette : we said we ’ d go back and see our garden in the rue plumet
on the other hand , the two letters uf
dead if i fall , nabbed if i stay put
a bit of skirt
from the saint-jacques church ?
they said in the village : it ’ s clear the devil has made an appearance
the old man on the bed , apparently half-drunk , got off the pallet and staggered over with a road-mender ’ s hammer in his hand
he lapsed into silence , then went on : number number–number
the gentlemen of the jury will take this into account
the initial commotion caused by amazement gave way to a sepulchral silence
there are certain mechanical motions that come to us , even unwittingly , from our deepest thoughts
the ideal is terrifying to see thus lost in the depths , small , isolated , imperceptible , brilliant but surrounded by all those great black threats monstrously banked up around it ; yet no more in danger than a star in the gob of the clouds
when the earth is surfeited , there are mysterious wailings from the shadows that the abyss picks up
that evening , since he was forced to head out the following morning , he turned up at the distillery foreman ’ s and asked for his pay
he gave me you
the man with the buttoned-up coat walked to the very end of the embankment and stayed there a moment lost in thought , wildly clenching and unclenching his fists , his eyes darting about like a ferret ’ s
monsieur le duc d ’ angoulême , number one of his majesty charles ix ’ s bastards , got married when he was eighty-five to a ninny of fifteen ; when monsieur virginal , marquis d ’ alluye , brother of the cardinal de sourdis , archbishop of bordeaux , was eighty-three , he had a son with a chambermaid attached to president jacquin ’ s wife , a real love child who became a knight of maltanumber and a knighted councillor of state ; one of the great men of the century , the abbé taranbaud , is the son of a man who was eighty-seven years old at the time
the victim ’ s desperate bid to escape , far from exasperating thénardier , had calmed him down
brevet , said the president , you were sentenced for a heinous crime and you can not take the oath …
jean valjean was hungry and thirsty ; thirsty , especially ; and that place , like the sea , is full of water that can ’ t be drunk
he had lost them the way you lose your hankie
there was , during the first quarter of the current century , in montfermeil , near paris , a kind of greasy spoon that no longer exists today
it is hate without exception
the idea was this : it ’ s not yet midnight , the rue de l ’ homme-armé isn ’ t far , i ’ ll take the letter there right away and i ’ ll be back in plenty of timenumber
the horrifying no longer horrifies
so why did the aes- thetics of the animated image suddenly disable the viewer of silent films , rendering strangely deaf a person hi therto not deaf in the slightest ?
incorruptible by sacristans , by whippers-in , or by dancers ; this had something to do with his popularity with the bourgeoisie
as for the priests , these were the abbé halma , the same to whom monsieur larose , his collaborator at the foudre , said : bah !
we have actually seen a note addressed by the then-reigning pope , leo xii , number to one of his relatives , a monsignor in the nuncio ’ s residence in paris with the same name as himself , della genga ; in it can be read these lines : it appears that in a convent in paris there is an excellent gardener who is a saintly man , known as fauvent
apart from the political chitchat , the main topics of which were the spanish war and monsieur le duc d ’ angoulême , you could hear in the racket perfectly local brackets such as these : around nanterre and suresnes they ’ ve had a good yield of wine
what you are quietly drinking , mesdames , is madeira , don ’ t you know , from the coural das freiras vineyard , which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above sea level !
one day , at a liquor seller in the lenoir market , a man with a thick collar of a beard and an italian accent hopped up on a milestone and read out loud an odd text that seemed to emanate from some occult power
we ’ ve got the heart , but no work !
the mother obeyed and threw herself heavily onto one of the pallets
he reached the top of the ruin , straddled the wall like a horse , and firmly knotted the rope to the upper crosspiece of the window frame
remember the 'thousand hills radio ' of the great lakes region of africa calling rwandans to inter-ethnic genocide ?
his father himself was fading somewhat from his heart beneath the splendour of his love
it ’ s only natural that a man make a bit of a racket when he finds himself with individuals who don ’ t exactly inspire sufficient confidence
what was he to do ?
well , then , go you halves
the old man would taste its bitterness
he was wrong above all in playing this dreadful and puerile game of holding him by a thread at arm ’ s length and keeping him dangling , once he had found the scent again on the pont d ’ austerlitz
her heart gave a slight lurch , but she scarcely registered it , immediately distracted as she was by a kiss from marius
it is not known where jean valjean has hidden this sum since his return to toulon jail
well then , father , said marius
i ’ m going to try something
they are yours , jean valjean cut in
here he broke off , the pen fell from his fingers , one of those desperate sobs came over him that sometimes rose up from the very depths of his being , the poor man took his head in his hands and brooded
he was the only one to know about the secret trust
then , sobbing all the while , he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times as though patting seven heads at different heights and through this gesture you could guess that whatever it was he had done , he had done it to feed and clothe seven small children
father fauvent , i had you called
which was merely a perfectly logical consequence of the change that had been effected in him , a change in which everything revolved around his father
hens were scattering dust with their beaks
only the birds could see this curiosity
he had hold of both arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other
with the children dead , the endowment was buried
inspector javert , replied monsieur madeleine , the highest form of justice is one ’ s conscience
enjolras thought for a few seconds before making the gesture of a man who has made up his mind
and the very play of the junction and disjunction of exemplum and historia will , in the twentieth century , allow painting to play around with its ideological programmes
mademoiselle gillenormand , wise elder daughter that she was , managed to find a way of sparing the very best linen , while letting the old man think his wishes were respected
he had little love for his grandfather , whose frivolity and cynicism rubbed him the wrong way , and his heart was dark in relation to his father
these creatures belonged to that mongrel class composed of commoners who have risen and intelligent people who have fallen , which lies somewhere between the class known as middle and the class known as lower , and which combines some of the defects of the second with almost all the vices of the first , without having the generous impulse of the worker or the honest respectability of the bourgeois
it ’ s icicaille , said one
thénardier walked slowly round the table , opened the drawer , and took out the knife
the cannons were bogged right up to their hubs
but who cares , long live joy !
at night a dreamy vapour rose from the garden and enveloped it ; a shroud of mist , a calm celestial sadness covered it ; that intensely intoxicating smell of honeysuckle and wild morning glory wafted up on all sides like an exquisite and subtle poison ; you could hear the final calls of the tree creepers and the wagtails dozing off under the branches ; you could feel the sacred intimacy of bird and tree ; of a day , the wings rejoice the leaves , of a night , the leaves protect the wings
there had been many days of fasting
the tumultuous give-and-take of all these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl
only , he felt that , whatever side he opted for , necessarily and without his being able to escape it , something of himself would die ; that he was entering a tomb , and whether he took the left turn or the right , he would undergo the final agony of death , the demise of his happiness or the demise of his virtue
the most dissatisfied , the most irate , the most tremulous , embraced it
bruneseau held up his lantern and examined this shred
he had the reputation of not backing away from anything and it was known that he had one day , out of sheer bravado , done over a police station
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and , at the moment of taking the oath , she would say to the priest : monseigneur saint francis chucked it to monseigneur saint julien , monseigneur saint julien chucked it to monseigneur saint eusebius , monseigneur saint eusebius chucked it to monseigneur saint procopius , etc , etc , just as i chuck it to you , father
it ’ s funny how you can suffer like that
when the little nipper ’ s fierce clamour got too much : your son ’ s squealing , thénardier would say
the insurgents had also been careful not to light any light in the upstairs rooms
now and then the young villain , vigorous and deft , thrashed around like an animal caught in a trap
no porte cochère could have been more ordinary , half a century ago , than the porte cochère of no
be serious , said enjolras
catholic spain was more roman than rome itself
i have to confess i have not always loved you ; forgive me , please
these men , grouped together under various names but who could all go under the generic title of socialists , tried to drill through this rock and make the fresh running water of human felicity gush forth
would jean valjean be allowed to be stronger than the entire social order , to be free and he , javert , continue to eat the government ’ s bread !
was she expecting a visit ?
if one of my subordinates had done to me what i ’ ve done to you i would have declared him unworthy of the service and sent him packing
i am well and truly riled
self-interest , that ’ s man ’ s purpose in life
i ’ m suffocating just thinking about it
he himself did not really know
how come monsieur madeleine had managed to get in , with the walls that were there ?
someone ’ s gone to get one , replied a peasant
we don ’ t want any more of this rue de l ’ homme-armé
oysters , cheese , and ham , said laigle
the man went on
in number , there was only one nun left of the whole order ; today , the only thing left is a doll
next to the rights of man , or at least alongside them , there are the rights of the soul
well , go back all the same to the inn and take a fresh horse
the entire column was now no more than a projectile , the force gathered to crush the english crushed the french , the inexorable ravine could not surrender until it was filled , riders and horses rolled into it pell-mell , grinding each other , forming one flesh in this gulf , and when the pit was full of men still alive , they marched over them and the remainder followed suit
i put the rags in a basket , the scraps in a tub , the linen in me cupboard , the woolens in me chest of drawers , the old papers in a corner of the window , anything worth eating in me bowl , the bits of glass in the fireplace , the old shoes behind the door , and the bones under me bed
the voice that had called marius through the dying light to the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie sounded to him like the voice of destiny
at the same time that tired people demand rest , established facts demand guarantees
but there ’ s a better way and that ’ s gribeauval ’ s movable star
we ’ ve brought his son home for him
and then again , cosette , in whom the woman was beginning to dawn , was thrilled to be a baroness
hear me out , for i have the prudence of amphiaraüsnumber and the baldness of caesar
where , oh where have you gone ,
jean valjean ripped up his own shirt , bandaged the wounds as best he could and staunched the flowing blood ; then , bending over the still-unconscious and almost unbreathing marius in the twilit gloom , he glared at him with inexpressible hatred
he thought it might be useful to open it , for it might well contain the girls ’ address , if in fact it belonged to them , or at least the information necessary to restore it to whoever had lost it
in spite of the murmurs of protest , enjolras put his veto on the fifteen bottles and , so that no one would touch them and to make them more or less sacrosanct , he had them put under the table where old father mabeuf was lying
you can ’ t do that
fancy living in the mountains and not even having streetlamps !
marius had two reasons for clearing out so swiftly
no doubt he was off to sit for some exam
to have done all he had done only to come to this !
there were five missives , five tales , five names , five signatures , and a single signatory
normally it ends in the ocean that is revolution
and to the man with the cudgel : hello , babet
the ciceronian period , number barely adequate on the subject of verres , would lose its edge on caligula
what a turnup for the books !
the compression caused by the panthéon obliterated in this way , a century ago , a section of the vaults of montagne sainte-geneviève
no one knew who he was
but how in god ’ s name did you get here ?
please , my sweet marius , let me stay here with the two of you
in the face of those two lines , he felt a horrible giddiness ; he remained for a moment apparently crushed by the emotional shift that was happening inside him , he looked at marius ’ s note in a sort of drunken stupor ; he had before his eyes that splendour , the death of the hated being
the hour , the place , these memories of youth recalled , a few stars starting to twinkle in the sky , the funereal repose of those deserted streets , the imminence of the inexorable adventure gearing up , gave a pathetic charm to these lines murmured softly in the twilight by jean prouvaire , who , as we said before , was a very gentle poet
i tell you , the deal can ’ t fail , the long-haired one resumed
but this laboured breathing scarcely ruffled the ineffable serenity that was spread over her face , transfiguring her in her sleep
i said : hold on , i ’ ve got my little cosette at hand , i ’ ll give her to him , then he ’ ll have to love me a little , or tell me why not
you know the promise i made to you and i will keep it
it seems that , the very day he made his obscure entry into the small town of montreuil-sur-mer , as night was closing in on a cold december day , with a knapsack on his back and a thorn stick in his hand , a great fire had just broken out in the community hall
they could hop down into the well , too , and search it
the sheet of paper monsieur madeleine was holding slipped out of his hands , he looked up and , firmly holding javert ’ s eyes , he said in an indescribable tone : ah !
two or three times
except for genius , there was something of danton in cournet ; except for divinity , there was something of hercules in danton
he goes out in the rain , he walks in the water , he travels in winter
it was , indeed , a man who went past jean valjean ’ s room , this time without stopping
vintage clothes are all the rage , and the young women of my dotage dress like the old women of my childhood
he added that some kind of compensation was due to him
while he spoke , jondrette was looking away from monsieur leblanc , who was watching him closely
and i tell them : look at her
every pocket of the redingote seemed to hold supplies for use in unexpected emergencies
a convict , for god ’ s sake !
at the same moment , a tiny oblong parcel wrapped in blue paper fell from a coat pocket
and he added , fixing the conventionist with his eye : what about louis xvii ? number
after a moment , he asked : where do you live , little girl ?
madame victurnien spends thirty-five francs on morality
in normal times , to dissolve an anachronism and make it vanish , you only have to get it to spell out the year of our lord
he might have been around forty-six or forty-eight
i was at waterloo , you hear !
inseparable from the suicidal state of representa- tive democracies , the art of the twentieth century has never ceased dangerously anticipating - or at least
cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark
the son , too , had got there too late
it was thought they got together to thrash things out in a cabaret close to the point of saint-eustachenumber a man named aug—— , head of the tailors ’ benevolent society , rue mondétour , was thought to act as principal intermediary between the leaders and the faubourg saint-antoine
jean valjean ’ s footsteps made more of a noise than usual through the rooms
murder is even more of a crime here than elsewhere ; we are under the eye of the revolution , we are the priests of the republic , we are the sacramental hosts of duty and no one must be able to vilify our struggle
her lips responded to one man and her eyes responded to the other
can ’ t a person be forgiven for refusing in the end ?
so , our troubles are over !
the government got word one day that weapons had just been handed out in the faubourg along with two hundred thousand cartridges
what door did he decide to open ?
when he got back to his humble abode , which he fondly called his palace , he said to his sister , i ’ ve just been officiating pontifically
the little tramp—the gamin de paris—is the giant city ’ s dwarfnumber
yet javert sank a few questions , like probes , into thénardier ’ s story
he pulled his hands away
the worthy fruit-hawker had put a hundred questions to her without getting more for an answer than the same mournful glance
his aide-de-camp , gordon , had just fallen by his side
it sometimes happens that , from the depths of their anguish , their discouragement , their privation , their feverishness , their distress , their rankness , their ignorance , their darkness , that great desperado , the rabble , protests—even against principles , even against liberty , equality , and fraternity , even against universal elevation , even against the rule of all by all—and the plebs do battle with the people
in the united states , to take one example , the torturing of the human body by sharp instruments seems to have become the preferred image of advertising , accord- ing to the wall street journal of may
the faces of the men were the colour of dirt
to continue his voyage
darkness blankets those doomed civilizations
driver , he said , rue de l ’ homme-armé , number seven
it ’ s in that room that i nail the coffin
you don ’ t need me any more , men ?
till now , i ’ ve been thinking only of myself !
there was a noise at the door
you ’ ve got a wife who loves you
just as he was about to turn the corner into the rue plumet , he heard someone say quite close to him : good evening , monsieur marius
when his eyes were full to brimming , his tears ran down his livid cheeks and he said , almost stammering , in a low voice , to himself , his eyes lost in the depths : o you !
a huge cart was crossing the seine at the same time he was , going over to the right bank just as he was
and the sergeant ventured out of the station soundlessly
but what is this 'situation ' concealing if not the contraction of time ?
monsieur gillenormand ’ s garb was not the attire of louis xv , or even the attire of louis xvi ; it was the flamboyant getup of the incroyables , number those young dandy reactionaries of the directoire
at night , going to bed , i finded [ sic ] three angels lying on my bed , one at the foot , two at the head , the good virgin mary in the middle , who said to me to be going to bed , and don ’ t worry about nothing
at one point they were caught between two volleys of shot and copped the volley from the field gun en batterie which , the gunners not having any orders , had kept firing without interruption
very well , cosette replied
they ’ re not here anymore , replied jean valjean
he pulled her up : call me jean
where have all the beautiful girls gone ,
he had a real following toward the close of the last reign
didn ’ t he have another goal , a big one , the true one ?
i ’ d be like mademoiselle thingummy !
all kinds of phantoms haunt these long lonely passages ; everywhere putrefaction and miasma ; here and there a vent through which villon on the inside chats with rabelaisnumber on the outside
and after the police ?
further bad luck was to ensue
you are among the blessed
i ’ ve spent the night trying to persuade myself to do just that ; you are hearing my confession , and what i have come to tell you is so extraordinary that you have a right to hear it ; so , yes , i spent the night coming up with reasons , i came up with some very good reasons , i did all i could , naturally
i ’ m very pretty this morning
nobody had been able to give him any news of thénardier ; he was thought to have gone abroad
the marquis turned to him and said sharply , monseigneur , i have my own poor
argus snored all nightnumber
as for the fifty francs , she had taken them from a fund monsieur madeleine had entrusted to her for alms for the poor and for the relief of workers and which she did not have to account for
he was chirpy and gentle when he wanted to be
each square was a volcano attacked by a swarming cloud ; lava did battle with lightning
you could still see on the roof of the hôtel de cluny ’ s octagonal tower the little clapboard shed that had served as an observatory to messier , number naval astronomer to louis xvi
for some years , the romanian government had encouraged the spread of these apparatuses , which were supposed to allow their compatriots to busy themselves quietly recording their small private pleasures
the whole barricade had come running , then all had lined up in a circle at a distance , feeling it impossible to utter a word in the face of what they were about to see
he turned and a shaft of moonlight lit his face side-on and jean valjean recognized old fauchelevent
at filspierre ’ s they found cartridges and weapons
everything concurred in the tragic majesty of this supreme moment ; a thousand mysterious roaring sounds in the air , the breath of the armed masses set in motion in streets that could not be seen , the intermittent galloping of cavalry , the heavy rattling of artillery on the move , platoon fire and cannon fire crossing each other in the labyrinth of paris , the smoke from the battle rising all golden above the rooftops , unidentifiable , vaguely terrible cries in the distance , lightning flashes of menace everywhere , the tocsin of saint-merry that now sounded like sobbing , the sweetness of the season , the splendour of the sky full of sun and clouds , the beauty of the day , and the appalling silence of the houses
the two women occupied the upper storey
there were only two ways out
they were riveted in and they were left there
ah , right , you ’ re having a laugh
he had been a buffoon at bobèche ’ s and a clown at bobino ’ snumber he had played vaudeville at saint-mihiel
are we really going to die like this without eating ?
he was following a broad paved roadway between two rows of trees , which undulated over hills that rolled along , one after the other , lifting the road up and letting it fall , like enormous waves
night comes bearing down and he has been swimming for hours , his strength is almost gone ; the ship , that distant speck where once there were men , has faded from view ; he is alone in the dreadful crepuscular gulf , he goes under , he is getting stiff , he thrashes around , he feels the monstrous waves of the invisible below him , he calls out
not a truer word was spoken
she ’ s going to walk past !
evening had come ; night had almost closed in ; there was now only one small spot lit by the dying sun in all the endless sky , and that was the moon
his heart broke at that point and he burst into tears
she stuttered , pale as anything , red as anything , wanting to throw herself into marius ’ s arms yet not daring to , ashamed to love openly in front of all these people
and a shiver ran down his spine
then they barricaded the window downstairs and they held at the ready the iron crossbars that served to bar the tavern door from the inside at night
the bell warns them
each one has two bullets
the situation was appalling
that was their first tiff
once he got excited , he erupted , a sort of gaiety accentuated his enthusiasm and he was both laughing and lyrical : let ’ s not insult the gods , he was saying
i ’ m the gravedigger from the convent
a voice burst out in the smog , sharply cut off by another voice
on the long trip to cherbourg , charles x , having a round table cut into a square table , number seemed more worried about imperiled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy
not long after the date of the letter quoted above , the bishop did something , if the entire village is to be believed , even more risky than the trip through the mountains held by the bandits
a bourgeois looked like a flower , a marquis looked like a gem
below the lowest of men comes the convict
you follow discipline , you ’ re a slave to orders , you ’ re a man of scruple and duty ; you ’ d never leave your family in the lurch to go gallivanting about with some shameless creature
god knows better than we do what we need
the baby ’ s gone , my lady , what will i do ?
marius was now a handsome young man of medium height , with thick , jet black hair , a high , intelligent forehead , passionate flaring nostrils , a candid and calm look , and with something hard to define that was at once arrogant , thoughtful , and innocent shining from every pore
feeling himself to be unloved , he did not feel love , either
cosette paid attention to her toilette
whoever picks it up and breaks it open finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in the courtyard
the grandeurs of despair
the petrified look on the two nippers ’ faces made it necessary to give them a shock
the battle line wiggles and snakes around like a thread , trails of blood stream illogically , the fronts of the armies undulate , regiments coming in or leaving form capes and gulfs
messieurs , asked the porter , what is it you want ?
if he felt like staying home : perfect
on top of this , jean valjean knew that he had been delivered from javert
there are gusts of wind that speak more distinctly than others
if he ’ s a half-wit , it ’ s none of your business
just be happy , that ’ s all i ask
i ’ d like to see monsieur madeleine
what dangers you run , o noble souls !
he placed the sheet of paper in front of monsieur leblanc
there are encounters that bind us , there are random events that drive us to do our duty
one of the guards , who had a hook on the end of his club , made a show of stirring this pile of human refuse now and then
there are miraculous relationships between beings and things ; in this inexhaustible whole , from sun to aphid , no one looks down on anyone else ; everyone needs each other
but on the night of june number–number , they stripped the dead clean
what did they care ?
it appears she ’ s dying
that is exactly what happened
all of a sudden , he heard a voice that seemed to come from the street and that cried through the trees : monsieur marius !
finally , he hung his head , sighed in anguish , dropped his arms to his side and retraced his steps
there ’ s nothing wrong with my hand , he said
here we find the same line of thought as rene gimpel 's - only , deformed by the canadian socio- logist 's media-haunted ideology
he had got through the worst of it ; the defile was opening out a little before him
to see your father
i ’ d like to see that one
and now suddenly her mirror was chiming in with jean valjean and telling her : no , you ’ re not !
he refused the cross , he handed out sous to all the little beggars he met
it also felt as though he ’ d gone deaf in one minute flat
he still yearned to see her again , but he no longer hoped to
who ’ s to say i ’ m not a murderer ?
unlike moholy- nagy , who was already making tele-paint- ings twenty years earlier using the crank phone to issue instructions at a distance to a sign painter
the constitutionnel was constitutionalnumber the minervenumber spelled chateaubriand chateaubriant , like the steak , and that final t gave the bourgeoisie a lot of laughs at the great writer ’ s expense
and what if there had been someone else there !
let the peasant smock out a little at the seams and you have your monk ’ s frock
yet it remains a riot
jean valjean turned to face the man and said quickly in a voice no louder than a whisper : give me three days !
he pointed monsieur fauchelevent out to gavroche
there were stone benches here and there that looked black with moss
his indifference was loving
he was soon knee-deep in sludge and more than knee-deep in water
he himself took the letter to the post office in montreuil-sur-mer the following morning
some of his father ’ s old generals and old comrades had invited him , when they found out who he was , to come and see them , and monsieur marius had not refused
this was where they conferred
he was transported , trembling , panting ; suddenly , without knowing himself what had got into him and what impulse he was obeying , he stood up , stretched both arms out the window , stared into the darkness , the silence , tenebrous infinity , the eternal immensity , and he shouted : long live the emperor !
the man spotted one night by boulatruelle was jean valjean
i mean a horse that can do twenty leagues in a day
the poor little girl was passive and kept her mouth shut
the officer murmured , for there was still agony in his voice : who won the battle ?
it ’ s a love letter !
cosette , the time has come to tell you your mother ’ s name
he didn ’ t answer my question
thénardier pulled the trigger
would you like some german ?
the misery of a child is of interest to a mother , the misery of a young man is of interest to a young girl , the misery of an old man is of interest to nobody
and then , we insist , studying social deformities and infirmities and identifying them in order to cure them is not a job where choice is allowed
such attacks of justness and goodness are not given to vulgar natures
only , as he knew no one and could not spray his cards around to any porters , he stuck them in his pocket
here grantaire , after this fit of eloquence , had a well-earned fit of coughing
what do you expect me to do ?
the door shut again and darkness returned
but when he saw the wealthy manufacturer madeleine going off to the seven o ’ clock mass , he smelled a potential future candidate and resolved to outdo him ; he took on a jesuit confessor and went to high mass and to vespers
there was talk of a bad-looking prowler ; of how a dubious-looking tramp had popped up out of nowhere and was lurking in town somewhere and how you wouldn ’ t want to run into him in a dark alley if you were foolish enough to come home late that night
he straightened up and twisted round and rooted himself firmly on that support in a kind of fit of fury
the gravedigger ’ s a drunk and a friend of mine
fantine ’ s daughter was there
he accepted the commission , saying : just as you like , auntie
a phenomenon frequently observed
no , answered the porter
the old woman who had given her what we might call lessons in the art of poverty was a pious old maid named marguerite , who was devout in the good sense of the term , poor and charitable toward the poor and even toward the rich , and who knew just enough to be able to sign margeritte , and believed in god , which is the trick
the prime equality is equity
anyone who has leafed through old folios knows that in number , martin verga founded a bernardine-benedictine congregation , with the headquarters of the order at salamanca and a branch church at alcala
jean valjean did not move a muscle
so , the self-same night that petit-gavroche had picked up the two stray boys , brujon and gueulemer , who knew that babet had escaped that very morning and was waiting for them in the street along with montparnasse , quietly got out of bed and started to drill through the chimney flue that their beds touched with the nail brujon had found
a few drops of water , more or less , brought napoléon to his knees
during the afternoon that followed javert ’ s visit , monsieur madeleine went to see fantine as usual
cosette persisted , adding in a barely audible voice , hoarse with anguish : but he even drank a lot !
he ’ s fixed up all his charities
all that exists now being one great carnival , there is no carnival anymore
events and people were put on trial there
even the bridge over the durance at château-arnouxnumber can barely take a bullock-drawn cart

he fixed a piercing eye on the stranger
the reduction of the universe to one single being , the expansion of one single being into god : that is what love is

these two beings , pure as spirits , told each other everything , their dreams , their euphorias , their ecstasies , their fantasies , their weaknesses , how they had adored each other from afar , how they had longed for each other , their despair when they no longer saw each other

now your work is mine
the third station , the one from seven o ’ clock in the evening , between la belle-alliance and la haie-sainte , is frightening ; still there today , it is a rather high mound behind which the guards had massed on a reverse slope of the plain

was there a voice that whispered in his ear that he had just passed the most solemn moment of his destiny , that there was no longer a middle course for him ; that from now on , he would either be the best of men or he would be the worst of men ; that he now had to rise higher , so to speak , than the bishop or fall even lower than the galley slave ; that if he wanted to be good , he had to be an angel ; that if he wanted to stay bad , he had to be a monster from hell ?

once more he crossed the place du châtelet diagonally , regained the quai , and went back with automatic precision to the very spot he had left a quarter of an hour earlier ; he leaned there and found himself again in the same position on the same flagstone of the parapet
in prison , where fresh misdemeanors had led him once more , he had become some sort of gatekeeper

any badly thought-out attempt , any clumsy bid to assist , any wrong move could easily finish him off
big booming voice , but a good old fellow with it
to put the infinite below in touch with the infinite above , in thought—this is what we call prayer
the superb thing that england had going for it there , whether it likes it or not , was itself—not its captain , its army
nihilism has nowhere to go
like all children who , like the young tendrils of a vine , cling to everything , she had tried to love
she spent nights crying and worrying
père-lachaise , and don ’ t spare the horses !
and everyone bolted their doors as fast as they could
but the english looked irremediably weakened
the other one replied : i saw
the dampness of the stones and the sliminess of the floor meant they were useless as supports , for either hands or feet
it is dark in misfortune , it is darker still in crime ; these two darknesses together compose slang
the former convict brevet was wearing the black and grey jacket of the state penitentiaries
one day the boarders managed to steal this book and began to race through it avidly , their reading often interrupted by fear of being caught , which made them keep swiftly banging the volume shut
reinforced as he was , the very idea of resistance was out of the question , no matter how energetic or vigorous or desperate jean valjean might be
calm down , pet , she said
but the pressure of the incomprehensible , the incontestable , was so great he felt his skull cracking open
he hated wellington with a straightforward hate that pleased the masses ; and for seventeen years , scarcely paying any attention to intermediate events , he had magnificently maintained his sadness over waterloo
although he was poor , he had had the talent to amass , through patience , self-denial , and time , a precious collection of rare editions in all genres
the man headed for the inn , which was the best in the district
what you feel in those places , as we have shown with marius—and we will see the consequences—is both larger and smaller than life
with her hideous hands !
all the miasmas of the cloaca blend into the air the city breathes—hence its bad breath
azelma listened to éponine in wonder
this name , spoken in this tone , at this dark hour , in this unknown place , by this unknown man , made jean valjean jump back
not seeing people allows you to think of them as perfect in all kinds of ways
i just don ’ t get it
gavroche called out to him : come and join us , young man !
the right wing , as charras says , number was pulled back behind the centre
i ’ ve just thought of something
the staircase has two sections ; the english , besieged on the stairs and huddled on the steps at the top , cut away the lower steps , and these big slabs of bluestone form a heap in among the nettles
well , cosette , mother thénardier crooned in a voice that was dripping with the bitter honey of the spiteful woman , aren ’ t you going to take your doll ?
the gardener answered , his shovel over his shoulder , and in the most placid tone : it ’ s the riots
now , god can sign me out
anyone who saw me now would think something terrible had happened , for heaven ’ s sake !
the inventory of fixtures we are drawing up here is rigorously exact and will certainly stir up very precise memories in the minds of former residents of the quartier
at the corner of the street they stopped and engaged in this puzzling dialogue in muted voices :
there ’ s been a change of program
you hardly notice , an hour after a storm , that the beautiful bright day earlier shed tears
fissures then open into chasms
he calls and calls
he then returned to the mairie and was seen by the office boy there to examine carefully a road map of france that was hanging in his room
what an even greater thing , to love !
it occurred to him to look over the wall
and he added in a whisper : take a good look at him , woman !
the outside talus offered an inclined plane for the assailants to walk up
he had the courage to stick his forehead against the glass and watch to see if the thing moved
he put the wallet in his coat and then he called gavroche
they had not even spotted grantaire and the sergeant was getting ready to repeat the order : take aim !
to the great surprise of his observer , the hounded man did not take the ramp to the watering place
adonaïs passes through on his twelve-wheeled chariot of thunder and lightning ; silenus makes his entrance on his donkey
poor horse , sighed fantine
you ’ ve won over my grandfather , you go together well
from the dormer window on the third floor , the death ’ s head watched them steadily
don ’ t you go spending that hundred-sou piece
it seemed to him that somebody could see him
hence visions , suppositions , conjectures , novels sketched out , adventures yearned for , fantastic constructions , whole edifices built in the inner darkness of the mind , sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find their dwelling place as soon as the floodgates are opened and they are allowed inside
we ’ ll take the cart for the republic and we ’ ll leave the auvergnat to his monarchy
there is not one metaphor , not one etymological derivation of slang that does not contain a lesson
and he yelled at monsieur leblanc : jesus wept !
bahorel , about to retort to bossuet , had been taking up a favourite pose
i think i ’ d have done better to skip the onions
the expression in the eyes of this eight-year-old child was normally so forlorn and sometimes so tragic that it seemed , at certain moments , that she was in the process of turning into an idiot or a demon
gavroche , who was anything but discreet , listened in
madame magloire knew exactly what he was getting at , turned on her heel without a word , and a moment later the three extra place settings required by the bishop were gleaming on the tablecloth , symmetrically arranged in front of each of the three guests
courfeyrac had a father who was known as monsieur de courfeyrac
would you like my hat ?
from that point in time , anyone who wanted to see it needed to be quick about it
since he did not know the streets , he struck out again at random
and he barricaded himself away from everybody , the king included , if it came to that
monsieur le maire , for the good of the service , make an example of me
the poor old soul was a virgin
the victim of an assassination who gets away is more suspect than the assassin ; and it is likely that this character , such a precious haul for the bandits , was no less a good catch for the authorities
the plateau of mont-saint-jean was taken , taken back , taken again
their innocent faces shone in ravishment ; perfume wafting from a flowering shrub nearby sent fragrant emanations out to passersby , but it seemed to come from the little girls
well then , let him keep going
the reason is that right is , in fact , indestructible
i thought it must be romainville ( why romainville ?
the king has roquelaure , the people have paillassenumber the clown
as we just said , nobody knows
one morning , several days later , they were both sitting on the garden steps in bright sunshine—another infringement of the rules jean valjean seemed to impose , and of the habit of keeping to her room that sadness had caused cosette to adopt
we all have our quirks ; i would have liked to have got as far as dawn
the war of number , an attack on the generous spanish nation , was thus at the same time an attack on the french revolution
another one of your funny ideas !
exelmansnumber left the cortège
this word , which blazes along on all four feet , sums up in masterly onomatopoeia the whole of la fontaine ’ snumber wonderful line :
it is remarkable that éponine did not speak a word of slang
the wisest , the calmest , the deepest , set about slowly deciphering it , and when they finally turn up with their text , the job has long been done ; there are already twenty translations in the marketplace
he felt emptied , useless , cut off from his past life , demoted , dissolved
thénardier , knife in hand , was working out what to do
two of me would be better
he was able to take in his situation more and more
to such people , everything is hostile and suspect
but the others had stayed there
a sapper was backed up against a tall chimney stack and he looked to be there as a sentinel
the lower town , where he lived , had only one school , a nasty shack that was falling to ruins ; he had built two schools , one for girls , the other for boys
for such a light to go out was , of course , impossible
you would have said he looked like an old private tutor from a good house back home from the emigration
there was another silence
marius stammered : what does this mean ?
as he did so , his little boy ’ s face , at once so cheeky and serious , so mobile and so deep , so chirpy and so harrowing , reproduced all the grimaces of an old man that signify : ah , bah !
those rare dreamers , mysterious priests of the beautiful , who compare all things to perfection , would have glimpsed the sacred antique harmony in this little working-class miss through the transparency of parisian grace
that campaign over , having , as he said , made a bundle , he had opened a pothouse in montfermeil
to do the same trip ?
jean valjean did not answer
fauchelevent looked at the stranger
begin by telling me one thing
driver , he said , hôtel de la porte saint-jacques
they ’ re all at it
a low rush of whispering could be heard from the barricade , similar to the muttering of a hurrying priest whipping off a quick prayer
the animal alone acted
at intervals , the cry of a very young child , who was somewhere in the house , broke through the ambient noise of the tavern
i got them , replied fantine
but the boy had followed it with his eyes , and saw what happened
two swans meeting on the jungfraunumber
the cart driver was german and didn ’ t understand
here , marius , feel how cold his hand is !
in all that was recounted earlier , the reader no doubt recognized jean valjean even before thénardier did
but he would have had to open the window and he did not dare
you ask me why i ’ m speaking out ?
the barrière du maine , replied enjolras
since then he had made unbelievable efforts to pick up the scent and track him down in the black pit of misery where thénardier had disappeared
not on your nelly !
a veteran of the neighbouring barracks , peering through the fence , said : here ’ s spring in full dress , shouldering arms
who is to blame ?
those words brought fauchelevent completely back to reality , and to its urgency
why do you say vous to me ?
the crown prosecutor put him on notice that he would be prosecuted for illegal wearing of said decoration
at the end of the street , which was incredibly short , he found the way barred on the les halles side by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a dead end if he did not see , to right and left , two black trenches down which he could escape
it teaches us to separate the task of the historian ( doing history ) from the ideological mirage according to which mankind or the masses would supposedly make history
a young man like you should have nice stuff
you could see daylight through his bones , but nothing in his eyes
you can be immortal and lame ; witness vulcannumber you can be more than man and less than man
when it comes to distress and intelligence it is especially dangerous for the two extremes to meet
wherever she went , you felt the chill
and that ’ s the reason caesar dies
there was music there and dancing
the ventriloquist ’ s voice sang this couplet :
here is the note :
he was falling apart yet blooming
this speech released everyone ’ s thinking from the painful cloud of individual anguish
she would not have understood and she would have replied : how can i be blamed for something i can ’ t help and that i know nothing about ?
the horse ’ s trot , the harness bells , the wheels on the pavement , made a soft monotonous sound
miracles spring from graves
i ’ ve been in the clink
still singing , the child paused now and then to play jacks with a few coins he was carrying—his entire fortune , probably
she turned toward him with a stunned look
ravined , jagged , serrated , snarled , crenellated by an immense rip , buttressed by piles that were themselves bastions , thrusting out jutting headlands here and there , and powerfully backed by the two great promontories of the faubourg houses , it loomed like a cyclopean levee at the far end of the fearful square that witnessed july number nineteen barricades rose up in tiers throughout the dense streets behind this mother barricade
jean prouvaire was in love , cultivated a flower in a pot , played the flute , wrote poetry , loved the people , pitied womankind , wept for children , confused god and the future in the same trusting attitude , and blamed the revolution for having caused a royal head to roll , that of andré chéniernumber his voice was usually soft but would suddenly become manly
do you have a room ?
you ’ re not leaving us again
wait till there ’ s some action
it was at this point that she began to fall behind in payments to the thénardiers
will you open up , yes or no ?
since you need two hands to fold the letter , give it to me , i ’ ll fold it
so marius saw them practically every day , at the same time , for the first year
there , profound peace , absolute silence , night
in the dark it would have been hard to work out what this piece of iron was made for
and once they agreed on a price with the donkey man , they rode back via vanves and issy
a breath , almost like sighing , stirred the undergrowth
he had not seen him when he arrived
so it was you we bumped into last night when we were going past
the completion and self-elimination of art go together , because it is the very particularity of history as a fate-dealing power that , in it , any existing form aims for a completion that is identical to its own elimination
the old man turned to the boy
he straightened up and called out to the young man in the cabriolet : monsieur marius pontmercy !
listen , madeleine went on
i don ’ t need a father anymore !
it ’ s all even lighter wines than around here
little gavroche marched at the head singing this song at the top of his lungs , like a kind of bugler
he went home on foot , at midnight , in driving rain
then she saw something the like of which she had never seen even in the darkest days of her fever
he remembered the mothers of others but forgot his own
let ’ s not let ourselves be caught short
others were as public as possible and you can judge how reckless this was by this fragment of a statement submitted in one of the subsequent trials : where was the meeting held ?
if he let go ?
the second article , a bit more detailed , is taken from the journal de paris , same date
really , no one would guess your age
as we said earlier , the current network is no less than sixty leagues long
one shot in the air , at the ceiling , it doesn ’ t matter where
her whole person , pervaded by the joys of youth , by innocence and beauty , breathed a splendid melancholy
and what if the fourteenth of july did cost twenty million ?
the cause of all of this adolescent ’ s assaults was the desire to look slick and expensive
when he did so , his aim was infallible and it frightened people
and then , right bank , left bank , on the quais , along the boulevards , in the quartier latin , in the quartier around les halles , breathless men , workers , students , sectionaries , read proclamations and cried : to arms !
enjolras answered in a vibrant and haughty tone : french revolution
the city streets flooded with lights , green branches hanging over the doorsteps , the nations like sisters , men just , old men blessing children , the past loving the present , thinkers enjoying complete liberty , believers enjoying complete equality , for religion the sky , god a priest needing no intermediary , human conscience once more an altar , no more hatred , the fraternity of workshop and school , notoriety as penalty enough and as reward , work for all ; for all , the law , over all , peace , no more bloodshed , no more wars , mothers happy !
javert answered : take your revenge
all the problems that the socialists listed , aside from cosmogonic visions , dreams , and mysticism , can be reduced to two main problems :
she was indeed pretty
i ’ m here to help you
it adapts to its divine labour , without being put off , both the man who bounded over the alps and the poor doddering old invalid of father élyséenumber it makes use of the gout sufferer as it does of the conqueror ; the conqueror outside france , the gout sufferer inside
everybody ’ s kicked me out
plenty of fusils bearing the numbers of legions , not many hats , no cravats , lots of bare arms , a few pikes
there is only one thing left for you to do and that is to think of her so unwaveringly that she is forced to think of you
these two walls had been built by two men , one named cournet , the other barthélemynumber cournet made the barricade saint-antoine ; barthélemy the barricade du temple
he looked at the cloud
he refused to go and gawknumber at the emperor as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and declined to prescribe public prayers in his diocese for him during the hundred days
he felt a kind of religious horror at letting that shade into cosette ’ s thoughts and wheeling in the dead woman as a third party in their shared destiny
thénardier could smell that javert was still around ; a watched man has a scent that does not let him down ; he had to throw the bloodhound a bone
ten years ago , i didn ’ t know she existed
god , it ’ s as easy as winking to be good , the hard thing is to be just
marius stared at him : i know your extraordinary secret , just as i knew the name jean valjean , just as i know your name
and on that altar and in that glory , the two apotheoses merging , somewhere in the background , who knows how—perhaps behind a cloud for cosette , in a blaze for marius—there lay the ideal thing , the real thing , the rendezvous of the kiss and the dream , the nuptial pillow
no , god thought the same as you and i did , and he doesn ’ t change his mind
these instances of resemblance between the sewer and remorse had a good side ; they were warnings ; very badly received warnings , though , with the city fuming over its sludge having such gall and not accepting that what you dump can come back to haunt you
every revolution , being an ordinary achievement , contains within itself its legitimacy , which false revolutionaries sometimes dishonour , but which persists , even when sullied , which survives , even when soaked with blood
all in the name of freedom of expression , a freedom contemporary with the terrorist politics joseph goebbels described as 'the art of making
a cab rolls in english and yelps like a mutt in slang
he was enjoying the collapse of all his past pain and he was full of optimism
a general , said thénardier , lifting his head
as wood is very dear in digne , he ’ d had the bright idea of dividing the cow stable with a partition made of wooden boards and that way creating a sealed compartment for himself
paris wakes up , rubs its eyes , and says : what an idiot i am !
we just saw the head of the procession go by , joly and i
this reminded marius of what the poor sorry creature had come to his room for
sometimes the sewer of paris took it upon itself to overflow , as though this undervalued nile was suddenly rocked by anger
they were alone in the garden
but one day , his own strange manner appeared to attract monsieur madeleine ’ s attention
you look most dashing , my lord
precisely at that double no
under the folds of this veil of smoke , and thanks to his smallness , he was able to advance a fair way into the street without being seen
too bad about the crowd !
by her side , the water swirling in the bucket made circles that looked like snakes of white fire
is monsieur able to receive monsieur marius ?
do you know what ’ s at stake here ?
there ’ s plenty to fight against , don ’ t you think ?
bonaparte fallen seemed taller than napoléon on his feet
was it true that a former crook , buckled under the weight of his convictions , could straighten out and end up being in the right ?
the nocturnal rustling of the forest enveloped her completely
all the friends of the abc had gone , each on his way to his own task
no , it ’ s not , said jean valjean
when she heard her husband ’ s step , she turned over and said : you know i ’ m kicking cosette out the door tomorrow
paris is athens , rome , sybaris , jerusalem , pantin
large sums passed through his hands , but nothing could make him change his style of life in the slightest or get him to embellish his spartan existence by the faintest touch of the superfluous
it ’ s got no heart , that cold fish of a barber , he growled
their tendency toward putrescence is obvious , their stagnation is unhealthy , their fermentation makes people feverish and enfeebles them ; their proliferation turns into a biblical plague
this was done automatically , as a duty , and even with a certain gruffness on jean valjean ’ s part
one evening when jean valjean was passing by that way , without cosette , he saw the beggar at his usual spot under the lamp that had just been lit
the vocal mothers conferred together after each confession and inflicted the penance out loud
there was the ravine , unexpected , yawning , right at the horses ’ hooves , two fathoms deep between its twin banks
i ’ d go mad first , i ’ d die , i ’ d get sick , i ’ d throw myself in the river
the wounded were laid out on these mattresses
to be a vice and turn into a hand !
from the barricade , which he was still fairly close to , no one dared yell out to him to come back for fear of calling attention to him
ecclesiastes says : number all is vanity
certain nocturnal wading birds make similar silhouettes in the wetlands
the bourgeois is a miser , his wife is a prude ; your century is dire
that ’ s it , old street , said gavroche
he made it to paris
never expose yourself again to having your fellow man struck off
the minute he reminded him that his infamy deprived him of the right to take the oath , chenildieu raised his head and looked straight at the audience
as they left the theatre , he refused to look at the garter of a pretty milliner who was leaping over a gutter and when courfeyrac said , i wouldn ’ t mind adding that piece to my collection , he was very nearly appalled
that one ’ s a ninny , all right , said gavroche
when you do , it gives you untold joy
weave and twist them together and it is monumental ; it is attila hesitating between marcian in the east and valentinian in the west ; hannibal hanging back in capua ; danton falling asleep at arcis-sur-aubenumber
sinks and sewers played a great role in the middle ages , in the late roman empire , and in the ancient orient
so , he said , my mind ’ s made up !
monsieur le président , arrest me
to be prince égalité , to get around bearing the internal contradiction between the restoration and the revolution , to have the disturbing look of the revolutionary who becomes reassuring as the ruler , that was louis-philippe ’ s fortune in number ; never has a man adapted more completely to an event ; the one blurred into the other and the incarnation was carried off
in the course of the s and s , the painters of the wiener aktionisnus , or viennese actionism , vould follow this dictum to the 'letter , using their own bodies as the 'support surface ' of their art
citizen , said gavroche , i haven ’ t called you a bourgeois yet
their only resemblance lies in this shared practice of the ladies of the blessed sacrament and the bernardines of martin verga , just as there was a similarity in the study and glorification of all the mysteries concerning the infancy , life , and death of jesus christ and the blessed virgin mary , between another pair of orders that were very distinct and on occasion even hostile : the oratory of italy , set up in florence by philip di neri , and the oratory of france , set up in paris by pierre de bérullenumber the oratory in paris claimed precedence , philippe di neri being only a saint , whereas bérulle was a cardinal
that is how it goes with human nature
they ’ ll see a man in a smock and a cap filing past
jean valjean felt the blood rush to his heart
come in , monsieur , she said
i miss everything about them
at midday , the doctor came back , wrote out a few prescriptions , inquired as to whether monsieur le maire had turned up yet at the infirmary , and shook his head
the solving of everything by universal suffrage being an entirely modern development , and all history prior to this development being filled for four thousand years with the violated rights and suffering of peoples , each era of history brings with it what protest is thinkable to it
they had stayed good friends ; they were ready to help each other out in every possible way should the occasion arise ; but nothing more
cosette let out a heartrending cry
marius understood that probably , judging by their flight the night before , their breathlessness , their terror , and the words of slang that he had heard , these sorry girls were also practising all sorts of dark trades—and that the net result of the whole sordid business was two miserable beings who were neither children nor girls nor women , monsters of a sort at once foul and innocent , produced by dire poverty , smack in the middle of human society as we know it
gavroche spotted him : whassat ?
they couldn ’ t see anything , but they could hear all right
there is no mercy
there , beneath the outer silence , titanic struggles are taking place as in homer , mêlées of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms as in milton , visionary spirals as in dante
nothing could be more normal than such a phenomenon
for want of twenty-four sous , his joy , his happiness , his love , was slipping through his fingers !
other acts , even more audacious , were suspicious to the people because of their very audacity
otherwise , through his daughter azelma , whom he had set on the trail of the newly married couple of february number , and through his own digging , he had managed to find out a lot of things and , from the depths of his darkness , he had succeeded in seizing more than one mysterious thread
despite this favoured lancer , the label prude , under which we have classified her , suited her to a tee
to love beauty is to seek the light
except for enjolras and marius , who kept silent , everyone joined in the aimless ranting
there was an extra chair in the enclosed alcove , but half the straw seating was missing and it only had three legs to stand on , so that it could only be used propped up against a wall
the scaffold is a kind of monster manufactured by judge and carpenter together , a spectre that seems to have a kind of ghastly life of its own arising out of all the death it has dealt
the idyll of the rue plumet and the epic of the rue saint-denis
what is beyond doubt is that sister simplice , sole witness to what was happening , has often recounted that the moment jean valjean whispered in fantine ’ s ear , she distinctly saw a heavenly smile form on those pale lips and in those dull pupils , full of the wonder of the grave
about a quarter of an hour elapsed
behind the door of this room , there was a man standing against the wall
when his aunt scolded him for this , he was very sweet and gave as an excuse his studies , courses , exams , symposia , and so on
he must be punished
at first the sisters had taken in and cared for that girl only with repugnance
this mongrel of very mixed blood was , in all probability , some kind of fleming from lille in flanders , french in paris , belgian in brussels , conveniently straddling two borders , with a foot in both camps
extreme emotions often speak out loud
not a voice rose , not an arm shot out to stop him
the fates are truly fatal for some and too profliget or too protectiv for others
there are four categories of them
this patch of dirt would perhaps have brought him the world , if only he had been able to take it
these two figures were not known to him
the fate of many a man is to live half submerged in this way
surely someone in this place can sell me a saddle
there ’ s enough here for four , anyway
digne was a particularly exhausting diocese to tour
she was so gentle she seemed fragile , but was actually the opposite , solid as a rock
at times he would say , i ’ m eighty-four , though , as if he had some lingering hope of coming to the end of his days before coming to the end of his books
let this be a lesson to you , you peddler of secrets , mystery merchant , rummager in the dark , miserable bastard !
cosette and marius saw each other again
you know , sorry , i ’ m not saying that right , but you know , for me , it ’ s all so far away ! —you know what we ’ re like , us lot !
a light flashed in her glassy eyes
he had a pick somewhere among the briars in a hiding place he alone knew about
feuilly , a drawn sabre in his hand , was marching in front crying : long live poland ! number
his mother would say to him : what the hell ’ d you come here for ?
if every object immediately has the potential to become subject , form or material , this is not only , as has sometimes been suggested a bit too hastily in the age of pop , because of its documentary ’ value , which turns it into a vehicle of a critical function
oh , look how happy he is !
you pushed it and you found yourself in a small room about six feet square , tiled , washed and scrubbed , clean and neat , cold , and hung with nankeen wallpaper with little green flowers at fifteen sous a roll
until that moment she had been happy just to see him go by on the boulevard without even trying to run into him
what is your occupation ?
a mother would have told her , for instance , that a young girl does not wear damask
of course , but it will take at least two or three days
and marius , pulling a banknote out of his pocket , threw it in his face
then he shook the worker ’ s hand and went on his way , saying : we ’ ll see each other again soon
to say that , to do that , to come up with that—this is to be the victor
if it had occurred to them to split into two squads and cover both directions at once , jean valjean would have been caught
marius felt a piece of paper there
but i need money
he seemed to be there to goad everyone else on
he lives … actually , he doesn ’ t live there anymore … ah , well , i don ’ t know
he went over to his bed , and his eyes fell—was it by chance ?
meanwhile , at that very moment , fantine was delirious with joy
one of these proclamations was signed : burtot , wine seller
on top of this , he had on him his watch and his purse , which contained a few gold coins
jean valjean sized up the wall above which he could see the linden tree
he turned and went on his way again , singing this song :
violent resistance ; conclusion , refusal
one possibility opened up the prospect , beyond jail , of the death penalty , if his identity was established and if the petit-gervais matter were to end up resulting in a conviction
i ’ ll be needing you
is that really what we are shown in the smile of the old peasant who joined the kolkhoz , the collective farm , the day it was set up , did ten years in a gulag sawing tree trunks , and merely says , here i live and that 's all there is to it ’ ?
he caught her , she fell , he caught her in his arms , he squeezed her tight without knowing what he was doing
i repeat , we ’ re talking about women here , we ’ re talking about mothers , we ’ re talking about girls , we ’ re talking about little nippers
those women , too , were once pure
i resigned myself to it : they don ’ t need you , stay in your corner , a man doesn ’ t have the right to go on forever
these rooms looked out on the surrounding wastelands
to squint is highly rated
all this labour was carried out without hindrance in under an hour and without this handful of daring men seeing one fur cap or one bayonet emerge
he was a corpse with wings you could feel
what did jean valjean want ?
cosette had been through so much that she was afraid of everything , even to open her mouth , even to breathe
now that he was alone with his wife , jondrette resumed pacing the room and he circled it two or three times in silence
at times , this noise moved away , at times it came closer , wavering mournfully
today , with excess heaped on excess , desensitiza- tion to the shock of images and the meaninglessness of words has shattered the world stage
you see , be reasonable , there ’ s nothing left now , i feel absolutely sure that it ’ s over
besides , help was evidently on the way
but there are more bastilles left ,
the place was in fact exactly right with its funnel-shaped entrance from the street tapering at the bottom and ending in a dead end , where the corinthe caused a bottleneck , the rue mondétour easily blocked off both left and right , and no attack possible except via the rue saint-denis , that is , from the front and without cover
so the relationship needs to be nuanced
in our time , these boisterous piles of creatures usually get themselves lugged about in some ancient contraption where they clutter the top deck , or they tumultuously overwhelm a government landau with its hood folded back
enthusiasm can lose its temper ; hence the taking up of arms
cannons , i tell you !
that was enough for him to live on
old toussaint , who went to bed early , thought only of sleeping once her chores were finished and was as much in the dark as jean valjean
i want the surprise !
i voted for fraternity , for harmony , for the dawn of a new age !
that same day , at around four o ’ clock in the afternoon , jean valjean was sitting alone on the shady side of one of the most solitary slopes in the champ de mars
we were only a few turns of the wheel from the little path that leads to the nuns ’ corner
the nightmare struck him so forcefully he later wrote it down
the flora of cauteretz was no longer selling at all—not a single copy
eighteen seventeen is the year that louis xviii , with a certain royal aplomb not devoid of arrogance , called the twenty-second year of his reignnumber it is the year monsieur bruguière de sorsum , number the translator of shakespeare , became famous
you can hear the broom of these spectres beneath these vaults
but also , first and foremost , by the horror of the laboratories of the extermination camps
had he actually reached the point of forgetting the mayor ’ s very presence ?
i should hope so , laigle retorted
and then , workers are a nasty lot !

on christmas eve itself , several men , carters and peddlers , were sitting at table , drinking , ranged around four or five candles in the low room of the thénardiers ’ inn
jean valjean had not cut out the strolls to the luxembourg , not wanting to do anything out of the ordinary and above all fearing to alert cosette to what was going on ; but during those hours that were so sweet for the two little lovebirds , while cosette sent her smile to the intoxicated marius , who saw nothing but that and now no longer saw anything else in this world but that one radiant and adored face , jean valjean fixed glittering and terrible eyes on marius

suddenly she yelled : you ’ re talking about monsieur madeleine there !
yet it didn ’ t look like he had any broken limbs , and by a stroke of luck , if we may use such a term here , the bodies had arched above him in such a way as to prevent him from being crushed
marius , with cosette at his side , climbed the stairs , triumphant and beaming , the same stairs he had been dragged up half dead
one thing added further to the garret ’ s horror and that was that it was big
he wheeled round to javert : that ’ s enough , javert
this did not prevent him from making plan after plan , devising schemes , erecting scaffoldings , elaborating projects for the future
it was like an eruption
she suffered from marius ’ s absence just as she rejoiced in his presence , strangely , without really knowing she did so
she sold everything she had , which gave her two hundred francs ; her minor debts paid , all she had left was about eighty francs
one day , we really should do away with the old line that goes that history 's losers ’ lose because they ca not understand , ca not reason or talk – because they are too far away , too immured in their godforsaken bogs and their daily chores to understand the reasons for progress or for oppression
marius flinched ; he was being asked to disown his father
i ’ m well dressed and ugly
when two mouths , sanctified by love , come together to create , that ineffable kiss is simply bound to set the mysterious stars shuddering throughout immensity
you are just starting out in life , i ’ m about to leave it ; you go off to shows , to balls , to cafés , to billiards , you ’ re witty , you please the ladies , you ’ re a good-looking boy ; i , i sit there spitting on my embers in the middle of summer ; you are rich with the only riches that count , i ’ ve got all the impoverishments of old age , infirmity , isolation !
the shadows that enveloped him entered his mind
in his death throes , he witnesses the immense madness of the sea
there , in the jaunty gloom of the greenery , a host of innocent voices spoke softly to the soul , and what the warbling forgot to say , the humming completed
he had an air of serenity that made him strangely venerable
the only things worth the trouble of being said and of being listened to
he had been mixed up with the group of insurgents
he was a small man of fifty or so , lively , weathered , puny , yellow , cheeky , frantic , whose limbs and whose whole person exhibited a sort of sickly feebleness and whose eyes expressed immense strength
otherwise , jean valjean was happy
that said , he sat with sovereign authority at the table , where the candle and the writing set still stood , pulled out a stamped sheet of official letterhead from his pocket , and started on his report

doubtless , historically , the riots had their beauty ; the war of the cobblestones is no less grandiose and no less pathetic than the war of the bushes ; in one lies the soul of the forest , in the other the heart of the city ; one has jean chouan , the other has jeannenumber the riots lit up in red , garishly but splendidly , all the most prominent features of the parisian character in its originality , generosity , devotion , stormy gaiety , with students proving that bravery plays a part in intelligence , the national guard unshakable , the bivouacs of shopkeepers , the fortresses of street kids , the contempt for death of the average man in the street

a sombre calm had succeeded the wild tumult that had filled the garret a few minutes before
no one ever knew
the blow-in said to the resident : you can see what ’ s on my back , i ’ ve got to get out , you have the key , give it to me
it seemed to him that everything around him looked different suddenly and he cried out : of course !

it is on one of the lawns of the garden that this tale was improvised by a rosy mouth of six and told to blue eyes of four or five : once upon a time there were three little chickens who lived in the countryside where there were lots of flowers
citizens , cried enjolras , and there was in his voice an almost angry tremor , the republic is not rich enough in men to incur unnecessary costs

and the man , overcome , bowing and scraping , grabbed the note and examined it
mademoiselle vaubois , a perfect example of her kind , was the very picture of stupidity without a single blot of intelligence
it seems they had thought of that , for it had been lined with a sheet of tin inserted into the wall a bit to the back and punched with a thousand holes tinier than the holes of a colander

never mind , it doesn ’ t matter
cosette had no idea what was happening in paris
that is what i thought
the same fury is legitimate against terray and absurd against turgotnumber the smashing of machines , the pillaging of warehouses , the tearing up of railway lines , the demolition of docks , the wrong turns taken by the multitudes , the people ’ s denials of justice for progress , ramus assassinated by schoolboys , number rousseau driven out of switzerland , number pelted with stones—that is rioting
in the distance the fugitives , stopping now and then , out of breath , listened in the darkness as the mournful thunder grew fainter

he told himself that it was true , then , that there were exceptions , that authority could be unseated , that the rules could be brought up short by a deed , that not everything was framed within the text of the code , that the unforeseen commanded obedience , that the virtue of a convict could present a snare for the virtue of a public servant , that the monstrous could be divine , that destiny set up these kinds of ambushes , and he thought with despair that even he had not been safe from a surprise
i don ’ t think you can really call such a small thing a good deed ; but if it is a good deed , well then , let ’ s say that i did it
what if i put coats on my melons for them ?

fouché answered : number wherever you like , you moron !
these ideas , which were infantile , as we said , and at the same time sterile , gave him , in their very childishness , a fairly just notion of the influence of showy trappings on a young girl ’ s imagination

let ’ s take a closer look
the old soldier replied in the calm and sovereign tone of one who was there : in the heel

roguet had set a grim example in threatening to kill any french grenadier who brought him a prussian prisoner

between you and me , i think that nincompoop of a lancer had a try at wooing her
at sunrise—the peculiarity of the sun rising is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the night , and the laugh we have is always in proportion to the fear we have had—at sunrise cosette woke to dismiss her fright as a nightmare and said to herself : what was i dreaming about ?
one day the sisters overheard her talking in her feverish delirium : i have been a sinner , but when i have my child back with me , that will mean god has forgiven me
her blush did not last long
we have always thought that this was sometimes an act of courage , and at the very least a simple and useful activity , worthy of the sympathetic attention that duty accepted and performed deserves
everything ’ s arranged—and nothing is , said fauchelevent
later on , this fades away like the sweetness of a kitten and all that grace ends , on two legs in the bourgeois , and on four legs in the tomcat
the mind ’ s eye dimly makes them out
he can ’ t hear me
de meaux , replied laigle
the shifty black look in their eyes gives them away
this population , full of proud virtue , capable of the highest degree of latent heat , always ready to take up arms , quick to explode , irritable , deep , ground down , seemed to be waiting only for a flying spark to fall
a rose-coloured cloud blankets all that
sixteen years count in the underground education in rioting , and june number knew a lot more about it than june number and so the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie was just a rough draft , an embryo , compared to the two colossal barricades that we have briefly described ; but , for the time , it was pretty impressive
having got away from the rue plumet without any complications or incidents was already a step in the right direction

at the beginning of this century , the paris sewer was still a mysterious place
time to give the pot a good skim
does this infinite arouse in us the idea of an essence , whereas we can only attribute to ourselves the idea of existence ?
he put the wallet back in marius ’ s pocket
i , too , have my patients ; to start with , i have theirs , whom they call the unwell ; and then , i have my own , whom i call the unfortunate
jean valjean had gone to look for her
it would be hard to conceive of a general without troops or a king without subjects
in a few bounds , jean valjean was at his side
her voice was querulous and her mind leaped about like a flea
that ’ s why i contemplate you instead
the fight will be colossal ; and the shadow cast , in that great epic field where humanity thrashes about , by this footslogger and this jumped-up bonesetter as they battle it out , will equal the shadow cast by megaryon , king of lycia , land of tigers , wrestling gigantic ajax , equal of the gods
this information delivered , gavroche added : i authorize you to tan their hides
with cosette ’ s garter , homer would have made the iliad
he kept coming back all the time to the job of being a grurin , as though he were hoping that the man realized , without giving him hard advice directly , that this would be a refuge for him
on one corner of the table was an old odd volume with a reddish cover ; its format , which was the old duodecimo of reading rooms , revealed a novel
he deciphered the few lines written by marius and muttered : gillenormand , rue des filles-du-calvaire , number six
despite the current negationism , freedom of expres- sion has at least one limit : the call to murder and torture
these bernardinesnumber were , consequently , not linked to clairvaux , like the bernadine monks , but to cîteaux , like the benedictine monks

this concerned the latch on the front door
two napoléons , growled an old toothless hag who was there
the good lord ’ s hands are black all the time from this dreadful dirty oil
marius , still kept apart from his fiancée , according to custom , came only in the second

to stop herself from being bored , she had opened her piano-organ and had started to sing , accompanying herself , the chorus from euryanthenumber—hunters lost in the woods ! —which is perhaps the most beautiful thing in all music
he grabbed an old hat and his purse
the answer , which had to do with the name of the street and not the street itself , appeared to marius more conclusive than it was
the apartment was provided with all the necessary utensils
night there was dramatic
what is certain is that the next day a postilion was lobbed from the charlemagne yard into the lions ’ den over the five-story building that separated the two yards
the one who looked like the leader turned round and strongly indicated with his right hand the direction jean valjean had taken ; one of the others seemed to be pointing somewhat stubbornly in the opposite direction

the way they had repelled the night attack made them almost scorn the dawn attack before the event
meanwhile , he worked all day on his patch of indigo and at night he went home to water his garden and read his books

in those days , certain houses near the park in the rue madame and the rue d ’ enfer had keys to the luxembourg , which the residents used when the gates were closed , a special dispensation since done away with

yes , you clearly see future times ; yes , you are right
at that precise moment éponine had tracked the burglars as far as the boulevard
a lovely big spiderweb , nice and black and adorned with dead flies , fanned out over one of the windowpanes
and then , are all riots calamities ?
most of them , chatting unguardedly , did justice to the king ’ s good points , standing as he did with one foot in the monarchy and the other in the revolution ; none of them hated him

the two old men had gone and got cosette from the fruit-hawker in the rue du chemin-vert , where fauchelevent had dropped her off the night before
all this went with the statesman , ex-ambassador
he had begun by opening his bag , hoping to drop in the two young girls who were supposed to be on surveillance outside the rat ’ s nest of a building
he dined on bread and potatoes
the man didn ’ t answer
sometimes he even lifts something else
that one was a boy , too
and so , he walked on , in some perplexity , putting dozens of questions to himself about this enigmatic character
what do we do with this gold dung ?
i ’ m not hungry anymore , said the child
she vaguely felt some nameless horror looming
he said to his wife
he nodded to cosette and placed the hand of the lady in her little hand
no idiom could be more metaphoric than slang
he looks so hard at humanity , he sees its soul ; he looks so hard at creation , he sees god
a sort of ghastly fascination nailed him to the spot from which he looked down on the whole scene
but enjolras and marius and seven or eight others who had rallied around them lunged forward and covered them
at that , jean valjean , who looked glum and broken , lifted his eyes , startled
the reality was that they were not as safe as jean valjean had thought
i ’ ll follow you wherever there ’ s room for a chair ; that everyone had to stay on their guard ; that come nightfall , there would be people looting isolated houses in the deserted corners of paris ( here you could detect the imagination of the police at work—that anne radcliffenumber embedded in the government ) ; that a battery had been planted in the rue aubry-le-boucher ; that lobau and bugeaudnumber were conferring and that at midnight , or at daybreak at the latest , four columns would march at the same time on the centre of the riot , the first coming from the bastille , the second from the porte saint-martin , the third from la grève , the fourth from les halles ; that perhaps the troops would also evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ de mars ; that no one knew what would happen but that one thing was for sure and that was that , this time , it was serious
what he tends to go in for , and we say this with the proper dose of regret , is not in the classical taste
it would be a mistake to write to liège for corks or to pau for glovesnumber miss dahlia , if i were you , i ’ d call myself rose
she was the shadow
the two women watched the bishop without a word , without a movement , without a glance that might upset him
and to me the oblivious , the pitiless , the guilty , the ungrateful wretch , he says : thank you !
they talked about this and that , noisily , passionately
the vast night confronted this tiny being
his head was thrown back against the pillow in the abandoned attitude of sleep ; over the side of the bed his hand dangled , adorned with his pastoral ring—the hand that had performed so many good works and saintly deeds
he had never had the time to fall in love
jean valjean had gone wrong from the start
he uttered the word enormous for the second time with an exaggerated snicker that only capital letters could do justice to
he turned to the three convicts : well , i recognize you , i certainly do !
what is the ideal ?
in those days the gates of the cemeteries of paris were shut at sunset , and , since this was a regulation made by the municipality , vaugirard cemetery was subject to it like the rest
marius said nothing ; for a second she remained silent , too , then she cried : if i wanted to , but , i could make you pretty happy !
and in that battle i saved a general called count someone-or-other !
we might as well spell it out
pierce through the livid face of a human being at certain moments as they ponder , look behind the façade , look into the soul , look into the darkness
but , no matter what he did , and no matter what extenuating circumstances he looked for , he could not avoid falling back on this : the man was a convict ; that is , the one who does not even have a place on the social ladder , being below the lowest rung
a savage breath rose from that abyss
kidlingtons , if you don ’ t find mummy and daddy , come back this evening
unfortunately , as he was alone and it was night-time , all this was neither seen nor seeable
madame magloire ripped all the paper off
when he ’ d fumbled in one pocket , he fumbled in the other
you reek of gunpowder
the fury of the rising tide was stamped on that amorphous clutter
it was not an act of infidelity to cosette ; it was a thoughtful and sweet farewell to a poor unhappy soul
what ’ ll you give me ?
we will meet up with him again
he ’ s within his rights
there is no longer anything of the middle ages in our constitution
marius was walking slowly down this slope , his eyes fixed on someone he could no longer see
the one who ’ s about to fly off is a saint
this greasy spoon was run by people by the name of thénardier , husband and wife
it was the noise of footsteps , someone was walking in the shadows , someone was coming his way
you see i can express myself properly
he was full of horror , but it seemed to him that the good thought was winning
they sank out of sight below the horizon
they made a front half a mile long
the old woman saw him fumble around in his pocket and take out a sewing kit , scissors , and thread ; he proceeded to unpick the lining of one of the tails of his redingote and pulled out of the opening a piece of yellowing paper , which he then straightened out
could you be bound in any shape or form of gratitude to such a miserable bastard ?
since a patrol was going back to its post at the arsenal , he requisitioned it and brought it along
on top of this , he was regular in his habits , and went out only for the demonstrable necessities of the orchard and the vegetable garden
with the remaining cobblestones they blocked up the opening
she was called mademoiselle gillenormand the elder
basque , without waiting for jean valjean to approach , addressed him : monsieur le baron asked me to ask monsieur if he would like to go up or stay downstairs ?
since she had gone away , there was nothing left for him to do but die
all of a sudden she thought she heard someone walking in the garden
where did you come from ?
it was already broad daylight , but as the sun ’ s rays were perfectly horizontal she thought it was still early , but that she should get up anyway—to welcome marius
a clot of blood had built up in the knot of his cravat ; his shirt was sinking into in his wounds , the cloth of his coat was rubbing against the gaping gashes in his living flesh
even hypocrisy , the ultimate cynicism , does not put it off ; it is so literary that it won ’ t hold its nose when faced by basilius , and it is no more scandalized by tartuffe ’ s posturing than horace was shocked by priapus ’ hiccupsnumber no feature of the universal face is lacking in paris ’ s profile
at first monsieur madeleine had been vilified by slander and calumny , according to a sort of universal law that all those who better themselves are subject to ; then these were reduced to spiteful cracks , then they became mere malicious jokes , and then that entirely evaporated
there is spade , sword , which comes from spada ; carvel , boat , which comes from caravella
she was counting on marius ’ s despair when he did not find cosette , and she was not mistaken
no choice was possible between these men who appeared to onlookers to be the elite of the gutter , the scum of the earth
in short , and we have insisted on this more than once , this whole inner fusion , this whole set , the result of which was lofty virtue , had wound up making jean valjean a father for cosette
the bernardine-benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows into their order
it doesn ’ t enlighten me as to your intrinsic and essential worth , you who have come here most likely presuming to bring me enlightenment
she seized marius ’ s hand convulsively with her wounded hand , but she no longer seemed to feel pain
it was not daybreak , it was dawn ; a ravishing , wild moment
who was this little one that thénardier had called the lark ?
his voice had become strangely calm again
all ready to go
old women had bundled up the tragic friend of the people for the grave in these swaddling clothes that had known the pleasures of the flesh
what he had just said had brought him closer to the one who stands at death ’ s door
marius , who was stepping into the downstairs room , scarcely noticed
in the middle of the grass you notice an uprooted tree trunk , recumbent , covered in green shoots
we blame the church when it is riddled with intrigue , we scorn the spiritual when it is hard on the temporal ; but we honour the meditative man wherever he appears
certain convicts , who are always hatching escape plans , end up turning combined strength and skill into a veritable science—the science of muscles
deeds are one , ideas the other
what do you mean ?
there is a great tumult ; everything in us speaks , except our mouths
the first row , on their knees , received the cuirassiers on the ends of their bayonets , the second row gunned them down ; behind the second row the cannoneers loaded their pieces , the front of the square opened up , made way for an eruption of firepower and then closed again
in any case , mother jondrette was still rattling around in her iron scrap
beginning of a great sickness
scarcely had he quit the room than the traveller came in
this particular man was old , the sight of his white hair on top of his black face was shocking
not if it ’ s you two
what is a cat ?
all along the bare table at intervals there were enamel basins in which the pupils themselves washed their metal cups and their plates , sometimes chucking out scraps , a tough bit of meat or rotten fish—an act that was punished
two barricades at right angles stretched out and ran from the rue montorgueil to the grande-truanderie , and from the rue geoffroy-langevin to the rue sainte-avoye
we don ’ t know what to do
there was a moment of silence in the rathole
no , of course not
put ’ em in a hat ! —
i want to eat
what was this sombre game of providence that had placed this child in such close contact with this man ?
you reached it by the spiral staircase that came out in a corner of the room in a square hole like a ship ’ s hatch
for the past two years , he had got the gravedigger , good old father mestienne , drunk a dozen times
no one ’ s throwing anything away these days
but whatever he was , now when he was tied up with ropes , surrounded by homicidal maniacs and half-buried , so to speak , in a grave that was getting deeper under him at every instant , faced with both the fury and the calm of thénardier , the man remained imperturbable ; and marius could not help but admire , at such a moment , that superbly melancholy face
a monster spewed out , etc
alain resnais had already contrasted photographs of survivors and corpses taken when the camps were opened up with the mutism and indifference of the surrounding natural environment ( night and fog )
yet old man thénardier , having learned by some obscure means that the child was probably a bastard and that the mother was forced to disown her , demanded fifteen francs a month , saying that the creature was growing and ate like a wild thing and threatening to send her back
one of his comrades replied , the soldiers have got some !
and his existence—he didn ’ t just risk it once , but twenty times !
he sat beside them , made cosette sit , and took their four hands in his old hands , gnarled as they were
the woman was basically a brute and the man had all the makings of a complete scoundrel
her nostrils were pinched and as pale as if she had heaved her last sigh
a prisoner of jean valjean
meanwhile , at the same time as the swans , the two little strays headed for the brioche
he had the strangest physiognomy , which started off looking humble and ended up looking harsh
it was a short iron bar , sharpened at one end like a hunting spear
if a man with a family finds himself at harvest time with his sons in the army and his daughters working as domestics in town , and he ’ s sick and can ’ t work , the curé offers up prayers for him and on sunday , after mass , all the people in the village , men , women , and children , go into the poor man ’ s field and harvest his crop for him and they take the straw and grain and put it in his granary
the figures were the numbers five , six , and eight and a half
all winter cosette ’ s little house was heated from top to bottom
and he dropped his pole-axe in a corner and followed mother thénardier out
it was obviously a whole way of thinking that poured its heart out there , sigh by sigh , erratically , without order , without choice , without aim , randomly
if it were given to our eye of flesh and blood to see the fearsome and lovely sights of the higher life , we would probably see the forms of the night , winged strangers , the blue bystanders of the invisible , bend down , a throng of dark heads , over the luminous house , satisfied , blessing , pointing out to each other , sweetly alarmed , the virgin bride , and wearing the reflection of human bliss on their divine faces
javert committed all these mistakes , yet was no less one of the smartest and ablest spies who ever existed
that is something you may be forgiven for doubting
you ’ d think there was nothing to it—one week later , finding a wedding party that went by in paris at mardi gras !
he came and examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon looking at a broken leg
he paused and then added : i ’ ll be dead in three hours
you ’ re the mayor , you can do it !
to sum up once more , the gamin de paris today , like the graeculus of romenumber in days gone by , is the man of the people as a child , with the wrinkles of the old world on his forehead
that particular knot still held
at eleven o ’ clock sharp i ’ ll be in the chapel
let 's turn now to contemporary theatre and dance , in particular the work of choreographer , meg stuart
today it is not rare for a little cowherd to be called arthur , alfred , or alphonse , or for a vicomte—if vicomtes still exist—to be called thomas , pierre , or jacques
action of the guilty
a little while after this , monsieur madeleine was appointed mayor
this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling while listening to the man with the white hair talking to her , and nothing was as ravishing as that fresh smile that went with her downcast eyes
he had never been known to have a sweetheart in the region
what had happened can be told in a few words
there they are , on the box , on the folding seat , on the sides of the hood , on the trailing arm
off you go , my darling cosette , leave us a moment
courfeyrac did not ask him any questions
you get soaked to the bone
marmosets worth four sous apiece , making innuendos and pathetic wisecracks !
wisdom is holy communion
hello , law and order
mother thénardier had no comeback
a few unintelligible pages on the sins of young boys was what was most interesting for them
his musings grew clearer and clearer
to borrow one of those vulgar phrases that have the merit of expressing in a single word ideas that can scarcely be expressed in a page , madame magloire had the look of a peasant and mademoiselle baptistine of a lady
besides , his mother loved his sisters
all with the skill of a conjurer
it was a mud hole in a cavern of pitch-black night
he believed as much as he could
one of the guests observed that it was mardi gras and that the place would be packed with carriages there
when it comes to those we love , we come up with all kinds of mad things in our concern
he felt that he was reaching the other decisive moment of his conscience and his fate ; that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life and that this champmathieu was marking the second

after having 'only reluctantly ' abandoned the figure on the pretext of not mutilating it , the american painter then chose to end this life himself as well by exercising the most nihilistic of freedoms of expression : that of self-destruction
this era will pass , is already passing ; we are beginning to understand that , if there may be some force in a boiler , there can only be power in a brain ; in other words , that what leads and pulls the world along is not locomotives , it is ideas
when he had finished speaking , the prioress interrupted the slipping of her rosary beads through her fingers and said to him : can you , between now and this evening , get hold of a strong iron bar ?
it was warm inside and he found quite a decent bed of straw
his principal adornment was a pair of elephant-legs—ballooning nankeen trousers , with stirrups of copper braid ; he had a strong rattan cane in his hand that had cost two hundred francs , and , as his boldness knew no bounds , he had the strangest thing , a cigar , in his mouth
after thirteen months had elapsed , the pawnshop had sold the copperplates of his flora
well , was i right or wasn ’ t i ?
good grief , it ’ s you , father madeleine !
and the law doesn ’ t even put up a notice
this packet was taken to the guardhouse
it was a strange lightning flash
the theft of a people has no statutory limit
he now made a third
the elite felt troubled just as the teeming hordes did—in a different way , but every bit as much
he questioned himself ; he patted himself down ; he was dizzy from all those vanished realities
it could easily hold twenty beds !
she lives in a garden where there ’ s a gate , rue plumet
he was so shy he was rude
his whole heart melted in gratitude and he felt more and more love
he remembered the inspector of the rue de pontoise and the two pistols he had given him , which he , marius , had used in this very barricade ; and he not only remembered the face , but he remembered the name
javert , who had not looked up , forged on :
what time is it ?
dutch colonizers in indonesia took those images to celebrate their work civilizing the natives
in fact , it ’ s very simple : a man has a bit of fun shoving snow down a woman ’ s back , that gives them a laugh—the officers , they ’ ve got to have some fun somehow ; the likes of me , we ’ re just there to keep them happy , of course we are !
they drank there , they ate there , they spouted there ; they paid little , they paid badly , they did not pay at all , yet they were always welcome
for four months , i was dead
this , then , was the essence and quintessence of white—legitimist—paris societynumber people of renown were shunned there , even when they were royalists
the jig was up
you can recognize them by the quills they wear in their hatband
on the sole condition of reaching down all the way to the people
five , six , eight and a half ?
thénardier answered in a straightforward manner : he ’ s a rich farmer
meanwhile , while some were singing , others were talking away at the top of their lungs and all at the same time ; the place was nothing but noise
his white hair added sweet majesty to the shiny bright light that lay over his face
but did anyone in the past ever fret about the very particular silence of the visible , best exemplified by the pictorial or sculptural image ?
three or four times a year , jean valjean donned his uniform and did his stint of guard duty , and very gladly , too ; for him , it was the perfect disguise , which let him mingle with the world at large while leaving him alone
his hideout was the arche-marion sewer
with cosette , behind her , a white-haired man had come , looking grave yet smiling , but with a small , heartbreaking smile
this tactic was known to the ancients
people whispered in horror of monstrous possibilities involving the king ’ s blood-red baths
nothing , said marius with an almost fierce firmness and resolve
you were in a cloud of glory and you had all kinds of heavenly figures all around you
the sister answered : no
there was intense anxiety in the redoubt
as soon as enjolras folded his arms , accepting the end , the deafening clamour of the struggle died down in the room , and the chaos suddenly abated in a sort of sepulchral solemnity
and , satisfied with the positive response he had given himself , he rushed on : we talked about you a lot , the two of us
that was the sixteenth of june and , then , the second of july
he didn ’ t exactly stand up again ; he stayed in a half-crouching position like that of a scared wildcat , turning his back on the heap of dead , scrutinizing the skyline , on his knees , the whole top part of his body being supported by his two index fingers on the ground , his head peering over the rim of the sunken road
in sum , no window is opened for thought by a philosophy that makes everything end in the monosyllable no
i don ’ t know what ’ s the matter with me , i see light
he had just stepped outside his door , where ma bougon was at that moment sweeping the doorstep while delivering this memorable monologue : what ’ s cheap these days ?
when he had finished , the audience burst out laughing
about three quarters of an hour before midnight
and then i ’ ll take you to a show
you could see two straight stiff shapes under the black cloth , one big , the other little , and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the cold folds of the shroud
shouted thénardier , insofar as you can shout keeping your voice down
they ’ ve killed him , cried combeferre
it meant cutting his losses , which is an option a person must never turn down
fantine owed them a hundred francs
i made use of the fire to cook ’ em
then thénardier went back and sat very close to monsieur leblanc
if you did not know what it was , the voice shut up and the wall became silent again as though the bewildered darkness of the tomb had been on the other side
he had given cosette a dress of binche guipure lace which had come down to him from his very own grandmother
i the night after a day ’ s walk
some would come running and others would line the roadside ; for a passing king always creates a commotion
if the old boy ’ s a philanthropist , what ’ s it to you ?
the bishop went on sleeping in profound peace beneath this frightening stare
madame might remember that it was his habit to go on trips from time to time
it ’ s out of honesty
a wide chimney , probably left over from some ancient kitchen of the ducs de la force , started at ground level and passed through the next four floors , dividing all the dormitories in half , like a sort of flattened pillar , before boring through the roof
no trace of the chaos of the night before last remained
finally he left the luxembourg , hoping to come across her again in a street somewhere
well , he had just faltered
we think we are sanitizing the city , but we are depleting the population

napoléon was one of those geniuses that release thunder
but in the middle of the silence , fantine yelled : i can hear her !
do any of you have wives , yes or no ?
there was just enough light coming in through this window for a man ’ s face to appear like the face of a phantom
i like you better in love than a jacobin
answer me , for christ ’ s sake !

even the police reports of which it is sometimes the object now show respect for it
they were savages , yes ; but savages of civilization
and yet , on certain points and in certain places , despite philosophy and despite progress , the claustral spirit lives on , right into the middle of the nineteenth century , and a bizarre recrudescence in asceticism is stunning the civilized world at this very moment
widow hucheloup was short-winded and misshapen , full of country memories
the flora of the environs of cauteretz stopped selling altogether

two versions of an 'art ' that french artist , christian boltanski , has tried to pull off according to his own lights in order to fend off forgetting ,

the july revolution had been a beautiful popular breath of fresh air , swiftly followed by blue skies
the dawn that follows a battle always rises over bare corpses
the cashier lived in the room exactly below monsieur madeleine ’ s room
in any case , a coffin in which there is a living being , this expedient of the convict , is also the expedient of the emperor
the winters here are bitterly cold and of course we have to try and do something for those in need
he had blown out the candle by snorting through one nostril the way convicts do and dropped onto the bed fully clothed , and in an instant he was fast asleep
then he stood up again and leaned back against the fireplace : now , he said , we ’ re ready to receive the philanthropist
no , it ’ s over , forever
this man was dressed in a smock ; he was barefoot ; he was holding his shoes in his left hand ; he had obviously taken them off to approach jean valjean without being heard
this penetration by the darkness is unspeakably sinister for a child
the conventionist held out his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it
will she keep quiet ?
he did not dither , but took the right
and those two poor wolf cubs
she has so much courage , that woman !
he sometimes spent half a day at a time gazing at a market garden , square beds of lettuce , hens scratching in the dung , and a horse turning the chain of a waterwheel
these were the columns that , two years previously , had supported the emperor ’ s podium in the champ de mainumber they were scorched and charred here and there by the bivouac fires of the austrians camped in barracks close to gros-caillounumber two or three of the columns had disappeared altogether in these fires , which warmed the great hands of the kaiserlichen , or imperialists
they could be heard saying : go easy on royalism !
barons are old geezers , they go to the luxembourg and sit in front of the château where there ’ s more sun , they read the quotidienne for a sou

swear to me one thing !
but it was only a trick of the thénardiers to get more money
he took his time
be that as it may , as we have just pointed out , brains caught up in either wisdom or madness , or , as often happens , in both at the same time , only very slowly open up to the business of living
he kept his mouth shut , precisely because his heart would have leaped out of it
revolt , as we have said , sometimes occurs within the powers that be

leonidas versus the foreigner , timoleon versus the tyrantnumber—who is the greater ?

in the end , amodern art ' was able to glean what communications and telecommunications tools now accomplish on a daily basis : the mise en abyme of the body , of the figure , with the major attendant risk of system , atic hyperviolence and a boom in porno- graphic high-frequency that has nothing to do with sexuality : jij/e must put out the excess rather than the fire , as heraclitus warned
monsieur madeleine , flabbergasted , started to open his mouth
how could he come so close to danger , only to run away !
a few minutes ticked away
don ’ t imagine that you ’ ll still be here tomorrow
they had to resign themselves to going hungry
one of the most loved , one of the most valiant
the bishop fell silent for a moment , then suddenly turned to the hospital director
all his good points had their bad points
the little girl ’ s whole person , the way she moved , her demeanor , the sound of her voice , the gaps between one word and the next , her eyes , her silence , her slightest gesture , expressed and translated a single idea : fear
it should be noted that the fire battering the barricade hardly disturbed the men inside it
manuel was proud and wise ,
when he was sitting down , she would press her cheek against his white hair and silently shed a tear , telling herself : he could well be my mother , this man here !
without really knowing what was wrong with her , she had the distinct feeling that there was something and that it had to be kept hidden
the bishop , for his part , though normally careful not to show curiosity , curiosity being as far as he was concerned very nearly a crime , could not prevent himself from scrutinizing the conventionist with an attention that , not having its source in sympathy , would have gone completely against his conscience if the man in question had been any other man
at the same time , the usher handed him the note
the sewer , in fact , reaps all the aftereffects of the growth of paris
and , bending over to marius ’ s ear , he whispered : too late
he was suffering the strange pangs of a conscience suddenly operated on for cataracts
the gendarme , who ’ s a good lad , he nudges my elbow and whispers to me : go on , answer
if he ’ d recognized me on his side , he wouldn ’ t be back
this was not picked up by the shady character in rags walking ahead
often when we think we are tying a knot with a simple thread , we don ’ t notice we ’ ve caught up another thread as well
the foreman replied : that ’ s good enough for the likes of you
he was moving forward—aimlessly
three francs fifty sous
her compliance here consisted in not remembering whatever marius forgot
there was nobody on the stairs , either
the girl had vanished
you follow my reasoning , don ’ t you ?
the entire cavalry poured out onto the plateau and it was like the start of an earthquake
cosette ’ ll be here tomorrow
once you ’ re through the gate , you scurry home , grab your pass , come back , the cemetery gatekeeper ’ ll open up for you and then you won ’ t have to pay , because you ’ ll have your pass
they range from images of the renewed pomp of religion , similar to that staged by the man who made ivan the terrible , perhaps to embrace , in a single sweeping glance , the russia of the tsars and the priests and the russia of the soviet dictator , and to the enigmatic image of an old man with an inscrutible face taking part in a ceremony
in which case , woe betide the sewer workers
think of me sometimes
several incidents occurred , the coffin was trotted around the vendôme column , number stones were thrown at the duc de fitz-james , number spotted on a balcony with his hat on , the gallic cocknumber was ripped off a popular standard and dragged through the mud , a police officer was wounded by a sword thrust at the porte saint-martin , an officer of the numberth light was heard to say out loud , i am a republican , the école polytechnique popped up unexpectedly after its forced confinement , with shouts of long live the école polytechnique !
the walls of this room , apart from two nails for hanging up the knee pad and the basket , were adorned only with an example of the royalist paper money of ’ number stuck on the wall over the mantelpiece
he reached the pont d ’ austerlitz

monsieur fabantou , yes , that ’ s right , i remember
she had in her countenance , more than before , that indefinably frightened and pathetic look that a stint in jail adds to misery
love one another : number he declared this to be complete , desired nothing more ; it was the sum total of his doctrine
what on earth is that ?
those of the lay sisters that the boarders liked the most were sister saint euphrasia , sister saint marguerite , sister saint martha , who was in her second childhood , and sister saint michel , whose long nose made them hoot with laughter
courfeyrac was energetically demolishing it
was he simply obeying some sort of instinctive impulse obscure even to himself ?
all that it took was a few words uttered by her husband , the name no doubt that her husband had whispered in her ear , for this big sleepy woman to wake up and shift from repulsive to appalling

a train of mysterious forces takes possession of you
passersby of forty years ago would stop in the street to gaze at it , without suspecting the secrets it concealed behind its fresh green layers

when jean valjean had accosted him , old fauchelevent had , indeed , had in his hand a corner of a straw mat that he was busy laying over the melon bed
a question presented itself
after a month , they fish up your man for you in the saint-cloud nets

the man heard a noise in the sewer
at the moment that the uproar of the demons was moving away , you would have said a choir of angels was coming closer in the dark
he ’ s got his sorrows , that one has
the tavern was the only place open , and that for the good reason that that is where the crowd had rushed to
matter exists , the moment exists , interests exist , the stomach exists ; but the stomach must not be the sole guiding light
then he sat on the steps , his heart full of sweetness and resolve , he blessed his love from the bottom of his heart and he told himself that , since cosette had gone , all that was left for him to do now was to die
today the defenders of the past , not being able to deny these things , have adopted the position of laughing at them
cosette was a ray of light
and you see the awful hand of the police shoot out of the shadows and promptly rip off my mask !
he could see what he hated seeing
the next day at sunrise , monseigneur bienvenu was circling his garden
the barricade is about to be seriously rocked
it ’ s that i have to be relieved of my duties
it was in place
this was his only pleasure now
if you stopped loving me , i ’ d race after you , i ’ d claw you to bits , i ’ d scratch your eyes out , i ’ d throw water over you , i ’ d have you arrested

the innkeeper was a man named jacquin labarre and he was held in high esteem in the town because he was related to another labarre , who kept another inn , the trois dauphins in grenoble and who had served in the guides
behind this story , it was said , there were makeshift arrangements that had been made for a magnificent marriage
that is my life for you
you had a good laugh at me back then , eh !
jean valjean said to himself
x the man wakes up
he had no idea what they were going on about ; no doubt he had complained in the heat of the moment about someone stealing that dear little girl from him so soon—out of tenderness he ’ d have liked to hang on to her for another two or three days—but it was her grandfather who had come for her , the most natural thing in the world
he took off his hat and greeted him with a sort of exasperated awkwardness : pardon me , monsieur le maire—
he hands me a sermon and his purse as presents
in better days , you ’ d only have had to look in my cupboards and you ’ d have seen for yourself that i wasn ’ t some slut living in a pigsty
cosette resumed her work , but for more than fifteen minutes she felt her heart skipping in her chest like a great snowflake

so he told himself : but it doesn ’ t mean anything , there ’ s nothing written there
supporting evidence , you understand ; a way of getting back on the trail of things and pinning the crime on the criminal
satan has two names—he is called satan and he is called lying
we both say that this house is not a bit safe ; that , if monseigneur will let me , i ’ ll go and tell paulin musebois , the locksmith , to come and put the old locks back on the door ; they ’ re just over there , it ’ ll only take a minute
pleasure—what a sad goal , what a puny ambition !
what would they think of a bishop who was frightened off ?
so what ’ s his name ?
the painting somehow restored his father to life and it suddenly stopped being the sign from the montfermeil tavern to become a resurrection ; in it a grave cracked open , a phantom rose to its feet , marius could hear his blood thumping at his temples , he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears , his bleeding father dimly painted on that sinister panel terrified him , he felt as though that amorphous blob was staring straight at him
this order of perpetual adoration is not all that old , going back no further than two hundred years
i ’ ll tell you what hurt me
every bishop worth his salt has his squadron of cherubic seminarians on patrol maintaining order in the episcopal palace and mounting guard over monseigneur ’ s smile
whatever the strange interior tranquillity just mentioned , the barricade , for those who remain inside it , remains no less unreal , a hallucination
) , as they said in the lower alps , and puerte un bouen moutou embe un bouen froumage grase ( a good sheep gives a good fat cheese ) , as they said in the upper dauphiné
all the streets were deserted , all the doors were open
he was a great man ; so much the worse , or so much the better ; the lesson is more to the point
well , then , mother hucheloup !
i hit ’ em with a bit of sound and fury about honour , and morality , and virtue !
royal houses are like those indian fig trees whose every branch hangs down all the way to the ground and takes root there to become itself a fig tree
because , if madame sees someone else carried it for me , she ’ ll belt me
the general movement that seemed to have been vaguely taking off had aborted ; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of the generals could now focus on the three or four barricades still standing
yet at nightfall , at the moment when the light went and in winter especially , at the hour when the icy evening breeze ripped the last red leaves off the elms , when the gloom was deep and starless , or when the moon and the wind punched holes in the clouds , the boulevard suddenly became terrifying
the louis , which she had on her in the same apron pocket the fifteen-sou coin had fallen out of the night before , kept distracting her
it ’ s a simple story
it seems that in extreme situations we often move around to ask the advice of all we might encounter in our travels
through the broken window , you could see snow falling
the wax used to be made with resin and lamp black and cost four francs a pound
cosette was sleeping soundly
she reappeared in this darkness , in this garret , in this diseased dump of a place , in this horror !
basically , there is only one harsh and cruel breaking story : you are not where what decides your fate happens
the result of this secret conference was a wonderful pleasure trip that took place the following sunday , the four young men inviting the four young women along
the moon , which had just risen behind her , cast her shadow in front of her on the lawn as she came out of the flowerbeds
do you remember our endless happiness ,
one day , having gone to vernon to visit his brother , he came across colonel pontmercy on the bridge and recognized the man from saint-sulpice
some poor devil , coming back to his hovel later , would find that his door had been opened , sometimes even forced open , in his absence
he felt a certain chill
does art mean listening or looking , for the art lover ?
as he became more successful , invitations rained down on him
homuncio , number as plautus would say
cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she took care of expenses , which were extremely modest
he hasn ’ t come back all day , and you know this is the time he has his dinner
you , too , you love me , my cosette
it ’ s mine , the lady ?
at the rue sainte-croix-de-la-bretonnerie , twenty or so young men , with beards and long hair , went into a bar and came out again a moment later carrying a horizontal tricolour flag covered in crepe ; at their head were three armed men , one with a sword , the second with a fusil , the third with a pike
she shut herself away , which her rule allowed her to do , and hid every time she wanted to contemplate it
there was no one there but the two of them
the inspector merely answered :
as she sat down , she noticed , over where she had just been , a rather big stone that had definitely not been there a moment before
i ’ ve done twelve leagues
this tough , gruff cloister was not so immured , however , that the life of the outside world , with its passions , its drama , and even its novels , did not penetrate
he repeated : long live the republic !
he thought no more about it
she called herself fantine
it humiliates me to think i ’ m the same age as that cue ball
father madeleine had him carried to an infirmary that he had set up for his workers in the same building as his factory and that was serviced by two sisters of charity
that ’ s the sort of dastardly deed they go in for these days
father and daughter , arm in arm , had just passed in front of marius ’ s seat
huge patrols , composed of regular battalions of the line flanked by whole companies of national guards and preceded by a police commissioner in full regalia , set off to reconnoitre the insurgent streets
how could he come to stare into the barricade , only to slink off all atremble saying : actually , i ’ ve had enough of this , i ’ ve seen it , that ’ s enough , it ’ s civil war , i ’ ll be on my way !
marius fixed his desperate eyes on that gloomy house , as black and as silent as a tomb , and even emptier
fall of the girondins
and at the same time he shook off his bonds ; they had been cut
when he came back downstairs , the concierge intercepted him : well , then , doctor ?
repression , having the army , does not count men and , having vincennes , number does not count shots
from behind , against the light , the camera shows us two men on a seat watching the sun go down and the endless movement of the waves
marius stepped into his room and slammed the door shut behind him
who could have written them ?
the four cannons echoed each other dolefully
as we said , for a long while monsieur gillenormand ’ s outlook had rubbed him the wrong way
javert knew this and venerated her especially because of it
he pursued : monsieur le baron , a sewer is not the champ de mars
i tell you it is her
this pathetic crisis in contemporary history , which parisians like to remember as the days of the riots , is surely a typical moment in the stormy episodes of this century
why didn ’ t you say anything ?
the position was good and the tavern was handed down from father to son
whatever the case may be , the said jean valjean has just been brought before the circuit court of the département of the var charged with committing highway robbery under arms , about eight years ago , on the person of one of those honest children who , as the patriarch of ferneynumber has written in immortal verse ,
god the father is there !
he was well aware that this was his greatest duty and his greatest work
that gave each man fifteen shots to fire
marius had gone and sat himself down at a table and was leaning with the corner of his mouth hooked on a curled finger
you were quite naked three quarters of the time , my good man
the brujon of number was the father of the brujon of number the latter , of whom we only caught a glimpse in the gorbeau ambush , was a strapping young lad , extremely cunning and extremely adroit , with a stunned , mournful look
when love has melted and blended two beings in an angelic and sacred unity , the secret of life is open to them ; they are nothing more , then , than the two sides of a single destiny ; they are nothing more than the two wings of a single spirit
how many of us are there ?
i ’ m not part of yours
and he threw a thousand-franc note at thénardier
just as well you recognize the fact !
he was gay and violent yet , as before , but his gaiety had a convulsive hardness about it as though it contained pain and anger , and his violent outbursts always ended in a sort of sweet and gloomy exhaustion
but , for my sake , i want you to know who i am
everything is black except the band , which is white
it ’ s so you have more stuff worth eating in your sack
the great wars of africa and spain , the eradication of the sicilian pirates , the introduction of civilization into gaul , britain , and germany—all that glory spans the rubiconnumber there is a sort of delicacy in divine justice here , when it hesitates to let the formidable historian loose on the illustrious usurper , saving caesar from tacitus and allowing the genius extenuating circumstances
every day , at every moment , through the wall , he could hear them walking , coming and going , talking , and he hadn ’ t even listened !
at times she laughed as she muttered to herself
mother thénardier , petrified and dumb , started in on her conjectures again : what the hell is this old codger ?
marius felt this question like a jab to the heart
the bolt slid and the gate turned
it was new , it was a change
he wouldn ’ t for all the world have taken a step toward the little bastard , but he suffered
wellington is classic warfare getting its revenge
at that moment the young cock ’ s voice of little gavroche rang out through the barricade
the postman shouted to the man to stop , but the traveller wouldn ’ t hear of it and went on his way at a rapid trot
he did not answer
every soldier in the troop was as much a hero as the general
what about the surprise ?
yet another was killed in the rue grenier-saint-lazare
unpleasantness of putting up a pauper who might just be rich
now and then , at intervals , when the wind came on , you could vaguely hear cries , a noise , a sort of tumultuous jangling , which was gunfire , and dull knocking sounds , which were cannon blasts
i realized my brother was no longer with me
he really did have his doubts
monsieur , that ’ s what he was angling for ; he ’ s as gentle as a lamb and he rides like the wind
for this research , marius was away from home for four days
well , hurry up and get her here
woe to the defenceless beings around him !
they ’ d be nabbed before they fully surfaced
preparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical slowness ; after which , all hell breaks loose
let ’ s see who monsieur marius was
but apart from this , his usual diet consisted of little more than boiled vegetables and soup made with olive oil
that is nothing more than the passing vanity of torrents swollen by a storm
this file of cars , whatever it was , was doleful
the timber yard on the rue transnonain was ransacked for barricades
just supposing you need me one night , you know where to find me
forgive me , i ’ m talking to you , but i don ’ t know what i ’ m saying , perhaps i ’ m annoying you , am i annoying you ?
the other man replied with some hesitation , scratching his head under his greek cap : that sounds pretty solid
the face stayed in his mind
in work like this , everything is dance , dance involving 'bodies without hands , twisted legs , wavering identity expressing who knows what self- hatred '
madame has gone out with monsieur and is not back yet , basque told him
not being listened to is no reason to keep quiet
don ’ t imagine you ’ ve changed much in the universe , just because your trousse-galant , as they used to call it , now goes by the name of cholera morbus , number and just because your bourrée goes by the name of the cachucha
illicit love is a sin ; so be it
they went and had dinner at rousseau ’ s and spent six francs
at every turn , he asked the doctor : there ’ s no danger anymore , is there ?
as a young man he had been stationed as a warden in the galleys of the south
this is because he has a pearl in his soul , innocence , and pearls do not dissolve in mud
the leprosy of monasticism has gnawed to the bone two wonderful nations , italy and spain , one the light , the other the splendour of europe for centuries , and in our day these two illustrious peoples are only just beginning to heal , thanks to the wholesome and vigorous hygiene of number
one fine day my heart will fly away ;
father fauchelevent , apart from the glory we have just recounted and of which he was completely ignorant , was rewarded for his good deed ; first , he was glad he ’ d done it , it made him happy ; and then , he had a lot less work to do now he was sharing the load
he had only to leave things alone
i ’ ve had a gut full of misery !
he would sit on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit trellis and he would gaze at the stars through the scrawny stunted silhouettes of his fruit trees
all of human destiny lies in that particular dilemma
turns into manipulation , pure and simple
such collisions are constantly taking shape , bringing things together and pulling them apart ; it is a matter of life and death
he would have dreaded those sublime peaks from which a few rare , not to say great , men , like swedenborg or pascal , number have slid down into madness
in paris , the faubourg saint-marceau was almost as hectic as the faubourg saint-antoine and the schools were buzzing just as much as the faubourgs
this one individual alone weighed more than the population of the world
she went back to bed , telling herself : that means he ’ s really worried !
that cosette continue to love him !
this is , let sympathetic souls not forget , the foremost of fraternal obligations ; it is , let self-centred hearts be aware , the first and foremost of political necessities
no budding ambition was silly enough to attempt to blossom in his shadow
whatever the case may be , even when they have fallen , especially when they have fallen , those men are honourable who , at the four corners of the globe , their eyes fixed on france , fight for the great cause with the inflexible logic of the ideal ; they give their lives as a pure sacrifice for progress ; they carry out the will of providence ; they commit a religious act
cosette was a condensation of dawn light in the form of a woman
and he grabs his pen
and do you have far to go ?
not a shutter was pushed open
disabled officers followed immediately behind carrying branches of laurel
they all wanted to be in on it
how to get ahead , succeed—that is the lesson that trickles down , drop by drop , from the overriding corruption on high
that ’ s his form of courage , as he says
we should say how it got that name
there was nothing ahead , nothing behind
she pocketed the coin and contented herself with throwing the child a ferocious look , saying :
there are earwigs in the ursulines depots , there are millipedes at the panthéon , there are tadpoles in the moats of the champ de mars
icy silence inside the fiacre
they had stolen , raped , looted , killed , murdered
the social order has its starless miners
we are not saying that the portrait of the man we offer here is accurate ; we will restrict ourselves to the claim that it is a passing likeness
his housekeeper , too , was a permutation on innocence
in the throes of violent emotions , you do not read , you wrestle to the ground , so to speak , the piece of paper you are holding , you strangle it like a victim , you crush it , you dig your nails into it with your anger or your delight ; you race to the end , you jump to the beginning ; attention is feverish ; it understands the essential , overall , more or less ; but then it seizes on a point and all the rest disappears
meat ’ s dear , ma patagon !
it ’ s better , said jean valjean
wide open gloomy country where there was no grass
but it ’ s cold here
what do you want of me ?
it imparts to those it seizes some mysterious extraordinary power
the silence was now so profound on the side where the attack would surely come that enjolras got everyone to take up their positions once more
the shopkeeper who says : montpellier available , marseillesnumber good quality ; the stockbroker who says : carryover rate , premium , end current account ; the gambler who says : a run of three sees you out , spades it is ; the bailiff of the norman isles who says : the enfeoffor who closes on his property can not claim the fruits of this property during the seizure of the immovable property of the defaulting tenant ; the vaudevillian who says : they baited the bear ( for they booed the play ) ; the actor who says : i was a flop ; the philosopher who says : phenomenal triplicity ; the whale hunter who says : there she blows , there she breaches ; the phrenologistnumber who says : amativeness , combativeness , secretiveness ; the foot soldier who says : my clarinette ( for his musket ) ; the horseman who says : my indian chicken ( for his horse ) ; the fencing master who says : tierce , quarte , break ; the printer who says : let ’ s use boldface—all of them , printer , fencing master , horseman , foot soldier , phrenologist , whale hunter , philosopher , actor , vaudeville writer , bailiff , gambler , stockbroker , shopkeeper , all of them are talking slang
a deep-rooted and bizarre formation
believe me , do not take on the dreadful drudgery of being a layabout
that is how they reasoned
cosette only dimly remembered her childhood
if the supreme being had gven me the talent for it , i could have been the baron thénard , member of the institute ( académie des ciences ) , but i am not
but it had forced him nonetheless to wrap up his hand in some linen and to wear his arm in a sling , and so had prevented him from signing anything
up you come , kidlingtons !
then she was quiet for a moment
all of them except laigle were from the south
the mob is a traitor to the people
gavroche was thinking alongside him
to inform on someone , in the vibrant language of slang , is known as manger le morceau , to eat the morsel , the pound of flesh
this is where he became alarmed ; his balance was out of whack , the scales tipped ; one of the scale pans toppled into the abyss , the other flew off up into the heavens ; and javert was no less horrified by the one on high than by the one down below
let me give you a word of friendly advice
they had been put on the bottom floor as a precaution
we ’ ll all live together
it had to be providence taking on a horrible guise , with the good angel crawling out of the ground in the form of thénardier
the whole family , including basque and nicolette , were gathered together in marius ’ s room when cosette came in
was he a grandfather ?
at the present day , for example , the hybrid ship with propeller is an amazing machine hauled along by sails three thousand square meters in surface and by a number-horsepower boiler
the locket opened when you pressed a spring
jean valjean , as we say , had his back to the light and was in any case so disfigured , so covered with mud and blood , that at high noon he would have been unrecognizable
and those that aren ’ t little rotters are nincompoops !
this armchair is for you
we were talking about a neighbour we once had who , ever since she ’ d moved into the street , used to always work with her window open
god delivers his will as visible in events , an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue
fauchelevent fell on his knees
mass has not been said here since the carnage
one evening—it was the fourth of june , though that did not stop old gillenormand from having a roaring fire going in his fireplace—he had dismissed his daughter , who was quietly sewing in the next room
thénardier had gone bankrupt , the inn was closed , and nobody knew what had become of him
had he embarked on this amorous adventure that had ended in his marriage to cosette a bit too carelessly to take in his surroundings ?
and the mother ’ s pale face would brighten
meanwhile , in a matter of minutes , twenty iron bars had been ripped off the grate over the shop front of the tavern , twenty yards of pavement had been ripped up , gavroche and bahorel had seized and tipped over the narrow dray of a lime manufacturer named anceau , this dray containing three barrels full of lime , which they stashed under the piles of cobblestones ; enjolras had lifted up the trapdoor to the cellar and all the widow hucheloup ’ s empty kegs had gone to flank the barrels of lime ; feuilly , with his fingers accustomed to colouring the delicate blades of fans , had buttressed the barrels and the dray with two massive piles of rubble
thénardier stood up quietly , went to the fireplace , removed the screen and stood it against the nearby pallet , thereby revealing the stove full of burning charcoal , in which the prisoner could see perfectly clearly the white-hot chisel , dotted here and there with little bright red stars
the gravedigger stopped in his tracks
marius hardly recognized , in this polite office clerk ’ s smile , the almost bestial maw foaming away in a frenzy only a moment before
camille desmoulinsnumber was from the suburbs
would she ever find him again ?
it will be my little girl
it was cosette sobbing
the sewer , for instance , rebelled against any itinerary
we absolutely must do something about those guns , said enjolras , and he shouted , open fire on the gunners !
i ’ ll do all i can to prove my zeal to the community
the cart was loaded to the brim
let ’ s hope he ’ s at home !
apart from this , he had never loved any woman as much as a tulip bulb or any man as much as an elzevir typeface
the door yielded to the pressure , silently and imperceptibly opening the gap a little wider
and then again , she was no longer the school boarder with her felt hat , her merino wool frock , her school shoes , and her chapped hands ; taste had come to her with beauty ; she was now dressed well with a sort of simple , rich , unmannered elegance
then came a motley crowd in countless numbers , excited , strange , the sectionariesnumber of the friends of the people , the school of law , the school of medicine , refugees of all nations , number bearing spanish , italian , german , polish flags , horizontal red-white-and-blue flags and every kind of banner imaginable , children waving branches of greenery , stonemasons and carpenters who were out on strike at that very moment , printers recognizable by their paper caps , walking two by two , three by three , letting out shouts , nearly all of them waving sticks , some sabres , in disarray and yet as one at heart , now a pushing and shoving crush , now a column
the best are not exempt from selfish thoughts
he removed my cataracts , he said to himself
i don ’ t have one
enjolras , carrying as he did the whole barricade in his head , held himself in reserve , saving his strength and keeping under cover ; three soldiers in a row fell beneath his battlement without even seeing him
and that , to thank him , the prioress would admit his brother into the house as a gardener and his niece as a boarder
however much of a dreamer , marius was , as we know , a strong and active person
at the corner where the two streets met , a man was standing with his back against a wall
respect was complete , unanimous , warm , and friendly , and there came a moment , around number , when the words monsieur le maire were spoken in montreuil-sur-mer in the same tone as the words monseigneur the bishop had been spoken in digne in number people came from thirty miles around to consult monsieur madeleine
marius felt proud of this man he didn ’ t know
the man picked up again as he ate
the students were to deliberate over this
i ’ ve read a lot of plato , but none of it has stuck ;
and he set his shovel in motion once more
gavroche was a gamin of letters
the farm buildings border the yard to the south
these range from the surrealist images of happiness , whose burlesque lightness of touch seems mockingly to undermine the promises of the official version of happiness , despite the conformism of the script , to the militant images produced by the cine-train , rolling across russia to shoot from life and immediately relay to the interested parties the debates of people taking control of factories , land or housing ; from official images made surrealist – or surrealist images made official ?
i so wanted to see you , i ’ ve got special leave
the funny thing was that there was another man in the sewer—someone other than himself
life , sap , heat , fragrance , spilled over ; you could feel the hugeness of the spring underlying creation ; in all these puffs of air saturated with love , in this to-ing and fro-ing of reverberations and reflections , in this wildly extravagant spree of sunbeams , in this endless outpouring of liquid gold , you could feel the prodigality of the inexhaustible ; and , behind this splendour , as behind a curtain of flame , you caught a glimpse of god , that millionaire in stars
and what a stroke of luck that all he did was steal !
his ideas began to get tangled up again
i ’ m warning you just so you know
at that point , as we said , he gave a shudder of revolt
one sunday night , maubert isabeau , the baker on the church square in faverolles , was getting ready to go to bed when he heard a loud crash and the sound of breaking glass at the barred window of his shop
why am i sticking my oar in ?
being hoodwinked by infinity !
for several days he had not eaten or slept
dévisser le coco , to unscrew the coconut—wring someone ’ s neck ; tortiller , to wolf down—to eat ; être gerbé , to cop it—to be sentenced ; un rat , a rat—a bread thief ; il lansquine , to pelt down daggers—to rain , a striking age-old image that , in a way , bears its own date with it , assimilating the long slanting lines of rain with the thick angled pikes of the lansquenets , and capturing in a single word the popular metonymy : it ’ s raining pitchforks
and he tried to pass his arm under her to lift her up
and breton 's 'surrealism ' , following hot on the heels of dada , emerged fully arned from the fireworks of the great '\tar where common reality was suddenly transfigured by the magic of explosives and poison gases at y pres and verdun
a water jug with a broken neck covered half a wall
he had not yet uttered a word , no one seemed to realize he was still there , standing as he was , straight and motionless , behind all these happy people
at this word , jean valjean became fierce
there is no other
who is this man ?
it ’ s someone who looks like him
a people won ’ t let themselves be pushed around
the convent is a compression chamber that has to keep working for an entire life , if it is to triumph over the human heart
when he occasionally let loose—and who doesn ’ t ? —with an : oh , if only i were rich ! —it was not ogling some young filly , like old man gillenormand , but gazing at a book
i kissed your fresh round arms on the wing
i cart madame magloire away , go to my room and i pray for him and i fall asleep
and it ’ s extremely urgent
a dilemma , the choice between destruction or salvation , which no act of fate poses more inexorably than love does
it was at that juncture that the profound observation about a rather greedy parrot who belonged to a lady boarder was made : isn ’ t it cute !
at that moment , the dragoons and the crowd came together , face-to-face
how could he come this far , only to turn back !
your horse is weary , go back to tinques
that done , he fainted
i ’ m a damned idiot , he said
there is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the splendours down below among the dregs
he was becoming a murderer !
how can we ultimately fail to twig that the apparent impiety of contemporary art is only ever the inverted image of sacred art , the reversal of the creator 's initial question : why is there something instead of nothing ?
all that could be placed at his disposal was a paltry village sacristy with a few old chasubles of worn-out damask dolled up with imitation braid
but there ’ s no danger today
he always ate alone , with a book open in front of him , reading
you are my master
society clamoured for him
had he bribed the officer ?
there was an all-powerful magnetism between herself and marius that made her , instinctively and almost automatically , do whatever marius wanted
favourite went on : oh yes , and i ’ d set the guards on you !
was it a fortress ?
the bravery was almost barbaric , mixed up as it was with a sort of heroic ferocity that began with self-sacrifice
like venice , you will have an artificial power , or like england a material power ; you will be the evil rich
too much tin in cast guns makes them oversensitive
he had before his eyes an unheard-of vision , a sort of reenactment of the most horrible moment of his life , played by his ghost
why doesn ’ t what ’ s-his-name ever hang his keys on the hook on thursdays ?
everything about her is fresh , smooth , young , sweet morning light
he did not budge from his seat and only went home when the gates of the luxembourg were closing
the man unfolded the piece of paper , looked at it , but his mind was clearly elsewhere
they both had wings , one the wings of an angel , the other of a goose
he ’ s one of the neighbours
under the long vaulted corridor that ends in the arche-marion , a rag-and-bone man ’ s sack , perfectly preserved , was the admiration of connoisseurs
the thief , too , has his cannon fodder , robbable material—you , me , whoever happens to be passing by , le pantre , sucker , the ordinary everyman
god could give me his brightest star ,
she had left poverty behind and was embarking on life
combeferre lived a much more normal life than enjolras
they have given their poor and widows and orphans the right to mow their meadows three days before everyone elsenumber when their houses are tumbling down , they rebuild them for free
father , marius plowed on , my good , dear father , if you only knew !
in stirring up so many gloomy notions , his courage never failed him but his brain hurt , and he began to think of other things in spite of himself , meaningless things
everything has to be over a good quarter of an hour beforehand
this is in everyone ’ s interest , not just mine ; i am madeleine , and madeleine i remain
he thought they were looking at him because of his old clothes and that they were laughing at him ; the fact is that they looked at him because of his grace , which set them dreaming
you could hear them say to one another : where ’ ve you got your pistol ?
marius heard the clatter of charcoal being knocked by tongs or some other iron instrument and jondrette continued :
the stern ancestor had made way for the grandfather
enjolras had gone on reconnaissance
from time to time , the man turned and checked whether he was being followed
almost all of them show scuff marks from musketry
i say , then , that he marched up to the bench the way i ’ d say : hannibal marched on rome
in the nineteenth century , religious notions are in turmoil
you know the rest
he asked cosette : would you like to go to the luxembourg ?
o gnawing sex , your pretty little white teeth crave sugar
two days in a row was too much
why was he in this wood ?
this was observed by the bread crumbs that were found on the tiled floor when the law later ordered a search
no , answered jean valjean
my hands are numb
how is monsieur ’ s arm ?
you can understand why
you could not see his forehead , which was hidden under his hat , you could not see his eyes , which were buried under his eyebrows , you could not see his chin , which was plunged into his cravat , you could not see his hands , which were retracted into his sleeves , you could not see his walking stick , which he carried under his redingote
we should say that , in growing old , mademoiselle gillenormand had actually gained more than she had lost
accordingly , in the official proceedings of the festival of federation of july , michelet reads the monuments of fledgling fraternity ’
you see , what is now the prefecture used to be the bishop ’ s palace before the revolution
he had bivouacked at dion-le-mont and set out at dawn
in switzerland , this monopoly-holder of the richest princely domains in france had sold an old horse to be able to eat
where is this argenteuil ?
the paris sewer has been an awesome old thing
they are souls with senses
but this is the place , if you ’ re looking for lost women , grantaire growled behind his back
she ’ s touched it with her filthy hands !
from number , he supported and applauded all demonstrations of hostility toward him
yes , you murderous swine !
wherever a railway station has been set on the edge of a capital city , it has spelled the death of a local neighbourhood and the birth of a township
enjolras , who had not said a word till then , broke his silence and addressed courfeyrac : you mean atonement follows hot on the heels of the crime
social prosperity means the human being happy , the citizen free , the nation great
ah , you ’ re putting on your manly voice , monsieur
well , give me a kiss , then
dictator , but despot ; despot issuing from a republic and symbolizing a revolution
already it was almost too late
the saint bartholomewsnumber filter into it , drop by drop , seeping through the cobblestones
he had a huge embrace
said the ventriloquist , snickering
no doubt you ’ re having people over this evening
the chapter assembled once a week ; the prioress presided , the vocal mothers attended
was he to remain the sort of father , rarely seen but respected , that he had been till then ?
since number , it has begun to grow through the staircase
they could see a sparkling hedge of bayonets rippling above the barricade
i never cease to marvel
jean valjean walked along it , though pretty painfully
yet i told you to pay attention !
a person could spend eternity in such bottomless pits
never , since his childhood , since his mother , since his sister , never had he met with a kind word or a kind look
he began to move again and strode to the other end of the drawing room
the most mediocre listener will do for someone who has been silent far too long
a young girl was hoeing and pulling up weeds in a field where a big yellow poster , probably for some fairground show , fluttered and flapped in the wind
fortune once smiled on me

they went in through the gates , visited the statue of the anchoritenumber in its grotto , gave themselves a few thrills in the famous hall of mirrors , a lascivious snare fit for a satyr-cum-millionaire or a turcaret metamorphosed into priapusnumber they rattled the swing that hung from two chestnuts celebrated by the abbé de bernisnumber while he gave each gorgeous girl a turn on the swing , one after the other , amid general hilarity due to a flying up of skirts that would have been grist for the mill for greuze , number the toulousian tholomyès , who was something of a spaniard , toulouse being a sister city of tolosa , sang to the tune of a melancholy lament the old gallega songnumber probably inspired by some beautiful girl zooming high in the air on a rope between two trees :
through the black words delivered , he glimpsed only one thing at all clearly and that was that an ambush was being set up , an obscure but terrible ambush ; that they were both in serious danger , she probably , her father for sure ; that they had to be saved , that the hideous schemes of the jondrettes had to be undone and the web of these spiders torn down

the year number was , however , indicated by two objects that were in vogue at the time with the middle class and were sitting on a table , to wit , a kaleidoscope and an iridescent tin lamp
what it thereby accompanies on screen is a minute yet decisive change in the appearance of the faces and attitudes of the colonized , in the happiness ’ they express : they respond to the surprise of these imposed exercises with attention , with a certain pride in playing the game , as perfectly as possible , before the blackboard at school or the iron at the forge

championnet , number who abused miracles , was a child of the streets of paris ; when still very little , he flooded the porticoes of saint-jean-de-beauvais and saint-étienne-du-mont , and he was on such intimate terms with saint geneviève ’ s shrine as to order about saint januarius ’ s glass vial , causing the blood to suddenly liquefy at will

isolation , detachment from everything , pride , independence , a love of nature , lack of any daily physical activity , living for himself , the secret struggles of chastity , benign rapture before all creation—all had prepared marius for this possession we call passion

as he was about to grab this bar , a hand shot out suddenly from the shadows and clapped itself on his arm
at that moment , the bludgeoning , multiplied by a hundred hands , was reaching a crescendo and extended to include whacking with the flats of swords ; the galley slaves crouched down , bent double , under this storm of whips and clubs ; a ghastly obeisance was produced by the torture and all fell silent , with the look of chained wolves
keep the eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand
little by little , however , dim outlines began to form and hold their shape in his mind and he could perceive with the precision of reality , not the situation in its entirety , but some of the details
you want to take the thunderclap to task
jean valjean thought that other bandits were perhaps hidden in some recess , not far away , and that thénardier was not too keen to share any spoils with them
he was a mastiff watching a thief
when , in this mysterious travail , he had completely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin , when he had stripped off the aristocrat , the jacobin , and the royalist , when he was fully revolutionary , profoundly democratic , and almost republican , he went to an engraver on the quai des orfèvres and ordered from him a hundred calling cards bearing this name : baron marius pontmercynumber
he came to the lane , recognized the apple tree , checked the fruit shed , examined the hedge ; a hedge is a leg up
someone ’ s coming , said the prowler , making a move as though to go
a native of provence , he had easily picked up all the different dialects of the south
the distress of the people ; labourers with no bread ; the last prince de condé vanishing into the shadows ; brussels chasing nassau outnumber the way paris chased the bourbons ; belgium offering itself to a french prince and handed over to an english prince ; the russian hatred of nicholas ; at our rear two demons from the south , ferdinand in spain , miguel in portugal ; the earth quaking in italy , metternich extending his hand over bologna ; france manhandling austria at ancona ; in the north the mysteriously sinister sound of a hammer nailing polandnumber back into its coffin ; in all of europe furious eyes on france ; england , a suspect ally , ready to shove over whatever might bend and to throw itself on whatever might fall ; the peerage taking refuge behind beccaria just to keep four heads from the law ; the fleur-de-lis scratched off the king ’ s carriage , the cross torn down from notre-dame ; number lafayette diminished , laffitte ruined , benjamin constant dead in dire poverty , casimir périer dead in the exhaustion of power ; the political disease and the social disease breaking out at the same time in the two capitals of the realm , the one the city of thought , the other the city of work : in paris , civil war , in lyon , servile war ; in both cities , the same laval glare of the furnace ; the crimson of the crater reflected on the forehead of the people ; the south fanaticized , the west churned up ; the duchesse de berry in the vendée ; number plots , conspiracies , uprisings , cholera , added to the grim noise of ideas the grim tumult of events
yet she felt something inside that resembled hope and joy and that wafted upward to the heavens
but boulatruelle ’ s shenanigans in the woods stopped and he went back to his regular hours as a road-mender
monsieur gillenormand followed him with his eyes and the moment the door opened and marius was about to go out , he darted forward four steps with that senile vivacity imperious and spoiled old men have , grabbed marius by the collar , marched him back energetically into the room , threw him into an armchair and said to him : tell me about it !
the maréchal , training his field glasses that way , had answered : four or five thousand men , sire
the girls trilled and twittered away like warblers who ’ d escaped from their cages
this is working well , said bossuet to enjolras
the bishop had not closed it
to understand what is about to follow , we have to remember that at this time the bastille guardhouse was located on the other side of the square and that what happened near the elephant could not be seen or heard by the sentinel
he said to himself
you see how they ’ ve stuck a bell on my shank as if i was some kind of wild beast
it had exploited cleverly enough the nation ’ s weariness and the hate mothers felt
sister simplice did not have a mirror ; she rummaged through a chest and pulled out a little mirror the infirmary doctor used to check if a patient was dead , no longer breathing
his sister got an annuity of five hundred francs , which was enough for her personal expenses , living at the presbytery
solve these two problems , encourage the rich and protect the poor , eliminate misery , put an end to the unjust exploitation of the weak by the strong , curb the iniquitous jealousy of the man on the way up for the man who has arrived , adjust , in a manner that is both mathematical and fraternal , wages to work , add free and compulsory education to the growth of the child and make science the basis of manhood , develop the intelligence while keeping the hands busy , be at once a powerful nation and a family of happy people , democratize property ownership , not by abolishing it but by universalizing it , so that every citizen without exception is a property owner , which is easier to do than you think , in short , work out how to produce wealth and work out how to parcel it out , and you will have material greatness and moral greatness all in one—and you will be worthy of calling yourselves france
she dropped the swaddled sword , which only half satisfied her , and ran her eyes slowly around the room
he turned round now and then to have a look
those words , monsieur le maire , had a strange effect on fantine
enjolras remained lost in thought
monsieur le maire , it ’ s just on five o ’ clock
you ’ ll come and have a drink with me
monsieur gillenormand went on : cannons in the courtyard of the museum !
this was the last swing of the pendulum
for a few seconds , jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by all that awesome yet soft serenity ; such moments of forgetting occur ; suffering stops harassing the miserable ; all worry slips away ; peace wraps the dreamer like night ; and in the glow of twilight the soul twinkles with stars , mimicking the sky as it lights up
although not one person was moving , you could hear shuffling in the mud
that was eight years ago ; yet it seemed to him only yesterday
when she had read it thoroughly , she kissed it and tucked it inside her corset
poor devils , he said
everyone was in tears
who could these pages come from ?
is there a straw we won ’ t clutch at when we feel ourselves drowning ?
in a week we will be in england
no grant from the king to the people
but this scraping job had weakened the bolting on the hull
where can he possibly have got to ?
besides , a lawyer can always be found
the conventionist began to gasp for breath ; the asthma produced by approaching death , which makes the last intakes of air so laboured , broke up his voice , and yet the perfect lucidity of his soul shone on in his eyes
it was the cemetery gates closing
they tied the bandits up
the reason is that symmetry spells boredom and boredom is the very essence of grief
wellington had backed off
though he never admitted it to himself , for it would have made him furious and ashamed , monsieur gillenormand had never loved any mistress the way he loved marius
everything would smash to smithereens , most likely , but at least then no one ’ d have anything , and that ’ d be something !
it is the fictional play of the significant and the a-significant , and its cinematographic application to the play of the double gaze , that give the image its documentary power
the tall man that courfeyrac , combeferre , and enjolras had noticed the moment he approached the crowd at the corner of the rue des billettes was making himself useful working on the small barricade
you have to be used to the twists of fate and being caught up in them to dare lift your eyes when certain questions appear in all their horrible starkness
it puts on word-masks and rag-metaphors
when you ’ re as lovesick as a tiger , the least you can do is fight like a lion
again the old biddies were not at a loss for words : the man ’ s a clod , quite uneducated
she went on : friends !
that was where his bed was
marius was dying and jean valjean worn out
napoléon is dead , said a passerby to one of the war wounded from marengo and waterloo
yesterday there was appetite , today there is fullness , tomorrow there will be satiety
it will come , citizens , the day when all will be peace , harmony , light , joy , and life , it will come
but just you try and prove anything !
but the failure of the genre painter to rise to history painting also heralds a time when it is genre painting , the repre­sentation of nondescript lives , that will be the exemplary manifestation of historicity
and lieutenant théodule woke up
jean valjean had already forgotten the means he had used to get cosette to stay quiet
the english guards lay in ambush in these rooms ; the spiral staircase , split from the ground floor right up to the roof , looks like the inside of a broken shell
if ever the sic vos non vobisnumber was applicable , it surely is to the village of waterloo
what are you doing turning up here , since it ’ s a no-go ?
at those words , coming once more from jean valjean , all that was welling up in marius ’ s heart found an outlet and he burst out : cosette , do you hear that ?
jean valjean was immediately sent to toulon jail
it ’ s thanks to the paris faubourien that revolution conquers europe , once the armies get involved
from that day forth , they adored each other
what could he do ?
can the soul be entirely remade by destiny and become bad if that destiny is bad ?
so then blondeau looks at me with the sweet smile of a tiger and he says : if you are pontmercy , you are not laigle
bahorel , in ecstasies over the barricade , cried : there ’ s the street nicely cropped off for you !
the ideal for javert was not to be humane , to be great , to be sublime ; it was to be irreproachable
d like hamlet reinterpreted by the east german defector heine muller , the warhol-machine no longer has something to say about the 'worker ' , but only about the 'unemployed '
there will be only the four cantor mothers , mother ascension , and you in the chapel
do you mean greece ?
the driver , foreseeing a long wait , fitted the muzzles of his horses into the nosebag of oats , wet at the bottom , which is so familiar to parisians , being—this said in brackets—something the various governments sometimes apply to them
he came to a wall
no conjecture was possible
here is what marius heard : listen carefully
do not they also say that , on the night of new year 's eve , the 'post-mortem ' duo of bob marley and his daughter-in-law , lauren hill , could be heard all over new y ork ?
this was a moment beyond words for jean valjean
in it , ordinary life is represented – that is , supplanted – by its materials themselves , by the detritus that gives it its concrete texture
it begins with a kiss , said blachevelle
at home , except when he got up or went to bed , he never wore a dressing gown
what are you trying to say ?
then he crossed the overcoat over in front : the coat ’ s too big , of course … never mind , he added
without limits , there is no value ; without value , there is no esteem , no respect and especially no pi ty : death to the referee !
marius ’ s arms were hanging around his neck and his feet dangling behind him
now , no blade is simple
this man was ready-made
the father asked : which cheek did he slap ?
give me your orders , most reverend mother
where have all the beautiful girls gone ,
you boo the victim to encourage him
when a being that is dear to us is about to die , you look at them with a look that clings to them in an effort to hold them back
the troops broke down the doors of houses from which there had been firing
and at a sign from courfeyrac , the mob rushed into the rue de la chanvrerie
the fiend dimly takes shape ; it is every man for himself
the hour had sounded in the nick of time
second , yes or no , are you the freed convict jean valjean ?
my name is euphrasie
it was the first time since they were married that she had dared criticize an act of the master
the snow was falling twice as heavily and filled the air
in just a few minutes , the mob with its thousand hands had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty fusils , nearly all double-barrelled , sixty-four swords , and eighty-three pistols
why haven ’ t you put her in my bed so that i ’ d see her the moment i opened my eyes ?
in a quiet , humdrum situation , thénardier had all it takes to play—we do not say to be—what passes for an honest tradesman , a decent burgher
we ’ re still in the rue de l ’ homme-armé
gavroche was still holding the cellar rat in his hand
this woman , as far as anyone could tell , must once have loved this man with whatever quotient of love was in her ; but most likely , in the daily mutual rage provoked by the awful distress that ground the family down , that love had died
he wants to give me a surprise
they were thirsty ; guillaume brought them something to drink
like you , reverend mother
regardless of the state , regardless of the laws , regardless of the prosperity and the insolence of others
it was a tilbury attached to a small white horse
fauchelevent cried out : lord !
marius asked : where ’ s the chief ?
the fleming called his wife and told her all about it
of course , despotism remains despotism , even under the despot of genius
bruneseau had set things in motion , but it needed choleranumber to spur the vast reconstruction that has taken place since
study evil amicably , note it , then cure it
one day cosette accidentally looked at herself in the mirror and let out a cry : well !
sire , said the minister of the interior to napoléon , yesterday i saw the boldest man in your empire
look at me , son
he saw nothing of all this : people who are overwhelmed with troubles never do look back
all of a sudden , he heard a racket behind him , the sound of running , cries of to arms !
the others could only see their immediate family , and that very rarely
but he did not abuse this knowledge in any way
now she ’ s a lady banker
it was clear that marius had his doubts about the origins of those six hundred thousand francs , that he feared some illicit source
he was timid to the point of seeming fierce , rarely went out , and saw no one but the poor who knocked on his window and his priest , the abbé mabeuf , who was a good old sort
in olden days a pianist used to punctuate segments of old burlesque movies ; now the reality of scenes of everyday life needs to be subtitled in similar vein , the audio-visual ailning to put paid to the silence of vision in its entirety
'he dead too , though , and all who remain silent
was he beginning to waver , in bewilderment , over a touch of adventure ?
as she swept the stairs , she stopped dead , forgetting her broom and the entire universe as she looked at this star shining at the bottom of her pocket
thénardier answered : she ’ s doing all right , i don ’ t know , leave me alone ; i said , get lost
when she had finished , she remained pensive
when mass was over , marius remained pensive as he moved along ; the old man came up again and said to him : i beg your pardon , monsieur , for having disturbed you a moment ago and for disturbing you again now , but you must have found me most annoying and so i must explain
marius , though , had to stay lying down on a chaise longue for over two months still , on account of the complications produced by the fractured collarbone
to hammer square formations , pulverize regiments , smash lines , grind and scatter massed formations—this was what it was all about for him , strike , strike , strike without letup , and he entrusted this task to the cannonball
while he wrote , the man talked out loud and marius heard what he said : to think there ’ s no equality , not even when you ’ re dead !
you receive him if you like , i don ’ t have much time for men of war in times of peace
what made the fault so enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed
father madeleine declined the cross
tholomyès was the original world-weary student
he had no court
there was not a soul in the woods or in the valley
from number to number , they had built number metres on average a year ; since then they have built eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries of masonry every year using small materials with a bath of hydraulic cement poured over a concrete base
they whispered to each other , marius leaning forward on his chaise longue , cosette standing close by him
he ’ s a little thing from bas-boulonnais
they stepped down from the throne with gravity , but without authority ; their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances that leave history with a sombre feeling ; it did not have either the spectral calm of charles i , number or napoléon ’ s eagle cry
he retraced his steps
bewigged tragedynumber has its raison d ’ être and far be it from me to challenge its right to exist , as some do in the name of aeschylusnumber there are rough drafts in nature ; there are , in creation , ready-made parodies
blind , marius had followed the course he would have followed with his eyes wide open
so he didn ’ t love his father—what of it ?
but it is up to society to save itself ; it is to its own goodwill that we appeal
get cracking , said fauchelevent
it was with great difficulty that the old monarchical provostship and , in the last ten years of the eighteenth century , the revolutionary mayoralty , managed to tunnel out the five leagues of sewers that existed before number all kinds of obstacles got in the way of this operation , some to do with the nature of the soil , others inherent in the very prejudices of the working population of paris
for napoléon , it was pure panicfnnumber blücher sees nothing in it but excitement ; wellington can ’ t make head or tail of it
the cellar rat , which smoked more than it shed light , made the inside of the elephant dimly visible
and that one fine day her nose will fall into her mouthnumber
these stockings , still gracefully moulded to the shape of little legs , were scarcely any longer than jean valjean ’ s hand
the french revolution is a move made by god
it had happened , it was all over ; he saw all the monstrous aspects of his past come to life again , reappearing all around him , with all the frightening force of reality
the guide had replied in the negative
this had its drawbacks
beneath the gilding of the heavens i glimpse a destitute universe
this one was an officer
it is precisely a matter of reproducing these gestures and songs as they were , made or sung by men who are the same but also not who they were – that being the point
jean valjean was not dead
she answered him sobbing these words straight from paradise that are never more thrilling than when said through tears : i adore you !
she no longer had a bed , all she had left was a rag she called her bedspread , a mattress on the floor , and a chair with the cane seat missing
this particular rag-and-bone woman was a grateful old sack and she smiled—what a smile ! —to the three porter women
the down on a peach , the frost on a plum , the radiate crystal of a snowflake , a butterfly ’ s wing powdered with feathers , are coarse things beside this chastity that does not even know it is chaste
i have to be there tonight
i won ’ t see her again
jean valjean did not utter a word
cosette laid her head on the good man ’ s shoulder and did not say a word
this man , who looked so much the man and yet cried like a woman , had struck the churchwarden
the candle was burned virtually to the bottom
there was once a greek painter named euphorion who was known as the painter of lips
madame campan quotes what a little girl of seven had to say to a big girl of sixteen , who took the head of the procession while she , the little girl , remained at the back : you may be a virgin , but i ’ m not
don ’ t expect me until the day after tomorrow
same age—he ’ s fifty-four , same height , same look , same man , in a word , it ’ s him
javert replied in his most imperious tone : why not right away ?
i don ’ t know how to explain ; me , i didn ’ t have any schooling , i ’ m a poor man
he even contributed to their misfortune , and he exacerbated it
at a given moment , any barricade that holds out inevitably becomes a raft of the medusa
the only thing that could clearly be discerned in his demeanor and on his countenance was a strange indecisiveness
cosette would outdo him
it was closed down soon after number montparnasse cemetery , number known as the east cemetery , has taken over from it , inheriting the famous watering hole bordering the vaugirard cemetery that used to have a wooden signboard over it with a quince painted on it ; it had an l-shaped bar , with the tables of drinkers on one side and the graves on the other , and this sign : au bon coing—at the good quince
the door of the dining room , which , as we have seen , opened straight onto the square in front of the cathedral , was once as loaded with locks and bolts as the door of a prison
i am about to go into that dark night without even seeing her again
but you ’ d hold it against me , maybe , when we see each other again in a little while
but , when all ’ s said and done , what was true in the tales told about the first phase of monsieur myriel ’ s life ?
from that moment on , his name was known
he walked with firm tread to the wall , pushed marius and the doctor aside when they tried to help him , took down the small copper crucifix from the wall where it was hanging , came back and sat down with all the ease of movement of a man in his prime , and said in a loud voice , laying the crucifix on the table : there is the great martyr
the first to reach the garden gate stopped and waited for the others ; a second later , all six were gathered together
as soon as the chief orders everyone to man their stations , all chaotic movement ceases ; no more skirmishing with one another ; no more nattering huddles ; no more private conversations ; no more standing aloof ; whatever is in everyone ’ s minds converges and turns into waiting for the assailant
in which you will read a delightful saying of the king ’ s
in toulon he was dressed in a red smock known as a paletot
the name thénardier , which monsieur leblanc did not seem to know , was known to marius
oh , the bastard ’ s cunning as a sewer rat
but you could not see anything of the outside
the real sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand five hundred francs
i ’ ve found the solution
javert felt his mind was about to snap
ah , you used to talk to me more friendly !
there aren ’ t any stars in the sky
people barricaded themselves in their houses ; wives and mothers fretted ; all you heard was : oh , my god !
jean valjean had arranged himself to stay alive in there and he was more or less still breathing
this hankie belonged to the old monsieur , who had quite simply dropped it out of his pocket
a room where you bed down costs twenty sous ; a room where you get some rest costs twenty francs
one evening in this same month of april , jean valjean had gone out and cosette had sat down on this bench after sunset
day was dawning when those inhabitants of montfermeil who were starting to open their doors saw walking by on the road to paris a shabbily dressed man hand in hand with a little girl all in mourning and carrying a big pink doll in her arms
what was the second man ’ s objective ?
the innkeeper felt a shiver of joy
he went into a spin , furious
it ’ s an old cemetery that ’ s in breach of the regulations , it doesn ’ t have the uniform and it ’ s going to take retirement
monsieur gillenormand , who was as alive as it was possible to be in number , was one of those men who have become a curiosity solely because they have lived a long while , and who are odd because once upon a time they looked like everyone else and now they don ’ t look like anyone
cosette did not complain , she did not say a thing , she did not ask any questions , she did not seek any reason why ; she had already reached the stage where you fear being found out or giving yourself away
he was a huge lazy force
this convent will be our salvation , he murmured
she had a way of coming out with quite grown-up little notions in her sweet infantile voice
meanwhile , you do what you can to alleviate the defect ; you can even identify where the holes and hollows in the bore of a gun tube are by using calipers
explaining actually means two quite different things
it was the man ’ s hat
the cops are onto us , to boot , and there ’ s a gunner on the lookout
he took his head in his two hands but it was no good , he could not manage to explain it to himself
a bale of straw
with the human race rising upward , the lowest levels will emerge quite naturally from the zone of distress
not being able to say she was married , she was very careful , as we have already hinted , not to mention her little girl
i the lark ’ s field
i don ’ t believe i have the right to kill a man ; but i feel i have a duty to exterminate evil
this is how , in the blindness of a bad political economy , we drown and let the well-being of all stream away and disappear in swallow holes
the shock of his fall had jolted the footropes and set them rocking like a swing
the man looked all around him , saw no one , dared not peer into that black corner , and stepped up the pace , frightened out of his wits
the judge repeated the question
at the same time our parents are appealing to us
who can this champmathieu be ?
the blessed mezzocane , abbé of aquila , wanted to be buried beneath the gallows ; that was done
love , you hold the future in your hands
the man was tall , dressed in a long redingote , and he had a cudgel under his arm
are you calling louis-philippe a tyrant ?
twenty times , when he was in that carriage face-to-face with jean valjean , the legal tiger in him had roared
but it ’ ll still take a good quarter of an hour
he knew her eyes , her forehead , her beauty , her figure , her gait , but he did not know the sound of her voice
the ridge of the hump that determines which way the water flows follows an extremely capricious line
nature in the month of april is full of that glorious light that travels from the sky , the clouds , the trees , the meadows , and the flowers right into the heart of humankind
this small pellet falls into the courtyard
let ’ s not get carried away
scaling a wall and theft , it ’ s all there
this passerby did well to hurry , for very shortly afterwards , six men entered the rue plumet , creeping along the walls , separately and at some distance from each other , looking for all the world like a drunken patrol
every good girl contains a hero
the fact is that it got no higher on average than six or seven feet
the true division of humanity is this : those filled with light and those filled with darkness
if his wish had been granted , if he had at that moment seen cosette ogling a lancer , he would have died of pain without being able to utter a word
in the face of such absolute assertion , mother jondrette lifted her big ruddy blond head and looked up at the ceiling with a twisted expression
the night probably knew more about him than the day
monsieur gillenormand would have liked marius to throw himself into his arms
there had already been more than one chapter in their barely begun romantic novel , and the amorous young man who was called adolphe in the first chapter turned into alphonse in the second and gustave in the third
he was going to get himself killed
that was the question
if such a feeling still exists in you , and i hope it does , reflect before you answer me , consider , on the one hand , this man whom a word from you may destroy , and on the other hand , justice , which a word from you may clarify
times are certainly hard !
it was not serious and he would not allow anyone to look at it , or bandage it , or even to see that he was in pain , not even cosette
in the absence of inspector javert , i believe i should remind the gentlemen of the jury what he said in this very place a few hours ago
enjolras resumed : the position ’ s good , the barricade is beautiful
but what they were attacking was the younger branch of divine right in louis-philippe , just as they had attacked the elder branch in charles x ; and what they wanted to overthrow in overthrowing royalty in france , as we explained , was the usurpation of man over man and of privilege over justice throughout the world
there is , in this way of living , some good mingled with the bad , for if enfeeblement is harmful , generosity is healthful and good
homer would have tied up polyphemus with it , shakespeare , calibannumber
montparnasse gave him a wink
normally this flame that burns us also enlightens us a little , shedding a little helpful light around us
we saw him hotfooting it out of town
what is this place ?
it looks like we ’ ve got a common interest
but the historian must also take what was written in the language of words and with the tools of rhetoric and re-read it , delving beneath what the words say and dredging up what they say without thinking , what they say as monuments , as opposed to what they say intentionally
was made with a faith so profound , with so much certainty , with such a total lack of anxiety and doubt , that he could find no words
in this way , they reckon , it can have peace after its revolution , that is , time to bandage its wounds and get its house in order
he thought he ’ d been too kind , too soft , we might as well say it , too weak
then he stuck the shovel in the ground and added : you see , it ’ s going to be a cold night tonight and the dead woman ’ s going to give us a piece of her mind if we plant her here without a cover
i answered : we did have ; among others monsieur de lucenet , who was captain of the old city gates at pontarlier under the ancien régime
in the days when he still went out , he had bought a little copper crucifix for a few sous from a coppersmith and he had hung it on a nail facing his bed
one of the survivors of the expedition , a smart sewer worker , very young at the time , was still a few years ago telling anyone who ’ d listen the curious details that bruneseau thought it best to leave out of his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of the administrative style
i ’ m in love with the character over the road from my place
as for éponine , javert saw to it that she was nabbed again
he said abruptly : what have you come here for ?
revolutionary fever was gaining , in any case
it got to the point at a certain moment , while my brother was talking about the mountain folk of pontarlier who have sweet work close to the heavens and who , he added , are happy because they are innocent , where he stopped short , fearing that in that word that had escaped his lips there was something that could rub the man the wrong way
i took the bowl of the clay pipe ,
marius , feverish , his stomach empty , his every hope shed , one after the other , stranded in grief , the darkest of shipwrecks , awash with violent emotions , and feeling the end near , had sunk deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor that always preludes the fatal hour when it is willed and welcomed
that which sits up there , at the top , at the summit , at the zenith , that which pours so much light over the earth , might actually see little , see badly , see not at all ?
nearly all the stagecoaches heading for the south and the west took the champs-élysées in those days
trying to outdo mere representation by offering the very presence oj the event , as instantaneous photography vvould do , followed by the photo- finish and the first cinematographic newsreels of the lumiere brothers and , ultimately , the live coverage offered by cnn
fantine , who had not taken her eyes off javert , wheeled around : did i say anything to you ?
gavroche ’ s adventure , which remained in the traditions of the temple quartier , is one of the most terrible memories of the old bourgeois of the marais and is entitled in their reminiscences : night attack on the post of the imprimerie royale
at times , he probably actually laughed to himself and talked out loud
bahorel shouted : flock—that ’ s a polite way of saying sheep
it does seem , indeed , that certain people are endowed with a real animal instinct , pure and intact like all instincts , that creates antipathies and affinities , that fatally divides one personality from another , that does not hesitate , that is never in doubt , is never silenced and never flags , clear in its obscurity , infallible , imperious , resistant to all the counsels of intelligence and all the solvents of reason and that , whatever their fates may be , secretly alerts the dog-man to the presence of the cat-man , and the fox-man to the presence of the lion-man
madame magloire , said the bishop , set one more place
thénardier was a different man now
the door was the one in the visitors ’ room reserved for the gardener in the course of his duties
at times her unbuttoned and torn chemise nearly fell down to her waist
all eyes followed him
he had to tackle holly , nettles , hawthorn , dog roses , thistles , the meanest of brambles , and got himself scratched to bits
citizens , said enjolras , what that man did is horrifying and what i did is horrible
fantine asked him : what did the doctor say ?
napoléon was used to staring hard at war ; he never did the poignant sums of details , figure by figure ; figures mattered little to him , as long as they amounted to this total : victory
the porter did not seem to understand either javert ’ s words or jean valjean ’ s signs
a sewer is a misunderstanding
madame victurnien sometimes saw her going by her window , noticed the distress of that creature , put in her place thanks to her , and was very pleased with herself
the historian of customs and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events
real misery , he had just seen
grantaire had risen to his feet
the next day jean valjean threw marius the glance marius finally caught
jean valjean looked as though he were about to pass out
two were bolder still
that is indeed the question at the dawn of the millennium
that doesn ’ t stop him from defending it , retorted enjolras
one of these flags was red and blue with an imperceptible white stripenumber in between
a hundred and nine francs fifteen sous
otherwise , the days went by , one after the other , and nothing new cropped up
in the cloister , games were heavenly
he managed to vanish , sold the bishop ’ s silver , keeping only the candlesticks as mementos , crept from town to town , travelled across france , turned up in montreuil-sur-mer , had the bright idea we ’ ve mentioned above , achieved what we ’ ve outlined , managed to make himself unassailable and inaccessible and from then on , well established in montreuil-sur-mer , happy to feel his conscience burdened by his past and the first half of his existence belied by this new phase , he lived a quiet life , reassured and hopeful , having only two concerns : to hide his name and to sanctify his life ; to escape the clutches of men and to return to god
the woman had murdered her child , infanticide was proved , the jury ruled out premeditation , she was sentenced to life
i can ’ t remember which philosopher it was who said : there is never any shortage of old women
i ’ ll stop this miserable bastard when i ’ m good and ready , he thought
my child , that is quite a load you ’ re carrying there , for you
over that way , you don ’ t pick the grapes ripe
number , he came to a tavern with this sign hanging on the outside : aux quatre vents
he seemed to stop looking or thinking
he was forced to make a mental effort to remember that all that surrounded him was real
the tiny one had his eyes open , but he didn ’ t say a word
cosette hung her head and went to get an empty bucket sitting in the corner of the fireplace
the riot had wreathed everything in its smoke
these words of francis bacon 's , taken from david sylvester 's interviews with the artist and quoted as a lead-in for the amodern starts ' exhibition at the museum of modern art in new york , , beautifully sum up the current dilemma : the less you represent , the more you push the simulacrum of representation !
she keeps the inn
he rushed to the window that looked on the street , opened it with his shaky old hands , leaned out down to the waist while basque and nicolette held him from behind , and cried : marius !
in nearly all the songs from the galleys , penal colonies , and penitentiaries of the eighteenth century , you find a diabolical and puzzling gaiety
from now on i can do nothing more for her
i want you to keep your job
all that seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind a theatre curtain
a quartet of crooks , claquesous , gueulemer , babet , and montparnasse , ruled the dregs of paris from number to number
i must have forgotten it
no doubt the poetic voice off that accompanies the images voices the suffering of the earth and of a life that aspires to resume the course of its thoughts ’
this will do for my dinner today , he thought
the shot went off , the bullet passed through his hand and perhaps through the workman , too , for he fell , but the bullet did not reach marius
everyone has noticed how swiftly a coin you drop on the ground rolls away and hides and how cleverly it makes itself unfindable
these epochs are singular and manage to baffle politicians who hope to exploit them
… well , then , monsieur , my worthy monsieur , do you know what is going to happen tomorrow ?
i won ’ t ask you any more questions
jondrette does his shopping
it seems that around these great centres of the movement of people , at the rolling of these powerful machines , at the breathing of these monstrous horses of civilization that eat coal and vomit fire , the seed-filled earth trembles and opens in order to swallow up the former dwellings of men and let the new ones out
so , who gives two hoots ?
it rolls there in wide and terrible corrugations ; it gathers and builds ; the torrent charges at the piles of the bridges as though to rip them out with fat liquid ropes
the old legitimist parties nonetheless assailed the revolution of number with all the violence that comes from false reasoning
the sun was going down and appetite was fading
marius was truly astounded
then he found himself back in his room , and he put his candle down on a table
i always thought there was something bad at the bottom of all that
when at two o ’ clock the royal carriage , surrounded by a squadron of silver-trimmed guards of the royal corps , came into the boulevard after skirting around la salpêtrière hospital , he appeared startled and almost alarmed
where there was once the battered old rattletrap there is now the railway car ; where there was once the rickety old two-masted cutter , there is now the steamboat ; today we say fécamp the way we once said saint-cloudnumber the paris of number is a city that has the whole of france as its suburbs

you ’ ll see if there won ’ t be miracles galore here , father fauvent !
it was almost night
the jondrette girl ’ s eyes had gone from forlorn to joyful and from joyful to grim
cosette did not know what love was
this is a stroke of luck , said courfeyrac
can you be too happy ?
he was in hungary , in , in a tank
babet was skinny and smart
the first thing cosette felt was a confused and deep sadness
you don ’ t really imagine that people die just like that ?
for marius , listening to cosette talk fashion ;
thénardier resumed : let ’ s get it over with , then

we are unlearning certain things and that is all to the good , as long as in unlearning this , you learn that
this whole prodigious city is a condensation of dead customs and creeds and living customs and creeds
the carter was so moved by the five-franc coin that he left his glass where it was and came running over
but its director , humphrey jennings , had a singular take on his work of propaganda for a country resisting the enemy 's bombs
at this point , cosette sobbed even harder
doctor , he ’ s coming back !
montparnasse went on : i ’ m goin ’ to find babet
what can you say , meanwhile , about the likes of richard hiilsen- beck , one of the founding fathers of dada , who told a berlin audience in , at a conference on the new trends in art , 'vve were for the war
the riots brought the cloudy skies back , they made that revolution , initially so remarkable for its unanimity , degenerate into a brawl
thénardier registered the movement and went on at the slow pace of an orator who holds his audience in the palm of his hand and feels his enemy squirming under his words : this man was forced to go into hiding , though for reasons that have nothing to do with politics , and he ’ d taken the sewer as his place of residence and had a key to it
by another natural consequence , the closer he came to his father , to his memory , and to the things for which the colonel had fought for twenty-five years , the further away he moved from his grandfather
the moment you hear the cab stop , open up straightaway , he ’ ll come up , you ’ ll light the stairs and the hall , and when he comes in here , go straight back down again and pay the driver and send the cab on its way
he said of the school portal : what a fine old man !
unbeknown to him , the mayor of montreuil-sur-mer enjoyed a kind of celebrity
volume by volume , the whole library went south
try and take away the dog the lion has in its cage !
come on , what is it ?
too much misery , as we have noted , had turned him into something of a visionary
universal suffrage has a wonderful way of dissolving the riot ’ s raison d ’ être , and by giving insurrection the vote , it takes away its weapons
cosette was huddled against him , trembling
if you don ’ t buy my painting , dear benefactor , jondrette wailed , i ’ ll be without resources , there ’ ll be nothing left for me to do but throw myself in the river
it happened very smoothly
philosophy has to be an energy , with the aim and effect of improving man

monsieur madeleine turned toward the jurors and toward the court and said in a soft voice : gentlemen of the jury , let the accused go
from time to time , he shook his head as though answering some question he had silently put to himself
the emperor , pleased , shouted to him : you are a colonel , you are a baron , you are an officer of the légion d ’ honneur !
but while he was waiting , the cab might take off
the monarchy pranced around in its flounces

the walls were white , the tables were black ; these two colours of mourning are the only choices convents have

with what despairing ravishment he contemplated that convent garden , full of flowers blooming unseen and incarcerated virgins , where all the perfumes and all the souls wafted straight up to heaven !
he told himself that he was happy that it was not there , that it had disappeared , that this was good , that this was only right , that his grandfather had been the true keeper of his father ’ s flame and that it was better that the colonel ’ s sword had been sold to the highest bidder , sold to a junk dealer , tossed among old scrap iron , rather than to cause the flank of his homeland to bleed today
my name is pontmercy
to arrest him too soon would be to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs
noble and mysterious triumphs that no other eyes see , that no renown rewards , that no fanfare salutes
the sister tried to speak , but she could barely stutter a few inarticulate sounds
who , in any case , could have guessed such a thing ?
he examined , dispassionately and with the eye of a linguist deciphering a palimpsest , the level of chaos that exists even in nature
it was tempting and courfeyrac could not resist
they own only one in thirty of the goats they look after
the man talking to him was an old man , stooped and lame , decked out more or less like a peasant and wearing a leather knee pad on his left knee with a fairly big bell hanging from it

and the fate of cinema , and of its relationship to the common fate of history , could stand between two ideas of music : the well-orchestrated symphony of images that , for canudo , epstein or vertov , was meant to take the place of the old language of words , and the distant call of words to images that currently characterizes its most acute forms
it ’ s a poor little thing that we took in just like that , out of charity
but the man , after leaving his bundle and his stick on a seat , had sat down at a table , where cosette rushed to put a bottle of wine and a glass
things come rushing back with abrupt lucidity , the annihilation caused by drunkenness , a sort of condensation steaming up over the brain and blinding it , evaporates and gives way to a clear and clean grasp of reality
his dream was to come by some windfall of an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand francs in income in order to have mistresses
she has a son , theft , and a daughter , hunger

and so , eight or ten months after what was narrated in the previous pages , around about the first days of january number , on a night of snow , one of these dandies , one of these idlers—obviously a true conformist , for he wore a morillo , and was snugly wrapped up in one of those huge greatcoats that then completed the cold-weather fashion plate—was getting his kicks harassing a creature on the prowl in front of the window of the officers ’ café in a very low-cut ball gown and with flowers wreathed around her head
i was one of the masters of the state , the vaults of the treasury were piled so high with coins that we were forced to prop up the walls which were ready to burst under the weight of all that gold and silver ; i dined in the rue de l ’ arbre-sec at twenty-two sous a head

cosette guided the stranger through the streets
yes , said the woman
to the eye of the dreamer , all the historic murderers are there , in the hideous gloom , on their knees , with a fold of their shrouds as apron , dourly mopping up their work
suppose i do let her go and sacrifice myself , i ’ d like to know where she ’ s going , i wouldn ’ t want to lose sight of her , i ’ d want to know who she ’ s living with , so i could go and see her now and then , and for her to know that her good old foster father is there , that he ’ s watching over her

how to argue and use vous just to use tu with all the more relish afterwards ;

combeferre , who spoke thus , was not an orphan

oh , cosette is a pretty awful name they must have pulled out of a hat when i was little
this is part of a story
i ’ m not some nonentity without a name who slinks into other people ’ s houses and kidnaps children !
at the same time , he rented two other apartments in paris , so that he would attract less attention than if he always stayed in the same quartier , so that he could absent himself , if need be , at the slightest concern he might have , and finally , so that he would not find himself caught short again like the night when he had so miraculously escaped from javert
he signalled to his wife , who came running , and after he showed her the line written on the piece of paper , he added in a muffled voice : quick , the ladder !
boulatruelle had explored , probed , and poked around the whole forest and rooted around wherever the ground looked freshly disturbed to him

the devil ceases to be le rabouin and becomes le boulanger , the baker , he who puts into the oven
all political opinions were indifferent to him and he approved of all of them without distinguishing between them , so that they would leave him in peace , much the way the greeks called the furies the beautiful , the good , the charming , the eumenides ! number monsieur mabeuf ’ s own political stance was to love plants with a passion , and books more than anything in the world
the hole that the demolished house left in the street is half-filled by a rotten paling fence , propped up by five stone posts
all she understood was that she was leaving the thénardier flophouse behind
it ’ s all part of my gardening
what we lack attracts us
and , rotten as she was , she lived the way the rotten live ,
these salons had their very own literature and politics
this good man here will carry you on his back in that
and in a second goes from a waif to a giant
but she only stayed six or eight months , giving as the reason for leaving that the garden had no shade

one sunday when he had gone to hear mass at saint-sulpice , in the same chapel of the virgin that his aunt used to take him to when he was little , being even more absentminded and dreamy than usual that day , he took a seat behind a pillar and knelt , without paying it any attention , on a utrecht velvet chair on the back of which was written the name m mabeuf , churchwarden
most of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared ; they kept their mouths shut from the very next day ; but of what we are about to relate , we can say : we saw it with our own eyes
he had written him the letter we know about , without knowing him
passersby would study him with surprise and a few found he had a suspicious demeanour and a sinister face
jondrette opened a cupboard next to the fireplace and pulled out an old cap , which he slapped on his head after whacking it on his sleeve to dust it
this very precise statement appeared to produce a rousing impression on the public and the jury
you could have invited good old once upon a time to it
the next day , he did not come
a fourteen-year-old boy was stopped in the rue de la cossonnerie with his pockets full of cartridges
what glory in god for the community !
the good women of the quartier would say : that man ’ s an innocent
now defend me against my husband
cosette was saying to marius : you know what ?
an apostle may be reckless , but a bishop has to tread carefully
jean-baptiste greuze , the painter who could make an example of any domestic scene , making people 's bodies and gazes stretch out towards the dying father , the prodigal son or the well-behaved wife , no longer had any idea how to give caracalla the grandeur that a roman emperor , no matter how villainous he may have been , should manifest in his attitude
the air ’ ll do her good , said jondrette
as he was leaving , he said to the sister : she ’ s better
for too long , the argument goes , has art been an ornament and a diversion ; the time has come for the artist to accept adult responsibilities and to make art a weapon
i beseech you , in heaven ’ s name , i join my hands together in prayer , monsieur , i throw myself at your feet , allow me to marry her
the reader has no doubt guessed that thénardier ’ s tracker was none other than javert
he seemed to be listening
this being so , as a convent turned up on our path , we simply had to go in
these in pace , these solitary cells , these iron hinges , these collar shackles , this high skylight on a level with the flowing river , this stone box sealed with a granite lid like a tomb , with this difference that here death was living , this floor that is mud , this shit-hole , these oozing walls—how they rant !
a person owes six hundred thousand francs some consideration and it was obvious that she could not do otherwise than to leave her fortune to these young people , since they no longer needed it
one of the scenes that gave rise to the drama we are relating is connected to this battle , but this history is not our subject ; this history , moreover , has been told and told in masterly fashion , both from napoléon ’ s point of view and from the opposite point of viewnumber by a glittering array of historians

from that moment on , though , he didn ’ t come across another thing
jean valjean gets his revenge
the human body undergoes something of this quivering as the moment arrives when the mysterious fingers of death are about to gather the soul
he had to make a huge effort to recall what on earth he ’ d been thinking before midnight sounded
a good number of old friends of the gillenormand family had been invited and they buzzed around cosette , vying with each other to call her madame la baronne
javert took the blow standing , full on and bang in the chest like a russian soldier
since jean valjean was alone , and there was no one there ?
and this is the great skill of alchemy : to make a success look like a catastrophe so that those who benefit from it also quake in their boots over it , to season any step forward with fear , to increase the transition curve so much that progress is slowed , to make the dawn dull , to denounce and discount the bitter struggles of enthusiasm , to cut corners and fingernails , to dampen triumph , to muffle right , to wrap that giant , the people , in flannel and put them swiftly to bed , to impose a diet on such excessively good health , to put hercules on a convalescent ’ s regime , to water down the event with the expedient , to offer minds thirsty for the ideal this nectar diluted with herbal tea , to take all precautions against too much success , to stick a lampshade over the revolution
all of a sudden he heard a noise behind him ; it was the porter woman , patagon , who had followed him and who , from a distance , was showing him her fist and shouting : you are nothing but a bastard !
'the cinema means putting your eyes into uniform ' , kafka confirmed
why must the time come when you emerge from blue skies and why does life go on afterwards ?
at this abrupt question , the man flinched
mother thénardier flung the door to the street wide open
myself , i side with the great clock of strasbourg , and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock of the black forest any day
he said mass in the middle of the jail , at an altar ; he had a pointed thing , gold , on his headnumber in the heat of the day , it shone like blazes
what a cursed fate !
but the two orders remained no less distinct
what about the silver ?
if we didn ’ t love one another , i really can ’ t see the good in having a spring ; and , as for myself , i ’ d ask the good lord to pack up all the beautiful things he lays out before us and take them back and stick the flowers and the birds and the pretty girls back in his box
a shiver ran through his body
one after the other , pontmercy saw wurmser taken prisoner in mantua , mélas in alexandria , mack in ulmnumber he was part of the eighth corps of the grande armée that mortier commanded and that captured hamburg
javert respectfully saluted the mayor , who turned his back on him and , without taking any notice of him , went on making notes in his file
lafayette took on the coronation
on all fronts , he had something to worry about
all around this deserted and ominous labyrinth , in the quartiers where the paris traffic had not been brought to a standstill and where a few rare lamplights still shone , the aerial observer would have been able to make out the metallic scintillation of sabres and bayonets , the muffled rumbling of artillery , and the swarming of silent battalions swelling in number from one minute to the next ; a daunting belt that slowly tightened and closed around the riot
he was forced to admit to his dismay that what looked like a door was simply a wooden panel cladding a structure it backed onto
that such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is surely unexpected
i reckoned it was going to rain and that there was no good lord to stop it from raining , so i came back to town to try and find a doorway
oh , yes , that ’ s true , you ’ ll tell all this to cosette
when he had got to the rue pavée , the rag-and-bone woman came back into his mind and he uttered this soliloquy : you are wrong to insult revolutionaries , mother gutter-sweep
ah , he really is gorgeous
the old man continued with a tiny smile : in that case , you are my bishop ?
another time she looked him steadily in the eye and declared : monsieur , you ’ re handsome , you ’ re gorgeous , you ’ re clever as can be and you ’ re not at all stupid , you ’ re a lot more knowledgeable than i am , but take this : i love you !
on certain days , every one of these beings took a turn putting in twelve hours at a stretch kneeling on the flagstones or prostrate face down on the ground , arms out on both sides like a cross
as she went on , her tone expressed the joy of being able to boast about something no human being is immune to : i can read , you know !
such are the effects of dawn , of childhood , of youth , of joy
she was always a bit on the wide-eyed side
the tilbury ’ s wheel took quite a shock
he had scattered his bouquet over it
she ’ s a greuzenumber so , you ’ re going to have this all to yourself , then , you cheeky rascal !
and this situation was , as we said at the beginning , made more palpable and urgent by the faubourg saint-antoine than by any other part of the population
on one side , endless shadow ; on the other , an atom
only , the wounded man did not stir , and jean valjean had no idea whether the man he was carrying into this pit was alive or dead
do not condemn this man , at least !
did they eat into the skull ?
there are traitors employed in lots of prisons , half jailors , half thieves , who help in breakouts , who sell their disloyal services to the police and make a fair bit on the side out of the rotten eggs thrown in the police wagon

at saint-pol he unharnessed the horse at the first inn he came to and had the horse taken to the stable
father fauvent , we must do what the dead want us to do
grantaire retorted in a grave voice : you ’ ll see
every time the poor miserable wretch has a moment to think , he makes himself small before the law and puny before society ; he lies down flat on his stomach and he grovels , he implores pity ; you feel that he knows he ’ s in the wrong
style is the shape the ideal takes , rhythm , its movement
now and then , fighting off his weariness , he made an effort to think straight
you could hear javert ’ s voice thundering : search the cul-de-sac !
the young girls frolicked under the eyes of the nuns ; the gaze of flawlessness does not bother innocence
she had it hard , too
the snow was still falling , streaking the grey of the sky
she only ever read a prayer book in big letters and in latin
the shack was indeed so well hidden behind the ruin , and so unobtrusive in its design , that jean valjean had missed it
he primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan

low thick black mists crept up the hillsides and tore away from them like smoke
it suits me either to keep quiet or to give myself up , to hide myself or to save my soul , to be a magistrate , despicable but respected , or a galley slave , disgraced but noble , it ’ s all about me , me , me , me , nothing but me !

an eruption of young life flooded this garden that had a cross cut into it like a shroud
two men who can ’ t be found
he took the candle , the man took his bundle and his stick , and thénardier led him to a room on the first floor , which was of a rare splendour , all furnished in mahogany , with a sleigh bed and curtains of red calico
he was getting tired and as his strength diminished , the weight of his burden grew

as fast as it was , that look was the kind you recognize when you have seen it before ; it did not escape marius
he fully entered into a sense of reality ; he attained that state of calmness that allows you to listen
you can make out sheer precipices in them
this was an event , and the boarders of the day still talk about it
the lower she sank , the bleaker everything around her became , the more this sweet little angel shone in her heart of hearts

the man went straight to the door to the street , opened it , and went out
their honour , thank god , their dignity , their radiance , their genius , are not numbers that those gamblers known as heroes and conquerors throw into the lottery of battle
the wagonload that headed the convoy struck up a tune , which they began belting out at the top of their lungs , with frantic joviality ; it was la vestale , one of désaugiers ’ snumber medleys , famous at the time ; the trees shivered forlornly ; in the side alleys , the faces of the bourgeois throng were covered in moronic bliss as they listened , riveted , to these bawdy ditties sung by spectres
chopped up , nettles are good for poultry ; ground , they ’ re good for horned animals
this shack , built out of rubble and still standing in number , consisted , as we have already said , of three rooms , all of which were completely bare
all the most august , the most sublime , the most delightful minds of humanity , and perhaps beyond humanity , have gone in for the play on words
in any case , both of them being unapproachable , there was no way marius could put a question of any kind to monsieur fauchelevent
maybe from the coast
was madame thénardier well out of the way ?
we shall see , said monsieur madeleine
he would kiss her on the forehead
but what do you want me to do about it ?
at wettingen , number under a shower of balls , he held in his arms colonel maupetit , mortally wounded at the head of the numberth dragoons
there was another pause
she swiftly broke the seal , opened it out and read ( for she could read ) :

it was gavroche going down the rue du chaume
if a detainee finds it , he hands the note over to the person it is intended for ; if it is a warden , or one of those prisoners who have secretly sold out , known as sheep in prisons and foxes in galleys , the note is taken to the clerk and delivered to the police
what is this secret ?
it was the start of the holidays and a bright hot summer ’ s day
me , i call a spade a spade
he was not looking at a spectacle ; he was enduring a vision
he told himself he had to do his duty ; that he might even be no more unhappy after having done his duty than after having eluded it ; that if he let well enough alone , if he remained in montreuil-sur-mer , his standing , his good reputation , his good works , the deference , the veneration , his charity , his wealth , his popularity , his virtue , would all be tainted by a crime ; and what a taste all those sacred things would leave , tainted by something so vile !
the basement of paris , if the eye could penetrate its surface , would reveal a colossal coral reef
and he breathed deeply with inexpressible relief
whenever jean valjean wanted to prolong his visit and make her forget the time , he would praise marius ; he would find him handsome , noble , courageous , witty , eloquent , good
not one living being passed in the streets , or walked in the rooms , or strolled about the gardens
she had thrown off her shawl but kept her hat on ; her husband , crouching behind her , almost vanished under the discarded shawl and she covered him with her body , holding the cobblestone with both hands above her head with the poise of a giant about to launch a rock
half the men on the muskets , the other half on the cobblestones
was that incredibly dense shadow that cloaked them about to be dispersed by light ?
and then , the more he recovered , the more his old grievances crept up on him , the more the old ulcers of his memory reopened , he thought once more about the past , colonel pontmercy once more came between monsieur gillenormand and himself , marius ; he told himself there was no real kindness to hope for from someone who had been so unjust and so hard on his father
this tiny change had in fact reduced the cost of the raw materials so considerably that it made it possible first , to raise wages , a benefit for the whole district ; second , to improve the manufacture , an advantage for the consumer ; and third , to sell them more cheaply while trebling the profits , a gain for the manufacturer
her blood was like ice in her veins
sleep comes a lot more easily than it comes back
for one thing , i don ’ t like balcony seats
montparnasse started to laugh
to suffer or to enjoy myself
with the candle out , he felt invisible
in any case , he made a virile and violent effort , overcame his hesitation , and continued his advance
asked the man of the house
in the world of slang

all of a sudden , on that whitish band , two silhouettes appeared
everything was still confused and in turmoil in his brain ; his brain was still so troubled that he could not latch on to any idea clearly and he himself would have been hard-pressed to describe what was happening to him except to say that he had just suffered quite a blow
i don ’ t need a pack of screaming brats , their mother would say
jean valjean had tacitly accepted cosette ’ s tacit acceptance
high walls hemmed him in on all sides
the man would most likely be found guilty ; the counsel for the prosecution—a wit who made up rhymes—was good
it would have been impossible to guess
and that is not a metaphor
for the passersby were now a crowd
you ’ re letting me do all the talking
the dandy was smoking , for smoking was very much in vogue
she would tell the sisters : i only feel alive when monsieur le maire is there
for example , the story entitled the last bolshevik , which ties all sorts of other images into the official image of the royal procession : images such as those from the rediscovered footage of alexander medvedkin 's films which , in various modes , accompanied the different phases of the soviet epic
the old man spoke with the volubility of a man of the land and there was nothing disturbing about it
spain buys a lot of it

the man replied : exactly
a few claimed he was a bit of a mystery man and asserted that no one had ever been into his room , which was a real anchorite ’ s cell , furnished with winged hourglasses and titivated with death ’ s-heads and crossbones
she studied herself from head to toe in the big mirror , then cried out in a burst of ineffable ecstasy : once upon a time there was a king and a queen
recommended by the eighty francs , they were handled with care , like all that is exploited for money ; not too badly turned out , not too badly fed , treated almost like little gentlemen , better off with the false mother than with the real one

less than an hour later , the jury ’ s verdict unburdened the man named champmathieu from all accusation ; and champmathieu , immediately set free , walked away stunned , believing all men mad and not understanding a thing about the vision he ’ d beheld
those scots died thinking of ben lothian as the greeks died remembering argos
on the way , he gave providence its due
the best minds have their soft spots and sometimes feel somewhat bruised by the scant respect of logic
the next day jean valjean asked cosette again : would you like to go to the luxembourg ?
on hearing it , he had woken up with a start
the two duties : to watch and to hope
he saw civil war yawning open like an abyss before him and he knew that it was there that he would fall
behind it , on the other side , he could make out the tops of trees evenly spaced , which indicated that the wall divided the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees
orestes on a fast and pyladesnumber drunk
the vast barricade displayed itself like a cliff face where the strategy of the generals of africanumber came to grief and was shattered

when it came down to it , he , fauchelevent , however nervous he might be , was not keen to cough up the money
and what does the gentleman do for a living ?
when javert had gone , monsieur madeleine turned to her , and said in a careful voice , struggling to sound as though he were in control and not on the verge of breaking down : i have heard you
i have a missus and a young lady—a very beautiful girl
he gazed at it the way a lamb would gaze into the eyes of a tiger
monsieur marius , are you there ?
any other uprising is bad
they remembered the popular ovation that greeted the neutrality of the numberrd regiment of the line in july number two intrepid men , whose mettle had been tested and proved in the great wars , the maréchal de lobau and general bugeaud , commanded , bugeaud under lobau
the cuirassiers hurled themselves at the english squares
éponine and azelma had made sure they did not forget to do so and had each put one of their shoes in the fireplace
jean valjean stuck his pistol under his arm and levelled a look at javert that needed no words to say : javert , it ’ s me
holy mother of god !
there is simply a story that can legitimately include them both
at last i ’ ve caught up with you again , monsieur , the philanthropist !
they lived modestly , as people do when they are in dire straits financially , although they always had a small fire
i ’ ll have lived my life in vain if you don ’ t enjoy them !
otherwise , it ’ s all over for you ; before too long , you ’ ll be caught in the wheels
those words mingled in his thoughts with a dim memory of the narrow corridors and black stairs he had just traversed
it was the spectre that had just passed before his very eyes
oh , yes we have , monsieur !
among all these passionate hotheads and true believers , there was one skeptic
the angel of the house is there , is always there ; if she goes away , it is only to return ; she fades like a dream only to reappear like reality
he went back to his old road between gagny and lagny to carry out graveling , on behalf of the state and under the surveillance of the administration , keeping his head down , a little downcast , extremely pensive , and with slightly cold feet as far as robbery went , since that activity had nearly sunk him , but turning all the more tenderly to drink , which had just saved his neck
that is what england demanded of the stuarts after the protector ; number it is what france demanded of the bourbons after the empire
there will be more joy in heaven over the tearful face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred righteous men
she herself , perhaps , did not know
i heeded the call
monsieur gillenormand was exasperated at his tales of casual amorous encounters near his barracks in the rue de babylone
and he advanced on the tips of his boots toward the corner marius had turned
let me off just this once , monsieur javert
would he have married her any the less ?
aren ’ t we going to get to know each other ?
a dreadful explosion burst over the barricade
revolutionary agitation opens up fissures there out of which popular sovereignty flows
or else , she would give him a little tap because he was coughing , and would say to him : don ’ t cough , monsieur
if i hadn ’ t been so keen to see cosette , i would not have made the confession i ’ ve just made to you , i ’ d have gone away ; but since i want to stay wherever cosette is and go on seeing her , i had to make a clean breast of it to you in all honesty
and off you went to the barricades , and you got yourself killed out of spite !
even when they miscarry , they are venerable , and it is , perhaps , in their failure that they are most majestic
could he be jean valjean ?
it ’ s obviously the end of this miserable terraqueous globe
the light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes
then , without hurrying , but working deftly with a steady and rapid precision and swift movements all the more remarkable at such a time , when javert and company could arrive at any second , he undid his cravat , wound it round cosette ’ s body under the arms , taking care it would not hurt the little girl , then tied the cravat to one end of the rope using the knot that seamen call a reef knot , took the other end of the rope in his teeth , took off his shoes and his stockings and threw them over the wall , climbed on the pile of masonry , and began to lift himself up in the corner made by the wall and the gable as surely and steadily as if he had rungs under his heels and his elbows
what the hell happened ?
oh , i ’ ll find him all right !
her father is taking her to england and my grandfather refuses to consent to the marriage

as he was dwelling on this painful thought , lieutenant théodule came strutting in dressed like a bourgeois , which was a clever move , and he was discreetly introduced by mademoiselle gillenormand
but let ’ s exonerate the soldier , particularly the contemporary soldier , from such a charge
we have been pretty happy
this innocent bed that throws off its bedclothes , this adorable semi-nudity that is frightened of itself , this white foot that takes refuge in a slipper , this bosom that veils itself in front of a mirror as though the mirror had eyes , this chemise that rushes back up to hide a shoulder whenever a piece of furniture creaks or a carriage goes by , these ribbons tied , these hooks and eyes fastened , these laces pulled tight , these starts and jumps , these little frissons of cold and modesty , this exquisite alarm at every movement , this very nearly flapping anxiety where there is nothing to fear , layers of clothing as lovely as clouds at dawn—it is not right or proper that all this be recounted ; it is already too much to refer to it
barrecarrosse , or coachrod , alias monsieur dupont
this man looked like someone looking for a place to stay and seemed to stop by choice at the most humble houses along this dilapidated outer reach of the faubourg saint-marceaunumber

the whole day conversations like the following could be heard all over town :
he plays in the gutter and rises up out of it in revolt ; his effrontery persists in the face of grapeshot ; he was once a little guttersnipe , he is now a hero ; just like the theban boy , number he shakes the lion ’ s skin ; the drummer barranumber was a gamin de paris ; he yells forward , march !
he kept marius aloft and , with an unbelievable show of strength , made headway ; but he was sinking fast

but in number , a rumour spread around town one morning that , on the recommendation of the prefect , and in consideration of the services rendered the district , father madeleine was to be named mayor of montreuil-sur-mer by the king

marius was convinced that monsieur gillenormand—from that day forth he never called him anything else—had thrown his father ’ s will into the fire

his judgment was clouded
what ’ s there to worry about ?
what was this man with a bell hung on him like some ram or ox ?
it seemed to me that this might well have been what my brother was thinking in his heart of hearts

enjolras had advised two hours ’ sleep

and to soften up the authority figure he added : i won ’ t fall
one day her butcher , who had just caught sight of jean valjean , said to her : that ’ s a funny one
one morning , a few days after this visit by a spirit to father mabeuf—it was a monday , the day on which marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece from courfeyrac for thénardier—marius had put this hundred-sou piece in his pocket and , before taking it to the prison clerk , had gone off for a bit of a stroll , hoping that this would make him work on his return
cosette dressed the wound morning and night with such a divine expression on her face and such angelic happiness at being useful to him , that jean valjean felt all his old joy return , his fears and anxieties evaporate , and he would gaze at cosette saying : oh , what a blessed wound !
for i ’ ll get you back in
cosette was all that remained of an otherwise extinct family ; she was not his own daughter but the daughter of a different fauchelevent
in the eighteenth century , the age-old melancholy of these mournful classes lifts
she ’ s seven years old
spring in paris is pretty often swept by bitterly cold and biting north winds that don ’ t so much freeze you as chill you to the bone ; these north winds , which mar the most beautiful days , have the exact effect of the drafts of cold air that rush into a warm room through gaps in a window or a door not properly closed
they are accused of raising , piling up , and packing a whole heap of miseries , sorrows , iniquities , grievances , and despairs against the reigning social order and of dredging up great blocks of darkness from out of the dregs as battlements that they can entrench themselves behind to fight
there ’ s nothing there , not even room
so , then , let ’ s not kill him
you ’ re going to catch a colb
shame on passions that make man petty !
no one ever knew
surely he wouldn ’ t dream of it
javert reached the bridge in time to see jean valjean on the other side of the water , leading cosette by the hand across the space lit by the moon
so he was going to find himself alone with cosette again
she returned to contemplating the notebook
a pretty big air vent , probably the manhole in the rue d ’ anjou , provided an almost sharp light
add the individual tortures to the national degradations and no matter who you are , you will feel yourself shudder before the habit and the veil , those two shrouds of human invention
what a godforsaken place , where the galley slaves are magistrates and tarts are looked after like countesses !
he came in , took a step , then stopped , leaving the door open behind him
on the fourth day , the army did what was done at zaatcha and constantine : number they bored right through the houses , they came over the rooftops , and the barricade was taken
everything has gone downhill in this century , even the scoundrels
the last of these stalls , set up exactly opposite the thénardiers ’ door , was a fancy goods shop , all glittering with tinsel and flashy beading , glass trinkets and magnificent things made of tin
this time , monsieur gillenormand capitulated
this is the example the old give to the young
come on , let ’ s examine our consciences , let ’ s listen to our hearts
hougoumont , for the antiquarian , is hugomons
principles wither and fade in your constitutional cave
then he turned toward the bed and , still sitting down , for he could not remain on his feet , he looked at the tiny black dress and all those little objects so dear to his heart
they ’ re not real , these particular savages
sometimes , beautiful as cosette was , marius would close his eyes before her
the defendant , it was true—and the defence counsel had to agree in good faith—had adopted a bad defence strategy
pardon me for sending my daughter and for not presenting myself myself ,
fear excuses such terrible inhospitality ; it merges with alarm , an extenuating circumstance
he set off , accompanied only by a boy who offered to act as his guide
he stood stock-still but did not let go of montparnasse
ah , young scallywag , you ’ ve got off lightly with me , you ’ re happy , but if i were fifteen years younger , we ’ d cross swords to see who ’ d get her
no , it ’ s not , your name is cosette
the one walking at the head looked decidedly suspect to him
he was more a victim of this miracle than transfigured by it
but i ’ m going to be chomping on your heart tonight !
abstruse speculations are dizzying , and nothing indicates that he polluted his mind with mystical claptrap
the eradication of destitution will occur through a simple rise in level
well , then , jean valjean went on , i ’ m the one who ’ s supposed to hand her the letter
it is by no means certain that he can read
from time to time the different parties slap new soles on their old insults
sin is like gravity
the age in which the arrangements of the exemplum and the historia are overturned by the new history ’ that men make without making it also underscores , with burke , diderot and lessing , the irreducible heterogeneity of the means of expression that every kind of material offers
as he was accustomed to doing whenever a stranger dined with him , he sat the man on his right
one day when the emperor was visiting his uncle , the worthy curé , who was waiting in the anteroom , found himself in his majesty ’ s path
and there were almost no roads , as we said earlier
he had let go of fantine ’ s hand
shall i admire england ?
he had gone home while the sun was still high in the sky
this was very nearly the case
yet jean valjean ’ s coolness won him over in spite of himself
he saw a gardener going past and he asked him : what is that ?
the ancient history of the sewer
besides , the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii created certain waves on the streets of paris
for hegel , as you will recall , the sheer resonance of music takes over from the capacity of pictures to show all
he wasn ’ t even big enough to go up to a hundred francs !
many thoughts came to him , but there was one that would not go away and that sent all the others scurrying
you could see the driver ’ s upper body above the parapet , whip in hand
wellington shouted to his old companions of talavera , vitoria , and salamanca : numberboys !
haven ’ t you said everything you can say ?
how many bushels of charcoal ?
after breakfast he collected his thoughts for a quarter of an hour ; then two generals came and sat on the bale of hay , plume in hand , a sheet of paper each on their knees , and the emperor dictated the order of battle to them
distraught , he carried cosette off in his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean
he was unhappy with himself
now he could see and he admired the one and adored the other
o spring , you are a letter i write to her
how can we fail to see that , in the wake of the hecatomb of the great war , when braque and otto dix found themselves on opposite sides of the trenches in the mud of the somme , modern art for its part forgot about the wound and concentrated on the knife - the bayonet - with the likes of oskar kokoschka , 'the scalpel-wielding artist ' , before moving on through the german expressionism of der sturm to the viennese actionism of rudolf schwarzkogler and his cohorts in the s
let go of me , then !
when the mine is loaded with explosives , when the fuse is ready to run , nothing could be simpler
what are you going to eat ?
take your wild beast back
i only did so out of necessity , let me assure you , and not out of vanity
curtains do come down like that on life
the old man was stuck between the wheels
v it ’ s not enough to be a drunk to be immortal
their attendance in the chapel was interminable
what ’ s the name of that man ?
you think you are hearing hydras talking
and so , against the wind , it has rope and canvas , against water , wood , against rock , iron , copper , and lead , against the darkness , light , and against the vastness , a needle
but cinema , with its conscience-free eye , has a tool that can precisely enact the romantic concept of the work of art as the equality between a conscious process and an unconscious process
no tool is wrong for this particular labourer
the woman , who seemed timid and dumbstruck in front of her husband , risked a question : is that right ?
where were the other six ?
i ask you for one thing only
if you yell , if you cry , mother thénardier will spot you
venice , as a people , will rise again ; england , as an aristocracy , will fall , but as a nation it is immortal
there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life
he had no doubt about the end result
not only is everything from now on 'possible '
all small debts will be paid
petit-gavroche ran after them : what ’ s the matter , then , kids ?
what increased the secret suffering of old man gillenormand is that he kept it completely bottled up inside and never let any of it show
a cannonball does only six hundred leagues an hour ; light does seventy thousand leagues a second
i first set eyes on it when it was just a tiny mite
madeleine , lying almost flat on his stomach , was seen trying twice , in vain , to bring his elbows and knees closer together
i will never forget it ’ , he says
isn ’ t the court in recess ?
it goes without saying that such a man deserved not to have political opinions
monsieur madeleine drew three napoléons out of his purse and put them on the table
it was to women especially that his heart went out
this is known as seeing how the land lies
yet he held himself perfectly erect , so that he would look good in case anyone behind him should happen to be watching
it was a dull , broken , strangled , rasping voice , the rough voice of an old man made husky by brandy and spirits
he had not taken the letter éponine had given him without a thrill
the orion was later employed in brest as a training ship , but at the time it was part of the mediterranean squadron
a lot of forehead in a face is like a lot of sky over a skyline
but , jean valjean plowed on , i must stay
when he got down again from the scaffold , there was a look in his eye that made the crowd stand back
he ran to a candle in the downstairs room
the flames were causing an iron pot hanging on a hook to hiss
they do not lose sight of each other , but they lose their hold on each other
at last jean valjean began to feel the calmness of utter devastation
you ’ re right , she said
why d ’ yer think , monsieur ?
he fixed marius with a wild-eyed stare
you can see what torment he was in
keep going , said jean valjean
there , we lose all trace of him
he had finally plucked up the courage to go closer to the bench
jean valjean went pale
he stopped for a few seconds and seemed to be weighing it up
if you don ’ t have sunlight , you have to make it
he had himself religiously removed the imperial effigy from the cross napoléon had given him ; this created a hole that he did not want to fill with anything else
the spirit of paris , that demon that creates children of chance and men of destiny , unlike the latin potter , turns the common or garden-variety jug into an amphora
yet it is likely that the inhabitants were roused , for a small square dormer window on the third floor was finally seen to light up and open and an old man with grey hair was seen to appear at this window with a candle , openmouthed and frightened-looking—it was the porter
see the number map of parisnumber
nothing , we repeat , is left of it today
in the pruning season , he made twenty-four sous a day ; number after that he would hire himself out as a harvester , as an unskilled worker , as a farmhand or cowherd , as any kind of casual labourer
as he came to a street that struck him as being the rue du contrat-social , a gunshot , coming from who knows where and shooting across the darkness randomly , whistled past him very close ; the bullet went through a copper shaving dish hanging outside a hairdresser ’ s shop
fantine did not earn enough
the ordinary life that is the stuff of absolutized art , the uninspiring subject who passively commands the light machine 's recording and the nondescript historical agent who actively makes shared history are here made identical
she lived on the quai des célestins , at the corner of that ancient rue du petit-musc , which has done what it could to come up smelling like roses despite the odour of its bad reputation
the old world has given me an appetite
i was counting on the absentminded marius , who is pretty good on the whole , but he doesn ’ t come here anymore
wellington sat there , icily heroic
marius ran into courfeyrac , he ran to monsieur mabeuf
the face was not absolutely unfamiliar to marius
she continued : they ’ re a silly lot , they are , these peasants , with their nicknames !
five , you will say , that ’ s hardly likely
it had probably been written there during the night
first you enter the garden
when they had climbed over this little roadblock , they found themselves alone together in the lane
the end was near
the chemise , while we ’ re at it , he said
what you saw was night , emptiness , the dark , a winter fog mingled with vapour from the grave , a sort of terrifying peace , a silence in which you took in nothing , not even a sigh , a shadowland where you could make out nothing , not even a phantom
fauchelevent took a step back and cracked his knuckles
neither the convention nor the death of louis xvi , nor napoléon , nor the return of the bourbons—nothing had been able to erase the memory of this crowning achievement
this assignat from la vendéenumber had been nailed to the wall by the previous gardener , an old member of the chouan partynumber who had died in the convent and been replaced by fauchelevent
people could not get their bearings in the waste dump network any more than they could make themselves understood in the city ; up above , the unintelligible babble , down below , an inextricable tangle ; beneath the confusion of tongues lay the confusion of cellars ; daedalus replicated babelnumber
jean valjean answered : no
lord almighty , that poor queen i seen go by in the cart !
the gold elixir , he would shout , bestuchef ’ s yellow dye , général lamotte ’ s drops , number were , in the eighteenth century , one louis for a half-ounce vial , the great remedy for the catastrophes of love , the panacea against venus
number , where she was a folder and stitcher
ideas almost refuse to allow themselves to be expressed by these ex-convict nouns
what was this barricade made of ?
the windows of the dining room looked out onto the street
as the sun set at the end of the day , dragging out the shadow on the ground of the tiniest pebble , jean valjean sat behind a bush in a great red plain that was absolutely deserted
the police have discovered that this monsieur madeleine was none other than an ex-convict in breach of ban , sentenced in number for robbery , and named jean valjean
to the inhabitants of one area , he cited the example of the inhabitants of a neighbouring area
do you hear me ?
at barthélemy ’ s , near the barrière du trône , at capel ’ s , at the petit-chapeau , drinkers sang out to each other with heavy gravity
said marius , going white
the absolute power of art whereby yvetot is as good as constantinople ’ , is possible only on the basis of such a pact with the insignificant
expiring here is humiliating
when the master falls in france , he falls everywhere
what is that supposed to mean ?
it was a full moon that night
an imperceptible flush passed over monsieur leblanc ’ s face but he answered with his usual placidity , in his usual soft , steady voice : no more than before
i ’ m sick to death of him
the bourgeoisie is quite simply the contented section of the people
the bishop ’ s candlesticks were in their place on the mantelpiece
so , the felt outrageousness of history never ceases to find pictorial expression
if she asked him twice , he would simply smile by way of reply
my child , said the doctor , calm down
meanwhile the drinkers had started singing an obscene ditty and they were laughing so hard they shook the ceiling
in any case , whenever both happen to be sincere and good , no one gets on as well or becomes as close as an old priest and an old soldier
how ’ d he get out ?
the merchant pacing back and forth at the back of his stall had a bit of the effect on her of the eternal father
a worm in a carriage !
volcanoes are full of darkness capable of bursting into flame
he would have to be content with half of what he wanted
he set to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness out in the open air under the beautiful trees of the luxembourg , in the sun
the diamonds and rubies look wet and make the veiled ones cry , below in the shadows , veiled ones whose flanks are torn and bruised black-and-blue by cilices and by scourges with iron tips , whose breasts are crushed by wicker racks , whose knees are skinned by prayer ; women who believe themselves to be brides of christ , spectres who believe themselves to be seraphimnumber do these women think ?
evening came , the theatres did not open ; the patrols did the rounds looking peevish ; pedestrians were searched ; suspects were arrested
after that , montparnasse had eluded javert
he could distinctly make out in the shadow a stranger that fate mistook for him and pushed into the gulf in his place
he had not seen madeleine ’ s debut
i saw him go out a while ago
he was forced to admit to himself that he had entrusted it a tad rashly to that stranger whose face he couldn ’ t even see properly
i could have killed the cat !
that evening , he had gone to bed far earlier than usual , advising that everything in the house be locked up , and he had finally dozed off from sheer fatigue
but it is my bedoom you should see
someone called bonaparte , scapin the clown … that world is no more
he looked on the people coldly and they returned his look
let ’ s look at the worst that can happen
nothing much fazes him , still less frightens him , he derides superstition , deflates exaggeration , makes a mockery of mysteries , pokes his tongue out at ghosts , knocks people off their high horses , caricatures epic aggrandizement
in that same year of number , the products of the new process invented by father madeleine were featured at the industrial exhibition ; acting on the jury ’ s report , the king named the inventor a chevalier of the légion d ’ honneurnumber—thereby providing a new rumour for the small-town mill
with his passionate and grave nature , marius surrounded the man to whom he owed his father ’ s life , or so he thought , that fearless sergeant who had saved the colonel as the cannonballs and bullets of waterloo were raining down , in a sort of glory
'inertia is a raw form of despair ' , saint-exupery claimed , at the end of his life
he did not know
he finally reached the blaru glade after a good forty minutes , sweating , soaked , out of breath , clawed to bits , ferocious
the room was not one of those that are bothered by the broom , the ceiling brush , or the duster
a helpful and graciously austere half-light that dissipates childish fears and prevents falls from grace
you ’ re not a woman
she hadn ’ t eaten either , or slept
laze around doing nothing !
lack of sleep , lack of food , emotional turmoil had thrown him , too , into a hallucinatory state
he focused on the accent and the gestures , but his disappointment only grew ; this man ’ s was a nasal tone , absolutely unlike the sharp dry voice he was expecting
they heard these words , barely audible , come from his lips : dying is nothing ; what ’ s terrible is not to live
there exists a very respectable liberal school that does not abhor waterloo
she will only be a baroness , which is demeaning , for she was born a marquise
the park , now part of the bien nationalnumber but at the time owned by the army supply officer bourguin , number was open , as luck would have it
radiant faces , white foreheads , innocent eyes full of happy light , all kinds of auroras would scatter into the shadows
the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark ; later , mirages that are too sudden and too alive spring up in it as in a camera obscuranumber it should be gently and discreetly enlightened , by the reflection of reality rather than by reality ’ s direct hard light
at the bottom of a ravine , he found water that he had to wade through
most likely he also made out , through all the hazy notions of a poor and completely ignorant man , something excessive in it
the jondrette garret appeared before him
that ’ s what a funeral ’ s all about
one evening , marius was wending his way to their rendezvous along the boulevard des invalides , walking with his head down as usual
what do you make of marat applauding the guillotine ? number
the sister looked up and replied : yes
they left the flap of cloth where it was , without finishing it off
he emptied his glass and added : dear me , laigle of the funeral orations , number your coat has had it
what sank adam might save gavroche
and he rushed to the casement window
listen to this : —the high cost of kings
he ’ d thought of himself as quite young till then and had followed the fashions
the servant found a scrap of paper , which she handed to marius
what do you want ?
and cosette came back : how mean to have left us like that !
a little street , the rue du chemin-vert-saint-antoine , opened up between two yards enclosed by walls
such channels bored through are ineffaceable ; such formations , indestructible
she ’ ll find my letter
on their side , the insurgents posted sentinels at the corners of crossroads and boldly sent patrols beyond the barrières
he leaned over and spoke in a half whisper to lacoste , the guide
his friends shortened this to bossuetnumber
it is because of this decline that the convent gave up educating girls
at the renewed insistence of the hostess , the yellow man , the millionaire , finally consented to have supper
they yell and carry on , if you only knew what a scream they are !
these teachers do the fairs—i ’ ve seen them
just as demons and spirits recognize by certain signs the presence of a superior god , thénardier understood that he was dealing with someone very strong
it must be thrown down
fantine was beautiful and remained pure for as long as she could
tailor the song to his nature and stand back !
i ’ m going to die in a little while
the smile of the woman you love has a brightness you can see at night
lord uxbridge , who the next day buried his leg , had a fractured knee
she was usually on her own there , because from this gallery , which was up some stairs , you could see the priest or the officiant and that was prohibited to the nuns
tell me , will you do that for me and not cry ?
wherever jean valjean was , there was well-being
in prison , he said
he ’ s my friend , like i told you
fresh surprise for marius
they ’ ll hop in a cab together with my friend up behind
they ’ ve certainly been in a hurry to notify the doctor this time !
death is merely a prolongation of sleep
he called me father
one day he followed cosette to the rue de l ’ ouest
his eyes were closed
the sewer , in the old paris , was the meeting place of all exhaustion and all enterprise
we have to tell you , since this is history
what the eye of the peasant woman of efremov sees is this strange democracy that derives from a mechanical eye and ear that go everywhere , treat on an equal footing the light shining on the great and the small alike , offer a face , a voice and speech to the anonymous but never have to answer their questions
it would seem that the same red goatee popped up later with the same function in another riot , the quénisset affair
then he turned to jean valjean
this budding young soul changed hands from a prude to a pedantic prig
that ’ s what justice is !
we ’ ve got no time to waste
all i have to do is let things take their course
the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence , based on his clearly observable state of intoxication on the night of the ambush , and he was set free
and are you doing the trip on horseback with your regiment ?
gavroche stopped , patted his sides , fumbled in his fob gusset , turned his pockets inside out , found nothing , not a sou , and began to shout : help !
some extreme emotion was required to wring out of him , once or twice a year , that lugubrious cackle of the convict , which is like the echo of a demon ’ s laugh
what does that grisly pile of mixed bones buried beneath the furrows of waterloo make of that , i wonder ?
a local tradition , obviously exaggerated , has it that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the sunken road of ohain
take the example of the new neurotic realism of adman and collector , charles saatchi , as revealed in the london ( and new york ) exhibition , 'sensation ' , with its fusion/confusion of the tabloid and
ah , you had red hands in those days , mademoiselle ; they are nice and white now
they had a troupe of shady extras at their disposal for any secret underworld drama
by means of what organ ?
can ’ t a girl sit on a stone these days ?
for a moment or two he stood , drunk and tottering , with this whirlwind swirling around in his head ; then he looked up , stared hard at his grandfather and shouted in a thundering voice : down with the bourbons and that fat pig of a louis xviii !
one of the pallets was close to the door , the other close to the window
only , they were always looking up with a sort of off-putting assurance
in number , in a whole host of streets—rue de l ’ étoile , saint-louis , du temple , vieille-du-temple , notre-dame-de-nazareth , folie-méricourt , quai aux fleurs , rue du petit-musc , de normandie , pont-aux-biches , des marais , faubourg saint-martin , rue notre-dame-des-victoires , faubourg montmartre , rue grange-batelière , in the champs-élysées , rue jacob , rue de tournon—the old gothic cloaca still cynically flashed its gaping chops
the streets were deserted
this society was to survive even the decrees of the court of assizes pronouncing its dissolution
he had never seen anything like it
you ask around , talk to my landlord , i pay the rent on time now , they ’ ll tell you i ’ m straight down the line
accordingly : vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche ?
it is the ingratitude of nature
courfeyrac threw his arms around his neck
your beautiful white hands , madame la baronne , will have the honour of scraping and saving to make ends meet
he went to the window
in a decidedly fin de siecle world , where the automobile questions its driver about the function- ing of the hand brake or whether the seatbelt is buckled , where the refrigerator is gearing itself up to place the order at the supermarket , where your computer greets you of a morning with a hearty 'hello ' , surely we have to ask ourselves whether the silence of art can be sustained for much longer
destitution makes an offer , society gives the nod
sort things out amicably
there is bankruptcy in creation
this was where the thorn in the side was
at the end of the hour , aunt gillenormand said : lovely !
call me father and you ’ ll see !
monsieur , all wheels don ’ t just fit all axles
each man chooses his place as though at the theatre to see a show
she had seen it !
the cur was put behind bars
charlot said to charlotte
it was some poor unfortunate who was not quite literate , but not completely illiterate ; he had been a tumbler working the fairs as well as a public letter-writer
very eighteenth century : frivolous and grand
into a pretty skirt with a chemise
yet , the gravedigger continued , you can not serve two mistresses
an old man , who looked really old , was marching with this band
this gave them pause for thought
they played , they yelled at each other , they formed huddles , they ran around ; pretty little white teeth chattered away in corners ; the veils , from afar , surveyed the laughter , the shadows spied on the rays of sunshine , but what did it matter !
but he only managed to bag azelma
the glow from that sweet face lit up his own pale face
those who had seen jean valjean in the days when he was passing through digne , in october number , would easily have recognized all the components of this miserable fancy dress
he held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it , stupidly happy , almost ready to laugh at the hallucination he ’ d been hoodwinked by
i don ’ t have the right to use it
this light added to the scarlet of the flag an indescribably terrible crimson
one morning an old woman who looked a bit dotty turned up on her doorstep and said , don ’ t you know me , mademoiselle ?
it comes and goes , moves toward the grave , then turns back toward life
he , for his part , accustomed to being found good-looking by the ladies , did not remember cosette any more than any other woman
the monarchy begins and ends in the ambulatory onlooker
one side of the double door cracked open a little and javert gave it a shove
the following month , they were short of money again ; the woman took cosette ’ s clothes to paris and pawned them at the mont-de-la-piété , the pawnshop , for the sum of sixty francs
for the second time , he stopped in his tracks
he walked over to the hedge for a look at the view
and so on , and so forth
he declared in his conscience that all that had been for the good
would you give me something to eat and a place to sleep ?
he ’ s just there , two feet away
that is , until the saatchi affair of autumn , when the exhibition 'sensation ' at the brooklyn museum , financed by ' christie 's interna- tional , had the unavowed aim of speculating on the value of the works on show
a limbo world in foetal state , something never before seen !
you save people ’ s lives and then you forget all about them !
he now crossed over the esplanade and the pont des invalides , the champs-élysées , the place louis xv , and turned into the rue de rivoli
yet one crucial aspect of this mutation of the seventh art has been too long ignored and that is the arrival of the talkies
and i say : erudimini qui judicatis terramnumber here lies blondeau , blondeau the nose , blondeau nasica , the bullock of discipline , bos disciplinae , the great watchdog of order , the angel of roll call , who was straight , square , punctual , rigid , honest , and awful
i will buy this pair of stockings , replied the man , and , he added , taking a five-franc coin out of his pocket and laying it on the table , i will pay for them
i swear we need to be on our own
more thousand-franc notes , no doubt !
now this , he muttered , is just the thing for plowing through dirt—or a man
we promised them solemnly to give them one
she murmured : but i might be going away and you can ’ t come !
one night , a doyenne of that special small world of high society , curious by right of seniority , ventured to ask : monsieur le maire is doubtless the cousin of the late bishop of digne ?
these six months are pretty moderate—the rule says all year , but hair shirts are unbearable at the height of summer and produce fevers and nervous spasms , so their use had to be restricted
he knew some artists ’ apprentices , a tribe closely related to his own
the war minister of the day , the maréchal soult , number who had seen austerlitz , watched it all with a sombre air
what are you giving us the once-over for like that ?
and gold is the lodestone
to stay a maid is all very well , but it ’ s chilly
proclamations addressed to the national guard of the départements were read in the middle of the street
the whole costume was , if we may use the word , tired ; the seams were going white , a sort of buttonhole was opening up on one of the elbows , and , on top of this , a button was missing on the breast of the coat ; but this was a mere detail , for the statesman ’ s hand had always to be inside his coat over his heart , the purpose being to hide the missing button
the heroic child answered : ah , well , but in that time , they ’ ll storm the barricade and i won ’ t be there
they were soon distracted by the commotion at the water ’ s edge , which they could make out through the branches of the great trees and which absorbed their attention completely
as for monsieur gillenormand ’ s two daughters , whom we have just mentioned , they were born ten years apart
it creates wealth to a wonderful degree ; it distributes it badly
it was the same hoarse voice , the same forehead , browned and wrinkled by the sun , the same open , wild , and wandering gaze
where did i get such a father ?
without a pass , he could not get back into the cemetery
but explain to me how my carriage , which is two paces away behind the trees , and my fine table and the guinea fowl i eat on fridays and my twenty-five-thousand-francs income and my palaces and my lackeys prove that pity is not a virtue , that clemency is not a duty , and that ’ number was not hideously ruthless
alix ( the big girl , nine ) : no , she doesn ’ t
the smaller branches , without breaking off the trunk , grow away from it
they usually gathered together at nightfall , which is when they woke up , in the wasteland next to la salpêtrière
the old man let out a laugh , shrill and grim , through which he coughed and spoke
a minute more and they ’ d have been in the fire
after a life of love , an eternity of love is , indeed , an increase ; but to increase the intensity itself of the ineffable felicity that love brings to the soul—that is impossible , even for god
enjolras , who was standing on top of the roadblock , fusil in hand , lifted up his handsome , austere face
fauchelevent began to bow once more
well , i don ’ t know , but it seems to me that that ’ s your son
while the voices went on singing , jean valjean no longer thought anything
this man and this woman were among such people
this done , she had laid it down in her arms and was softly singing to put it to sleep
down with the pope !
gavroche must have handed my letter to him , instead of you
said jean valjean , and suddenly springing up , foot still on the coin , he added : i ’ d get cracking if i was you !
people moved on to other things
everything else was banished from his thoughts
he was from outside the département
marius now had no weapon ; he had chucked his pistols once they were discharged , but he had spotted the powder keg next to the door in the downstairs room
enjolras broke off at this point rather than stopped ; his lips moved silently as though he were continuing to talk to himself , which made the men watch him closely , straining to hear him still
he felt its icy breath brush right up against him , at his back
so let ’ s count the herd for a bit
the field of waterloo today looks like any other plain ; it has that calm that belongs to the earth as mankind ’ s impassive support
solitude , silence , night ; a mysterious chill that bit to the bone
in number , the cowardly breach of silence on the part of the taciturn legislative body , emboldened by disaster , was worthy only of outrage , and it was a crime to applaud ; in number , faced with those treacherous marshals , faced with a senate that lurched from one dirty deed to another , insulting where once it had deified , faced with this idolatry collapsing and then spitting on the idol , it was a duty to turn away
meanwhile , the man went on , i still haven ’ t paid what i owe
he was over a hundred
whoever sees paris feels like they have seen the hidden side of the whole of history with the sky and the constellations in the gaps in between
it was all over
rome was of the same temperament
the old gothic slang is crawling with it
paris is a maelstrom where anyone can lose themselves and everyone disappears in the world ’ s great whirlpool just as they would do in the whirlpool of the sea
savages getting about stark naked , their noggins tizzed up like shuttlecocks , with clubs in their paws , aren ’ t as savage as these gay young blades !
the squares , eaten into by the frenzied cavalry , dwindled without flinching
the saint bartholomew killers , september cutthroats , avignon slaughterers , assassins of coligny , assassins of madame de lamballe , assassins of brune , miquelet militia , followers of verdet , cadenette-wearing soldiers , companions of jesus , the chevaliers du brassard—that is riot for you
take that however you like
for , of all the tortures that he had suffered in this long testing that destiny had subjected him to , this one was the most awful
monsieur leblanc seized the moment
humanity realistically represented is a humanity that has withdrawn – like the face of the jew at the window which is not so much a victim 's face , frightened or resigned , as a seer 's face , already removed from humanity , witness to a cataclysm even more astonishing than it is horrible
ruthless , yes , said the bishop
as we see , the two barricades , although physically isolated , were very much of one mind
can you imagine , monsieur javert , he sent me packing , because of a pack of old harlots who tell tales and stab you in the back in the workshop
how i miss the days when i used to see bonaparte and talma going into the bal-sauvage arm in armnumber seditious words—six months ’ jail
another time he received the death notice of a gentleman of the district , which laid out , in one long page , not only the honours of the deceased but all the feudal ranks and titles of nobility of every one of his relations
when you say convent , you say swamp
but he had to know first of all if it really was javert
there are paper mills , tanneries , distilleries , big clock factories , steel mills , copper foundries , at least twenty iron foundries—four of them at lods , châtillon , audincourt , and beure are very big concerns—
the only thing they noticed especially was two candlesticks of an old-fashioned shape standing on the mantelpiece , which looked like they were made of silver since they bore hallmarks
we haven ’ t a clue who they are
forcing her to choose between the death of her child and the death of her conscience
as he passed by the cathedral square , he shook his fist at the church
being in jail for a crime does not prevent a person from getting another crime off the ground

i ’ d like to go and listen to musettes in the woods
people don ’ t know what they should know and know things they should not
cosette was used to the enigmatic side of her destiny and scarcely noticed her father ’ s odd ways
it was written in the colonel ’ s handwriting and this is what it contained :
ships being built there sit under a bell jar , so to speak
they saw him go up to the stove where there was never a fire and where the pipe , you know , was puttied with yellow clay
this was the last of the cartridges
no one ’ s ever heard of him !
the arrest of monsieur madeleine caused a sensation in montreuil-sur-mer , or , more precisely , an extraordinary commotion
the corridor through which jean valjean was now wending his way was not as narrow as the first
this helps make sense of the title of that heinrich heine institute conference , 'the elimination of nature as a theme in contemporary art '
i say that jean valjean and madeleine are the same man , and i say that javert had no killer other than javert , and when i say something , it ’ s because i have proof
who is the mademoiselle euphrasie in question ?
a host of souls , evil , vile , or bitter , who have passed through life and vanished into eternity are there , almost intact and in a way still visible in the form of a monstrous word
it was getting bigger , it seemed to move along in an orderly fashion , and yet it was all spiky and shuddering ; it seemed to be a conveyance but you could not make out its load
the inspector muttered : the long-haired bloke would have to be brujon , and the bearded bloke would have to be demi-liard , alias deux-milliards
it was broad daylight and yet the child slept on
misery , prostitution , police officers , saint-lazarenumber—that ’ s what those beautiful delicate girls will come to , those fragile marvels of modesty , of kindness and beauty , fresher than lilacs in the month of may
but éponine would not let go and kissed him all the harder
and chewed on a bit of bread
the whole point of love is to stray
all the bottomless pits had opened up again inside him
he was in the grip of a whole host of new sensations
they thought they could hear voices singing in infinity ; they had god in their hearts ; destiny appeared to them as a ceiling of stars ; they saw above their heads a glimmer of the rising sun
your third estate is insipid , colourless , odourless , and shapeless
one day an arrogant cook , a cordon bleu , number of the noble race of concierges , presented herself
it seemed to him that these remote splendours , far from dispelling his own darkness , made it all the more funereal and black
it involves all the work on variations and combinations of images – reproductions , icons , idols – trivializing multiple images of governors or stars ( andy warhol ) ; transporting official images of the young mao to the piazza san marco in venice ( erro ) ; combining a portrait of miss america with a snapshot of a vietnamese prisoner of war being beaten up ( wolf vostell ) ; further mummifying the mummified portrait of brezhnev ( erik boulatov )
the two vertical strokes would be the rue de la grande-truanderie and the rue de la chanvrerie and the horizontal stroke would be the rue de la petite-truanderienumber the old rue mondétour cut the three strokes at the most tortured angles
on june number , number , robespierre on horseback was thrown from the saddle
but what proved that this thief was champmathieu ?
you could say that it created man a second time , by giving him a second soul , power
youth , even in its heartaches , always has a luminosity of its own
when the five men sent back to life had gone , enjolras went on to the man condemned to death
beyond the agnus deis and the ave marias , number the only thing mademoiselle vaubois had an inkling about was the different ways of making jams
the street suddenly went black
two of the brigands clapped their hands on his shoulders and the masked man with the ventriloquist ’ s voice stood facing him , ready , at the slightest movement , to smash his skull in with a blow of the giant key
for the gulf to close up again , someone had to fall in—himself or the other man
i ’ m the unlucky one ; i ’ m on the outside , looking in
he feels buried at once by those two infinities , the ocean and the sky ; the one a grave , the other a shroud
it was the interior of that mournful and severe house known as the convent of the bernadines of perpetual adoration
take advantage of it
for two days the riot had strongly agitated , outraged , and preoccupied monsieur gillenormand
in all the years i ’ ve lived here , he said , this is the first time anyone has been to my home
this put the smile back on the king ’ s face
he strolled beneath these windows until the light went out
you see that we have no bad intentions
there are words and incidents that wake up even those in the depths of despair
little by little he recovered
he is the first abbé of clairvaux
the english army was profoundly shaken
those minutes in which we live through centuries have this supremely and wonderful peculiarity , which is that while they go past , they fill our hearts completely
they were the kind of men who , diminished in number , grew in heart
in the dismal war of june number , one insurgent , an awe-inspiring shot who was fighting from the top of a roof garden , had himself brought a voltaire armchairnumber up there ; a blast of grapeshot found him seated in it
of course they recognize you !
look at me , hanging his key on his nail !
you will remember that the last time he escaped , he had already been on a mysterious trip there or in the general environs , which the law got wind of
he occasionally went in for gentle raillery but there was almost always a serious message involved
a hole in the heart is not satisfied with a stopgap
i loved you , says the corpse
and i ’ m leaving for palestine
he was , along with the comte gérard and the comte drouet , number one of napoléon ’ s maréchaux in pettonumber the treaties of number stirred him up like some personal offence
fauchelevent grabbed the shovel and jean valjean the pick and together they buried the empty coffin
the two little boys trotted along behind mechanically , holding each other by the hand
this intersection being a junction , the point is a node
feeling that all extremes meet and that , if you are not careful , abasement of fortune may lead to baseness of soul , he jealously watched over his pride
were explained , they stood for urbain fabre , and ursula ’ s name was no longer ursula
as he lifted her up , he touched her hand
would he find it in time ?
i was as hungry as a wolf before i came here ; but you are so good , that , now , i don ’ t know what ’ s hit me ; it ’ s gone
that said , he forgot all about the lancer
from the top of the pile the space that had to be climbed to reach the top of the wall was only about fourteen feet , if that
i was saying , monsieur , dear patron , jondrette resumed , leaning on the table and contemplating monsieur leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of a boa constrictor , i was saying that i had a painting for sale
one of them had made himself a dagger out of a shoemaker ’ s hook by snapping the hook off and sharpening the stump
they didn ’ t seem to be in any hurry and yet they were walking faster than i was
they had gone to bed in silence
he ate whatever he could garner for dinner
jean valjean began to understand
the next day at dusk marius arrived in vernon
paris very quickly gets used to everything—it ’ s only a riot—and paris is so busy that it does not trouble itself for so little
oh , i ’ m not excessive
only once , at one of these departures , had she accompanied him in a fiacre as far as the corner of a little cul-de-sac , where she read : impasse de la planchette
javert ducked , the cobblestone flew over him , hit the back wall , taking out a huge chunk of plaster , and then bounced back , ricocheting from corner to corner across the room , which was happily almost empty , to come to rest just behind javert
badly , answered jondrette , with a terribly distressed and grateful smile , very badly , my worthy monsieur
the fortress was complete
how would he ever get out of there ?
the little girl , taking this remark seriously , began to wail again , louder than ever , quite beautifully
they put up with him because of his good humour
during the afternoon of this same christmas eve of number , a man had been strolling up and down the deserted part of the boulevard de l ’ hôpital in paris for quite some time
so , he had thénardier at last
sixty francs down the drain
a fat flemish servant promptly set the table for him
the hull had not been damaged on the starboard side , but a few planks had been pried open here and there , according to custom , to let air into the shell
but by being in too much of a hurry to sit down , you can even stop the march of the whole human race
each was the image of the man who built it
the basket will be made of pine and the lid will be a black sheet
one of the four was known as the baby because she was the youngest ; and one was known as the old girl
then , turning back to the elder girl : well , then !
what is your name ?
this repression was not accomplished without noise , without that tumultuous racket peculiar to clashes between the army and the people
they ripped officers ’ epaulets off
you like apple turnovers , mesdames , but don ’ t eat too many of them
this thénardier , if you took him at his word , had been a soldier—a sergeant , he claimed ; he had probably taken part in the campaign of number , and even acquitted himself quite bravely , so it would seem
from that moment , as we saw , he was a different man
everyone on the job
one day she said to jean valjean : father , let ’ s take a stroll down there for a bit
for many years now , from the time my hair turned white , i ’ ve sensed that many people think they have the right to look on me with contempt ; for the poor ignorant hordes , i wear the face of the damned and , hating no one , i accept the isolation hate brings
right , right , sit down , said the old man
he was obviously surprised that a man could talk like that
they go back five hundred years to a raoul de faux , a jean de faux , and a thomas de faux , who were all noblemen , one of them being a seigneur de rochefort
him on top , me inside
you speak such amazingly good sense
with familiarity gone , with this vous instead of tu , with this madame and this monsieur jean , he was a different person for cosette
blindness does not exist where there is certainty
two candles were burning on it , one in a bright green copper candlestick , the other in the neck of a cracked carafe
the bag revealed to bystanders this name written in big black letters on a card sewed to the material : marius pontmercy
a second later the door opened again , mademoiselle gillenormand did not come in , but showed herself at the doorway ; marius was standing , mute , his arms hanging , with the face of a criminal , monsieur gillenormand was pacing up and down the length of the room
he endured it , exasperated
no pocket was so dingy it did not hold a bit of money , no abode so poor it did not enjoy a bit of joy
the day after a wedding is lonely
i ’ m going up to my room
she broke off , not daring to go any further
the thénardiers , however , hung on to the kid and dished out a hundred poor excuses
at fifteen , she came to paris to seek her fortune
there was only one door still ajar through which my past could erupt into my present life
on the side of the french , in this battle of the cuirassiers , delord , l ’ héritier , colbert , dnop , travers , and blancard were out of action , but on the side of the english , alten was wounded , barne was wounded , delancey was killed , van meeren was killed , ompteda was killed , wellington ’ s entire staff was decimated , and england came off worse in this bloody juggling act
yet it ’ s only ten years ago
this question summed up the situation and woke jean valjean out of his reverie
one where the water is still , but deep
around the time when workers take a break , two men were seen meeting between the barrière picpus and the barrière charenton in a little covered way between two walls near a barkeeper ’ s who had a siamese draught board on a card table out front
we ’ re a crossroads , here
before the man had time to say another word , she added : i don ’ t think so
if a candle appeared , he slapped on a mask
but that did not stop you from having your sword by your side
so then , i couldn ’ t earn enough and that ’ s when all the bad luck started happening
he took an old shovel and spread the ash over the wet embers so as to hide them completely
and then , to tell the truth , although the judge was a good man and smart enough , he was at the same time a committed and almost ardent royalist , and he had been shocked that the mayor of montreuil-sur-mer , in speaking of the landing in cannes , had used the word emperor and not buonaparte
let ’ s see what they ’ ve got in their paunches
a machine made of spirit
it is likely he was holding counsel with himself
sister , he said , are you alone in the room ?
you very often saw , at the dip where the sides of a street or an intersection ended , wide square grates with big bars whose iron shone , burnished by the feet of the crowd
after dinner , he said to courfeyrac : come and i ’ ll take you to a show
in that case , said javert , forgive me if i insist—it is my duty—you have not seen this evening a person , a man
then she opened the window and ran her eyes all around , hoping to be able to turn up something of the street , a corner of a house , a patch of pavement , and be able to watch for marius there
gavroche buried his fist in another of his pockets and pulled out a note folded in four
since we are in the process of giving details about what was once the convent of petit-picpus and have dared to open a window on this discreet refuge , we hope the reader will allow us a further small digression , one basically foreign to this book but typical and useful in showing us that even the cloister has its original characters
a young working girl passing close by one day said : now there ’ s a widower who ’ s nice and neat
there was no bread and no meat
the danger of the position was the forest of soignes , then right alongside the battlefield and cut off by the ponds of groenendael and boitsfort
since everyone had the plateau , no one had it and , in a word , it remained for the greater part to the english
just as the brother and sister were getting up from the table , there was a knock at the door
he had to wait for the bulk of his army corps and he had been given the order to mass his forces before entering into battle ; but at five o ’ clock , seeing the peril wellington was in , blücher ordered bülow to attack and said this remarkable thing : we must give the english army time to come up for air
this was precisely the same month that the thénardiers , having demanded twelve francs instead of six , had just upped it to fifteen francs instead of twelve
jean valjean found himself , with marius still senseless , in a sort of long underground corridor
it ’ s the small jug of red at six a shot
the lamp shone on him from one side , the fire from the other
you need a small anvil two inches square and a spirit lamp to soften the wax
what makes a riot ?
you are so graceful
above this frightening nest of shadow , the upper floors of houses stood out , livid ; at the very top , the chimneys were turning white
here , where the collège rollin stands today , there is a square where the rue neuve-sainte-geneviève joins the rue des postes
the nights may be cold but the days are hot
enjolras was more manly
that said , she curtseyed to marius and to jean valjean
the republic , the empire , had been nothing but monstrous words for him till that moment
the ideal of some twirp of twenty about to marry is to be like monsieur royer-collardnumber and do you know what the world ’ s coming to with that kind of stateliness ?
would it have changed her , cosette ?
louis-philippe was a broad-daylight kind of king
cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her smock , and went green
he held it up to the candle , looking for the initials
fauchelevent ’ s turn had come
something awful will happen in town tonight
there , you saw a barrier of black shutters , secured and reinforced by wooden crossbars painted a gingerbread yellow
marius did not ask himself any of these questions
this time the jig was up
there ’ s a five-hundred-franc note in the chest of drawers
v sundry thunderbolts fall on ma bougon
the streets of the quartier latin , which were crawling with students and working girls , number saw the beginning of this idyll
the long-haired one dug the other one in the ribs and said : with patron-minette , you can ’ t go wrong
the restoration had been one of those intermediary phases that are hard to define , in which there is weariness , buzzing , murmuring , dozing , uproar all at once—phases that are nothing more or less than a great nation coming to a standstill
none of the puzzles he ’ d hoped would be cleared up had been illuminated ; on the contrary , they had all , perhaps , become even more opaque ; he knew nothing more about the beautiful girl from the luxembourg gardens or about the man he called monsieur leblanc , except that jondrette knew who they were
the old woman wondered
a charter is a mask ; underneath it is the lie
near the fontaine de l ’ arbre-sec , there were gatherings , motionless gloomy groups , standing amid the eddying hordes like stones in the middle of a running stream
he was writing to her !
théodule , for his part , even with his nose on the inheritance , rebelled at the chore of pleasing
whenever he passed through a village , ragged little urchins would gleefully run after him and surround him like a cloud of flies
he sometimes held his own with monsieur de bonald and even monsieur bengy-puy-valléenumber
cosette would not have been able to come without monsieur fauchelevent
are you an inn ?
the english , replied the prowler
but the goal of the outing seemed achieved
napoléon , seeing the old boy give him the once-over with a certain curiosity , wheeled round and said brusquely : who is this little man staring at me ?
in the paris of the day there were two thousand two hundred streets
the saintonge regiment was part of the army of the rhine , for the old regiments of the monarchy kept their provincial names , even after the fall of the monarchy , and were not dragooned into the army until number pontmercy fought at spires , worms , neustadt , turkheim , alzey , and mayence , number where he was one of the two hundred who made up houchard ’ s rear guard
monsieur gillenormand wrung his hands with a frightening burst of laughter
the planet was , in fact , very close to the horizon at that moment and passed through a thick layer of mist that gave it a horrible red colour
nothing told him which part of the city he was crossing or what way he had come
mother thénardier ’ s raucous voice came back : don ’ t worry
to think about the dark is a serious thing
what i am doing at this moment , god , who is on high , looks down upon , and that is enough
it was the opportunity
it was evident to anyone familiar with the man ’ s straight , clear , sincere , righteous , austere , and ferocious conscience that javert was emerging from some huge inner struggle
we won ’ t have to tell any lies
six o ’ clock , said marius
and can we be sure we didn ’ t do anything before we were born ?
do you know them ?
pigritia is a terrible word
the french army was dressed in white , austrian style , the regiments were known as legions , and instead of numbers they wore the names of départements
dew is good , monsieur
you come and find the grandfather , who ’ s not a bad old stick at heart , and who always has a few rolls of louis lying around in an old drawer , and you say to him : grandfather , this is how it is
] number as for me , i ’ m for caesar alone
no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room
after the promotion of domestic consumerism via the euphoria of radiophony , it is now production that finds itself beefed up with a sound backdrop designed to improve office life
to be the empire of such an emperor—what more splendid destiny for a nation , when that nation is france and when its genius is added to the genius of the man !
he had taken the purse to the local police chief as lost property placed by the finder at the disposal of any claimants
only her sweet face was visible ; her hair was beautifully tousled , her eyelids were still swollen from sleep
they never disturbed him , not even by a sign , once he had begun any course of action
monsieur madeleine had known nothing of all this
those august hands no longer stirred
this was the reflection of the torch burning in the corinthe barricade
when he did not take cosette , she stayed with the old woman ; but nothing thrilled the little girl more than to go out with the man
the day begins in tears
in the rue du cimitière-saint-nicolas , an officer of the national guard , pursued by a troop armed with clubs and foils , took refuge after much ado in a house where he was stuck until that night , and could then only leave it in disguise
it ’ s cold in here !
mother thénardier went back to her stove and tasted what was in the pot with a wooden spoon , grumbling all the while : there ’ s some at the spring
shall we use a wet finger !
she followed him as stealthily as an old cat and managed to see him , without being seen , through the crack in the door directly opposite
who on earth can that man be ?
the greatest dangers are within us
you are going to live
for some hours now , javert had stopped being a simple man
to contemplate leads to action
duty could have dead ends !
i must have heard wrong
and so , said the bishop , i intend to proceed without an escort
the rule of martin verga
loved by cosette , he was happy !
you can see for yourself we ’ ve got a joint to case icigo , added babet
monsieur , he said , the palais de justice , please ?
where are we going to sleep tonight ?
the dragoons advanced at a walking pace , in silence , their pistols in their holsters , sabres in their sheaths , carbines in their rests , with an air of grim expectancy
a soul for a bit of bread
so , what are you waiting for ?
those are god ’ s lots
gave ’ em their money backnumber
but nothing could induce marius to spill the beans
a contorting triumph rippled and bloomed across that narrow forehead
thanks to genomics , you can now enter the human system in the same way as you break into a computer bank - without leaving any trace a tall
the heat of the burning coals was so great that the candle on the table was melting fast and had burned right down on the side nearest the stove
your burned muff , your lost boa !
be that as it may , dripping with sweat , drenched with rain , his clothes in tatters , his hands skinned raw , his elbows bleeding , his knees torn to shreds , thénardier had reached what children , in their figurative language , call the sharp edge of the wall of the ruin , he had lain on it stretched out to full length and there , at that point , his strength had failed him
she was always following at his heels
and what a splendid transfiguration !
the time that had gone by since koblenznumber was declared nonexistant
the butcher ’ s refusing credit , he won ’ t give us any more meat
white attacking white is ferocious ; if the lily could talk , it ’ d make mincemeat of the dove !
destiny makes such about-faces
we ’ ll break the door down !
yet they got along at quite a clip
he said ; it was his painful refrain
i ’ d prefer a ghost to a gendarme any day
my name is félix but i ’ m not happy
the social observer should step into these shadows
every one of them dreamed they were zétulbé
the porte saint-jacques , the porte paris , the barrière des sergents , the procherons , the galiote , the célestins , the capucins , the mail , the bourbe , l ’ arbre-de-cracovie , the petite-pologne , the petit-picpus—these are names from the old paris , lingering on in the new
it is terrifying , questioning the shadows
o , my brothers , this is the very spot where those who think and those who suffer come together as one ; this barricade is not made of cobblestones , or wooden beams , or scrap iron ; it is made of two heaps , a heap of ideas and a heap of pain
these are the joys of life
hang on a bit longer
it is a sort of dark polyp with a thousand antennae sitting in the earth and growing down below at the same time as the city above
the address ran : to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint-jacques-du-haut-pasnumber it contained these few lines :
this ferocious lynch lawnumber is not something any party has the right to reproach others with , for it is applied by the republic in america just as much as by the monarchy in europe
we no longer have a clue
what ’ s this got to do with me ?
yet while marius pinned her with a stunned and sorrowful look , the young girl was pacing up and down the garret as though she owned the place , with the audacity of a revenant
the mattress slid down between the two clothes poles and fell to the street
this point has never been cleared up
anyway , they are as ugly as can be , and i ’ d prefer a round table in mahogany
god can not add anything to the happiness of those who love each other except by giving them endless duration
i give it its due , nothing more
the counsel for the prosecution wound up by insisting that in the absence of javert , the three witnesses brevet , chenildieu , and cochepaille be heard again and solemnly cross-examined
such are the old monasteries of spain
a small rosebush sat dried out in a corner , forgotten
his daughter could try as she might to tell him , but he is your grandnephew , after all
i don ’ t know if you follow me , monsieur pontmercy , but to go off now , not see her anymore , not talk to her anymore , not have anything anymore—that would be hard
the solitude of a place where so many crimes had been committed had something awful about it
they took the boulevard
crime , intelligence , social protest , freedom of conscience , thought , theft , all that human laws pursue or have pursued , has hidden in this hole ; the maillotinsnumber in the fourteenth century , highwaymen in the fifteenth , the huguenots in the sixteenth , morin ’ s visionary illuminatinumber in the seventeenth , the chauffeurs , number those brigands who burned their victims ’ feet to make them talk , in the eighteenth
the judge of the royal court of douai , who was presiding over this session of the circuit court in arras , like everybody else , knew this name , so thoroughly and universally honoured
i succored the oppressed , i relieved the suffering
a mere wall separated him from these abandoned beings that lived groping around in the dark , beyond the land of the living
they also seized from the cell a half-empty bottle containing the remains of the laced wine with which the soldier had been knocked out
so no more jacquerie
i ’ ll have a hammer , a chisel , and some pliers in my pocket
the instant madeleine ’ s eyes met javert ’ s , javert , without moving , without stirring , without coming a step closer , became truly terrible
the military academe excommunicated him as it went under
this looked less like a human being than some sort of shade that the twilight had just hatched
the armchairs had disappeared
the rest of you , said thénardier , search him
he ate the bread and opened the wallet
enjolras ’ order was executed with the due haste peculiar to ships and barricades , the only two places of combat where escape is impossible
'the effect is so immediate that no words spring to mind
the bishop ’ s face immediately took on that expression of gaiety peculiar to hospitable natures : let ’ s eat !
the old man quietly took it on the chin and suffered in silence
they don ’ t get a lot of people passing through in those parts
they went to the watchmaker ’ s
nothing to expect , nothing to hope for
this madame thénardier was a redhead , fleshy , yet bony ; the soldier ’ s-wife type in all its ghastliness , and with an odd bent look acquired from devouring romantic novels
in seizing the colours , he had received a sabre cut across his face
the downstairs room had spruced itself up a bit
at the entrance to the rue de l ’ homme-armé , the fiacre stopped
the subject of his sermon was charity
was marius and cosette ’ s happiness from now on condemned to such kinship ?
after napoléon , louis xviii
one of the blocks of shadow covered the whole wall that marius was leaning against in such a way that he disappeared
there is nothing to be said on that score
while cosette and toussaint are sleeping
resources dry up , necessities loom
he was something of a mason , something of a gardener , something of a doctor ; he bled a postilion once when he fell off his horse ; louis-philippe never went around without his lancet any more than henri iii did without his daggernumber the royalists scoffed at this ridiculous king , the first to have spilled blood as part of a cure
in the erasure of things that disappear , in the diminishing of things that vanish , philosophy recognizes everything
the sweat , the heat , the journey on foot , the dust , added a strange sordidness to his shabby appearance
the mother would die
the great assault and battery of number , number when poland was partitioned , got him going more than anything else
father madeleine required goodwill of the men and pure morals of the women and honesty of everyone
so , come to the chaumière ! number
conserve , conservation , conservative—that was more or less the entire lexicon
his brain had lost all power to retain ideas , they rushed through like waves and he grabbed his forehead in both hands to try and stop them
the son , regretting the swans , kept his head turned toward the pond until a flowerbed hid it from him
things get stuck , they won ’ t shift
what ’ s he got in his mitt , then ?
fancy getting them to take the armchairs away !
a palace and her heart
beautiful with a beauty both entirely womanly and angelic at once , with a complete beauty that would have made petrarch sing and brought dantenumber to his knees
a big blue handkerchief of the kind invalids use to blow their noses was tied like a shawl around her waist and largely concealed it
did she want to go out ?
in shrugging off the opinions of his grandfather to don the opinions of his father , he thought he was set ; he now suspected , anxiously and without daring to admit it to himself , that he was not
dishonesty espoused number , divine right hid itself behind a charter , fictions made themselves constitutional , prejudices , superstitions , and ulterior motives , taking article number to heart , cloaked themselves in liberalism
poor mothers , go and make pretty boys , why don ’ t you !
is it the eighteenth century ?
the colonel was perhaps wrong to accept these conditions , but he bowed to them believing he was doing the right thing and hurting only himself
does taking waterloo away from wellington and blücher mean taking something away from england and germany ?
marius was poor and his room was fairly bare ; but , just as his poverty was noble , his attic was clean
he no longer saw night , he saw blue skies
it ’ s just that , you see , there ’ s something that has to be said about taking post-horses … does monsieur have his passport ?
it won ’ t be for long
they spent several years in this way
father fauchelevent had insisted monsieur madeleine have the main room , and he was forced to accept it , for jean valjean had resisted in vain
this man of lofty virtue had three domiciles in paris solely for the purpose of evading the police
cosette lifted her head and replied : yes , monsieur
javert was in appalling pain
in neither case was there any right of reply
the king , in his inexhaustible clemency , has deigned to commute his sentence to that of hard labour in perpetuity
his whole face expressed this one idea : what ’ s the use ?
these salons did not stay pure for long
the description is fair , but incomplete
moral of the story : love defeated by colic
before such a soul , we can feel nothing but respect
now you mention it , yes , said dahlia , the famous surprise !
i don ’ t know anyone !
in a word , was this genius , as many historians of note have thought , on the wane ?
it was a second piece of ordnance
too right , uncle , said théodule
it ’ s for the poor
it doesn ’ t even have any drawers
for him monsieur madeleine had kept all his prestige
at one end of the room , where he found himself , worried-looking judges in worn-out robes were biting their nails or closing their eyes ; at the other end , the rabble in rags , lawyers in every possible pose , soldiers with hard , honest faces ; tarnished old wainscoting , a dirty ceiling , tables covered in serge that was rather more yellow than green , doors blackened by hands ; nails planted in the panelling , small tavern-style oil lamps providing more smoke than light ; on the tables , candles in brass candlesticks ; gloom , ugliness , sadness ; and from all this a sense of the austere and the august emanated , for you could feel that great human thing known as the law and that great divine thing known as justice in that room
the men began talking in low voices
ah , you don ’ t like the idea of working !
they ’ re saying the forty-hour prayers
when there were no more chiefs left alive except enjolras and marius at the two ends of the barricade , the centre , which courfeyrac , joly , bossuet , feuilly , and combeferre had held for so long , folded
after which he opened the gate , let the man out with his load on his back , shut the gate again , and bolted , not caring too much to get mixed up in the episode as it happens and especially not wanting to be there when the murderer chucked his victim into the river
let ’ s go for what is real
monsieur madeleine forced a smile
this provided an accessible and pragmatic element in all combeferre ’ s views
and you ’ ve gone into the choir for your work ?
my friend , he said to the stable hand , is there a wheelwright around here ?
within a few seconds , his expression had shifted from unbridled violence to a calm and relaxed cunning
it was a lot
i was with monsieur baloup , he put me up in his house
jean valjean was thoughtful without being glum , which is typical of affectionate natures
thénardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since the night of february number they never did find out how , and through whose connivance , he had managed to procure for himself and hide a bottle of that wine invented , they say , by desrues , which has a narcotic mixed in with it and which the endormeurs gang , number the dopers , made famous
listen , what is really unlucky is that i have these strings here in my heart that keep me bound
and yet , in later years , as we shall see further on , madame magloire found decorative paintings on the walls of mademoiselle baptistine ’ s chamber underneath the distempered wallpaper
how happy i will be !
take a breather , tholomyès , said blachevelle
the more you talk , the less you paint !
he did not study god , he was dazzled by him
old coats are exactly the same as old friends
he kept the sixteen sous and gave the five francs to the girl
all the blessings will fall away before they reach heaven , and only the curse will rise as far as god !
he bent over and looked at her
first he hands over twenty sous , then five francs , then fifty francs , then fifteen hundred francs—just as easily every time
for a gamin to hit the pavement is like a giant hitting the ground ; gavroche had only fallen the better to rise again ; he stayed sitting there on his haunches and , with a long trickle of blood streaking his face , he lifted up both arms in the air , turned his head to where the bullet had come from , and began singing :
the healthful , pure , vital , joyful , freely breathable air flooded him
end of the petit-picpus
did they stop at the scalp ?
the man looked at cosette ’ s poor red feet and continued : when will she be through with this pair of stockings ?
but , golly , said the boy , we didn ’ t have a home to go to anymore
the bandages were complex and difficult , for fixing pads and cloth in place with surgical tape or sticking plaster had not yet been dreamed up at the time
babet ’ s diaphanousness was in stark contrast to gueulemer ’ s meatiness
at the moment that the moonlight superimposed itself , so to speak , on this inner limpidity , the sleeping bishop appeared bathed in glory
he was not sure he was himself
the righter of wrongs , striking caesar , may strike too hard and be unjust
everything had the air of having lived a long time ago and of holding out doggedly against the grave
on the one hand , he would say , a public servant can ’ t be deceived ; a magistrate is never wrong
and the whole barricade clapped
the cabaret siege had begun
to become honest and good again
otherwise , he was a real swindler
was he , in the middle of the distractions and amorous diversions that filled his life , suddenly hit by one of those mysterious and terrible jolts that sometimes come and strike at the heart , bowling over the man public calamities couldn ’ t shake , threatening as these did only his existence and his fortune ?
he had one other worry : to teach himself , which he also described as saving himself
éponine started to laugh and leaped up to kiss him
in the smoke all this was glimpsed rather than seen
did you pick up your coin , at least ?
the noise of the rusty hinge had woken no one
the doorkeeper of the mairie had been put in place by the emperor
the implausible was natural there
you ’ ll be a wood louse in a cellar
the police officers , reemerging from the cadran gallery , had thought they heard the noise of footfalls coming from the direction of the ring sewer
one respects the reverential silence of the happy couple
out of the corner of his eye gavroche had assured himself that father mabeuf was still sitting on the bench , though perhaps asleep now
he sniffed around the law for a bit , but he never did it
go out of the barricade as fast as you can—gavroche , anxious , started to scratch his ear—and tomorrow morning , take it to the address on it , to mademoiselle cosette at monsieur fauchelevent ’ s place , rue de l ’ homme-armé , number seven
he stopped the horse and asked the man : how much further is it from here to arras ?
what had these men done ?
such a loan was only allowed on the part of novices
the senator , encouraged , took up the challenge : come on , let ’ s be good chaps
whoever is free is scrupulous ; whoever votes , reigns
it reverted to stammering about a charter
from the opposite side of the boulevard , the car with the masks was facing the car with the bride
this is the primitive foundation of every human language , what we might call the bedrock
history is that time in which those who have no right to occupy the same place can occupy the same image : the time of the material existence of the shared light of which heraclitus spoke , the sun of judgment none of us can escape
in the days of mathurin régniernumber the tavern was called the pot-aux-roses and as plays on words were all the rage , the sign was a post—poteau—painted rose pink
but as soon as they spot you , they remember they have a trade and that they have to make a living and they offer to sell you an old woolen stocking full of cockchafers or a clump of lilac
this point of the quai is not very far from the house brought from moret to paris in number by colonel brack , and known as the house of françois inumber a guardhouse sits right alongside it
whoever was around inhaled happiness ; life smelled good ; all of this nature gave off candour , succour , support , fatherliness , tenderness , a golden yellow freshness of dawn
finding his way was hard
every time the wind blows , it sweeps away more of humanity ’ s dreams than clouds in the sky
this was the other half of the english cavalry , so justly celebrated
… the day when we no longer suit you , crush us , but until then , help us to walk
there are people who have nothing !
'these offices are so quiet that the slightest noise , such as the phone ringing , disturbs people 's concentration which , of course , can lead to stuft- , ups
they pulled a sour face at every flourishing of the nation
the racket was indescribable ; trapped and burning smoke almost blanketed the fight in total darkness
fauchelevent felt himself teeter and almost fell into the grave himself
the dog and the cat were habitual table companions ; cosette ate with them , under the table , from a wooden bowl just like theirs
i am performing a duty , i am the sorry convict
it was an improvisation thrown up by ferment
as soon as they were alone , old man thénardier offered the traveller a chair
he began by passing judgment on himself
and who knows , anyhow ?
he prescribed an infusion of pure quinine and , if she became feverish again overnight , a soothing potion
you can take me , for here i am
everyone milled around gavroche
of a poor lover who hanged himselfnumber
marius had not left his place
the first cry of the enlightened and growing hordes is : death to thieves !
it ’ s all coming along nicely , replied jondrette , but my feet are frozen
there was a blow with a stick
there ’ s been a mistake , i ’ m telling you
this other lifer , who had come straight from jail and who was dressed in red like chenildieu , was a peasant from lourdes , half man , half pyrenees bear
you didn ’ t see a sort of godforsaken rodentlike little muscadinnumber of a fop getting about over that way by any chance , did you ?
let ’ s do our duty !
what can i do ?
you can go straight in
marius had got into the habit of walking down this path without thinking
since the restoration contests this title , which i have paid for with my blood , my son will take it and bear it
she was born at montreuil-sur-mer
it was the sound of muskets being cocked
marius had vanished ; it was over , what could she do ?
i made lint all the time , here , monsieur , see , it ’ s all your fault , i ’ ve got calluses on my fingers
they ’ re a bunch of vermin
the winds of change blow there as irresistibly as everywhere else
so why go there ?
the silence of the redoubt was probably beginning to worry the besiegers , causing them to fear some unexpected development , and they were probably feeling the need to see clearly through that heap of cobblestones and to know what was going on behind that impassable wall that took fire without returning it
toussaint had replied , stunned
she preferred an hour with him to her ravishing tête-à-têtes with catherine
he had barely finished when mother thénardier , indeed , rushed into the room , flushed , winded , panting , her eyes ablaze , and shouted , whacking both her thighs at once with her huge hands : false address !
he blessed and was blessed in return
i never twist anything
he felt the tug of an unknown feeling
jean valjean had some trouble moving and walking
the two men , chatting away standing-stock still in the snow that was swirling down , formed an association that a police sergeant would definitely have kept his eye on but that marius barely noticed
she grabbed the handle with both hands
he said to the man : why is the bread here so bitter ?
the hospital was a low , narrow , single-story house with a small garden
her creditors were harassing her
and there were all kinds of little treats on top of that
or the short straw !
then his eyes dropped to the four uniforms
little by little , for some time , he had been moving away from strict dogma and venturing into the wider fields of progress , and he had even come to accept , as a definitive and magnificent evolution , the transformation of the great republic of france into the vast republic of humanity
he cleared away the stones , lifted out the grate , loaded marius , inert as a corpse , onto his shoulders , and with this burden on his back , he dropped down into this sort of luckily fairly shallow well , using his elbows and his knees , let the heavy iron trapdoor fall shut over his head and the stones roll back over it again , and found his footing on the flagstone surface ten feet below ground
the amphictyonsnumber held two sessions a year , one in delphi , home of the gods , the other in thermopylae , home of the heroes
he said to himself : when i ’ ve finished my balls of blue , i ’ ll be rich , i ’ ll get my copperplates out of hock , i ’ ll get my flora back on the shelves with a bit of charlatanism , some hefty handouts under the counter , and a few ads in the papers , and i ’ ll buy , and i know exactly where , a copy of pierre de médine ’ s the art of sailing , the edition of number , with woodcuts
i ask nothing more
his slithering , his bearing , his mysterious darting movements caused him to resemble those crepuscular spectres that haunt ruins and that old norman legends call alleurs—goers
everything was the colour of dirt , even the sky
in the corner opposite grantaire , joly and bahorel were playing dominoes and talking about love
in the morning , everything was streaming , in the afternoon , everything is shining in a powdery haze
what geese these young men are !
a crisis was obviously brewing
shot of all moral or emotional compromise , the painter seeks to move 'towards the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea , between the idea and the onlooker '
the brutus who killed caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy
the bell tower of what was once their village forgot them ; the boundary of what was once their field forgot them ; after a few years ’ sojourn in jail , jean valjean himself forgot them
third : tailing is good , with relays of officers at intervals , but for important occasions , there ought to be at least two officers who do not lose sight of one another , so that if , for any reason , an officer takes sick on the job , the other can keep watch over him and stand in for him
the bourgeois talked peacably with the workers about what was ginnying up
after checking five or six housefronts barricaded in this fashion , the kid shrugged his shoulders and tackled the matter with himself in these terms : i ’ ll be buggered !
there was a stove in one corner burning away with glowing embers you could see
bossuet burst out laughing
the old man had had a shock and had given as good as he got , and so terribly that , in the blink of an eye , assailant and assailed had switched places
he always got away , sometimes resisting with violence
marius was a bronze vase , but old man gillenormand was an iron pot
citizen , i gave the letter to the porter
the simpleminded police of the restoration tended to view the people of paris through rose-coloured glasses
thénardier helped jean valjean get marius back on his shoulders , then he headed for the gate on his bare feet , tiptoeing , beckoning to jean valjean to follow him ; he peered outside , placed a finger to his lips and remained sort of suspended for a few seconds ; the inspection done , he put the key in the lock
when she entered this hovel , she filled it with paradise
well , then , jean valjean continued , keep the money for your mother
can you make head or tail of it ?
she glanced at it
and , anyway , where would he go ?
the pampas of south america would appeal to me , if i didn ’ t have the arcades of the odéon
from his window he could see the courtyard in front of the house and the street
he put the supporting evidence in his pocket
it had projections , corners , black holes , recesses where the roof dipped down , bays , and ridges jutting out
some say a trumpet blast was heard sounding the charge from the direction of the arsenal , others that a boy stabbed a dragoon with a dagger
after a pause , gavroche added : for the little ones i ’ ll use a ladder
she started to tidy the tables ; the husband paced up and down the room
daring deeds dazzle history and are guiding lights for mankind
on june number , number , his family took flight and hid in the woods
no one and everyone
enjolras shook his hand with a smile
and then , above all , marius felt inexpressibly revolted in thinking that it was monsieur gillenormand who , for entirely stupid reasons , had torn him mercilessly from the colonel , thereby depriving the father of the son and the son of the father
and so , he shut himself up in it , he lived in it , he was utterly happy there , leaving aside the prodigious questions that lure and terrify , the unfathomable perspectives of abstraction , the heady precipices of metaphysics , all these profundities that converge , for the apostle , on god , and , for the atheist , on nothingness : fate , good and evil , the war of being against being , man ’ s conscience , the pensive sleepwalking of animals , transformation by death , the summing up of existences in the grave , the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the enduring self , essence , substance , being and nothingness , the soul , nature , freedom , necessity—thorny problems that are sheer drops , murky depths , over which the colossal archangels of the human mind hover ; awesome abysses that the likes of lucretius , manu , saint-paul , and dantenumber contemplate with blazing eyes that , by staring hard at infinity , seem to cause stars to hatch there
bossuet shouted to the gunners
was anarchy now about to descend from on high ?
i want to stay
he cast a furtive glance at the door as though he feared it might open despite the bar that held it shut tight ; then with an abrupt and violent move , he grabbed in a single armful , without so much as a quick glance at them , these things he had so religiously and perilously hoarded for so many years , and took the lot , rags , stick , haversack , and threw them on the fire
he also made his way out of the garden , walking backward , obliged , to keep the dog ’ s respect , to resort to that manoeuvre with the stick that masters of this style of fencing call la rose couverte
say everything ’ s fine and i ’ ll be right down
still the little boy could not get to sleep : monsieur ?
i mean that man has a tyrant , ignorance
who was going to worry about that ?
we need to reform and transform
dada today is still for war
as his mouth was alluring , his lips the most rosy red and his teeth the whitest in the world , his smile made up for what was severe in his whole physiognomy
sixth : the detainees , known as barkers , that call the other detainees to the visitors ’ room , make the prisoner pay them two sous to call out their name clearly
he looked ahead as far as the eye could see and saw nothing
he would say with authority : the french revolution was a bunch of rotters
he was about halfway down the street , level with a very low wall that you could step over in certain places and that bordered a patch of wasteland , and he was walking along slowly , preoccupied as he was , the snow muffling his footfalls , when , all of a sudden , he heard voices talking quite close by
the man opened the wallet and pulled out , not a fistful of banknotes as thénardier had hoped , but a simple bit of paper , which he unfolded and presented , open , to the innkeeper , saying : you ’ re right
he was antinous , number wild
after all , a person has the right to rob a corpse he has made
this weakness had led him to make a foolish concession
it is its antechamber ; but , like rich people who display their greatest riches at the entrance to their palace , it seems that death , which is close at hand , puts its greatest miseries in this , its vestibule
he seized éponine by the arm
gavroche was stuck for a reply , so he stayed there , undecided and scratching his ear sadly
but i just can ’ t stop myself from congratulating you
you can talk to me , it doesn ’ t wear me out
but perpetual movement still remains the rule
we are describing the state of a mind on the move
to die of love is to live from it
nearly all the trees in the orchard were wildings ; he budded them and got them to yield excellent fruit
twice a year , on the first of january and on saint george ’ s feast day , marius wrote dutiful letters to his father that his aunt dictated and that you would have said were copied from some manual ; this was all monsieur gillenormand would tolerate ; and the father answered with overwhelmingly tender letters that the old man pocketed without reading
the old biddies gave up the ghost , saying : after all , he ’ s a sort of adventurer
even when loyson takes wing , you know his paws are firmly on the ground
it was as though something of the repose of the dead had entered into jean valjean ’ s tranquillity
he bought the watch for forty-five francs
he saw what he saw , and that was that
marius gave a shudder
fauchelevent wiped his forehead
but she declared that she was the first to detest them , and then again , she had reached her ferociously devout phase
aren ’ t there any more seats ?
it was roughly eighteen feet high
it seemed that it was a disembodied evocation speaking to you from across the barrier of the grave
it ’ s like a small republic
it is the day of destiny
try to imagine this forest of dark branches known as the sewer underneath that
for instance , since you ’ re a millionaire , i told you i demanded money , a lot of money , enormous amounts of money
nothing could have been more unexpected , more surprising , and , we have to say , more unpleasant
so , he said , that ’ s enough of that
in the morning , when he used to come into my room , i would growl at him , but for me it was like sunshine streaming in
i ’ m not attacking you , of course , my dear senator
the second is about the distribution of pleasure
she was to monsieur gillenormand what we saw monseigneur bienvenu ’ s sister was to him , always by his side
that ’ s all there is to it
you ’ ll find monsieur bossuet there
how can we fail to see here the catastrophic
the years end up giving a head a windswept look that is most distinguished
we have already pointed out this typical detail
i have my writer ’ s stall in the market in the rue de sèvres
there is nothing harder to drill through and penetrate than the geological formation that the marvellous historical formation known as paris sits on top of ; as soon as work , in any shape or form , begins and ventures into that nappe of alluvial sediment , subterranean resistance abounds in the form of liquid clays , springs , hard rock , the soft deep silt that the special science calls mustard
she seemed to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her
the man was evidently beyond the reach of horror or desperation
as we ’ ve already explained , with first love , you take the soul well before the body ; later on you take the body well before the soul , sometimes you don ’ t take the soul at all ; the faublases and the prudhommesnumber add : because there isn ’ t one ; but happily this bit of sarcasm is blasphemy
louis-philippe had been handsome and he remained graceful even in old age ; not always approved of by the nation , he was always approved of by the multitude ; he was pleasing
the french poet wanted to steal from the brightly shining stars the right light not only for illuminating the workers ' faces , but to consecrate the shared sojourn
you ’ re going to say that i could have tendered my resignation , but that is not enough
right you are , replied the father in a gentle tone that contrasted with the young girl ’ s abrasiveness
lordy , yes , rue plumet
when i think that my girls go barefoot and don ’ t have a dress between them !
the beggar raised his head and answered in a doleful voice : thank you , my good sir
on the first floor , hold your axes ready to cut off the staircase
he still had his yellow redingote , his black breeches , and his old hat
you can ’ t shock a people into going any faster than they want to go
but the grapes can ’ t have been ripe ?
what am i after now ?
the youngest of the three was to collect from a great-aunt a tidy sum of a hundred thousand livres in bonds ; the middle son was to step into his uncle ’ s title as duc ; and the eldest was to succeed to a peerage held by his grandfathernumber the bishop would listen in silence to this innocent and forgivable maternal showing off
yes , answered enjolras , but not as much as on the life of jean prouvaire
he stood with more than half his body showing above the top of the redoubt
certain magnificent and rowdy cortèges , notably the fat ox , number the special model of a prize ox , enjoyed the same privilege
the fathers ran after the exempt-gangs in desperation
how has a criminal act been committed against me by you ?
the night before , in the dark , the barricade had been approached as silently as if by a boa
the tenth year , his turn came again , he took advantage of it again
prioresses and mother superiors almost always bear names impregnated with a particular gravity , recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments in the life of jesus christ , like mother nativity , mother conception , mother presentation , mother passion
she handed it to her husband
his laugh was faint and chilling and gave marius goosebumps
let ’ s admit without bitterness that the individual has his own distinct self-interest , and can without committing a crime make that interest clear and defend it ; the present has its excusable dose of egotism ; the life of the moment has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself endlessly to the future
what the hell is that ?
a year went by , then another
why , with so much money in his purse , the miserable getup ?
in some places the wall was covered with gnarled funguses that looked for all the world like tumors ; the stone itself seemed sick in that unbreathable environment
it appeared that some bohemian , some barefoot gypsy , a dangerous beggar of a man was in town at that actual moment
when bossuet and courfeyrac turned round , half the street was already barricaded with a rampart taller than a man
youth is the season when bones are swiftly mended and wounds rapidly healed
and we will then see god
for her part , cosette sank into black despond
for this surprising ineptitude is not new ; it is no youthful idiocy
his daughter , marie-louise , married adrien-charles de gramont , son of the duc louis de gramont , a peer of france , colonel in the gardes françaises and lieutenant general in the army
ah , you have some communication to make to me
soon we will even be able to intervene with precision on energy levels and mechanical , mus- cular and neurological elements ' , one expert claims
the only wise creatures in all of creation are the turtledoves
it ’ s my beard that saved me !
and he signalled jean valjean to listen
how did you get here ?
they ’ re silver ; but for me , they are gold , they are diamond ; they change the candles you put in them into altar candles
while fantine had been slowly sinking deeper and deeper into destitution , her native town had prospered
ah , the little cur !
the bishop sent for him , gently chastised him , and appointed him verger of the cathedral
the rue saint-denis was as mute as the avenue of the sphinxes in thebesnumber there wasn ’ t a living soul at the junction , which was turning white in reflected sunlight
all they found in it was a piece of paper , folded
can it be true , then ?
on this bench , which was lit by several candles , there was a man between two gendarmes
was it really you who killed the gunner sergeant ?
the orchard was taken , though
bringing up the rear came an old man in the clothes of a labourer , limping
but , according to the etymology of the word , explaining can also mean letting the scene , or attitude or expression , unfold the fullness nestled in its simple presence
it was then that he noticed she was in tears
here i am , he said
they forced the burghers to lend a hand
and how could it occur to them , they who imagined that louis xvii reigned on the ninth of thermidornumber and that louis xviii reigned on the day marengo took place ?
it serves those who denounce it without complaining , even exonerating them , and its magnanimity lies in agreeing to desertion
to throw herself into that very death just as she would have thrown herself into any other , and drag marius in , too
you ’ re not talking , marius shot back , about that miserable petty theft of forty years ago , expiated , as appears from your very own newspapers , by a whole lifetime of repentance , self-denial , and good ?
you write it yourself
he was supposed to occupy courfeyrac ’ s chambers , which were decent and where a certain number of law books , bolstered and filled out by odd volumes of novels , made up the library required by the regulations
jean valjean took the risk of sticking his nose out to look round the corner into the street
you ’ ll get yourself robbed , ma bougon used to say
the prioress , usually dammed up by silence , and now having a surplus in her reservoir , stood and shouted with the loquacity of an opened sluice gate : on my right , i have benedict and on my left , bernard
his mind was elsewhere and where your mind is , your eyes follow
you would have said it was the tatters of a whole populace , rags made of wood , iron , bronze , stone that the faubourg saint-antoine had shovelled there at its doorstep with one colossal sweep of the broom , turning its misery into a barricade
what are you going to do ?
she could hardly lift the bucket
this is a profound and useful truth to know , one the stuarts did not have an inkling of in number and the bourbons did not have a clue about even in number
at the corner of the rue de bourdonnais there were no more lanterns
you need the useless for happiness
there were instantly several versions of the story , which had wound up being described as a case of child-snatching
now there ’ s a good book for you , said monsieur gillenormand
they had not been able to figure it out
you think this poor unfortunate convict has only a sou to his name ; not so , he has liberty
how do you work that out ?
not long after fauchelevent had finished nailing on the top plank , jean valjean felt himself being carted out , then rolling along
and so he came to the prefecture , followed by the seminary
the interior , calm again , is strange
wouldn ’ t that be something if i left my daughter without a stitch !
so just what was it ?
it was clear that whoever was in charge of this sordid procession had not bothered to sort them
long billowing curtains hung at the casement windows in great broken folds that were truly magnificent
'looking is not the same as experiencing ' , isabelle adjani reckons and she would know when it comes to looks
when he spoke , she listened , and when he took action , she was right behind him
the tradition of cars of masks—masked revellers—goes back as far as the earliest years of the monarchy
he could not help but give a start of surprise that did not escape jondrette
it is a matter of the twin mastery the camera prompts , the mastery of the operator and that of his subject ’
this figure probably includes all the other corpses that were thrown into the ravine the day after the fighting
listen , she said , you ’ re wrong
clearly he is not on the right track ; he stops to get his bearings
listen to me , friend
it was , indeed , him
as you like , father , said cosette
he was familiar with its tradition as though he had been a witness to it
now our two bedrooms , which used to be covered with old wallpaper whitewashed with lime , would not be out of place in a château as fine as your own
fantine had had a night of fever and insomnia—full of happy images , though ; in the morning , she fell asleep
trophonius ’ s vat holds nothing not found in mesmer ’ s tub ; ergaphilas is resurrected in cagliostro ; the brahmin vasaphanta is incarnated in the comte de saint-germain ; saint-médard cemetery supplies miracles every bit as good as those of the umumiya mosque of damascus
chance would have it that the heads of their beds leaned against the chimney flue
cosette gave nothing away
next to the french doors , a great big table with an inkstand , piled high with papers all in a heap and enormous tomes
the first , feeling himself to be the weaker , avoided the second , but he avoided him in a profoundly furious fashion ; anyone observing him closely would have seen his eyes shining with the glum hostility of a man in flight and with all the menace there is in fear
the moon shone right on jean valjean ’ s wildly frightened face
i thought it was just a fling , but it looks like it ’ s real passion
but if all the taunting passivity of the peasant is packed into that expression , all the freethinking anarchy of the cheeky suburban nipper is packed , indubitably , into this other

faced with the interviewer who wants to hear the old men and women reminiscing about the days of the soviet union , an old peasant woman digs her heels in and keeps repeating something no one is asking her to say , a thing she never stops saying without ever getting a reply , the only thing she 's interested in : having her own little corner with a window
he jammed his hat down resolutely and left
among other things , this same passerby said :
she had never heard the word uttered in its earthly sense
now , war , civilized war , sums up and exhausts all forms of banditry , from the armed robbery of the catalan bands in the gorges of mount jaxa to the marauding of the comanche indians in doubtful pass

the sun looks like a pauper
éponine and azelma had spent hours contemplating it and cosette herself , furtively it is true , had dared to cast a glance at it
everyone knows voltaire ’ s name and no one knows the name of caesar de bus
the mystical school of joseph de maistre , number which , at the time , spiced up what were known as the ultra—ultra-royalist—newspapersnumber with highfalutin cosmogony , would not have failed to claim javert as a symbol
gavroche went on , adding with dignity : there are three of us

it ’ s the good lord who ’ s guided me to your inn
old man thénardier was one of those men who judge a situation at a glance
after all , if anyone has come to grief , it ’ s not my fault
does anyone , cried feuilly bitterly , understand these men—and he rattled off names , well-known names , even famous names , some from the old armynumber—who promised to come and join us , who swore they would help us , and who were bound to do so in all honour , these men who were to have been our generals and who have deserted us !
this was fauchelevent , jean valjean , and cosette
as for the strong emotion he experienced shortly after being back under the turf roof of his road-mender ’ s hut again , this was it :
the fireplace and the table with the two chairs sat exactly facing marius
mabeuf , the churchwarden , whom he went to see again , had given him an account of life in vernon , the colonel ’ s retirement , his flowers , his loneliness
cosette has placed a big old bergère covered in utrecht velvet by your bed and she said to it : open your arms to him
monseigneur bienvenu had what is commonly known as a handsome head , but he was so sweet that you forgot he was handsome
for science made government , for the force of things become the sole public force , for the law of nature having its own sanctions and penalties within itself and being promulgated by evidence , for a dawning of truth that corresponds to the dawning of day
around number , he invariably spent two afternoons a week in a house in his neighbourhood , rue férou , at madame la baronne de t—— , number a worthy and respectable eminence whose husband had been ambassador of france in berlin under louis xvi
he ’ s as white as a plucked chicken
marius sat down and gestured for him to sit
it ’ s her mother that entrusted her to me , i can only hand her over to her mother
now , we will say in all conscience , louis-philippe being in good faith in his tenure , and democracy being in good faith in its assault , the degree of horror that attaches to the social struggles can not be charged either to the king or to the democracy
i was wondering when you ’ d get to it
surely this small enclosure , with the sky as a ceiling , was enough to enable him to worship god by regarding his loveliest works and his most sublime works , one by one ?
a thief , since he robbed a rich manufacturer , monsieur madeleine , whose ruin he caused
monsieur leblanc said nothing
its metaphors are sometimes so shameless you can feel they have been in shackles
and what did it mean ?
the result was the whiteness we mentioned , a whiteness that bathed even her lips and eyes in its radiance
this was more than monsieur gillenormand could bear to hear
and now , at the very moment he was about to deliver a brigand , in the middle of perpetrating a crime , to the legal authorities , destiny screamed at him : but it ’ s thénardier !
marius reached the church , but did not go in ; instead he turned and went behind the chevet
i do : i ’ m thrilled !
the old man addressed did not stir
jean valjean ’ s wound had been a diversion
the poor mother hung her head
the same artery was throbbing everywhere
he watched in alarm as the kind of frightening calm that the injustice of his rotten fate had produced melted away inside him
on top of the national guard
vvhat can you say about the 'talkies ' and about the sound-track that pu ts the finishing touches on the effect of mastery of th , e image track , except that they are a lot more harmful than people realize ?
then he pushed the dead body away with his foot and said : throw that outside
he was so bedazzled that everything else had been wiped from his brain
he would have died at thermopylae with leonidas and would have burned drogheda with cromwellnumber
or you ’ ll have to deal with cosette
it was a white paper envelope
you are so beautiful !
sometimes , while getting the little girl to spell , he remembered that it was with the idea of doing wrong in mind that he had learned to read in jail
is what we see a country without a history , men without a fate or unequal to their fate ?
and then the illness got worse and a nurse was needed
the hand that had gripped him from behind just as he was about to fall and which he had felt as he lost consciousness was jean valjean ’ s
the post book has it down as five and a quarter leagues
you ’ ll be staying with us at least this week ?
it made you think of a hungry predator following its prey , but trying to look as though it wasn ’ t

to have cosette , to possess cosette , was no different for him from breathing
gibelotte recognized joly and laigle and plunked a bottle of wine on the table
this voice was not entirely unfamiliar to him
marius was there from now on to carry out the job of providence by cosette ’ s side
as for that , said toussaint , it ’ s the honest truth
anyone passing through the small town of vernonnumber in those days and taking a stroll over the beautiful monumental bridge that will soon be replaced , let ’ s hope , by some hideous wrought-iron affair , would have been able to see , if they looked down from the parapet , a man of about fifty wearing a leather cap and dressed in trousers and a jacket of coarse grey woolen cloth , to which something yellow was sewn which had once been a red ribbon , shod in clogs , weathered by the sun , his face almost black and his hair almost white , with a large scar across his forehead that ran on down his cheek , bent , buckled , old before his time , strolling around virtually all day , with a spade or a billhook in hand , inside one of those walled plots of land right next to the bridge that line the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces—lovely enclosures full of flowers that you would describe as gardens if they were a lot bigger , and , if they were a lot smaller , as bouquets
a few constellations here and there in the pale , deep sky , the earth all black , the sky all white , a shiver rippling through the blades of grass , everywhere the mysterious rush and sudden chill of dawn light
when he was nabbed again , the new severities inflicted on him only served to make him wilder
you said to yourself : damn it !
woe to anyone who happened to be within arm ’ s reach then !
but he never went to these parties or balls except on days when it was cold and dry enough to split stone , for he could not afford a cab and he did not want to turn up unless his boots were polished to a mirror finish by the frost

they have two mothers , both stepmothers : ignorance and misery
it ’ s because they have a nest that they are able to sing
she let her head fall on marius ’ s knees and her eyelids closed
marius took no notice of these symptoms
what about you , monsieur le vétéran , you must have been wounded quite a bit ?
napoléon came into his own as the ogre of corsica there ; later on , the entry into history of monsieur le marquis buonaparté , lieutenant general of the king ’ s armies , was a concession to the spirit of the age
as we never get tired of repeating , think , first and foremost , of the disinherited and hurting hordes , relieve them , give them air , give them light , love them , broaden their horizon magnificently , lavish all kinds of education on them , set them the example of toil , never the example of idleness , lighten the weight of the individual burden by giving more weight to the notion of the universal goal , limit poverty without limiting wealth , create vast fields of activity , public and popular , be like briareus and have a hundred hands that can reach out on all sides to the downtrodden and the weak , put collective power to work at that great duty , which is to open workshops to all hands , schools to all aptitudes , and laboratories to all forms of intelligence , increase wages , decrease the struggle , balance debits and credits , that is , match pleasure to effort and gratification to need—in a word , make the social apparatus release more light and more comfort , for the benefit of the suffering and the ignorant

she placed her hand on the door handle
this question , straightforward for cosette , was profoundly complex for jean valjean

of all the children with fathers and mothers , he was one of those who most deserve pity , for they are actually orphans
jean valjean had continued on his course once more and did not stop again
he replaced jean valjean who , because he still had his arm in that sling , could not give the bride his hand

a story , une histoire , is an arrangement of actions according to which there has not simply been this and then that , but a configuration that fits the facts together and allows them to be presented as a whole : what aristotle calls a muthos – a storyline , or plot , in the sense in which we speak of the plot of a play
it might well have prevented the marriage

these cars , or , to be more precise , these cartloads of masks , are only too familiar to parisians
you could hear the clatter of the swords in the carrousel of all those amazing soldiers of the mighty republic and the mighty empire ; there was a glut of heroes tripping over themselves at napoléon ’ s door—men from the rhine , from the scheldt , the adige , and the nile ; companions of joubert , desaix , marceau , hoche , kléber ; balloonists from fleurus , grenadiers from mayence , pontoniers from genoa , hussars that the pyramids had gazed upon , artillerymen junot ’ s cannonballs had spattered , cuirassiers who had stormed the battle fleet at anchor in the zuyder zee ; some had followed bonaparte over the bridge at lodi , others had been with murat in the trenches of mantua , still others had gone before lannes in the sunken road of montebello

they tied one end of the rope brujon had woven in his dungeon to the stumps of the chimney bars they had just twisted off , threw the other end over the encircling wall , leaped over the chasm in a single bound , hung on tight to the top of the wall , clambered over it , let themselves slide , one at a time , down the rope onto a little roof that abutted the bathhouse , pulled in their rope , jumped down into the bathhouse courtyard , crossed it , pushed open the porter ’ s transom , next to which hung his cord , pulled the cord , opened the porte cochère , and found themselves in the street
now , he had just looked down into a vipers ’ hole ; it was a nest of monsters and it was right under his nose
why not take advantage of the fact that you ’ re rich ?
with guns like this one , all you have to do is exceed the ratio of ten parts tin to a hundred copper , even by a fraction , and they are liable to burst
was it partly their own fault ?
monsieur le président , the presiding judge , snuck in this back way so that even those who might have spied on him and followed him and observed that every day monsieur le président went off somewhere mysteriously , could not have suspected that going off to the rue de babylone actually meant going off to the rue blomet
on the right , as you enter by the dining room
she slowly backed away , for she felt herself drawn
but this lasted only a moment
those two little creatures were so obviously happy !
the church struck a quarter past three
as for the little girl , i need to talk that over a bit with monsieur
did anyone see him come out ?
this is how the dialogue went :
monsieur madeleine ended up becoming aware of this , but it seemed beneath his notice
eight feet above the floor , a massive beam went from one end of this underground passage to the other ; from this beam , at regular intervals , hung chains three feet long , and on the end of these chains were collar shackles
until now all that had been hanging over him had been , in his eyes , a clean , simple , limpid surface ; nothing unknown or obscure there ; nothing that wasn ’ t defined , coordinated , linked , precise , exact , circumscribed , limited , closed ; completely foreseen
i miss the bride ’ s garter
le dab est sinve , la dabuge est merloussière , la fée est bative , the old man ’ s thick , the old lady ’ s slippery , the sprite ’ s easy on the eye—the bourgeois gentleman is stupid , his lady wife is cunning , the daughter is pretty
add to that little boots with little iron caps on the heels , a narrow-brimmed top hat , hair worn in a tuft , an enormous cane , and conversation spiced with the puns of potier
the place was completely isolated
then he strode twice , slowly and in silence , from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace , crossing the whole length of the room , causing the parquet to creak , like a stone statue on the move
he was six feet tall , had pectorals of marble , biceps of bronze , cavernous lungs , the torso of a colossus , and the skull of a bird
the bigwigs , the nobs , are at the top , along the pathway where the acacias are , where it ’ s paved
then he raised his voice : citizens !
a hand emerged from below the pall , dangling toward the floor
it was merely a coincidence , perhaps , no doubt , of course , but a threatening coincidence
a piece of the north gate , broken by the french , hangs where it has been fixed to the wall
he headed for the faubourg saint-marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find the prefect of police
get in here this minute !
but this is where , and we insist on this , this is where life is , the throbbing , the shuddering of humanity
it goes without saying that permission was never granted to men
the iron soldier is worth every bit as much as the iron duke
on the mantelpeice , under a glass jar , sat a woman ’ s headdress worked with silver thread and orange blossomnumber
i ’ ll be here at six o ’ clock , and i ’ ll bring you the sixty francs
i did , said madeleine
through cracks in the planks he glimpsed the mounds of rubble and roughly cemented stones that passersby could still see there ten years ago
the innkeeper started following him again
thénardier did perhaps know something
you can take off with four l ’ s , jean prouvaire told him
naturally , he did not see the girl he was looking for
he picked up the flag which had fallen right at his feet
with nihilism no discussion is possible
put your shawl on
apart from the visible signs we ’ ve mentioned , the prosperity father madeleine had created in montreuil-sur-mer had another symptom that , though not visible , was no less significant
jean valjean froze , aghast
he did not look for him , he saw him at once
he pulled the curtains back a little and by the light of the rushlight he saw fantine ’ s great calm eyes watching him
it happens because it has to happen
i think that would be best , replied marius coldly
he had thought of nothing else from the moment the conversation began , but for some reason hadn ’ t dared bring the subject up
he was happy , joyful , thrilled , charming , young
the nipper had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus
is there anything you need ?
marius , still fighting , was so peppered with wounds , particularly to the head , that his face was lost in blood and looked for all the world as though it was covered in a red handkerchief
at nightfall they used to light lamps placed on posts at regular intervals and these lamps were lifted and lowered by means of a rope that ran from one end of the street to the other and that fitted inside the groove of the lamppost
they seemed almost to have gone out and then , at times , they lit up again and shone like stars
don ’ t i also owe something to this woman by way of reparation for the harm i ’ ve done her ?
it was only perfectly natural that marius admire her , adoring her as he did
if i take myself off , everything will die
don ’ t hold it against us
it was the sole debt that the colonel had left to him and marius considered it a point of honour that he should pay it
the cartridges of the men besieged were running out ; not so , their acid wit
fauchelevent had reached the point where you no longer have a clue what you are saying
he was in the habit of disappearing like this
don ’ t be too long , murmured fantine
he said : do you love me ?
what the meaning of this is , is that you dropped your pass out of your pocket and i found it on the ground after you ’ d gone
on his rounds , he was giving and gentle and he didn ’ t preach so much as chat
the object of resentment , nietzsche tells us , is time itself , the es war : this was
you couldn ’ t imagine anything simpler than the bishop ’ s bedroom
it was only a good fifteen minutes later that he saw that the young man had , indeed , tagged along behind
she needs expensive drugs
at the foot of this tree , there was a burning fire where three hares were roasting a hunter on a spit and in the background , over another fire , a smoking pot from which the head of a dog poked out
he was a bit gouty and when he slept his old fingers , stiff with rheumatism , clutched at the sheets
two servants , called matelotte , fish stew , and gibelotte , rabbit stew , whose real names no one ever knew , helped ma hucheloup deck the tables with the carafes of dark rotgut wine and the various gruels that were served to the hungry in earthenware bowls
meanwhile , none of the men seemed to see gavroche , who , while this confabulation was taking place , had gone and sat on one of the fence posts ; he waited a few moments , maybe for his father to look his way , then he put his shoes back on and said : is that it ?
i saw the door of a house open and i went in
was it because of fantine ?
why are you whispering ?
was jean valjean , in fact , a chrysalis who would dig his heels in and would go on coming over to visit his butterfly ?
all these thoughts swirled around in his brain
the chaplains spoke highly of his religious habits
in the first place , and this was his main worry , javert had not taken the prisoner , prisoner
who was this jean valjean who had seen to cosette ’ s education ?
traitors crawled out of the woodwork ; men who had gone over to the enemy the day before a battle did not bother hiding a sou of what they ’ d earned in bribes and strutted about shamelessly in broad daylight full of the cynicism wealth and honours bring ; the deserters of ligny and quatre-bras , number in their unchecked and financially rewarded depravity , paraded their monarchical devotion brazenly , for all to see—forgetting what is written on lavatory walls in england : please adjust your dress before leaving
champmathieu won ’ t have it
the cuirassiers left the cavalry to return to the infantry or , more accurately , all this formidable throng wrestled with each other without letting go their hold
at a dull thump , he guessed they were crossing the pont d ’ austerlitz
charitable old bastard , aren ’ t you ?
it was a circular arch , not as high as the vault , which got smaller by degrees , and not as wide as the gallery , which got narrower at the same time that the vault got lower
besides , gavroche had no idea that on that horrible rainy night when he had offered two little mites the hospitality of his elephant , it was for his own brothers that he had played the part of providence
this is without counting the innumerable barricades that went up in twenty other quartiers of paris , in the marais , on the montagne sainte-geneviève ; one , in the rue ménilmontant , even sported a porte cochère that had been torn off its hinges ; another close to the little bridge of the hôtel dieu was made with the coach known as an écossaise , unhitched and upended , only three hundred feet from the prefecture of policenumber
i can ’ t remember who it was who recently found that tacitus , too , was a ranter , that nero was a victim , and that one really had to feel sorry for that poor holofernesnumber
oh , i ’ m so happy !
he doubtless knew that javert was held prisoner there
since morning , he had smiled in all his impenetrability
what is a mere feather for others will be a rock for you
we should say further that , on their side , marius and cosette had been away
no other city has enjoyed the kind of domination that sometimes scoffs at those it subjugates
and that is because—i suspected as much a long time ago—you ’ re hiding something and you want to keep it hidden
marius found it hard to believe that the fauchelevent of the barricade was the same as this fauchelevent of flesh and blood , so gravely seated by cosette ’ s side
suddenly everything became clear , and he admitted this : that his place in the galleys was empty , that no matter what he did , it was still waiting for him , that robbing petit-gervais led him straight back there , that the empty place was waiting for him and would pull at him until he was back in it , that this was inevitable and fatal
you ’ re carrying a child there who can walk
it would give montparnasse a good laugh
he did not know arras , the streets were dingy , and he wandered around aimlessly
yet , should the sheep ’ s mange cause the shepherd to recoil ?
the barricade , now walled in on three streets , in front on the rue de la chanvrerie , to the left on the rue du cygne and the rue de la petite-truanderie , to the right on the rue mondétour , really was now almost impregnable ; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in
we told them at home that we ’ d taken the letters to the people and they told us , nothing doing !
the old woman beetled off , the old man remained alone
you felt disconcerted the first time you set eyes on these two forests flanking those two cavernous holes
what a mournful instant it is when society withdraws and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being !
thanks to their offshoots and to the underlying network of their contacts , babet , gueulemer , claquesous , and montparnasse ran the general ambush business of the entire département of the seinenumber they performed the coups d ’ état of the underworld on unsuspecting passersby
outside that sacred thing , justice , by what right does one form of war scorn another ?
a cry went up : it ’ s the voter !
the kid went over to this pensive character and began circling around him on tiptoe the way you walk when you ’ re frightened of waking someone up
fauchelevent was giving the unexpected gribier the once-over again
these cobblestones leave riot only their mud
what a fatal coincidence !
once more the interior of the jondrette rathole came into view
he thought it was better not to attract the father ’ s attention
there was in her veins the blood of the bohemian and the adventurer who goes about barefoot
if you bend over , your eye becomes lost in a deep brick cylinder filled with a densely layered darkness
handling iron when there ’ s ice on the pavement—that ’ s tough
he took one of his old shirts out of a wardrobe and tore it up
she put the bucket on the ground , stuck her hand in her hair and began to slowly scratch her head , a gesture peculiar to children who are terrified and undecided
do you know , monsieur ?
the lark was the name that , in the depths of marius ’ s melancholy , had replaced ursula
he was overcome , he would have liked to be stunningly handsome , he would have liked to be wearing the cross of the légion d ’ honneur
i hope , for the sake of the tale ’ s clarity , we may be allowed to resort to a simple device already used on waterloo
he came across several doors but they were closed
her heart said nothing
o relentless march of human society !
now , that ’ s what i call a leap !
my very dear friend , monsieur montparnasse , said éponine , please , you ’ re a good boy , don ’ t go in !
god , who is always within man , and resistant , he the true conscience , to the false , stopping the spark from going out , ordering the sunbeam to remember the sun , enjoining the soul to recognize the true absolute when faced with the fictitious absolute ; indestructible humanity , the inadmissible human heart , that splendid phenomenon , the most beautiful perhaps of our inner wonders , did javert understand it ?
suddenly his dull eyes blazed with a hideous fire , the little man straightened up and became terrifying ; he took a step toward monsieur leblanc and bellowed at him in a thundering voice : but never mind all that !
the father was laughing , the toddler was laughing , the mother was smiling
both cosette and marius , speechless with anguish , not knowing what to say to death , desperate and trembling , stood before him , cosette giving marius her hand
he saw mabeuf fall again , he heard gavroche sing under the grapeshot , he felt the coldness of éponine ’ s forehead against his lips ; enjolras , courfeyrac , jean prouvaire , combeferre , bossuet , grantaire , all his friends rose before him , then evaporated
they had swapped as many secrets as they could but that did not get them much further than their names
they eat that up
should a person make it to some other exit , he would find it blocked off by some other plug or grate
it was a serene benevolence , flowing over all people , as we have seen , and sometimes extending even to things
i ’ ll come and get you there
one night , he was alone in his little room under the eaves
you see , monsieur pontmercy , i ’ ve been through a bit in life
not on your life
and he continued to advance toward her
two names anticipated by la fontainenumber the opportunity was too good for the legal fraternity attached to the law courts not to have a good laugh about it , and a parody immediately made the rounds of the galleries of the palais de justice , in somewhat lame verse :
the insurgents , all geared up for the imminent attack , had their backs turned
the former ss camp warden himself recalls the work song the inmates were made to sing in treblinka
aunt gillenormand gave up all attempts and arrived at this profound diagnosis : my father never loved my sister much after her silly mistake
the prioress ’ s face , till then worried and dark , became once more serene
we ’ ve got so many outlays
yet the one with the key parlayed , solely to gain time
young girls who have no bread—that ’ s a terrible thing
if only i make it to the barricade in time !
waving away the brigands who still had their hands on monsieur leblanc , he said : back off a bit and let me have a chat with the gentleman
he was still in the same position , his chest doubled over the table , his head lying flat on his arms , surrounded by glasses , tankards , and bottles
on the part of the egoists , prejudice , the glumness of a rich education , a growing appetite based on intoxication , the giddiness of a prosperity that deadens , a fear of suffering that , in some people , reaches the point of aversion for those who suffer , an implacable self-satisfaction , the ego so inflated that it blocks out the soul ; on the part of the miserable , covetousness , envy , hate at seeing others having fun , the deep pull of the human animal toward personal gratification , hearts filled with fog , sadness , want , fatalism , ignorance impure and simple
just as soon as he could
well , it ’ s time for revenge
he started to stammer like a madman : true ?
the art of the motor - cinematographic , video- computer graphic - has finally torpedoed the lack of motorization of the 'primary arts '
this bestowing of speech upon images , upon the whirling rush offilm , meant unwittingly triggering a phenomenon of panic in which the audio-visual would gradually lead to this silence of the lambs whereby the art lover becomes the victim of sound , a hostage of the sonorization of the visible
and then , human society had only ever done him harm
favourite was the result
what a star you are , o youth !
a little old priest like me , getting along mumbling poppycock ?
did you oil the door hinges so they won ’ t make a noise ?
he ate up a fairly large allowance , something like three thousand francs , doing nothing
all the same , said jondrette , no harm going round to check
and then , without moving a muscle , without shifting her head , she looked all around her with her eyes wide open and an air of joy and she said nothing more
to say the clever is the same as saying the mediocre
he had the same unflappable preoccupied look
the very instant he found himself untied , while javert was busy making out his report , he had taken advantage of the confusion , the clamour , the crowd , the darkness , and of a moment when attention was not fixed on him , to leap out the window
a convict was his benefactor !
he gave the old chief tenant three francs a month to come and sweep out the rathole and bring him , every morning , a small supply of hot water , a fresh egg , and a little bread roll worth one sou
you hear the bell
that was the last time
some little time later it happened that the seine-et-oisenumber prefecture sent the prefecture of police in paris a notice about the kidnapping of a child , which had taken place , they said , in peculiar circumstances , in the commune of montfermeil
he only had three shirts , one on his back , one in his chest of drawers , and the third at the laundry
indeed , what was the good of having a nice face and a delectable outfit if you don ’ t show them off ?
both of them , one in number , the other in number , made sizeable donations to mother catherine de bar , a benedictine nun called of the blessed sacrament , to found a convent of the order of saint benedict with this pious aim ; number initial permission was granted mother catherine de bar by monsieur de metz , abbé of saint-germain , with the stipulation that no maiden can be admitted unless she brings three hundred livres in board which equals six thousand livres in principal
four gossips were jabbering away on a doorstop
of a private conversation between four men squatting in a ditch at the barrière du trône roundabout , all that could be gleaned was this :
the squares were still holding
i am not the lord mayor ,
this coincided with a black cloud that promptly hid the sun
the secondhand dealer she owed money to for her furniture—some furniture ! —had said to her : if you try to sneak off , i ’ ll have you arrested as a thief
they were everywhere—except beneath the throne
enjolras , we know , had something of the spartan and the puritan
there you go , he said
love is life—except when it is death
came to see me yesterday in a brocade coat
who was it that was fleeing so desperately ?
all he knew about these two characters was that they had been appointed by the king , number one to his bishopric , the other to his living , on the same day , which happened to be april number , number when madame magloire took down the paintings to shake the dust off , the bishop had found this detail written in faded ink on a little square of paper yellow with age , stuck behind the portrait of the abbé of grand-champ with four sealing wafers
is monsieur in a hurry ?
in fact , today , i ’ m just reminded by the weather , louis-philippe could use his royalty at both ends , extend the sceptre end against the people and open up the umbrella end against the skies
never had such a vise had him in its grip
jean valjean ’ s repeated and dogged attempts to escape are enough to prove how strangely the law worked on the human soul
and the proof of that , señoras , is this : give me the wine cask and i ’ ll give you the people
she did not go out alone and toussaint , surprised by such an errand , would most certainly have shown the letter to monsieur fauchelevent
you could have kept the secret to yourself
this idea of napoléon ’ s , scorned by men , had been taken up by god
these morning trips were arranged the night before
he doesn ’ t eat every day but he goes to a show every night , if he feels like it
courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable local of the quartier latin ; he had gone to live in the rue de la verrerie for political reasons
everybody else goes downstairs ; you , you ’ ll rip up your bedsheets , you ’ ll tie them together , strip by strip , and make a rope , then you ’ ll go out your window and you ’ ll hang there by this thread over an abyss , and it will be at night , in a storm , in the rain , in a hurricane , and if the rope is too short , you ’ ll only have one way left to get down and that will mean dropping
the tenants of that house have latchkeys to get in with at night
he ’ s at the age when you become girl-crazy !
the whole room was bathed in that mist peculiar to dimly lit places that adds to their horror
under the chemise you could make out mud-caked trousers and boots with his toes sticking out
now they ’ re killing the dead on me
on this sheet of paper he read this line written in capital letters that very morning by the elder of the thénardier girls : the cops are here
let 's hear it from those trying to denounce this drift of genetic expressionism , from the inside :
javert pulled the door open , entered with fantine in tow , and shut the door behind him , to the great disappointment of the gawking horde who stood on tiptoe , craning their necks at the grimy guardroom window in an effort to get an eyeful
his face was the colour of his trousers
he did not succeed
all the works of modern social philosophy must converge toward that end
they get up to all kinds of mad antics
the number made louis-philippe king
fauchelevent had been ready for anything , except that , that a gravedigger could die
he thought he was putting marius on the right track and that the boy was about to give in
the crowd gathered there , at the side of the road , is addressed by an officer with an imperious gesture : when the tsar passes , the thing to do is to remove your hat
we know the rest : the irruption of a third army , the disintegration of the battle , eighty-six fire-breathing maws suddenly thundering ; pirch the first surging forward with bülow , zieten ’ s cavalry led by blücher in person , the french driven back , marcognet swept off the ohain plateau , durutte dislodged from papelotte , donzelot and quiot beating a retreat , lobau sideswiped ; a new battle gearing up as night fell over the dismantled regiments , the whole english line taking the offensive once again and driven forward , the gigantic hole made in the french army , the hail of english bullets and the hail of prussian bullets lending each other support ; the extermination , disaster along the front , disaster along the flank , the guard falling into line under this horrifying collapse
indeed , what more could you want ?
the multitudes regarded these beds of putrefaction with an almost religious fear as monstrous cradles of death
in the billiard room , ma hucheloup , matelotte , and gibelotte , variously changed by terror , one stupefied , one breathless , the third now actually awake , were tearing up old dishcloths and making lint ; three insurgents were helping them , three great strapping lads with long hair , beards , and moustaches , who were going through the cloth with the nimble fingers of laundry supervisors and throwing them into a flutter
and then you ’ ll spend years in a dungeon , bolted to a wall , groping for a drink from your pitcher , gnawing on a horrible loaf of blackness even dogs wouldn ’ t touch , eating beans the worms would have got to before you
i ’ m going to dim the candelabra
this only happens among men
what a thing it is to swallow an oyster or a revolution the wrong way !
madame thénardier was just smart enough to read that kind of book
the doctor was startled
in daylight , you would have recognized that it was just an ordinary miner ’ s spike
enjolras went on : who here has the courage ?
the most important man in greece for fifty years was the grammarian philetas , number who was so tiny and thin that he was forced to put lead in his shoes so he didn ’ t blow away in the breeze
the gate did not budge
the soul that loves and that suffers has attained the sublime
he then went on to the italian front and was one of the thirty grenadiers to defend the col di tende with joubertnumber joubert was made adjutant general and pontmercy second lieutenant
a fearsome method , and one that , allied with genius , made this sombre athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for fifteen years
e nature of art , promoting instead its communication
each one taught only its own lesson , unchanging over time , and intended only for those whose vocation it was to leave behind a memory of their actions and accordingly draw an example from the memorable deeds of other men worthy of being remembered
teeth and claws dread the intangible
did you read what i put there , on that bench ?
tholomyès , put in blachevelle , behold mon calme
the child , with his brioche that he had mauled but not finished , looked stuffed
white clouds were scudding across the sky as gaily as if they had just been released from captivity
a compliment is something like kissing through a veil
the man took three steps and went over to the lamp that was on the table
that is the thread by which he hung on to humanity
then he stamped for some little time on the ground in the space bounded by the tree and the stones , as though making sure the ground had not been freshly dug
the accused , for his part , listened to them with the stunned look that , according to the prosecution , was his principal defence
he said in a half whisper : splendid !
those two did not need to be told twice
do you recognize me a little ?
he always stuck his hands in his fob pockets
he addressed the public and asked in a tone that was understood by all : is there a doctor in the house ?
in this leaden place , there is darkness but there are no more secrets
monsieur leblanc and his daughter had just left their bench , the daughter had taken her father ’ s arm , and they were making their way together , slowly , to the middle of the walk , where marius was
the elder daughter was scraping the mud off the hem of her mantle , the younger sister went on sobbing ; the mother had taken the girl ’ s head in both hands and was covering it with kisses , whispering to her : now , now , my treasure , it ’ s nothing , don ’ t cry , you ’ ll make your father angry
the paths were lined with stiff little dark shrubs that shot straight up
so , misery , worry , a bit of bread here , a bit of heartache there , it all keeps me going
’ cause it ’ s so tender , it bends under the scythe
a few seconds later , the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything peculiar except that the tenderfoot was too young and looked like a real hick
l ’ aigle de meaux , as we know , lived rather more with joly than anywhere else
he had just seen , out there in the street , society , represented by a property owner and voter , number physically and verbally abused and vilified by a creature who was beyond the pale , an outcast
great blunders are often made , like great ropes , out of numerous strands
he wore blue trousers , a blue redingote , and a broad-brimmed hat , all of which looked new , a black tie , and a quaker shirt , meaning , dazzlingly white but made of coarse material
while we agree that it was not for some political role that god had created monseigneur bienvenu , we would have understood and admired him if he had protested in the name of right and liberty , if he had put up fierce opposition , perilous and just resistance to napoléon , when napoléon was all-powerful
he took up a lot of space in sixteen-year-old imaginations
thank you , monsieur , answered jean valjean softly
seventh : for a dropped thread , ten sous are held back from a prisoner in the weaving workshop ; this is an abuse on the part of the contractor , since the cloth is just as good
he was no longer pale , he was white
the name history ’ was given to the anthology of such great examples , worthy of being learned , represented , meditated upon , imitated
you ’ re driving me mad !
when anyone , soldier , officer , or representative of the people , ventured to cross the lonely roadway , which they did from time to time , a faint but sharp whistling would be heard and the person would fall , wounded or dead ; or , if he escaped , a bullet would be seen sinking into some closed shutter , into a gap between rubble stones , into the plaster of some wall
cosette had a minor setback
then these others : conde de rio maïor
pretot , who was also to die in the struggle , seconded mavot and to the question , what is your goal ?
what sort of man was he ?
now , for an unhappy man in his position , the convent was at once the most dangerous and the safest place to be ; the most dangerous , because no man could get into it , so if he were discovered there , it would be in flagrante delicto , and being caught in the act for jean valjean meant just a skip and a jump from the convent to the clink ; the safest , because if he managed to get himself accepted and to stay , who would think of looking for him there ?
monsieur leblanc had hardly uttered more than a few words , and that without raising his voice ; even in his struggle with the six brigands by the window , he had kept profoundly , and strangely , silent
it was no longer merely terror that took hold of her but something even more terrible than terror
he went on , answering the first question she had asked him as though he had just heard it : i was praying to the martyr up above
and , going over to enjolras , he whispered in his ear : don ’ t worry
thénardier , in shoving jean valjean outside in his stead , gave the police a bit of bait , threw them off his own scent , got himself overlooked in a much bigger haul , rewarded javert for waiting , which always placates a police spy , earned himself thirty francs , and found a means , one he was certainly counting on , of bolting with the aid of this diversion
a doll makes its entrance
he recognized the voice of the old woman , his concierge
grantaire admired , loved , and venerated enjolras
she looked like a virgin on her way to becoming a goddess
for some moments , jondrette had been studying the philanthropist in a bizarre way
we are leaving , we have left
their first convent was built new in the rue cassette with the funds provided by mesdames de boucs and de châteauvieux
who did this anarchic doubter rally to in this phalanx of absolutists ?
well , well , so there ’ s going to be another revolution , is there ?
and with that , she smiled
was there any proof ?
as for the convent , its gratitude to fauchelevent was great
in any case , he was going on a short trip
to blow that man ’ s brains out myself
when madeleine had popped up in the area , fauchelevent , a former scrivener and peasant who was almost literate , had a business that was going bad
almost at the same moment as the boys , another pair approached the great pond
i ’ m just passing through
in the process it turns ugly
that old face had none of those unfortunate wrinkles at the top of the forehead that signify meanness or stupidity
he was a prudent man
but no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet
you have to resign yourself to it
the eight of clubs , for instance , was a big tree bearing eight enormous clover leaves , a sort of fantastic personification of the forest
in paris , the identity that binds an individual to themselves snaps from one street to the next
in the end , come what may , the gravedigger is waiting , the panthéonnumber for some of us , but we all end up in that big hole in the ground
he gave his final instructions in the downstairs room in a voice that was clipped , but profoundly calm ; feuilly listened and answered on everyone ’ s behalf
and who is this man ?
he looked for some time at the english barricades on both roadways , two broad abatis of felled trees , the one on the genappe road above la haie-sainte equipped with two cannons , the only ones in the whole of the english artillery trained on the battlefield , and the one on the nivelles road where the dutch bayonets of chassé ’ s brigade glinted
wellington , oddly ungrateful , declares in a letter to lord bathurstnumber that his army , the army that did battle on june number , number , was a despicable army
he must have been really keen to see a soul carted off by the devil
it ’ s like a cellar
you can see for yourself , he ’ s a dashing young man , he is fearless , you can see he ’ s a thinker , these young artillerymen are extremely well educated ; he has a father , a mother , a family , he ’ s probably in love , he can ’ t be any more than twenty-five years old ; he could be your brother
but even there , he had lost love ’ s instincts and sudden illuminations
as you can see , he had a strange , idiosyncratic way of looking at things
in which case marius did not stay
he fitted the key into a lock , though the keyhole was barely visible , lost as it was in the darkest shades of the design of the wallpaper on the wall
passersby told him the man and the child he was looking for were heading off toward the woods near gagny
a manly voice was heard to cry out : long live france !
and every box passes through the worker ’ s hands thirteen times !
if such a hell were to exist , this stretch of the boulevard de l ’ hôpital could well serve as its approach
while the executioner was burning the great liberating books of the century on the steps of the palais de justice , writers now forgotten were bringing out , with the king ’ s seal of approval , all kinds of weirdly subversive writings avidly read by the dregsnumber a few of these publications , sponsored by a prince , amazingly , can be found in the bibliothèque secrète
for men of thénardier ’ s ilk , all dialogue is a battle
( i don ’ t understand how god , the father of men , can torture his children and his children ’ s children and hear them crying out without being tortured himself )
fauchelevent headed for the door
was napoléon ’ s obvious physical decline coupled with a certain inner diminution by that stage ?
but i am still a public letter-writer
society ’ s cannibals , the ugolinos , number are found in this abyss
gavroche lifted it with remarkable vigour and propped it against one of the elephant ’ s front legs
on the whole , we have to say , waterloo was more of a massacre than a battle
they spoke to him about it , one day , and just for a moment , there was a flash of lightning , like a window suddenly opening on the destiny of these creatures he had loved , then everything shut again ; he never heard another word about them again , not ever
how far did the cuirassiers get ?
would marius die there of a hemorrhage and himself of starvation ?
as you didn ’ t lie about your name , you won ’ t lie about your address
javert walked very slowly away
the stars had gone out ; heavy clouds filled the horizon all around with their melancholy billowing
this was the precaution a cunning man takes to keep his secret to himself in front of his accomplices
the bishop grabbed his stick , put his overcoat on to hide his cassock , which was getting too threadbare , as we ’ ve seen , and also because the evening breeze would not be long in rising , and left
the opportunity seemed to present itself
one old lady , a subscriber to the drapeau blanc , number made this unfathomably deep observation : i can ’ t say i ’ m sorry
its explosions , its bad days , its masterpieces , its wonders , its epics spread to the ends of the earth—and so do its cock-and-bull skits
he did not try to fold his chasuble in imitation of elijah ’ s mantle ; number he did not throw any ray of light from the future onto the shadowy unfolding of events ; he did not seek to condense the glimmer of things into a flame ; there was nothing of the prophet or the seer about him
this horde of men , dimly lit by a single candle , filled the lair with shadows
beneath the apparent contradiction lies something great and profound : the french revolution
this represented a sleeping woman and a sleeping child , the child on the woman ’ s knee , an eagle in a cloud with a crown in its beak , and the woman taking the crown off the child ’ s head , and without its waking up , too ; in the background , napoléon in a blaze of glory was leaning on a fat blue column with a yellow capital adorned with this inscription :
this letter , cropping up in the middle of the obscure episode that had been worrying marius since the night before , was a candle in a cave
and , lowering his carbine , he aimed at the gunner captain who , at that moment , was bent over the breech of the cannon , adjusting and finally setting the aim
he sought to counsel and to calm the desperate by pointing to those who were resigned , and to transform the grief that gazes on the freshly dug grave by showing it the grief that gazes up at a star
she brought her hands together with an expression that held all the violence and all the gentleness that prayer can hold
at six o ’ clock in the evening , he went down the rue saint-jacques to dine at rousseau ’ s , number opposite basset ’ s , the print dealer at the corner of the rue des mathurins
there ’ s going to be some strife
he is not perhaps entirely to blame
they danced a little , they laughed a lot ; it was a good-natured wedding
and he held out to her the envelope containing the four letters
where can it be coming from ?
the patrol set off again , leaving jean valjean behind them
actually , they ’ re all saints here
there is no robespierre who can hold out , woman rules
the comic , the serious , the unpredictable , blend in it with the variety of the characters and with a tinge of romantisism lightly spred all threw the plot which works misteriously and goes , by striking twists and terns , to come to a head amid several wunderful stage coups
messieurs , what ’ s the hurry ?
nothing will stop me
follow marius for a while
what ’ s up , i wonder ?
i ’ ll go and see my auntie
this suitcase used to intrigue cosette because of the smell of embalming that came from it
he must have had beautiful horses ?
in great and exalted natures , physical pain brings out the soul , through the revolt of the flesh and the senses against it
it ’ s every man for himself in times of peril
when we speak of convents , those seats of error , but also of innocence ; of befuddlement , but also of good intentions ; of ignorance , but also of devotion ; of torture , but also of martyrdom , you almost always have to say yes and no
but what is dark down there is light up here
women feel and speak with the loving instinct of the heart , that infallible organ
as for cosette ’ s education , it was almost finished and complete
he bounded over to this table , took a key from his pocket , and opened the suitcase
meanwhile , on the left bank , the municipal cavalry swung into motion and came to bar the bridge exit ; on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the célestins and deployed along the quai morland
the marly horses , number those whinnying chunks of marble , reared up in a golden cloud
all right , then , it ’ s the convent of petit-picpus !
that person thinks they ’ ll climb out again easily , and tells themself that it ’ s the same thing , after all
how easily , having attained that false aim of life , happiness , we forget the real aim , duty !
we can well imagine
we won ’ t insist , this is not the place
the young girl was there with monsieur leblanc
on the table there was also a pen , a lead inkwell , and spare paper for eventual police reports and the statements of the night patrols
and anyway , they were already stolen
and , after a pause , he went on : monsieur le maire , you were unjustly severe with me the other day
this service plautusnumber performed , whether he wanted to or not , by making two carthaginian soldiers speak phoenician ; this service molière performed by making so many of his characters speak levantinenumber and all sorts of dialects
it ’ s worth the trip
sire , the man with the petition went on , my grandfather was a whipper-in , a dog man , nicknamed lesgueules , muzzles
but there ’ s nothing for sale , nothing for hire , not for five hundred francs , and not for a thousand , neither
he took two five-franc pieces out of his bag and handed them to the priest
cosette got dressed pretty fast , combed and did her hair , which was a very simple business in those days when women did not puff up their curls and their coils with little cushions and tiny rolls or stick crinolines in their hair
monsieur madeleine said to the doctor : well ?
let them get themselves out of it
on penal questions , marius , though he remained a democrat , was still stuck on the side of the ruthless legal system and he had , about those whom the law strikes , all the ideas of the law
these two hearts poured themselves out to each other and into each other , so that at the end of an hour , the young man had the soul of the young girl and the young girl had the soul of the young man
the facts , however , are not so easily thrown off , and they persist
was he , lastly , really the man thénardier thought he recognized ?
the moment they were least expecting it , the captain launched his men against the barricade
though , if the bishop had one of his priests to dinner , madame magloire took advantage of the occasion to serve monseigneur some wonderful fish from the lake or some fine game from the mountains
enjolras held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms he had had put aside
madame , the baker was shut
so what you ’ re saying is , she went on sharply , you don ’ t know her , but you ’ d like to know her
what she felt at that moment was something like what she would have felt if someone had suddenly said to her : little girl , you are the queen of france
these doctrines , these theories , these forms of resistance , the unexpected necessity for the statesman to consult the philosopher , blurry half-glimpsed evidence , the need to create new policy in accord with the old world without causing too much discord with the revolutionary ideal , a situation in which lafayette had to be used to defend polignac , number the hint of progress transparent in the riot , in the chambers , and on the street , rivalries to balance all around him , his faith in the revolution , maybe some indefinable sense of resignation deriving from vague acceptance of a definitive and superior right , his desire to remain true to his race , his sense of family , his sincere respect for the people , his own honesty—all these preoccupied louis-philippe almost painfully at times , and as strong and courageous as he was , overwhelmed him with the difficulty of being king
they had crossed the river and left mont-saint-éloy behind them
instead of flowers among the branches and dew on the flowers , you could see the long silver ribbons of slugs on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves ; but in every case , whatever the aspect , whatever the season , spring , winter , summer , autumn , this little enclosure breathed melancholy , contemplation , solitude , freedom , the absence of man , the presence of god ; and the old rusty gate looked as if it were saying : this garden is mine
the only thing going for him was that he was a drunk
the prefecture knew less than the cabdriver
the thénardiers invariably wrote back : cosette is in perfect health
painting the inhuman ’ means setting out places and figures in a kind of history painting that declines to make any comment
at the police station of the place du châtelet
and his smile switched from the sun to the boy
it is beset by negation
he woke up , stammering : is it over , jondrette ?
france that finds himself on a voyage for his homeland and lack in funds
jean valjean sometimes said to her , smiling with happiness at being pestered : go home , for heaven ’ s sake !
he went on the prowl in the deserted no-man ’ s-land beyond la salpêtrière ; that is where the windfalls are ; where there is no one , you always find something
this destiny , the true one , begins for man at the first step inside the grave
give me twenty francs
it was her father
as for the cost of episcopal services , redemptions , dispensations , baptisms , sermons , consecrations of churches and chapels , marriages and so on , the bishop took from the rich all the more greedily for giving it all to the poor
the violent jolts of fate have this peculiar feature , which is that , however perfectly controlled or detached we may be , they drag human nature out of the depths of our entrails and force it to reappear on the surface
two old trees stand there ; one is dead , the other is wounded in the foot and grows young again every april
at the top of the stairs , he pulled another key from his pocket and opened another door with it
her bodice was never opaque enough , never climbed high enough
suddenly he stopped in his tracks
it also makes sense of the recent innovation not only of a counter culture , opposed to the culture of the bourgeoisie , but also of an art that is frankly counter-nature , peddling as it does a eugenics that has finally triumphed over all prejudice absolutely , in spite of the numberless horrors of the waning century
the english army was sleeping
cosette , who made it a rule to please her father and for whom , in any case , all spectacle was fresh and new , accepted the distraction blithely with the good grace of adolescence and did not pout too disdainfully at this joyful romp known as a fête ; so much so that jean valjean could tell himelf he ’ d carried it off , and that no trace of the hideous sight remained
who knows whether a sort of infernal glimmer might not remain on that angelic brow ?
he was , as you will recall , of that antique race of old men who await death perfectly erect , whom age burdens without buckling , and whom even sorrow does not bow
vincent de paulnumber has divinely portrayed the sister of charity in words that vividly paint the combination of a high degree of freedom with a high degree of humility : his sisters were to spend their time nursing the sick in their homes , having no monastery but the homes of the sick , no cell but a hired room , no chapel but the parish church , no cloister but the streets of the city or wards of the hospital , no fence but obedience , no gate but the fear of god , no veil but holy modesty
at midday , he would stop to eat and the midday meal was virtually the same as his breakfast
it had not been carted away
add to that , the police are less than useless [ a useful repetition ]
we ’ ll go to the forest or i ’ ll burst
what ’ s the latest on mum ?
any rogue could get the better of him and his servant scolded him
this is canonical enslavement in all its self-abnegation
what a shame i ’ m lame , we ’ d step up the pace , otherwise
it is enough that it is a potential convent for me to have to take it into account
and he took marius ’ s head and cradled it with both arms against his breast , and they both wept
a mere half an hour separated him from what was to come
and , words tossed out meandering along the way they do , a minute later , after a detour via jean prouvaire ’ s poetry , combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgicsnumber to one another , raux to cournand , cournand to delille , pointing out the few passages translated by malfilâtre , particularly the bit on the miracles and wonders surrounding the death of caesar ; and , at that word caesar , the conversation swung back to brutus
yet , completely in control of himself as he was , he could not escape a surge of inner turmoil
and yet , a new day was dawning and its soft light was settling over his life and over his soul
he always passed close by the bench where she sat simply because that was his habit
they have to stick to the straight and narrow
give it to me , the man went on
i ’ ve spent nineteen years in the clink
so wrote the great art dealer , rene gimpel , in his diary of
that particular day , cosette ’ s glance drove marius wild , marius ’ s glance made cosette tremble
she had had a very bad night
a formidable maw was now open on the barricade
in voting for the republic , that is what i voted for
monsieur fabantou , he said , i have only those five francs on me , but i ’ m going to take my daughter home and i ’ ll return this evening ; it ’ s this evening , isn ’ t it , that you have to pay ?
this is where the mystery of languages lies
cosette adored the old man
after the abbé of saint-germain , the king granted letters patent and the rest , the abbatial charter and royal license , was ratified in number in the chamber of accounts and in parliament
monsieur mabeuf was very close to eighty at the time
each dray or , better still , each ladder was harnessed to four horses in tandem
there ’ s a knack , crick , crack , in no time at all , you ’ re up and you ’ re on your own
these four men , four broad-shouldered porters , went and positioned themselves behind the table where the man from the rue des billettes was leaning , without doing anything that might attract his attention
for him , owing money was the beginning of slavery
tell-tale sign of a defect , a handicap , the loss of colour of the rising tide under the efiects of maritime pollution
he rushed downstairs and reached the boulevard just in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du petit-banquier to go back to paris
i ’ ve got eighty francs
he occupied an old and vast apartment on the first floor , between the street and the gardens , furnished right up to the ceilings with huge gobelin and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes ; the subjects on the ceilings and the wainscoting were repeated in miniature on the armchairs
they saw the old man appear in the doorway of the tavern
but the bishop somehow managed
the candles haven ’ t , though !
marius had learned in montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the hapless innkeeper
the empire faded to a shadow that resembled that of the dying roman world
that we sold so we could eat at night !
god performs his miracles however he sees fit
he resolutely hurdled a wooden fence and found himself in the garden
but the constancy of song will
the insurgents become lepers
france had its eyes on paris ; paris had its eyes on the faubourg saint-antoine
the thirty-eight loopholes cut by the english at irregular heights are still there
i land impoverished by the sea
that ’ s what it is to be young ; the young quickly dry their eyes ; they find pain pointless and simply don ’ t put up with it
ecstasies in which they forget to kiss
to marius ’ s mind , if he accepted this offer , his position would be both better and worse at once ; he would gain material well-being and lose his dignity ; it was complete and beautiful adversity turned into ugly and absurd inconvenience , something similar to a blind man ’ s gaining sight in one eye
finally he raised his head trying to look merely satisfied but looking perfectly triumphant
as for the man , he really was so tired that he did not even enjoy the nice white sheets
everything ’ s going to rack and ruin ; the world is a pain in the neck
this vile sand that you trample beneath your feet , throw it into the furnace , and if it melts there and boils , it will become sparkling crystal
just as well he left it for me , though , the old bastard !
wellington is just a hero like any other
marius noticed on that occasion that monsieur fauchelevent spoke well and even with a certain linguistic flair
on the back , the colonel had added :
so no matter what he does , venerate whoever bears the sign of starry eyes
what did he do during this part of the trip ?
they were a sad bunch , enveloped by a poverty that was slowly squeezing them dry
they left their home county
one thing was striking and gave him pause for profound thought , like a warning whispered by providence itself : the walls scaled , fences hurdled , luck tried to the death , the long hard climb uphill , all these same efforts he had made to get out of the other place of atonement , he had made to get into this one here
the odd thing was that she looked both poorer and prettier ; two steps you would not have thought possible for her to take
and with a sovereign movement , the frail young man of twenty pushed the stocky and robust picklock onto his knees in the mud , bending him like a reed
when these poor beings have grown into men , the millstone of the social order almost always catches up with them and grinds them to a pulp , but while they are still children , they escape , being little
and she slumped in a heap as though she were dying herself
they ’ re a pack of wolves !
the documentary will only attain its human factuality by imitating fiction , even beyond its logic
jean valjean seemed to have one last hesitation and , tonelessly , almost breathlessly , he stammered out rather than spoke these words : now that you know , do you think , monsieur , you who are the master , that i should not see cosette anymore ?
doesn ’ t she have a little girl she ’ s keen to see ?
a clash of principles is like a shock in the elements
a good thing , father fauvent
they ’ d chase away the graces for flashing too much bosom
marius waited in vain all day
he stages a coup d ’ état , because there is a break in the connection between the present and the future and because , even being god , he can ’ t make the two ends meet
she squeezed gueulemer ’ s big rough fingers with her weak bony little skeleton ’ s hand and went on : you know very well i ’ m no fool
to lose themselves is what they live for
you light your candles for me
you , thénardier said to her , stay out of it
they would not stop to speak but would just nod to each other sadly
if you want to get an idea of all the gigantic proportions that come together to make up a ship of the line , you only have to duck under one of the covered slipways , six stories high , of the ports of brest or toulon
with an industry , the manufacture of black glass beads , he made the fortune of a whole town
the ballots were collected in caps
she had all the doors and windows carefully shut everywhere , got toussaint to go over the entire house from cellar to attic , shut herself up in her room , shot the bolts , looked under her bed , got into bed , and slept badly
in the lower rooms they read subversive pamphlets
jean valjean was poised this moment at the most perilous of such crossroads
the four couples conscientiously got through all the folies champêtresnumber then possible in the country
it is not a matter of any equality in rank ’ in the eyes of the camera
we are at the pinnacle , so let ’ s have a higher philosophy
her fate was beginning to intoxicate her
the bed had not been slept in and on the bed were laid out , trustingly , the coat and the black ribbon
well then , cried the old man impetuously with a pain that was poignant and full of anger , what do you want with me ?
the good lord is more than just , my brother said
he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was cosette
my poor boy , you ’ re going the wrong way , laziness is giving you bad advice ; the toughest of all work is theft
boulatruelle had let the individual pass and it didn ’ t occur to him to approach him , because he told himself the other bloke was three times as strong as he was and armed with a pickaxe and would probably whack him when he saw who he was and figured out that he ’ d been recognized
in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge , jean valjean let go of all that had been troubling him for some time
their job had been to go at night and collect from the scaffold the heads and bodies of those guillotined during the day ; they then carried off these streaming trunks on their backs and their red convict smocks had a permanent crust of blood at the back of the neck , wet at night , dry in the morning
monseigneur bienvenu was no genius
as for the six hundred thousand francs , you haven ’ t mentioned them to me but i know what you ’ re thinking—it ’ s a trust
you ca not hear a heart beating anymore
that was what brujon had written in the middle of the night
he had taken as his motto : never a lawyer be , and for his coat of arms a night table on which a square capnumber might be glimpsed
polignac is a rioter ; camille desmoulinsnumber is a ruler
this could be seen by the complete lack of young priests flocking around him
the next day , the toulon paper ran these few lines :
when we added your age to mine
this silhouette had something unspeakably mean and disturbing about it , the whole look was of what was then known as a fop ; the hat was stylish , the redingote was black , well cut , probably of good fabric , and cinched at the waist
they don ’ t have much money and yet they ’ re bringing up a poor kid someone dumped on their doorstep !
we are not saying this is what happened , of course
i see your cabriolet going by from my window
remember what the name meant to him !
chenildieu burst out laughing
for them it is like a hangover from number imaginations once fired , they say , do not calm down in a day
the good women who passed by took him for beelzebub , then they recognized boulatruelle and were scarcely more reassured
what ’ s more , he maintained a superior skepticism about all things , a great strength in the eyes of the weak
all he had to protect himself from bullets was the bulging half-columns that divide the shops ; he remained pinned in this delicate situation for close to half an hour
it is the people ’ s very substance that is being carried away , here drop by drop , there in gushing torrents , by the miserable vomiting of our sewers into the rivers and the copious vomiting of our rivers into the ocean
the sixth man , who had not yet opened his mouth , began to inspect the gate just as éponine had done an hour earlier , gripping each of the bars in turn and jiggling them carefully
he went on : pardon me , what were you saying , monsieur fabantou ?
the congregation thought a lot of him
the concierge began to scratch away at the grass that was growing in what she called her pavement with a knife , and while tearing out the grass , she mumbled : that ’ s a shame
you ’ re to get a charcoal fire going in the stove
i exist , murmurs that someone known as everyman
he took a shortcut to the seine , reached the quai des ormes , followed the quai , passed la grève and stopped , at some distance from the place du châtelet guardhouse , at the corner of the pont notre-dame
he reread the four lines , but he did not believe it
i don ’ t know you , either , answered laigle
before you grab a stick with thorns , you put gloves on
he saw his old general joubert fall at novi just as he raised his sword and cried forward !
this time , it ’ s me
marius had just emerged from his
the poor unfortunate wretch who aspires to deliverance finds the means , sometimes without any tools beyond a pocketknife or an old razor blade , to saw a sou into two thin sections , two discs , to then hollow out these two sections without touching the imprint of the mint , and to cut a screw thread along the edge of the sou in such a way that the sections screw back together again
the debris that had fallen off the back of the elephant onto its belly had filled up the concave space so that you could walk around as though on a floor
one of them cried : let ’ s exterminate them to the last man and die on the point of our bayonets !
down in what they call the room of the dead
you won ’ t find one !
what do you want the government to do with little wastrels who ’ ve got nothing better to do than think of ways to upset everyone , just when things were starting to quiet down a bit again after all the troubles we ’ ve had
he dived back into the darkness as though boring through it , with the rigid speed of a projectile ; the little rue de l ’ homme-armé became silent and solitary once more ; in the blink of an eye , that strange child , who had both shadow and dream in him , had sunk into the mist of those rows of black houses and been lost there like smoke in the dark ; and you might well think he ’ d blown away and vanished if , a few minutes after he disappeared , a resounding noise of breaking glass and the splendid crash of a streetlamp shattering onto the pavement had not brusquely woken up the indignant bourgeois once more
they dived under the trees in the boulevard behind him and were a dim white smudge in the darkness for a few seconds before vanishing altogether
marius continued to be careless
he told himself that javert and his spies might not have gone , that they had doubtless left people in the street to keep watch , that if this man found him in the garden , he would cry thief and hand him over
and he set off again
like looking for a needle in a lousy haystack !
they reclaimed the light wearing the mask of night
a quick and decisive moment , critical for every orphan , whether poor or rich , for wealth does not protect you from making a bad choice ; misalliances are made very high up the ladder ; the true misalliance is that of souls ; and , just as more than one unknown young man , without name , without birth , without fortune , is a marble capital that supports a temple of grand feelings and grand ideas , so some other man of the world , self-satisfied and opulent , with polished boots and polished words , if you look , not at the outside , but at the inside , that is , at what is reserved for women , is nothing more than a crummy little dive dimly haunted by violent , sordid , and debauched passions—the cabaret sign-post
javert ’ s whole person screamed spy—and an underhand spy at that
rise up , by all means , but only to grow
revolutions have tremendous arms and lucky hands ; they hit hard and choose their targets well
faced with someone whose eyes see nothing , think carefully and be afraid
another time , marius happened to be going down the rue jean-jacques rousseau between enjolras and courfeyrac
if you squeezed their noses , milk would come running out !
we know the rest
this is what was happening in monsieur madeleine ’ s bedroom
the day after that , he did not leave his bed
the aunt examined the note , turned it over and around , then put it back in the locket
and that was when he put snow on me
she had only one child with her by then , a little boy , the baby of the bunch
they could see his back , and the stream of blood gushing from a hole in the middle of it
the strange thing was that he thought he recognized monsieur leblanc
and , if it was heresy to pray outside the sacred texts , then saint teresa and saint jeromenumber were heretics
at the barricade in the rue greneta , a man appeared on horseback and handed something that looked to be a roll of silver to the man who seemed to be in charge of the barricade
this was where marius had come the first time he had absented himself from paris
the new respite that the assailants were allowing the barricade had indeed been extended
why can ’ t my wife have the wit to give me a child like that !
the facit indignatio—anger writes poetry—replaces the gracchinumber
but what the drama would gain , the truth would lose
it just happens , like that
do you hear anyone else say : i ’ ll eat tomorrow !
he was dreaming of her
you attain the height of esteem if you manage to cut yourself badly , to the bone
the assailants , hurtling into the cabaret , their feet tangled up and tripping over the panels of the door which had been battered in and thrown on the floor , found not one combatant inside
he opened a drawer in his secretaire , pulled out a few banknotes , shoved them in his pocket , closed the secretaire again and rang
the nun ’ s dead , he said
my brothers , have pity !
how sweet of you to have put that pillow behind my back !
this is an art that has made the corner of the courtyard of the conciergerie in paris , where the prisoner batte-molle escaped twenty years ago , so famous and feared
hurry up and get down , go on , hop it , my little elf , you ’ re the young one
you mustn ’ t let yourselves be so stunned by this rather stunning pun
gavroche , busy singing , whistling , humming , charging ahead and banging shop shutters with the butt of his hammerless pistol , paid the man no attention
he looks like he ’ s following someone
several years went by this way ; cosette was growing up
agree , compashionate man , that you have to experience the crullest want and that it is truly painfull , to obtain some releef , to have it attested by the authorities as if we wernt free to suffer and to die of starvashion waiting for someone to releev our missery
you ’ ve got my place and i ’ ve got yours
monsieur myriel could be called to the bedside of the sick and dying at any time of the day or night
marius had fallen into a mental hornet ’ s nest
to get his silence paid for ?
the tread of the patrol was becoming more and more distinct
and the funny thing was—for in this century the revolution has to muscle in everywhere—that this impeccably feudal salon was , as we have said , dominated by a bourgeois
the camera has captured these images faithfully
these are beings from the great neutered species ; geldings , parasites , nonentities , who have a bit of land , a bit of giddiness , and a bit of wit , who would be hicks in a salon and think themselves gentlemen in a barroom , who talk about my acreage , my woods , my peasants , hiss and boo actresses at the theatre to prove they are men of taste , pick fights with officers of the garrison to show they are men of war , hunt , smoke , yawn , drink , sniff tobacco , play billiards , ogle travellers alighting from the coach , live at the café , dine at the inn , have a dog who gobbles up the bones under the table and a mistress who slaps down dishes on top of it , hang on to their loose change for dear life , go overboard for whatever is in fashion , admire tragedy , despise women , wear out their old boots , ape london via paris and paris via pont-à-mousson , lose their marbles with age , never lift a finger to work , don ’ t do any good and don ’ t do much harm , either
cosette was going away
these two candlesticks held two wax candlesnumber and they sat as a rule on the bishop ’ s mantelpiece
was he buckled so far as to break ?
in this mysterious balance sheet that the reflective marius was drawing up for jean valjean , he noted the credit , he noted the debit , and he tried to reach a balance
he thought of the double march that was going on at that moment in the shadows , crime advancing on one side , justice coming from the other
from the political standpoint , there is only one principle : the sovereignty of man over himself
one day jean valjean went downstairs , took three steps into the street , sat down on a curbstone , on that same curbstone where gavroche , on the night of june number , had found him musing ; he stayed there for a few minutes , then went back up
she thought of sending for her
she is a caterpillar
inside him , horror and fatigue
hence , for the commander in chief , the necessity of examining the slightest tuft of vegetation and of digging into the slightest contour
good , i hear you say ?
the missus has coughing fits
i ’ m sick of my cake
it is more hypocritical than irreproachable
they are , said enjolras
you will recall marius ’ s hesitations , palpitations , terrors
what did he say ?
for the rest , the place , being kept by two women , was always in a state of exquisite cleanliness from top to bottom
father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine , and monsieur madeleine had become monsieur le maire
the poor woman gazed all around her
when the moment came , as the archbishop was walking past the boarders , mademoiselle bouchard , to the unutterable horror of her companions , broke rank and said : monseigneur , a day off
who the hell is he going to take those flowers to ?
and when he was within reach , he grabbed him swiftly and vigorously by the arm and pulled him up
make a note of this extenuating circumstance
that ordinary men saw his life , but the bishop saw his conscience
the cannonballs made holes in the cuirassiers
meanwhile , trust the little ’ uns , don ’ t trust the big ’ uns—
hardly was the light extinguished when a weird tremor began shaking the netting the three children were lying under
old man gillenormand smiled
there was a full moon that night
how much will you give me for it ?
the immense incomplete exists in nature
she stopped crying from shock
her heart ached , but she made her decision
it was not yet possible to say
the burial takes place at the vaugirard cemetery just before nightfall
he feared he might have said too much , he raked his hair hard with his nails and refrained from saying more than : ah , there it is
such trains of thought and heartache can not be interrupted
in number , the author of this book held in his own hands the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in number
it did not close ; he turned round and saw that a hand was keeping it open
it is spelled faux , fauq , and faoucq
the whole night , she saw that stone as big as a mountain and full of caves
all that day , cosette was in a kind of haze
his hand was shaking
whose is the vile hand that furtively slips into victory ’ s pocket ?
marius had only one more step to take
number what are you doing that to the door for ?
what was there this time in the young girl ’ s gaze ?
in those days , a dandy was put together with a big collar , a big cravat , a watch dangling charms , three different coloured waistcoats worn one on top of the other , with the red and blue on the inside , and then an olive-coloured short-waisted jacket with tails and with a double row of silver buttons tightly buttoned right up to the shoulder , and lighter olive trousers , decorated at both seams with ribs of a random , but always odd , number , ranging from one to eleven , that limit never being exceeded
he went easy on women and the poor , feeling that the weight of human society fell on them
in his lair a tiger had a good hoot
even the public were admitted through a sort of quarantine entrance provided on the street
the intermittent reflections from the air vents appeared only at very widely spaced intervals and the light was so wan that daylight was like moonlight ; all the rest was mist , miasma , opacity , blackness
answered the elder boy , gazing at gavroche with the expression of a rescued angel
in the period when he was most desperately destitute , he noticed that young girls turned around when he passed and , with a heavy heart , he fled or hid
oh yes i have !
the latent man that existed in each was altogether different
but to be fair , even to selfishness , the state to which that part of the nation that we call the bourgeoisie aspired after the shake-up of number was not inertia , which gets tangled up with indifference and laziness and contains a bit of shame ; it was not sleep , which assumes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams ; it was a halt
from something javert let slip , it was clear he ’ d done some secret research , with an inquisitiveness in keeping with the breed and having as much to do with instinct as with any deliberate intention , sniffing out any former traces that father madeleine might have left behind elsewhere
the bible says : go and multiply
he had once been a pruner , after all , and was glad to find himself a gardener again
they stepped into the street
he put them to good use
so you really shouldn ’ t be surprised at that six hundred thousand francs , monsieur pontmercy
twenty years ago , you could still see at the southeast corner of the place de la bastille , near the dock of the canal dug out of the old moat of the prison-citadel , a bizarre monument that has already been wiped from the memory of parisians yet that deserved to leave a trace there , for it was something that a member of the institut , commander in chief of the army of egypt , number no less , had come up with
there , the archbishop , aga khan of heaven , number locked up and spied on this seraglionumber of souls reserved for god
on the appointed day , he went to the minister ’ s
he asked out loud , perfectly distraught
jean valjean shuddered with the unconquerable tremor of the wretched victims of fate
under both the empire and the restoration , one after the other , he had enjoyed the two forms of bravery necessary to the two epochs , bravery on the battlefield and bravery at the rostrum
gavroche stuck his head up , amazed by the size of this gros sou ; he looked at it in the dark , and the whiteness of the gros sou dazzled him
behind closed doors , he gently poked fun at god
someone whom you do not answer back saw to it
he would come out with all manner of crude , obscene , and filthy remarks with wondrous calm and an unflappable air of elegance
her father was down below on the lawn
aren ’ t we friends anymore , then ?
you ’ re losing the thread of the speech you were going to make me , monsieur the attorney , that ’ s irritating
the tragic picture we have begun to paint would not be complete , the reader would not see , in their exact and actual relief , these great moments of society in labour and giving birth to revolution , in which the convulsions are mixed with sheer hard work , if we leave out of the outline sketched here , an incident full of epic and savage horror that occurred almost immediately after gavroche left
marius ’ s eyelids did not lift ; but he breathed through his half-open mouth
meanwhile , she had planted herself in front of marius with a trace of joy visible on her livid face and something that resembled a smile
it seems that all the time he had been there—over an hour—lost in his thoughts , he had vaguely been aware of the fancy goods shop lit up with little lanterns and candles so splendidly that you could see it through the tavern window like an illumination
the message could not have come far
buddha and the dragon , mused monsieur mabeuf sotto voce
aunt gillenormand had got out of bed
he remained speechless , utterly lost for words
marius enjoyed himself enormously
at around two o ’ clock , almost invariably , you would see his carriage and the royal cavalcade stream past furiously on the boulevard de l ’ hôpital
how could he condemn the victim and spare the assassin ?
the dadaists did the show as a matinee in berlin and the high point of the programme was a race between a typewriter and a sewing machine
cried the astonished director
oh , no , we won ’ t allow any more trips
it was floating on the water
the chapter has assembled
i ’ m talking about their cheese dairies , which they call fruitières
they never risk going beyond it
besides , cosette could not quite remember what marius had told her about being away , which was supposed to be only for a day , and what explanation he had given her
i complete the restitution in saying my real name
you think staying silent is simple ?
what would be demeaning , then , for the son of colonel pontmercy , in the impending fight ?
the generation currently taking its turn on this earth is not obliged to shorten its passage for the generations to come , who are its equals , after all , and will later have their turn
you didn ’ t know i was an old coward
you know very well , answered thénardier
jondrette did not need to be told twice
to paint a battle , we need those powerful painters whose brushes are dipped in chaos ; rembrandt would be better than van der meulennumber van der meulen was accurate at midday but lies at three o ’ clock
his name is dehaze
she walked over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder
listolier and fameuil were engaged in a discussion about their teachers and were explaining the difference between monsieur delvincourt and monsieur blondeaunumber to fantine
they were no longer eyes ; they were the deep window on the soul that replaces gazing eyes in certain long-suffering people ; such a look seems oblivious to reality , reflecting past horrors and calamities in a blaze of fierce light
his whole life would have been useless , all his penitence wasted , and there would be only one thing left to say : what is the point ?
in a corner next to the opening marius was looking through , hanging on the wall in a black wooden frame , was a coloured engraving at the bottom of which was written in capital letters the dream
and so on and so forth
then again , when two lovers understand each other , it all goes very smoothly ; any third party , no matter who , that might disturb their love , is kept completely in the dark by a few precautions that are always the same for all lovers
marius then saw that what he had taken for a shapeless heap was a rope ladder , very well made , with wooden rungs and two large hooks for hanging
maman said she ’ d take us to get blessed palms on palm sunday
there was no way of opening the gate
in the middle of this vile rumination , the ideas we just mentioned kept stirring around in his brain , coming and going and coming back again , seemingly bearing down on him like a ton of bricks ; and then , without knowing why , and with that automatic persistence of reverie , he thought at the same time about a convict named brevet whom he had known in jail , and whose trousers used to be held up by a single brace of knitted cotton
isn ’ t there in every human soul , wasn ’ t there in the soul of jean valjean , in particular , an initial spark , a divine element , incorruptible in this world , immortal in the next , that good can bring out , prime , ignite , set on fire and cause to blaze splendidly , and that evil can never entirely extinguish ?
he did not know himself anymore , he no longer counted
between the armchairs , in guise of a carpet , an old bedside rug had been spread showing more warp than wool
and with that , he blew out the candle
at the bottom of the garden , an avenue of great poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent at the corner of the rue droit-mur to the house of the little convent at the corner of aumarais lane
i ’ ve had a gutful of despotism
we have moved on from the days when those terrifying swarms of people erupted in france , when you could hear beneath your feet a muffled and obscure stirring , when molehills mushroomed mysteriously on the surface of society , when the ground cracked open , caves yawned , and you saw the heads of monsters suddenly rear up out of the ground
the kind of magnetic instinct that alerts the eye made monsieur leblanc turn round almost at the same time as marius
all of a sudden , he spotted the two little ragamuffins , motionless behind the little green swan house
but why the workman ’ s getup ?
the convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by sheer cliffs
now there ’ s an overseer we could do without , said enjolras
his eyes were closed , his matted hair stuck to his temples like dried brushes that had been dipped in the colour red , his hands hung down , lifeless , his limbs were cold , there was coagulated blood at the corners of his mouth
i happened to be crossing the square as you were carting this woman away
this ruin is recognizable by two big square windows that can still be seen there ; the one halfway up , closest to the gable on the right , is barred by a worm-eaten joist propped against the wall like an upright beam
these encounters seemed to really throw boulatruelle
travel expenses incurred in pastoral rounds ?
monsieur marius … baron marius pontmercy , by jove !
the rathole was so dark that anyone coming in from outside felt like they were entering a cellar
she came in , shut the door behind her , stopped to catch her breath , for she was quite winded , then shouted with an expression of triumph and joy : he ’ s coming !
first , the duties of all ; second , the duties of each one according to his station in life
toussaint ’ s bed was also stripped
to send one down , or drop the other ?
nowadays the priest is the only man who can routinely become king—and what a king !
deliberate about the citizen artillery !
but what he was really furious about was his pistol ’ s not having a dog—a hammer
that done , he crossed his legs and lay back in his chair , in the manner of a man who is sure of what he is saying ; then he took the plunge and tackled the subject gravely , stressing every word with great emphasis : monsieur le baron , the sixth of june , number , roughly a year ago , the day of the riot , there was a man in the grand sewer of paris , over where the sewer comes out at the seine , between the pont des invalides and the pont d ’ iéna
don ’ t blow a gasket , come with us , let ’ s hit the bottle together
the idea of exploring these pestilential regions did not occur even to the police
something of the sort has already been seen
on both sides they seemed rooted to this deathly soil
an eastern tale has it that the rose was made white by god , but that when adam looked at it as it was beginning to open , it was ashamed and went pink
what was the good of living , what was there to live for now ?
you only have to let yourself slide down , we ’ ll catch you
certain flashes of fire can only come from certain souls ; the eye , that cellar window of thought , is set ablaze ; glasses hide nothing ; you might as well stick a pane of glass on hell
opposite the passage de l ’ ancre , a drummer received a thrust of a dagger
did you see how i pulled that out of the bag for you , my sixty francs , my landlord , my fourth of february !
still hidden in the crook of the rue mondétour , marius had watched the first phase of the battle , irresolute and shivering
while they were in this predicament , a great chest was brought in and deposited in the presbytery for monseigneur the bishop by two unknown horsemen who promptly turned their mounts and charged off
it rallied , but kept out of sight
for four years he had been waiting for marius resolutely—that is indeed the right word—in the conviction that the naughty little rascal would ring at his door one of these days ; now he had reached the point where , at certain mournful hours , he told himself that if marius took his time even a little longer … it wasn ’ t death that he found unbearable , it was the idea that he might never see marius again
for a long while now , i haven ’ t seen you
and what about the trip !
at that initial phase of love , a phase when sensual pleasure keeps absolutely still under the all-powerfulness of ecstasy , marius , the pure and seraphic marius , would have been rather more capable of visiting a streetwalker than lifting cosette ’ s gown up to ankle level
his thoughts gradually became unbearably black
of the production revol u tion
the sister , who had no idea of distances , replied : oh , i ’ m sure he can be back here tomorrow
you look at this surface bubbling away apparently without a cause ; you don ’ t see the hydra scuttling along the bottom
where have all the beautiful girls gone ,

they always make these stoves too hot
all the rest looks like a toothless jawbone
you are true comedians
it is to measure being and non-being
the grandfather shivered from head to toe , as much as ossified limbs can shiver , and his eyes , their corneas yellow due to his great age , filmed over with a sort of glassy gleam
that is the theory of the clever
since the days when the author of this book still lived in paris , two have died
she did not look at herself anymore and for a fortnight tried to do her hair with her back to the mirror
that done , he got himself to montfermeil
ecclesiastes names you the almighty ; the maccabees name you the creator ; the epistle to the ephesians names you liberty ; baruch names you immensity ; the psalms name you wisdom and truth ; john names you light ; the book of kings names you lord ; exodus calls you providence ; leviticus , holiness ; esdras , justice ; creation names you god , mankind names you father ; but solomon names you mercy and of all your names , that is the most beautifulnumber
once he was under the elephant , he let fly with a bizarre cry that doesn ’ t belong to any human tongue and that only a parakeet could reproduce
only , of course , these a-significant ’ moments have a very precise function : the thing that allows itself to be apprehended in them , within the suspended fiction , is simply the life ’ that the characters in the meaningful action are endowed with by the same token
coarse paper , clumsy folding , the mere sight of certain missives puts you off
but that didn ’ t stop marius pressing ahead
he slowly wrote the lines that follow :
cock an ear , montparnasse , d ’ you hear all the yapping in the clink ?
he was well read and rather erudite
after the disbanding of gaspard bès ’ s gang of crooks , number which had overrun the gorges of ollioules , one of its lieutenants , a man named cravatte , decided to seek refuge in the mountains
a few men around a flag marked the place of one regiment , another battalion was now commanded only by some lieutenant ’ s captain ; alten ’ s division , already so badly battered at la haie-sainte , was almost destroyed ; the intrepid belgians of van kluze ’ s brigade were strewn over the fields of rye all along the nivelles road ; there were almost none left of the dutch grenadiers who joined our ranks in spain in number to fight against wellington and who rallied to the english in number in their fight against napoléon
you know , cosette , your husband is very handsome ?
three hundred sous , said fauchelevent
at around six o ’ clock in the evening they had reached chelles
not a cloud in the sky
his house in the rue des filles-du-calvaire , as we said , belonged to him
at forty , a man ’ s finished
he had no idea what a father and mother should be like
it could rain all it liked , as often as it liked , paillasse , pantaloon , and gillesnumber were not about to call it a day
showing the annihilation , as claude lanz­mann does in shoah , therefore implies that you have linked a theory about history with a theory about art
tomorrow ’ s truth borrows its method—battle—from yesterday ’ s lie
that , moreover , was the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother
provided they are face-to-face with immensity , they smile
the first was skinny and had a long cudgel with an iron tip , the second was a sort of colossus , carrying a pole-axe for slaughtering cattle , holding it by the middle of the handle with the hatchet part pointing downward
jean valjean aimed at the dormer and fired
the students would say : ah , monsieur leblanc ’ s on his bench !
jean valjean changed numbers in jail
the old woman was grumbling
jean valjean went on
the glimmer of light vanished and everything became indistinct again ; immensity seemed to open out there
the besieged , alas , uses anything he can as a weapon
next day monsieur mabeuf received an invitation to dinner at the minister ’ s
what ’ s a man to do ?
i took a second street
she exchanged with her husband a few words all the more furious for her not daring to utter them out loud : stupid old goat !
he could hear the octogenarian breathing

it was the days when they had great big sheep in the tuileries that used to pull the little carriage of the king of rome

hello and goodbye , said jean valjean
he had never been a father , lover , husband , friend
in the middle of the slightly convex garden , on top of a grassy knoll , there was a beautiful fir tree , pointed and conical , from which four great allées radiated , as from the pointed hub of a shield ; arranged in pairs between the spokes of the broader walkways , eight small paths radiated , so that if the enclosure had been circular , the geometric plan of the garden paths would have looked like a cross laid on a wheel
one person digs with an idea , another digs with numbers , yet another digs with rage
and after a pause , she went on : i don ’ t think i ever had one
the place was incredibly bleak

if anyone knew who he was , it was his own doing
the world is what it is

then he picked up his carrier , put back in the cartridges that had fallen out , without losing a single one , and , advancing toward the fusillade , went and stripped another cartridge pouch
progress is an honest man ; the ideal and the absolute do not pick pockets
he hissed between clenched teeth
and he quickly told the kid that , that same day , in the morning , babet had been transferred to the conciergerienumber and had escaped by turning left instead of right in the halls of justice
wherever it tries to be alive , we attack it and do our level best to kill it
i ’ ll see cosette tomorrow !
he was the spectator of his own drama , like a person at a play he doesn ’ t understand
we have just seen how marius discovered that she was called ursula—or thought he had
they went to ground
before the major works begun in number got off the ground , the underground network of paris was subject to sudden cave-ins
the confidence with which monsieur le baron honours me makes it my duty to say so
there was no address on one side , no seal on the other
it was precisely something of the kind that happened on the afternoon of june number down by the seine , on the embankment of the right bank , a bit beyond the pont des invalides
it is our heritage
what ’ s the good of being on top if you can ’ t see past the next man ’ s nose ?
one day , shortly after mother magnon had handed éponine the note about the rue plumet , the police suddenly descended on the rue clocheperce ; mother magnon was seized along with mamselle miss , and the entire household , which was suspect , was hauled in
he had not examined and weighed up the right man claims to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable
one doesn ’ t need to be hungry to eat a cake
all the things were black
in villages that he found to be without a schoolteacher , he also cited the case of queyras
what ’ s become of these men ?
if , at that supreme moment , the newlyweds , dazed with sensual rapture and believing themselves alone , were to listen , they would hear in their room the muted sound of fluttering wings
on top of this , paris was stirring ; for anyone who had something in his life to hide , the political turmoil offered this disadvantage , the fact that the police had become extremely nervous and extremely jumpy , and that in their efforts to track down men like pépin or morey , number they could well uncover a man like jean valjean
it ’ s true , it ’ s very cold !
their veils are knitted with night
any violent step backward is riot ; to recoil is an act of assault and battery against the human race
the frenetic storm of murder that was raging a few feet above him did not reach him , as we said , thanks to the thick chunk of earth that separated him from it , except in a muted indistinct way , like rumbling at a great depth
thénardier raised his right hand to his forehead and shaded his eyes with it ; then he knitted his eyebrows together as he blinked , which , along with a slight pursing of the mouth , typifies the sagacious attention of a man straining to place another man
jondrette noticed that monsieur leblanc was staring at the men
the king , who was laughing , went on laughing , passing merrily from the two bishops to the two attorneys and agreeing to let these men of the robe off their names , or almost

he went on in a voice so weak , he could barely be heard : so his identity was confirmed ?
don ’ t forget , monsieur , that you are in our power , at our discretion , that no human authority can get you out of here , and that we would be really sorry to be forced to resort to unpleasant extremes
all of a sudden he felt a real pang of hunger
all that for nothing !
cosette took marius ’ s hand and squeezed it without answering
two days after the events we are relating at the moment , he left , thanks to marius , for america , under a false name , with his daughter azelma , armed with a draft for twenty thousand francs to be drawn in new york
it was the splendid time when the grande armée had marengo behind it and austerlitz ahead of it
this wall is hidden outside by a great quickset hedge ; the french arrived , thinking they had only the hedge to tackle , leaped over it , and found the wall , an obstructive hurdle and an ambush , the english guards entrenched behind it , thirty-eight loopholes all firing at once , a storm of grapeshot and cannonballs ; and soye ’ s brigade was smashed against it
basque , who was in any case absolutely respectful , opened the door of the downstairs room , saying : i ’ ll go and let madame know

under the rue saint-denis , there is an old stone sewer dating from louis xiii ’ s day that runs straight into the main sewer , known as the grand égout , the grand sewer , with only a single sharp turn , on the right-hand side , under the old cour des miracles , and a single connecting drain , the saint-martin sewer , whose four intersecting arms form a cross
jean-luc godard , in germany year nine zero , and in the histoire ( s ) du cinéma , thereby questions the century through a dialogue between the leninist dream factory and the hollywood dream factory ; the images of escheated socialist germany and capitalist germany through a phrase of rilke 's , reference to goethe , the music of bach and beethoven , but also the silent music of the gramophone in people on sunday or of siegfried 's death in lang 's nibelungen , the statue and the verse of the sovietized pushkin or the image of don quixote overtaking , in his utopian ’ stampede , the broken-down trabant , that automobile of real socialism ’ made in east germany
montparnasse , in fact , had run into éponine on the boulevard where she was keeping watch under the trees and had taken her with him , preferring to play némorin to the daughter rather than schinderhannesnumber to the father

lobau at one end and reille at the other are rolled in the torrent
all the neighbouring churches were scoured
fauchelevent saw them , touched them , spoke to them , and didn ’ t believe it
he peered through the glass as he had done at the tavern
a kind of lettered clerk !
without the tree , she would have fallen
father , what do you expect me to do with it ?
and you used to keep a greasy spoon of a place in montfermeil
i will confine myself , since monsieur le maire wishes it , to the case of the citizen in question
it was the voice of jean valjean
it was distance forced into proximity , compulsory intimacy
it made him laugh

if the ocean went in for dikes , this is how it would build them
he stayed away for a fortnight
something indefinably sad enveloped her ; she could feel his eyes on her rather than see them
there were just a few die-hard rumourmongers who said : you can be certain that the road-mender from gagny didn ’ t root around like that for nothing
as he approached the gate , he forgot everything
he climbed out of the coffin and helped fauchelevent nail the lid back on
it was grantaire who had discovered corinthe
you ’ ll make my grandfather jump for joy if you play whist
he sensed the situation was urgent and that it was now vital to get to the seine whatever the risk
jean valjean did not try to dislodge the hand that held the collar of his coat
but this monster is not yet perfect , however , for its kafkaesque metamorphosis is incomplete the 'four-legged chicken ' is in fact an experimental failure worthy of featuring in the bestiary of a jerome bosch !
after some hesitation , he decided to speak to this man , but not without first looking in front and behind , as though he were frightened someone might overhear the question he was about to ask
at that , the host bent down to his ear and said to him in a tone that made him jump : get out of here
he approached the hut ; for a door it had a very low and narrow opening , and it looked like one of those buildings that road menders throw up by the side of the road
the lock was visibly locked with a double turn

he thinks of the murky adventures of his corpse falling through the limitless gloom
a fortress—and a mousetrap , courfeyrac quipped , laughing
at those moments , a bolt of lightning could have fallen thirty feet away and they would not have noticed , so deeply absorbed were they in each other
he admired , instinctively , his opposite
from the man , he had easily arrived at the name
courfeyrac did not want to be left behind so he called himself plain old courfeyrac
what the matter is , is that i ’ m hungry , answered gavroche bluntly
monsieur leblanc did as he was told

his inmate pals helped him as they do in such sad places
you can also shout by using rubbish and that 's what i did , glueing and nailing [ … ]
surprise on the part of boulatruelle
i have romans , men and women [ here the word is illegible ] —the whole retinue
hardy types , who can ’ t resist a gamble , have thereby often enough , we are assured , opened up the holes dug by the black man and tried to rob the devil
the prisoner remained thoughtful for a moment , then he took up the pen and wrote : mademoiselle fabre , care of monsieur urbain fabre , rue saint-dominique d ’ enfer , no
find a way of getting me out like cosette in a basket and under a lid
in the encounter that took place , jean valjean was veiled and thénardier unmasked
for five years marius had lived in poverty , in deprivation , even in distress , but he realized he had never known real misery
it is paved for a considerable part of its course
he had at times , accordingly , sustained with his own credit and his own funds the tulle factory in boulogne , the mechanized flax mill in frévent , and the hydraulic textile manufacturing of boubers-sur-canche
in the depths of her irises there was a point of amazement where terror lurked
monsieur gillenormand took the letter in trembling hands , read it , ripped it in half and chucked it into the wastepaper basket
it can ’ t be anything , he said
in the eerie amplification of that initial moment , he almost imagined that the hinge had come alive , suddenly taking on a terrible life of its own and barking a warning to the world like a dog rousing the sleeping from their slumber
the horror got worse and worse
i don ’ t abhor this particular government
oh , why had his father died so soon , before his time , before justice was done , before his son came to love him !
god can go to hell !
many of those intrepid men , who had embarked on the most frightening of adventures without turning a hair , now turned their heads away
the prioress was waiting for them , rosary beads in hand
marius , my boy , you are a baron , you are rich , stop this pettifogging , i beseech you
otherwise , he was the cheeriest of the lot
the fall in value of a pile of écus had bankers singing the marseillaise
this made them laugh all evening
i was forced to give up the profession of author
it needs a nipper , brujon chimed in with the barrières slang
the candle , spreading out like a giant mushroom , barely lit the cavernous vastness , the fire had died down , and all these monstrous heads made deformed shadows on the walls and ceiling
they are so ridiculous where i come from
there was nothing there , inside the houses , but fear , mourning , stupor ; in the streets , a sort of awestruck horror
cosette started to laugh , too , all her ghoulish speculations fell away , and the next day , over breakfast with her father , she poked fun at herself over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of chimney pots
there won ’ t be much left for dinner
but the prisoner spoke up : you are poor worthless wretches , but my own life is not worth being so heavily guarded
seeing which , the barricade started to laugh
and then again , anyway , it ’ s you who got me a place here , it ’ s your business
i feel that you make cosette happy
the dinner , as we were saying , was winding down
wood and wine were kept in a kind of semi-subterranean recess lined with loose stones right next to the door on the rue de babylone , a space that had once served as a grotto to the presiding judge ; for in the days of follies and country cottages , no love affair was complete without a grotto
bright sunshine streamed into the room
speaking of which , how was the letter to this old codger signed ?
it was now three days since she had seen marius
the officers looked around
these are the darkly radiant
you got ta be one jump ahead
the impression swiftly passed , but for the moment it was irresistible
as he weaved through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil , he had spotted this little shadow , struggling along groaning , dumping its burden on the ground , then picking it up again and walking on
as long as you ’ re like this , i won ’ t let you have your daughter
thénardier shoved the hankie in his pocket
and you call me monsieur !
he gently disentangled himself from cosette ’ s arms and grabbed his hat
jupiter was setting in the depths of the sky
i was three years old
fauchelevent shot back , clutching at straws , however weak
six o ’ clock rang out at saint-médard
i must warn you , i ’ m not part of that pack of ninnies
flowing beer gathers no head
and a moment later he made his entrance into the drawing room where mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was already in position , embroidering her cabriolet wheels
despair causes us to freeze
so much so that you no longer know whether chekov , turgenev or gontcharov were right about the eternal nature of russian life , doomed to being always the same , always the same as a good semblance of a life ’ , or whether the very movement of that life , its way of being equal to the action and the suffering of history , is to imitate russia 's writers , to make life the same as the words of the masters of the language
they shouted at it : revolution , why this king ?
can we really have found you again only to lose you ?
it ’ s already fun , she said
what you saw was the interior of a cloister
and yet , only two or three profited by it
meanwhile a paper lantern had been lit at the little barricade , and at the big one , one of those wax torches you see at mardi gras in front of the carriages loaded with masks heading for the courtille
he derided any allegiance to any party , in the brother as much as in the father , in the young robespierre as much as in loizerollesnumber a fat lot of good it did them , dying , he would cry
but it makes no difference , the evidence is there
a few hours had been enough
you can say o and p , or orestes and pylades , number whichever you prefer
one day marius , who was given to talking seriously in the midst of his happiness , said apropos who knows what incident : the men of the revolution are so great , they already have the lustre of the centuries , like cato and phocion , and every one of them already seems like a figure of antiquity
this number included madame de beaufort d ’ hautpoul and madame la marquise dufresnenumber another was only ever known in the convent by the alarming noise she made when she blew her nose
behind the window of an apartment block in bucharest that is just like all the rest , a hand activated the camera that took a long shot of protesters marching on the presidential palace ( videograms of a revolution )
here she stopped , fixed her lacklustre eye on marius and burst out laughing before saying , in a tone that contained extreme anguish smothered by extreme cynicism : gah !
there , at the corner we mentioned , it dipped down so low that there was nothing left to see but a wall
take these five hundred francs while you ’ re at it and get out !
we ’ ll take the wolves ’ rue de rivoli , he said
the poor poacher survincent , number who had been through the cellar prison of châtelet , used to say : it was the rhymes that kept me going
we brought down the old world , some of us , and the old world , that chamber pot of miseries , tipped over and turned into an urn pouring joy over humankind
i ’ d go down to hell for that
and then again , shouldn ’ t charity be the greater , the deeper the fall into darkness ?
this little kid will grow up
the benedictine-bernardines of martin verga , cloistered fifty years ago in petit-picpus , sang the services to a solemn psalmody , pure plainchant , and always at full voice for the whole length of the service
so that is why i began to love her
he was fluent in italian , latin , greek , and hebrew ; and this served him to read only four poets : dante , juvenal , aeschylus , and isaiah
there are six of you ; but i am the rest of the world
g—— went on : let ’ s go back to the explanation you requested
public education , when it is good , can always bring out the latent usefulness of a soul , no matter what it is like to start with
i ’ m really not interested in all the details , to tell you the truth
feel how cold i am , she said
matelotte had gone back upstairs , grantaire had grabbed her by the waist and pushed her toward the window , with long peals of laughter
jean valjean instantly slammed his foot on top of it
he went on at length about his age , his infirmities , the weight of the years now bearing down on him
cosette turned to him
two very severe duchesses , mesdames de choiseul and de sérent , often visited the community , where they gained access no doubt by virtue of the privilege of their status as grandes dames , to the great terror of the boarders
no doubt about it
though he may have converted his carriage into alms , that didn ’ t stop the bishop from doing his rounds
probably to her , since a hand had deposited the packet on the bench
the german anatomist actually has invented a process for preserving the dead and , in particular , for sculpting them , by plastination , thereby taking things a lot further than the mere embalming of mummies
finally she seemed to reach a decision
but the key was in it
when the man came nearer , the noise came nearer ; when he moved away , the noise moved away ; if he made a sudden movement , a tremolo accompanied that movement ; if he stopped , the noise stopped
the first street on the left
it was clear that this man was one of those you do not answer back
a heart needs a bone to gnaw on
these days , there are those who can ’ t distinguish between the mighty saint bernard and the bernard known as of the catholic poor , a certain good-hearted ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century
he lived constantly in such shadow , groping like a blind man or a dreamer
combeferre , standing next to enjolras , studied the young man
go and sleep somewhere else , yelled enjolras
elmira would give alms to belisarius ! number but no , nothing !
come on now , this is ridiculous !
he had come there from somewhere else
and so idleness is a mother
of course it ’ s all true
to be left-handednumber makes you most enviable
well-heeled bourgeois didn ’ t think much of being buried in vaugirard ; it reeked of poverty
a thousand thoughts flitted through him , but they only strengthened him in his resolve
the sight filled him with jealousy and he had done everything he could to hurt madeleine
he chattered away so sweetly and so unintelligibly you ’ d have thought he was a bird
everybody who is anybody turns on their wit when the firmament turns on its stars
monsieur madeleine wheeled round and recognized javert
after that , you can do what you like with me
you feel sweetly drunk
it could not go on like this
your majesty , two of them would need to be placed end to end to make up one of your grenadiers
the sight of a sabre or a gun froze him
the servant was an old maid called toussaint , or all saints , whom jean valjean had saved from the hospitalnumber and destitution
tragedy , which sheds its own light , intensified the thin light of day that was in his mind
there are some who don ’ t have a lot of linen , so they ’ re waiting on it ; if you don ’ t get their washing done , you lose the business
and then , you have to be careful
when it is the heart that is slipping , you don ’ t stop on the way down
he was some sort of labourer in a jacket with big pockets and a pick under his arm
how would the shell of the barricade behave under cannon fire ?
greuze 's inability to represent history in all its majesty will be met with the ability of this or that fascist or soviet painter to serve his cause by concentrating exclusively on the composition of volumes and the distribution of light
man plays a supporting role
don ’ t forget any of what i ’ ve told you
the film is called listen to britain
cosette ’ s mother continued : you see , i can ’ t take my little girl back home
the dining room was ablaze with cheery brilliance
the girls got up to do as they were told
with a low forehead , broad temples , a mass of crow ’ s-feet though not yet forty years old , wiry short hair , bushy cheeks , the beard of a wild boar—you can see the man from here
mademoiselle gillenormand kissed him
and , bowing , he said out loud : monsieur tranchelevent—
'this demand encourages the supply of fake documents , sundry reconstructions and conjuring tricks , but surely we could say the same today of art when it comes down to it
i ’ m off to the barricades
cambronne comes up with the word for waterloo the way rouget de l ’ isle comes up with the marseillaise , number being visited with inspiration from on high
the old rattletrap ’ s hitched ?
that ’ s the fault of rousseaunumber
me , i was fifty-three , i was really pushing it
the muck would be almost solid in one place , almost liquid in another
it was still the dead of night
we got to the stage where we were turning out very good glass beads
but it was remarked how the bishop from that point on avoided going near the square where executions took place
the good man entered
i say : to err is to be in love
poor cosette did not say a word
like certain church towers , the salon of madame la baronne de t—— had two cocks
i ’ ll be going there to testify
paris has a boy and the forest has a bird ; the bird is called a sparrow and the boy is called a ragamuffin imp , a street urchin : le gamin
look at the room downstairs
it was deadly serious
you looked , but you did not see anyone ; you listened , but you did not hear a footstep or the faintest murmur of a human voice
reverend mother , you can hear the knell much better from here than in the garden
gavroche replied : maybe more than you have
me , i had my little cosette , i was forced to become a bad woman
she ’ s my old lady , said the child
how the chain on the shackles must have undergone preparatory treatment to be shattered like that with one whack of the hammer
and yet , i give you my most sacred word of honour that , if you go away , i will die
she let out a shriek of delight
he made further inquiries
two undertakers in grey uniforms with black trim were walking to the left and right of the hearse
if this really is the case , the academicism of horror will have triumphed , the profane art of modernity bowing down before the sacred art of conformism , its primacy , a conformism that always spawns ordinary everyday fascism
gavroche dived back into the dark
no tongue could tell all that this word , woman , contained , uttered the way it was by that child
in those paintings , a host of small regular luminous splotches of colour are spread in rows over a dark background , at will , figuring the spiritual tension of an abstract homage to the soldier priest helder camarra , or sketching the teeming favelas of his homeland
i swore i ’ d go through fire , not water
dear boy , you give me such a headache
a few pages of history
to do your culp you prostrated yourself flat on your face in front of the prioress until she , who was never referred to as anything other than our mother , alerted the culprit , by a little rap on the wood of her stall , that she could get up
all of a sudden , between two shots , they heard the distant sound of the hour striking
it was concluded that he must have had some connection to the venerable bishop
the pigsty he had a bird ’ s-eye view of at that moment was abject , dirty , fetid , putrid , dark , sordid
nothing else for it !
cosette continued to pluck her daisies attentively ; she seemed to be thinking about something , but it must have been something lovely ; all of a sudden she turned her head back over her shoulder as delicately and slowly as a swan and shot jean valjean a question : father , what are they , actually , these galleys ?
monsieur le maire , allow—
tholomyès went on : quirites , gentlemen , caballeros , mes amis !
he knocks a second time
mother thénardier had one of those radiant flushes that unexpected flashes of talent will spur in a person
fauchelevent repeated : i ’ m paying !
their tall stature and their enormous fists were no less disturbing than their sinister stealth in the darkness
after getting his breath for a few minutes , he turned round to where the shooting was raging , brought his left hand up to his nose and thrust it forward three times while smacking the back of his head with his right hand ; a sovereign gesture in which the parisian gamin has condensed all french irony and which is obviously effective since it has already lasted half a century
i ’ ll give you a bullet !
it makes you think of a mole crying out : i pity them , with their sun !
trivia fiends , who collect anecdotes the way herbalists collect dried flowers and prick fleeting dates on their memories with a pin , know that in the last century , in paris , around number , there were two public prosecutors at châtelet , number one known as corbeau , the crow , the other , renard , the fox
having been soaked by the rain , they were walking along the paths on the sunny side , the older one leading the little one ; they were pale and in rags and they looked like wild birds
it ’ s enough to make you shudder , i know !
he spoke to him of the highest truths , which are the simplest ones
never joy , always ecstasy
there is a point where digging any deeper means being entombed and where the light is completely extinguished
and yet it is true ; gravediggers themselves die
i go off on my own when i feel like it , sometimes i sleep in a ditch
of course , you can make mistakes there , and do make mistakes ; but error is venerable there , for it involves so much heroism
i the issue on the surface
all eyes sought monsieur fauchelevent
marius replied rudely , now that he ’ d begun to notice that this police spy had still not had the courtesy to refer to him as monsieur
we don ’ t say home , we say digs
and then , you must have cashmeres
the old woman did , in fact , have a kind of wicker cariole in her shed
as he was leaving them , he arranged to meet them that same evening at the same place , and had left them with these words by way of goodbye : i ’ m going to beat it , in other words , i ’ m taking off , or , as they say at court , i ’ ll skedaddle
this has often been the mistake of the bourgeoisie
it was the jondrette girl
the garden was absolutely still , and all you could see of the street was deserted as always
what is there against him ?
they worked up the script
now , toussaint , as though predestined to be jean valjean ’ s servant , was not curious
there was a holy alliancenumber—the belle-alliance that the fatal field of waterloo foretold
the point from which he viewed all things was shifting once more
i must have had a hallucination
sweat trickled down his forehead
he wore a horrible old yellow redingote worth several millions , since the lining was stuffed with banknotes
you lived in death
fancy letting a man like that come into your home !
in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris
i say , dear bishop , why don ’ t we get right down to it
the man from the funeral parlour went and had a word with the cemetery gatekeeper
you can ’ t hear a thing down at the bottom of the garden
no doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little savoyard
the fact is that , if he had only gone a bit further into the cul-de-sac genrot , he probably would have—and he would have been finished
some ugly tart that ’ d make you shudder , i ’ ll warrant !
to see cosette , to forget by her side , was so sweet to him !
after quite a while , not hearing another sound , he turned round without making any noise and , just as he was raising his eyes to the door of his room , he saw a light through the keyhole
he thought no more of the girl now that she was beautiful than he had thought of her when she was ugly
hitched to a cabriolet ?
sometimes it is a defect
hougoumont , said the peasant woman
as he spoke , he had bent down to tie up a branch of the rhododendron and he went on : wait , i remember now
she went on : all i have to do is scream , they ’ ll come running , whoosh !
the pedestrian coming from the rue saint-denis and going into the rue de la chanvrerie saw it gradually shrivel away in front of him as though he had stepped into an elongated funnel
this anguish melded with the horror she felt at being alone in the woods at night
the conventionist , on the other hand , gazed at him with a humble congeniality in which one might have discerned , perhaps , the humility that is appropriate when a person is so close to returning to dust
jean valjean saw the problem
in his heart of hearts , this prodigious captain was the man who , in his report on aboukirnumber to the directoire , had said : this cannonball of ours killed six men
why are they like this ?
his reply was sharp and angry : as you can see , my good woman , i ’ m trying to sleep
he could well infect you by contagion with incurable poverty , numbing of the joints used for climbing the ladder , and , in short , a tad more renunciation than you ’ d like
but this is where the question returned : uphill or downhill ?
he had learned german and english ; thanks to courfeyrac , who had put him in touch with his friend the bookseller , marius played , in the literary section of the bookshop , the modest role of hack
it was the end of the dictatorship
the middle ages aside , asia aside , the historic and political question left open , from a purely philosophical point of view , beyond the requirements of some militant polemics , on the condition that the monastery be absolutely voluntary and shut in only consenting adults , i will always look upon the cloistered community with a certain attentive and , in some respects , deferential gravity
woman has been left out
in an instant , a fiacre was at the door
as they do the monumental spaces of the mediter- ranean ?
all at once the idea that the stone had not come and sat on the bench on its own , that someone had put it there , came to her and frightened her
the wall above which he could see the linden tree and the ivy obviously enclosed a garden where he could at least take cover , even though there were still no leaves on the trees , and spend the rest of the night
because i thought as you did
then again , she felt safe , since she was with him
i believe the lark truly is your daughter , and it seems only natural that you should hold on to her
yes , for anyone other than jean valjean
not counting the ravishing chimes that it scattered into the air all the time without anyone knowing why
the glance has been so abused in love stories that we have ended up discounting it
net result : i ’ m riled
the officer went on : look in my pockets
as he had guessed , there was a building there and its roof sloped steeply downward from the top of the wooden cladding to just above the ground , on a fairly gentle inclined plane , just touching the linden tree
the sweet month of april to gorgeous may
then , still caught up in her ballad , she sang through clenched teeth :
will monsieur have supper ?
these bare feet , these bare arms , these rags , this ignorance , this abjectness , this darkness , can be put to work in the conquest of the ideal
the reel on which the rope was wound was housed beneath the lantern in a little iron box
for six weeks he had lived , as we said , outside life ; those words—going away ! —brought him down to earth with a thud
man is the eel
all four girls were deliriously pretty
supposing that some living being had been so fabulously thin as to even be able to think about getting in or out through the square hole , the grate would have prevented them from doing so
while this was going on the man didn ’ t pay much attention
he performed a whole host of good deeds as secretly as other people conceal bad deeds
as for other duties , the bishop found them listed and prescribed in other places ; those of sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans ; those of magistrates , wives , mothers , and young men by saint peter ; those of husbands , children , and servants in the epistle to the ephesians ; those of the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews ; and those of virgins in the epistle to the corinthians
you don ’ t let go of a mystery once you ’ ve got hold of one
a few feats of arms were serious ; the taking of the trocadero , for example , was a fine military campaign ; but on the whole , we repeat , the trumpets of this war produced a tinny sound , the ensemble was suspect , and history backs france in her difficulty in accepting this false triumph
the priest was , so they said , a worthy and respectable gent , one who gave good advice
the garden ran alongside a lonely unpaved laneway that was bordered with bushes for want of houses ; a hedge separated the garden from the lane
these fifty men were expecting sixty thousand
i certainly am , monsieur
the abbé grégoire , number ex-bishop , ex-conventionist , ex-senator , acquired the status of the infamous grégoire in royalist polemics
it seems likely that this vanishing of the hell behind us is part and parcel of arriving in paradise
why won ’ t anyone give me a musket ?
in spring , the light shines in sad souls just as it shines in caves at midday
it appears he took a bath in the seine without being aware of doing so
the statistics show that the mortality rate among abandoned infants is fifty-five percent
the second was straight , firm , slight
reproaches made tonelessly by a dying man to a corpse
snorted thénardier , pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand francs
it was indeed that poor girl
nothing more in the street , nothing more in the garden
where are they going ?
you ’ re the one who should go , replied the man
he did not understand any of this and believed himself to have been short-changed—let ’ s not mince words , robbed
all his blood rushed to his heart
you ’ re little , said enjolras
sometimes the old man would add : good god !
the storm of battle still lingers in this courtyard ; the horror is visible there , the reversal of the fray has turned to stone ; it lives , it dies , it was yesterday
they entrusted him to god
had married , in our happy couple ,
at the site of these writings your generous soul will be moved by a feeling of markt benevolence , for true philosophers always experience lively emotions
for instance , what i could do is come in the evening , when night is about to fall
he bent down and picked it up
two fauchelevent brothers had been gardeners at the petit-picpus convent
the caribbeansnumber leave nothing but the bones , the dancers leave nothing but the shells
i i despite magritte and a handful of others , commercial imagery - verbal art , visual art - would wreak the havoc we are all too familiar with yet which has for some reason provoked less of an outcry than that wreaked by 'socialist realism ' , the official art of the defunct soviet union the comic strip
dying a holy death is now forbidden
good arrangement for one , good investment for the other
the shock stopped both the cart and the orator in their tracks
was he concentric to the felony and repression ?
he did not hesitate
it knows nothing about what is rich , it knows nothing about what is noble
and while her mouth thanked mother thénardier , her whole little heart thanked the traveller
somebody had carried him from les halles quartier to the champs-élysées
show me where you are going
so , i ’ ve taken my secret and i ’ ve brought it to you
where ’ s he got to ?
the certainty of at last holding jean valjean in his hands , captive , sent all that he had in his soul rushing over his physiognomy
it seems the thread he thought he held had snapped
a tiger attacking a wild ass , a spider attacking a fly
he was benevolent , brusque , charitable , and if he had been rich , he would have tended to the lavish
you can tell us all about it by letter
it represented one tiny moment grappling with centuries of monarchy on the one hand and , on the other , eternal right
no thinker worth his salt would dare claim that the scent of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations
all around the tulip beds the bees whirled , sparks from the flame-flowers
javert poked his head over and looked
the first thing to go was craftsmanship , a victim of ind ustrial manufacturing from the eighteenth century onwards
marius engaged in sad conjecture ; he did not dare keep watch over the porte cochère during the day
there , they pronounce jean as chan , so he ’ s known as chan mathieu
now let ’ s cover his corpse and let every one of us defend this old man dead the way he would defend his father alive , and let his presence in our midst make the barricade unassailable !
mademoiselle baptistine told what happened at the bishop ’ s place that night so many times afterwards that there are still people living who remember it down to the last detail
the hive of joy opened and each one of them brought their honey
the gamin came running at the sound of marius ’ s voice , with his face full of joy and devotion
scotland has its trios of witches , number but paris has its quartets of gossips ; and the thou shalt be king hereafter , hurled at macbeth on the heath at armuyr , would be just as ominous hurled at bonaparte in baudoyer square
there are beings who , to find the answer to such teasing riddles , about which , furthermore , they don ’ t actually give a fig , spend more money , devote more time , go to much more trouble than ten good deeds would require ; and do so gratuitously , just for the hell of it , without being rewarded for their curiosity except by curiosity itself
hercules yourselves , are you ?
marius ’ s erstwhile sense of distance from this man , from this fauchelevent–cum–jean valjean , was now mixed with horror
did you sleep badly ?
marius pulled his head away from his grandfather and said , softly : but , father , now that i ’ m doing so well , it seems to me i could be allowed to see her
he saw , a few feet away , at the base of the small roadblock so mercilessly guarded and watched from outside , under a collapsed heap of cobblestones that partly hid it , an iron grate lying down flat , level with the ground
will you come back again , doctor ?
what does she expect us to do with her seven francs ?
i must leave you
the kid ’ s profound observation brought montparnasse back to calm and common sense
is there anyone here who ’ s got the back and the heart for it ?
son of a fathernumber to whom history will certainly grant extenuating circumstances , but just as worthy of esteem as that father had been worthy of blame ; having every private virtue and several public virtues ; mindful of his health , his fortune , his person , his affairs ; knowing the cost of a minute and not always the cost of a year ; sober , serene , peace-loving , patient , a good man and a good prince ; sleeping with his wife and having lackeys in his palace whose job it was to show the conjugal bed to the bourgeois , an ostentation of regular intimacy that had become useful after the old illegitimate displays of the elder branch of the family ; knowing all the languages of europe and , what is rarer still , all the languages of all the interests , and speaking them fluently ; admirable representative of the middle class , but outdistancing it and in every way greater than it ; having the excellent sense , even while appreciating the blood from which he sprang , to esteem himself for his intrinsic worth , and on the very particular question of his race , declaring himself orléans and not bourbon ; very much the first prince of the bloodnumber as long as he had been only a most serene highness , but an honest bourgeois the day he became majesty ; diffuse in public , concise at home ; a declared , but not proven , miser , and at bottom , one of those economical types who are easily moved to extravagance when the whim or duty takes them ; literate yet not too fussed about literature ; a gentleman , but not a knight ; simple , steady , and strong ; adored by his family and by his household ; a winning conversationalist ; a savvy statesman , cold inside , ruled by the immediate interest , always sailing close to the wind , incapable of rancour or gratitude , pitilessly wearing out his superiority on mediocrities , skilled at proving wrong through parliamentary majorities , those mysterious unanimities that grumble quietly beneath thrones ; expansive , sometimes imprudent in his expansiveness , but showing marvellous adroitness in this imprudence ; rich in expedients , faces , masks ; frightening france with europe and frightening europe with france ; incontestably loving his country but preferring his family ; prizing domination more than authority and authority more than dignity , a disposition that is disastrous in that , by turning everything toward success , it accepts ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness , but profitable in that it preserves politics from violent clashes , the state from fractures , and society from disasters ; meticulous , proper , vigilant , attentive , sagacious , indefatigable ; contradicting himself sometimes , and giving himself the lie ; daring against austria at ancona , relentless against england in spain , bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard ; number singing the marseillaise with conviction ; impervious to despondency , to world-weariness , to any yen for the beautiful and the ideal , to reckless generosity , to any utopia , to any chimera , to anger , to vanity , to fear ; having every form of personal fearlessness , a general at valmy , a soldier at jemappes ; number having had brushes with death by regicide eight times and still smiling ; brave as a grenadier , courageous as a thinker ; anxious only when faced with the chances of a european uprising , yet unfit for the great political adventures ; always ready to risk his life , never his life ’ s work ; disguising his will as influence in order to be obeyed as an intelligent man rather than as king ; endowed with powers of observation but not divination ; taking little notice of minds but knowing a lot about men , that is , needing to see in order to judge ; prompt and penetrating common sense , practical wisdom , ready speech , prodigious memory ; delving endlessly into that memory , his sole point of resemblance to caesar , alexander , and napoléon ; knowing the facts , the details , the dates , the proper names ; ignorant of the tendencies , the passions , the diverse genies of the teeming hordes , the inner aspirations , the hidden and obscure upheavals of souls , in a word , all that might be called the invisible currents of people ’ s consciences ; a bit out of touch with the france below the surface ; getting by on finesse ; ruling too much and not reigning enough ; his own prime minister unto himself ; excelling at making the pettiness of daily reality a bulwark against the immensity of ideas ; adding to a real creative faculty for civilization , order , and organization some indefinable spirit of procedure and chicanery ; founder and lawmaker of a dynasty ; having something of charlemagne about him and something of an attorney—all in all , a lofty and original character , a prince who knew how to govern with authority in spite of france ’ s anxiety and how to hold on to power in spite of europe ’ s jealousy
with his crimped and pomaded hair , his pinched waist , his womanly hips , and the bust of a prussian officer , surrounded by the murmur of admiration of the girls on the boulevard , his tie suavely knotted , a club in his pocket and a flower in his buttonhole ; such was this fop of the house of death
i think i ’ m not mistaken and that those are the names my brother mentioned
in this deathly valley , at the foot of the slope the cuirassiers had scaled , now flooded by the masses of the english , under the converging fire of the artillery of the victorious enemy , under a frightening rain of projectiles , this square fought on
i have been to the auvergne , i have been to faverolles , sure !
all of it was black
my friends , every new bridegroom should be a prince aldobrandininumber take advantage of this one minute of your life to soar off into the empyrean with the swans and the eagles , even if it means dropping back down into the bourgeois world of frogs the next day
two days of pine cones !
he was like the village idiot in the presence of all these fine minds ranged in battle around him—or like a foreigner in the midst of this society that had him by the throat
if he hadn ’ t found the bundle of letters by accident , it would have looked like a hoax
you ’ re not nearly as ugly
thénardier had something stiff in his movements , which reminded you of the barracks when he swore or of the seminary when he made the sign of the cross
he resumed his dark dialogue with himself
i run into you here on the stairs and then i see you visiting a man named father mabeuf who lives over austerlitz way , sometimes , when i ’ m out walking around there
a grate slid open
she did everything around the place , the beds , the rooms , the washing , the cooking , whatever , she ruled the roost and called all the shots
when he had just got out of that ugly , dark , deforming place we call jail , the bishop had wounded his soul the way a sudden flash of blinding light would have hurt his eyes coming out of the dark
while he was carrying marius in this fashion , jean valjean slipped a hand under his clothes , which were pretty much torn to shreds , and felt his chest to reassure himself that his heart was still beating
and now , monsieur , picture this : i said nothing , i remained monsieur fauchelevent , i took my place among you , i am part of the family , i ’ m in my room , i come down and have breakfast in the morning in my slippers , in the evening we go off to a show together , the three of us , i accompany madame pontmercy to the tuileries and to the place royale , we are together , you think of me as the same as you ; one fine day , i ’ m here , you ’ re here , we ’ re chatting away , we ’ re laughing , suddenly you hear a voice shout : jean valjean !
you have all kinds of pet names for it : bottom of the soup , crankypants , the mother in the blue yonder ( in the sky ) , the last mouthful , etc , etc
otherwise he did not come up with a sou more than the thirty francs
those of yesterday are ghosts ; those of tomorrow are spectral larvae
since number , there had been small halfhearted riots here and there , swiftly put down but breaking out again , a sign of a vast underlying conflagration
how can we fail to see that the mask of modernism has been concealing the most classic academicism : that of an endlessl ) ' reproduced standardization of opinion , the duplication of 'bad feelings ' identically reproducing the duplication of the 'good feelings ' of the official art of yore ?
nothing could be more touching than to see him handing the patient a cup of herbal tea with his slight senile tremor
i am , with the distinguished consideration that we owe the benefactors of humanity ,
they had the effect on him of an apparition seen in a flash of lightning
from that moment , he became more gentle and fraternal than ever toward the little children and the suffering
suddenly the crowd gave a great cry
there in the gloaming , it seemed to be a sort of apparition
utopia today , flesh and blood tomorrow
when he had run into jean valjean so unexpectedly on the bank of the seine , he had felt something like a wolf catching its prey again—but also like a dog that once more finds his master
the opéra danseuses are rose-pink cannibalsnumber they don ’ t eat men , they bleed them dry
hello , my good man , said jean valjean resolutely , handing him a sou
they conferred on the necessity of seizing the person of monsieur le maire of montreuil-sur-mer
king louis xviii , considering as null and void anything that had been done in the hundred days , recognized neither his standing as officer of the légion d ’ honneur , nor his rank as colonel , nor his title as baronnumber he , for his part , never missed an opportunity to sign himself colonel baron pontmercy
they were dignified , but they were not august
it ’ s the end of the world
this red flag kicked up a storm and disappeared into it
after about three hundred feet , he reached a point where the street forked
they say it ’ s quite a grotto
if she does not see monsieur le maire before then , she went on timidly , she won ’ t know monsieur le maire is back ; it will be easy to make her be patient and when the child arrives she will naturally think monsieur le maire has arrived with the child
he drags it around with him and he yields to it
what was coming to fruition there ?
but what does that matter to eternity ?
this is one of the ultimate forms of happiness
what are you doing here ?
it ’ s true , he said , the two of you together , that ’ s all you ’ re good for
this bizarre espalier with branches of metal and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean
it does indeed feel like a sort of horrible animal of the night that has just been dragged out of its cesspool
it was of very fine cambric and they made out at one of the least worn corners a heraldic crown embroidered above these seven letters : lavbesp
the army was mined at the same time as the general population , as was later proved by the belfort , lunéville , and épinal movementsnumber they were counting on the numbernd regiment , on the numberth , on the numberth , on the numberth , on the numberth light
and i did tell him the last door on the right at the end of the hall
he stayed in his backyard , like the dog
it ’ s taken care of , i tell you
i was once a french soldier , i ’ m a blasted veteran , i ought to be decorated !
and i , monsieur le maire , don ’ t know what i am seeing
it was cordoned off from the rue du parc-royal on
this school , whose pseudoprofundity is all on the surface , dissects effects without going back as far as causes , and rails against the tumult of the marketplace from the height of its pseudoscience
when playtime was over and cosette had gone back in , jean valjean would watch the windows of her classroom and at night he would get out of bed to watch the windows of the dormitory where she slept
you don ’ t go in too hard ; you don ’ t go asking for trouble ; no talk of a wedding and monsieur le maire and his sash
even though no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy , no more in circumscribing the cause than in limiting the effect , the contemplator falls into endless raptures at all these breakdowns of forces that end in unity
rain had swollen the river
in the rue boucherat , rue de normandie , and rue de saintonge , there are still a few old residents around who remember a gentleman called monsieur gillenormand and who speak of him favourably
no , it ’ s not good
he didn ’ t have any kind of bag , but obviously had big pockets under his greatcoat
he ’ s wearing black for the bishop of digne , said the drawing rooms ; it elevated monsieur madeleine enormously and gave him , suddenly and immediately , a certain standing in the noble world of montreuil-sur-mer
then she continued , raking her bitter flaming ghost ’ s eyes over the rest of the crooks : what ’ s it to me if they scrape me off the pavement in the rue plumet tomorrow , hacked to death by my own father—or if they find me in a year ’ s time in a ditch in saint-cloud or on the île des cygnesnumber in among all the rotten old cork floats and drowned dogs !
a separate path ran around the outer edge of the garden and along the white wall that enclosed it
bullets ricocheted off the cornices of the houses , bored into the barricade , and wounded several men
we chip away as best we can at the mysterious block of marble our lives are made of—in vain ; the black vein of destiny always reappears
how gloomy my life has become !
why didn ’ t the man reappear ?
at that instant , he seemed to hear a voice crying out inside him : jean valjean !
there is not a hint of respect for any of this in the contemporary trials : 'when will the nuremburg code be applied to medically assisted procreation
his daughter appeared , then the servants
but what i do know is that there has never been anything but miserable bastards among all those sorts of scum !
get out of there , he ’ s dead , dead as a doornail
she was also as terrified as a person can be by happiness
and where is the public prosecutor to be tried ?
on top of that , he had himself revealed his situation of his own accord
courfeyrac pulled a mattress off his bed , which had two of them , laid it on the floor , and said : there you go
and you know what else ?
an enormous battery was hidden by sacks of dirt at the spot that is today known as the waterloo museum
the latter spelling would put paid to the pretensions entertained , last century , by the vicomte de gestasnumber of being a descendant of the unrepentant robber
cosette and jean valjean fell to their knees
nothing of such a fantasy could have any bearing on cosette , who was as pure as a lily
she lifted a bare arm and clung to the damper handle of the stove as though feeling not too steady on her feet
i have a choice
the rule comes first ; as for the civil code , we ’ ll see
this explains war , made by humanity against humanity in spite of humanity
i didn ’ t say anything
this was a separate building with a garden where all kinds of old nuns of different orders lived together , remnants of cloisters destroyed by the revolution ; a gathering of every shade of black , grey , and white , of every possible community and every possible stripe and that we might call , if such a coupling of words is permissible , a sort of harlequin convent
he tried again to disengage the chain from the well and could not do it
the grandfather stuck to his infallible diagnosis : in love !
but , well , enjolras doesn ’ t have a woman
there was something unknowable about thénardier the man , whence his absolute hold over the woman
the man plunged into the woods with the child , leaving the innkeeper motionless and speechless
the emperor had joked with ney , who said : wellington would not be so silly as to wait for your majesty
he stepped into the mire
at a quarter past four , that is , when night had fallen , he went past the porte saint-martin theatre , where the play they were putting on that day was the two convictsnumber the poster , lit up by the lights of the theatre , struck him even though he was walking fast , and he stopped to read it
monsieur leblanc took up the pen
the preliminary investigation was under way
in number , digne , which had sustained sieges in the wars of religion , number was still surrounded by ancient walls flanked by square towers that have since been demolished
one fine day , hucheloup decided the time had come to alert the passing trade to his specialty ; he dipped a brush into a pot of black and as his spelling was peculiar to him , just like his cooking , he improvised on a wall outside this remarkable inscription :
last flickerings of a lamp with no oil
to sum up , that despot , the cannon , can ’ t do all it would like to ; strength is a great weakness
thénardier replied coldly : that ’ s what you think !
god subordinated to the police commissioner
he came and went this way five or six times on his walk and he did the walk five or six times a week without their reaching the point of exchanging greetings
sometimes he would stand for half an hour at a stretch without moving in the shadow of some leonidas or spartacus , number holding a book while his eyes , gently raised , sought the beautiful girl over the top of it and she , for her part , would turn her lovely head toward him with a vague smile
case of being caught red-handed in the act of murder , if ever there was one
people were transformed , almost without suspecting it , by the very movement of time
cosette had a small side pocket in her smock ; she took the piece without a word and put it in her pocket
when he looked up again , there was no one in sight
made trouble for him in a tweak :
the band was growing by the second
that ’ s enough , said cosette
like everyone else , he was an -ist , without which no one in those days could have survived , but he was neither a royalist nor a bonapartist , nor a chartist , nor an orléanist , nor an anarchist ; he was a bouquiniste , devoted to old books
that had replaced the long live the emperor !
where does he want me to get them from ?
fancy sending me packing when i haven ’ t seen you for four months already and i ’ ve hardly had time to give you a kiss
i ’ ll go and see
when i return you can give me my money back
out of hatred for me !
and what about him ?
let ’ s have a peek at what grantaire is up to and how far he ’ s got
and why does god will it ?
it is one of those sins that look very much like a duty
as he read , father mabeuf was looking over the book in hand at his plants , among others a magnificent rhododendron that was one of his consolations ; four days of dryness , of sun and wind , without a drop of rain , had just passed ; the branches were hanging down , the buds drooping , the leaves dropping , everything needed watering ; the rhododendron especially was sad
at the time , the north end of the rue saint-louis was being repaved
nasty people enjoy a grim satisfaction
take advantage of this opportunity
as he reached this phase in the assistance he was offering the dying man , the officer opened his eyes
then his eyes returned to himself , falling on his puny arms and his bony hands
in the evening after dinner , she quite often worked on a tapestry in the salon , or on some other dainty work she ’ d been taught in the convent , while jean valjean sat reading beside her
the moon cast a bright light over this square
in that epidemic , mother magnon had lost her two boys the same day , one in the morning , the other in the evening , when they were still mere toddlers
every bit of the filth of civilization , once it is of no more use , falls into this pit of truth where the immense social slide ends ; it is swallowed up in it , but on display
she regularly went to church services , said her rosary , read her prayer book , which she called a euchologion , whispered avesnumber in one corner of the house while they were whispering i love yous in the other , looked on marius and cosette as two shadows
and yourself with it !
he jumped down from the chest of drawers and grabbed his hat
it almost hurt him physically
by virtue of what right ?
among the visitandines , the nun entering says ave maria and the nun whose place is being entered says gratia plena
my dear montparnasse , éponine replied very sweetly , you must learn to trust people
all salt is drying
they all rushed inside
skepticism , that dry rot of the intellect , had not left one intact idea in his head
when the restoration came , she turned herself into a bigotnumber and with such verve that the priests forgave her her monk
i have to choose between the pen and the pick
that ’ s right , twenty-one years old , no standing , twelve hundred livres a year , madame la baronne pontmercy will go and ask for two sous ’ worth of parsley at the fruit-seller ’ s
the thinkers pondered while the grass roots , meaning the people , run through by revolutionary currents , trembled beneath them with who-knows-what epileptic shocks
he has no intention of being a saddle horse
so this is how you spruce yourself up for the fine eyes of this general lamarque !
only the top of the façade of corinthe suffered ; the crossbar on the upper-storey casement and the attics in the roof , riddled with buckshot and biscayens , slowly warped
the paris kid isn ’ t knocked up out of damp chaff , added brujon
they didn ’ t see that they were in the same hands that had cleared napoléon out
jean valjean , in black , followed behind , smiling
the same could not be said for dahlia , zéphine , and especially not favourite
in any case , you must see that i am well informed
he arrived just in time to see an arm shooting through the hole punched into the wire-meshed glass
it ’ s a matter of going back over all the seams we have sewn and seeing if they hold
if the facts did their duty , they would stick to being evidence in law ; the facts are god-given
what is the world coming to ?
you could tell by the perpendicular wrinkles
there is only one way to reject tomorrow and that is to die
the curious laugh and chatter two feet away from these streets full of war ; the theatres open their doors and perform vaudeville
the man was lost
the cuirassiers had not succeeded in the sense that the centre was not overrun
there was a stone nearby
everything we have just said has to be set aside when we consider that extraordinary riot in which you felt the sacred anxiety of labour reclaiming its rights
in any case , everything had broken down and new things had to be made out of the fragments
this occurred in cosette ’ s bedroom
the lawyer had accordingly begun by expatiating on the theft of the apples—something difficult enough to do in the grandiloquent manner , but bénigne bossuetnumber himself was once forced to refer to a hen in the middle of a funeral oration and he carried it off with alacrity
one of the thénardiers ’ neighbours met the young mother as she was setting out and he came back with the tale : i ’ ve just seen a girl sobbing her heart out in the street
and that woman who has suffered so much , who was so noble in her fall from grace … i was the cause of her downfall , albeit unwittingly !
marius followed the rue saint-honoré
this little madam , not even two months ago , was sitting pretty in a garret , fitting the little copper rings in the eyeholes of corsets , what do you call those things ?
he seemed glad to take as meditative texts those funereal psalms that are full of visions of another world
any talk in the street inevitably gathers a circle of people
history has nothing more moving than this death rattle bursting out into acclamation
marius shuddered from head to toe
the last was guy-étienne-alexandre and he was a colonel and something or other in the light horse of brittany
the paper caught fire
jean valjean went on : the only thing that worries me is what happens in the cemetery
he had not eaten or slept for thirty-six hours
elsewhere prisoners lay in the open air in the prison yards , piled on top of each other
for him , the idea of life itself could not be separated from the idea of cosette ; he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept one without the other and he was unshakably determined to demand of anyone or anything that wanted to force him to live , whoever and whatever they might be—his grandfather , fate , hell—the restitution of his lost eden
he leaped down from the tilbury
of this man , who was his saviour , nothing ; not a trace ; not the slightest sign
the man continued in a tone of voice he hoped sounded casual , but in which there was an odd tremor he could not hide : what does she do , your madame thénardier ?
it has never been interested in what was said inside
on the other hand , this long illness and convalescence saved him from prosecution
that history , made from the very traces those memorable men chose to leave , was now opposed by a history made from traces no one chose as such , the silent testimonies of ordinary life
no one knew what it meant
every last branch can turn into a dynasty
you could say that amazement has its flashes of insight
both of us may benefit
who among us is without sin ?
but we are not living in normal times
he believed himself to have been tracked down and pursued
they are as carefree and indolent as cats
to start with , that other thing was a fright , this one isn ’ t too bad !
he could not make sense of what was happening to him
we ’ ve got him , this croesus ! number as good as
hey you , where ’ ve you come from ?
an apple is a meal in itself ; an apple is life
death of a horse
but what was june number , when it all comes down to it ?
half of the cuirassiers stayed on the plateau
oh , the young people of today , they ’ re scoundrels , every one of them !
she reckoned that when she was young , the bernardines were right up therenumber with the musketeers
it ’ s the thénardiers , they ’ re innkeepers , peasants , you can ’ t reason with them
at last , where three paths intersected , he stopped
he was sure of success ; all he had to do now was close his hand
good or evil are behind the stern question mark
parisians today who enter the rue rambuteau coming from les halles and notice , on their right , opposite the rue mondétour , a basket weaver ’ s shop whose sign is a basket in the shape of the emperor , napoléon the great , with this inscription :
until that day , javert had only ever adopted , of napoléon ’ s two poses , the one that expresses resolution , arms folded over the chest ; the one that expresses uncertainty , hands behind the back , was unknown to him
at bottom , martainvillenumber was a jacobin
the voice given by the camera to the peasant women of efremov , at the very moment when it shows their historic dignity , sends them back to their non-being
there are two of us here who will have only one thought from now on—your happiness !
if he was a murderer , would i save him ?
the old woman did the housework and the cooking and the shopping
she was some months behind
what i ’ m thinking is this : that god can ’ t possibly want to separate us
the lovers saw each other every day
this had already been done
while cosette was still tiny , she was the whipping boy , so to speak , of the other two girls ; as soon as she began to grow , that is , even before she was five , she became the drudge for the entire household
we might say , by the way , that success is pretty awful
yes , that ’ s the way !
the marauders flew off to one corner of the battlefield while they were being shot in another
whoever sees it quakes in their boots with the most mysterious of terrors
and alongside all this—all such contradictions are the lightning play of love—they liked to laugh and with such delightful abandon and such intimacy that they sometimes seemed almost like two boys
the event is always resistance , between what the speech-act seizes and what the earth buries
one evening , marius was talking , in front of cosette and jean valjean , about the whole peculiar episode , of the endless information he had gathered , and the pointlessness of his efforts
a good hour passed in this way
before we go any further , it would be appropriate to recount in some detail a weird incident that happened at montfermeil around the same time and that may not be purely coincidental to certain conjectures of the public prosecutor ’ s department
jean valjean cocked an ear and heard something like footsteps receding
once this commitment was made , a man seated in a corner of the cabaret put on a ringing voice and boomed , you know what you ’ re saying !
wherever it hurts , we probe ; and , once we ’ ve diagnosed the trouble , studying the cause leads to discovery of the remedy
sometimes the boarders were allowed , as a major excursion , to go and visit them , which means that those young minds have retained , among other memories , the memory of mother saint basil , mother saint scolastique , and mother jacob
yet sundry complications were looming
one broken baluster stands on its shaft like a broken leg
mademoiselle baptistine also had a huge bergèrenumber in her room made of wood that had once been gilt and covered in a soft floral pekin silk , but this bergère had had to be winched up to her room upstairs through the window , as the stairway was too narrow , and so it could not be counted among the movable furniture
the closer he got to that street corner , the brighter his eyes would grow ; a sort of joy would light up his pupils like an inner dawn ; he looked fascinated and overcome with emotion , his lips would move slightly , as though he were talking to someone he could not see , he would smile vaguely and slow his pace to a crawl
you are allowed to spy on misfortune as a traitor if you are going to relieve it
paris begins with the dawdling onlooker and ends with the gamin , two beings that no other town is capable of ; the passive acceptance that makes a person happy just to look on , and inexhaustible initiative ; prudhomme and fouillounumber paris alone boasts such native fauna
besides , let ’ s admit it , this same small world had its grandeur
fameuil and dahlia were humming ; tholomyès was drinking ; zéphine was giggling ; fantine smiled
one morning the hotelkeeper sailed into marius ’ s room and said : monsieur courfeyrac has vouched for you
a few people , though , remained curious , thinking that what might be involved in the whole business was not the fabulous treasure of legend , but a real windfall , a lot more serious and substantial than the devil ’ s banknotes , and whose secret boulatruelle had half-gleaned
that ’ s all … so , madame , he added , what do i owe ?
it was as though a ray of sunshine had gone astray and , without realizing it , had flashed through the night
the rim of the hole in the ceiling was soon surrounded by the heads of the dead from which long lines of blood streamed , red and fuming
this painting you see here , which was painted by david at bruqueselles , number do you know who it ’ s a painting of ?
it was a blissful summer morning , marius was full of joy as you are on a beautiful day
what ’ s going to become of you ?
to these points and to this testimony the attorney could only oppose his client ’ s denial , a self-interested denial ; but supposing he were the convict jean valjean—did that prove that he was the stealer of the apples ?
this was the terror of that poor creature that the reader has perhaps not forgotten—little cosette
there was a mirror above the bar
he ’ d stick an old chatterbox like me in his poem and he ’ d call him nestornumber my friends , in the old days , in the good old days , they knew how to marry ; they ’ d have a good solid contractnumber and after that a good solid spread
some time around number , in an arrondissement of the pas-de-calais , there was a man who had had some kind of scrape with the law some time before and who , under the name of monsieur madeleine , got back on his feet and rehabilitated himself
on the other hand , lit up from the front by the light coming through the gate which shone full in his face , the light of a cellar , it is true , livid but sharp in its lividity , thénardier , as the lively if trite metaphor has it , stood out plain as day to jean valjean
napoléon , two miles , wellington , a mile and a half ; seventy-two thousand combatants on each side
she had all the fears of a convent girl and all the fears of a nun combined
if this bastard doesn ’ t show up !
she didn ’ t pose herself any questions about the weirdness of a chimney pot that is afraid of being caught in the act and darts back when you look at its shadow , for the shadow had leaped back when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought she was quite sure of that
it was the sparrow pecking at the hunters
it ’ s usually daybreak that you die
we say to ourselves , we talk to ourselves , we cry out inside ourselves , without the outer silence being broken
he had lurched from one suffering to the next and had gradually arrived at the conviction that life was a war ; and that in this war he was the vanquished
i think it ’ s wonderful that a young man like you should be in love
she picked up a man , the first man who happened along , a man she did not love , out of bravado , with rage in her heart
yes , these are ghastly times , ghastly , ghastly , and here is what i think of you , of your ideas , of your systems , of your masters , of your oracles , of your doctors , of your little pipsqueaks of writers , of your weasels of philosophers , and of all the revolutions that have terrified the flocks of crows in the tuileries for the last sixty years !
here stands another door before us , on the threshold of which we hesitate
the battle of marengo copies the battle of pydna ; number clovis ’ s tolbiacnumber and napoléon ’ s austerlitz are as alike as two drops of blood
there ’ s only one thing sadder than seeing your children die and that ’ s seeing them go bad
jean valjean took a swig of brandy and felt thoroughly restored
it was not a dream !
only that evening , as cosette was saying good night before going to bed , did he hear her say in a faint little voice as though to herself : i think that if ever i ran into one of those men in a dark alley , my god !
cosette and marius were in one of those blessed selfish moments when you can ’ t see anything but happiness
they were ultra—that is , ultra-royalists ; this word no longer means anything today , although what it represents has not perhaps entirely disappeared
haven ’ t you got a wheel you could sell me ?
it was a huge spider , black , hairy , horrible
he folded his arms , studied the floor at his feet as though he would have liked to disappear through the floorboards into a hole , and his voice suddenly boomed : as a family !
vulgar natures have one thing in common with guileless natures and that is that there is never any transition
monsieur , the elder of the brothers asked gavroche , pointing to the mesh , what is that ?
a bit before this , he had quizzed one of the workers about the daily rate they earned for the job ; they told him that it was thirty sous
he backed off , grumbling between his teeth
cosette had never had a mother
this worthy priest was the brother of a saint-sulpice churchwarden who had several times noticed the man gazing at the child , and the scar on his cheek , and the fat tears in his eyes
that particular day , as soon as she spotted monsieur de rohan , she half-rose and called out loudly in the silence of the chapel : lord !
in a few days , marius was friends with courfeyrac
he saw cosette every day , he felt a sense of paternity stirring and growing inside him more and more , he protected that child with his soul like a brooding hen , he told himself that she was his , that nothing could take her away from him , that this was how it would be forever ; that she would most certainly become a nun , being gently prodded in that direction every day , that accordingly the convent was now the world for her as for him , that he would grow old there and she would grow up there , that she would grow old there and he would die there , that in the end—ravishing hope ! —no separation was thinkable
well , i recognize you !
my only chair has the bottom out of it !
hoche and marceaunumber had no camp followers ; wellington , we gladly do him this justice , had few
and all those fichus that turned to rags !
i ’ m bringing the boy back dead
the decapitated baby jesus , though , was not as lucky as christ
bruneseau had only just got past the first sections of the underground network when eight out of the twenty workers with him refused to go any farther
he felt even the roots of his hair stand on end with the rousing of egotism , and his ego howled in the abyss of his soul
thénardier , for it was indeed he , was strangely taken aback ; he ’ d have been rocked , if that were possible for him
at the mention of waterloo , marius , who was leaning on the table beside a glass of water , took his hand away from under his chin and began to study the room in earnest
don ’ t you want any more ?
only , he feels somehow as though his feet are getting heavier with each step he takes
when they saw the cartridges , there was a shudder among the bravest and a moment of silence
monsieur to a convict is a glass of water to a man shipwrecked on the medusanumber ignominy is thirsty for respect
the fall of the bourbons was full of greatness—not on their side , but on the side of the nation
cardinal fesch refused to step down , so monsieur de pins , archbishop of amasie , took over the administration of the diocese of lyonnumber the fight over the valley of dappesnumber kicked off between france and switzerland with a memo from captain dufour , who was later made a general
monsieur leblanc got to his feet , put his back to the wall , and swiftly ran his eye around the room
monsieur , he said , i must have fifteen hundred francs
monsieur le baron , you have under your roof a thief and a murderer
the night of the second day he was nabbed again
get on with it !
every time our cesspools hiccup , it costs us a thousand francs
i was licking your arse this morning !
to start with , the people don ’ t want anything to do with your republic , they don ’ t want it , they ’ ve got common sense , they know very well that there have always been kings and there always will be , they know very well that the people , after all , are just the people , they laugh at it , your republic , do you hear , you little dimwit !
this point of the seine is dreaded by bargemen
he went to hear low mass every sunday
enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand , just as he had kissed the man ’ s forehead the night before
he finally said it
it doesn ’ t have a mother or a father , i brought her up
you have been abandoned
his name is jean valjean
and he laid his head back on the mat
the reader was one of the big girls , chosen for the week
two fresh children ’ s voices could be heard laughing and babbling in a neighbouring room ; that was éponine and azelma
well , then , asked brujon , the rue p ?
she pulled her hand away and went on , in a tone that would have broken the heart of any observer but that did not remotely move marius , intoxicated , in raptures as he was : oh , how happy you are !
that said , she plonked down on the base of the gate , and began quietly singing :
the assault was so frenzied that for a moment the barricade was overrun with assailants ; but it shook off the soldiers the way a lion shakes off dogs and was covered in besiegers the way a cliff gets covered in foam—only to reappear a second later , sheer , black , and forbidding
a heart under a stone
the swans had not yet reached the brioche
between eleven o ’ clock and midnight , you will come with your iron bar
she added , as though making an effort : the address—you know very well !
the sum , six hundred and thirty thousand francs , all in banknotes , did not take up much space and was contained in only one box
her soul was trembling on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower
we do what we can for her—we ’ re not rich , after all
two hours later , at four o ’ clock , when they came to relieve the conscript , he was found fast asleep , slumped on the ground in a heap next to thénardier ’ s cage
have you come a long way ?
the windbag who did this was a gorgon known as madame victurnien , guardian and keeper of universal virtue
fauchelevent , who had sat down , shot up as though a firecracker had gone off under his chair
twenty men at the barricade
it was the final degree of hypocritical vileness !
this man was composed of two sentiments , very simple and very good in themselves , relatively speaking , but which he made almost bad by exaggeration : respect for authority , and hatred of revolt ; and in his eyes , theft , murder , all crimes , were just different forms of revolt
if lavaternumber had been able to study the man ’ s face he would have found in it the vulture mingled with the prosecutor , the bird of prey and the pettifogging shyster bringing the worst out in each and completing each other , the shyster making the bird of prey ignoble , the bird of prey making the shyster appalling
cosette had not left the rue plumet without a show of resistance
marius and monsieur fauchelevent saw each other but did not speak to each other
well , then , we ’ d better drink
this was the public entrance to the church
i went into the second
one morning , when monsieur madeleine was in his office , busy settling some pressing mayoral matters ahead of time in case he did decide to travel to montfermeil himself , someone popped in to tell him that police inspector javert wished to speak to him
truths he wanted nothing to do with obsessed him inescapably
the flask finished off what the unfettered air had started
it didn ’ t take much more to get monsieur gillenormand going
any more of that and he ’ ll be calling her your majesty like she was the duchesse de berry ! number he must be off his rocker !
jean , if you like
yes , he said , here i am tittering and killing myself laughing and overflowing with mirth , but i ’ ve lost time , i ’ m going to have to make a detour
is this second infinite also intelligent ?
he who felt that he could only crawl , at best walk , watched cosette sprout wings
they ’ re little devils , those cherubs
i can ’ t quite remember his name
mother thénardier swiftly replaced her scowl with an amiable grimace , a change of perspective peculiar to innkeepers , and avidly strained to get a look at the newcomer
as though she were looking at him for the first time in her life
i ’ ll feel the good lord ’ s blessing when cosette is here
she backed against the gate , faced the six bandits , though they were armed to the teeth and looked like demons in the night light , and in a firm low voice she said : sorry , i don ’ t want you to
why should it be exaggerated ?
there was a moment of silence
enjolras , courfeyrac , and combeferre were among those who took to the rue bassompierre shouting : to the barricades !
but the night really was becoming too much now , the rain was bucketing down so heavily it cleared the streets , the cold was creeping up on them , their clothes were soaked , their shoes had holes in them and were taking on water , the alarming uproar that had just broken out in the prison meant hope was fading , fear was returning
the ultimate smile is god ’ s alone
the whole time she was there , he had lived that life of ecstasy that suspends material perceptions and causes the whole soul to rush to one point
the doctor , who had been sent for , had come running
they really were two pretty little girls , more bourgeois than peasants , incredibly charming , one with very shiny auburn plaits , the other with long black plaits that fell down her back , both so lively , clean , plump , fresh , and healthy that it was a pleasure to lay eyes on them
god gives men air , the law sells it to them
a man had been condemned to death for murder
that a life so created is now genetically programmed to suffer abnormally - this constitutes absolute horror
all that was once carefully made up is now smeared and laid on with a trowel
and all for this old bastard of an apple thief who , beyond any doubt , deserves the galleys for something else , if not for that !
in the midst of this melancholy somnambulism in which she was immersed , she told herself : you really need wooden clogs to be in the garden at this hour
the violent struggle unleashed in him since the day before was not yet over , and at every moment it took a new turn
two of durutte ’ s regiments come and go , bewildered and as though tossed between the sabres of the uhlansnumber and the fusillade of the brigades of kempt , best , pack , and rylandt
he looked at her
it was all there , it was the same apparatus , the same time of night , almost the same faces on the judges , soldiers , and members of the audience
jean valjean was the unhappier of the two
as he said no more , she burst out : so , why— ?
though we have to say that no one ever took the key out of the door
black coats and round hats had virtually disappeared
they have such a good little argenteuil wine , mumured fauchelevent
the little one repeated in a small voice from time to time : i ’ m hungry
they butter their dry bread with it
he was one of those who think that science will wind up turning the tables
no one could say ; all that was known was that , when he came back from italy , he was a priest
but i don ’ t have many toys
there were now only five thugs left in the rathole besides thénardier and the prisoner
gavroche was a human whirlwind
strolling together in lonely expanses !
resisting the camp 's fate to erase and silence means not only inscribing the traces of the horror as a faithful witness
having nothing to seal this letter with , he merely folded the page in four and wrote this address out : to mademoiselle cosette fauchelevent , care of monsieur fauchelevent , rue de l ’ homme-armé , no
after a quarter of an hour , he got up , as though he were about to begin walking toward the bench again , surrounded as it was in glory
she did not look at a single merchant ’ s display on the way
you saved the life of a colonel—
obviously an enormous event
he carted off his flora , his copperplates , his herbariums , his portfolios , and his books and set up near la salpêtrière in a kind of cottage in the village of austerlitz , number where he had three rooms and a hedged-in garden with a well for fifty écus a year
in the antechamber , three violins and a flute softly played haydn ’ s quartets
me , i fancied … in a word , that ’ s what i did !
so that ’ s that , he ’ s dead
but don ’ t rely on it too much
if you ’ d done that , we wouldn ’ t have touched you
father gillenormand did not do it deliberately , but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic way of hisnumber
calvin grabs socin by the hairnumber but nothing stops or interrupts the straining of all these energies toward their goal , and this vast simultaneous activity comes and goes , goes up and down and up again in the darkness , slowly transforming what lies above from below and the outside from the inside , in an immense teeming infestation
he went and sat in the corner of the fireplace meditating , his feet on the hot ashes
you ’ re the right age for it
they were shoved under this beam where each one of them had his iron brace swinging in the darkness , waiting for him
you don ’ t shoot outside the ranks any more with your soul than you do with your gun
he would vanish like an apparition and then reappear as though popping up out of the ground
this punic labour , incontestably authorized by war , which allows for traps , was so well performed that haxo , sent by the emperor at nine o ’ clock in the morning to reconnoiter the enemy batteries , did not notice a thing and returned to tell napoléon that there was no obstacle apart from the two barricades barring the roads from nivelles and genappe
he was very soon down to his last sou , never to his last laugh
the whole episode greatly enhanced fauchelevent ’ s standing
before , her soul had been cold , now it was warm
it is both nation and idiom at the same time ; it is theft in its two different species , people and language
the suffocation of the soul !
she whiled away her time on sundays after mass counting the linen in her trunk and spreading out on her bed all the dress material she bought piecemeal and had never run up
to the casual observer who lets his imagination run , all these men in groups huddled together look like so many sinister beehives where certain kinds of mind buzz away , building all kinds of bleak constructions together
it goes without saying that he will be worthy of it
the gamin embodies paris and paris embodies the world
take your foot away , right now !
you hear it and you recognize in cambronne the old soul of the giants
that done , cosette had pleaded a persistent migraine , said good night to jean valjean and shut herself up in her room
he did battle as though he were in a dream
it ’ s the denoument of the elegy in andré chénier ’ s le jeune malade—the andré chéniernumber who had his throat cut by the bast—by the giants of ’ number
what the chief tenant noted
but was this g—— really a vulture ?
at the time of the emperor ’ s landing , the trois dauphins had been the talk of the region
with that , he started pacing again , erupting like a volcano as he did so : ah !
he went to the mantelpiece , swept up the two silver candlesticks , and handed them over to jean valjean
the amazement of marius
it was only the second or third she had ever seen in her life
she plopped on the grass and stayed there , squatting
a pretty good fire had been lit
it is there , with its sublime and brutal end ; and no matter how innocent souls may be , you can feel , in the most decorous tête-à-tête , the wonderful and mysterious difference that distinguishes a couple of lovers from a pair of friends
monsieur javert , my good monsieur l ’ inspecteur !
while he was thinking along these lines , devastated but resolute , hesitant , though , and , in a word , shuddering in the face of what he was about to do , his gaze wandered about the interior of the barricade
when it was pitch black , he would speak , though only to his accomplices and only with his back turned
equality , citizens , is not the levelling of all the vegetation , a society of tall blades of grass and short oak trees , a community of envies leaping at each other ’ s throats ; it is , in civic terms , all aptitudes having the same opportunity ; in political terms , all votes having the same weight ; in religious terms , all consciences having the same right
less than a mile away , at the corner of the rue du temple that debouches onto the boulevard near the château-d ’ eau , if you were game enough to poke your head out beyond the tip formed by dallemagne ’ s shop front , you saw way in the distance , beyond the canal , in the street that goes up the slopes of belleville , at the highest point of the hill , a strange wall reaching the second storey of the façades , a sort of hyphen linking the houses on the right and the houses on the left , as though the street had decided to fold its highest wall back in on itself to seal itself abruptly off
at the time of her birth , the directoirenumber still held sway
the sun ’ s going down
cosette did not hesitate for a second
you can keep your théodule to yourself
so , there , she said
a legitimist association , the faithful knights , moved among these republican affiliations , but it was denounced and repudiated
all that , that ’ s the ceremony of dying
the grace of a child was still struggling with the ghastly premature aging brought on by debauchery and poverty
inquiries are made in faverolles
marius offered the old man his arm and walked him home
in the twentieth century , it was art 's turn to feel the impact of industrial repetition - head-on
let ’ s hope he doesn ’ t get it wrong !
these men patiently follow such bourgeois
you could hear the overhead dialogue of birds in their nests bidding each other good evening in the elms of the champs-élysées
i ’ ll give you a hand
he hugged the elephant ’ s rough foot and in the twinkling of an eye , without deigning to use the ladder , he had shinnied up and reached the crevice
i don ’ t like seeing people accused unjustly
in less than a minute , two thirds of the cobblestones that enjolras had had piled at the door of corinthe had been taken up to the first floor and the attic , and before another minute had passed , these cobblestones , artistically packed one on top of the other , walled up half the height of the window on the first floor as well as the dormer windows in the roof
me , i was fond of the duc de bordeaux
he waited for night to fall with feverish impatience , he only had one clear idea left and that was that at nine o ’ clock he would see cosette
he liked to go to saint-médard , the nearest church
they went through the trapeze formed by the inside of the barricade like this
i ’ ve dressed her with my hair
they went up to the first floor
while jean valjean was busy building a normal place for cosette in society and possession of an unassailable status , monsieur gillenormand saw to the wedding presents
as for monsieur gillenormand the elder , he did not barter when it came to giving alms and gave willingly and generously
thérèse brought them into the world , jean-jacques booted them out into the world
well , yes , but you ’ re right , i ’ m an idiot , why not just stay ?
his theories as an innkeeper sometimes shot out of him in flashes
you could just see , in the right-hand corner at the back , on padded white satin cushions , a broad face , firm and rosy , a forehead freshly powdered à l ’ oiseau royal , an eye proud , hard , and keen , a scholar ’ s smile , number two great braided epaulets floating on a bourgeois frockcoat , the golden fleece , the cross of saint louis , the cross of the légion d ’ honour , the silver medal of the holy spirit , a fat gut , and a wide blue sash : number this was the king
there has been a misunderstanding
as an institution and a mode of training for man , monasteries were good in the tenth century , debatable in the fifteenth , and detestable in the nineteenth
here , in the square , i was about to lie down on a stone
the stranger , without getting up from his chair , turned toward mother thénardier
heralding the coming proliferation of live shows in museums , silence has become identified with death
he condemned it to his hate
not a bad joke !
monsieur tranchelevent inclined his head
one doesn ’ t rule out the other
there ’ s still the empty coffin
to shout out at the first guardhouse they came to : here is a fugitive from justice who has returned illegally !
he couldn ’ t breathe , he placed his hand on his heart to slow the beating
she was more than a match for the other two little girls for the stylishness of her outfit ; she had a fine linen bonnet trimmed with valenciennes lace and a little chemise with ribbons
cosette put catherine on a chair , then sat on the floor in front of her and stayed there without moving , without saying a word , in an attitude of contemplation
the fifty men in the barricade had quickly exhausted the meagre provisions of the tavern over the sixteen hours they had been there
that machine later became quénissetnumber
jean valjean flourished and felt his happiness growing from the happiness he gave cosette
here again there was a magic word that you had to know
the sand is like pitch underfoot ; his soles stick to it ; it ’ s no longer sand , it ’ s glue
you ’ ve got to get out of here , though
what are you doing , coming here and stopping us from getting on with the job ?
the traveller told her tale , a slightly edited version : how she had been a working woman ; how her husband had died ; how she couldn ’ t find work in paris and was now looking elsewhere , in her own part of the country ; how she had left paris , on foot , that very morning ; how , since she was carrying her child , she had got tired and , having come across the villemomble coach , had hopped on ; how from villemomble she had reached montfermeil on foot ; how her little girl had walked a bit , but not far , she was so little , and so she had had to carry her and her treasure had fallen asleep
cried cosette on entering
jean valjean ’ s calmness was one of those powerful tranquilizers that are contagious
i don ’ t know what else you want me to say
a phenomenon not altogether foreign to certain well-organized police
and out of that particular vacuum , he creates the very place of charles 's love for emma
just tell me how she is
after the funeral , he went straight back to paris and got stuck into law again , without giving his father another thought , as though his father had never lived
all of a sudden , one of the peddlers who lodged in the tavern came in and said in a hard voice : no one ’ s watered my horse
marius arranged things so that he was always out when jean valjean called
this time it was not a mirage
monsieur madeleine promised me one
he murmured , looking at cosette and marius
once , though , he had a burst of real joy
he had thick bushy eyebrows , enormous black side-whiskers , bulging eyes , a muzzle of a chin , and over it all that indefinable air of being right at home
he had no weapon and was rushing so as not to be left behind , although he looked lost in thought
your grandfather looks so nice !
he slipped in the way a grass snake slides into a crack , kept going , and a moment later the two boys vaguely made out his whitish head as it popped out , a pale and wan disk , at the edge of the hole full of darkness
a trade , a simple trade !
the prisoner is prone to flight the same way a sick person is prone to the crisis that cures or kills him
it was only with great difficulty that toussaint had obtained permission to bundle up a bit of linen and clothing and a few toiletries
that evening , when he got back to his garret , marius ran his eyes over his clothes and realized for the first time that he had the sordidness , the indecency , and the unbelievable stupidity to go walking in the luxembourg in his everyday attire , that is , in a hat that was ripped near the band , great walloping carter ’ s clodhoppers , black trousers that were shiny at the knees , and a black coat threadbare at the elbows
but the truth is that this little boarding-school girl , fresh from the convent , chatted with an exquisite perspicacity and at times came out with all sorts of true and subtle things
jean valjean answered , and the sound of his voice seemed to wake javert : he is precisely what i wanted to speak to you about
you will also understand that the gate that so obligingly opened for jean valjean was a bit of cunning on thénardier ’ s part
if i was only good for chastising others and not myself , i ’ d be a miserable swine , indeed !
what is this about ?
well now , follow me
to the pole in the peephole , added brujon , meaning the crosspiece of the window
for this , he had pawned the copperplates of his flora
the woman , a sad bejewelled spectre in a dress , kept walking backward and forward in the snow and did not answer him , did not even glance at him , but continued pacing in silence and with a dismal regularity that brought her back within range of his sarcasm every five minutes , like the condemned soldier going back for the birch
she would have caused a heart of stone to melt ; but there is no melting a heart of wood
he was on that ship just a moment ago , he was part of the crew , he came and went on deck with the rest of them , he had his share of air , of sunlight , he was alive
mother jondrette was sitting next to him
then his forehead diminishes , a bit of hair flutters above the sand ; a hand pops up , pokes a hole in the surface of the beach , flaps and shakes , then disappears
the two little boys , who hadn ’ t been listening to anything till then , busy as they were picking their own noses , came closer at the sound of that name and gazed at montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration
you mean there ’ s a hole ?
but , after all , the talk in which his name cropped up was perhaps nothing more than talk ; hot air , babble , words , less than words , pap , as the colourful language of the midinumber puts it
jondrette forged straight ahead without suspecting that he was already being watched
the humiliation of having lost the scent somewhat and of having been mistaken momentarily about this champmathieu was wiped out by the pride of having been so right to start with and having so long had the right instinct
you will hand cosette over to the bearer
sleep off the absinthe
as he had the reputation of being extremely dangerous in the charlemagne yard , he was put in the new building
you would have said that the icy peace of the tomb had seeped up from the ground and spread out under the sky
poets love getting around in the trousers of rabbit-skin peddlers and the overcoats of the peers of france
what the bishop had wanted him to become , he became
then his right arm , raised ready to release the signal shot , slowly dropped , and the moment jondrette shouted , do you hear me ?
i prefer glacesnumber on my plate , said favourite
it is incontestable that we talk to ourselves , there is no thinking being who does not do so
its use was to save from the cold , the frost , the hail , the rain , to protect from the winter wind , to keep from sleeping in the mud that brings fever and from sleeping in the snow that brings death , a little being with no father or mother , with no bread , with no clothes , with no refuge
are you interested in this case ?
could he straighten up again and regain a foothold on something solid in his conscience ?
if you were to take me back , monsieur pontmercy , would that mean i was not what i am ?
the hospital had been poorly endowed ; he had provided ten extra beds
she had already valiantly renounced finery , dressing in cotton and putting all her silks , all her glad rags , all her ribbons and lace on her daughter ’ s back—the sole vanity that remained to her , this one sacred
this was the roof of the new building
meetings were sometimes intermittent
an event was in train at the end of the walk
then , as the bag on his back was uncomfortable and it would make a good pillow , he started to unbuckle one of the straps
there ’ s flatfoots about , there ’ s cops , grab yer gear and beat it , cut through the sewer !
you ’ d have to buy it first , because we don ’ t know you from adam
many a platoon of national guards set themselves up , on their own private authority , as a court-martial and would then try and execute in five minutes any insurgent taken prisoner
to make a barricade , answered courfeyrac
but i ’ m his son , marius went on
this javert who has been on my tail for so long , with his appalling instinct that seemed to have sniffed me out , that did sniff me out , for christ ’ s sake !
this word made gavroche shout out loud
there is nothing the games of children do not get caught up in !
meanwile , two other masks in the same car , an old-fashioned-looking spaniard with an outsize nose and an enormous black moustache , and a skinny fishwife of a young girl wearing an eye mask , or loup , had also noticed the wedding party , and while their companions and the passersby were busy insulting each other , they carried on a dialogue in a muted tone
on top of that , he made up verses and songs , which gave him great authority
your cup runs over with serenity , gaiety , ecstasy ; you are a beacon of light in the night
she ’ ll arrive any moment , i ’ m expecting her
the handles are silver at bombarda ’ s and bone at edon ’ s
look closely at life
having for various reasons failed in his affairs , he had fallen from being a scrivener to a carter and labourer
paris no longer has the same outskirts ; the face of what we might call circum-parisian life has completely changed in half a century
whether they were in france or england , what did it matter , as long as he had cosette by his side ?
after a while , i turned round and i saw a great crowd coming behind me
all the crimes of the man begin in the straying of the child
so , you go to enormous trouble , for these particular holes are normally very deep , you sweat , you root around , you toil away all night , for this is done at night , your shirt gets soaked , your candle burns out , you damage your pickaxe , and when at last you get to the bottom of the hole , when you lay your hand on the treasure , what do you find ?
they sleep together among the stars
they did not get much pleasure from this exciting danger , though
at the same time , he squeezed the trigger of his carbine
any number of stories made the rounds about madame albertine
after that , nothing and no one had wanted her
alcippe , it ’ s true , then , in a little you ’ ll be marriednumber
here there is a region , a town , factories , a whole industry , workers , men , women , old grandfathers , children , poor people !
well , then , they would go
but surely i can find a horse for hire in the village ?
yes , combeferre went on , and mine , too
to bear witness to a confrontation in history , the filmmaker links together moments of rest or dream , as in a juxtaposition of under-motivated images
mother magnon sought an expedient
history as the sensible fabric of things is doubled by history as fate-dealing power
so this is what appears to political philosophers :
to come out of it slain or victorious , the only possible way out from that point on
father fauchelevent ’ s off with his basket , it ’ s as simple as that
oh , but i have to laugh
it ’ s nothing to do with us
there ’ s a girl there giving you the eye—go on , look !
you ’ re not supposed to do that sort of thing
truth is , he ’ s just the bloke to get his hands on lucifer ’ s stash
there was a real danger he would slip under one or the other of the two
these were the sentinel at the end of the street and the scout at de la petite-truanderie ; the scout at the rue des prêcheurs lane had stayed at his post , which indicated that nothing was coming from the direction of the bridges or les halles
he had at once both spied on him on his own account , for pleasure and out of instinct , and spied on him as though he were being paid to do so
he retraced his steps furiously and threatened them with his stick ; the children scattered like a flock of birds
so , what prevents this nondescript subject from getting behind the camera and making history with it ?
she was virtually famous in the congregation for this imperturbable truthfulness
and so she made it to the spring
i did what i could
then the nuns split into two lines ; one line files past her , saying in a plaintive tone , our sister is dead !
the bourbons took respect with them , but not regret
when he was declared to be rich , those who comprised society saluted him and about town he began to be called monsieur madeleine ; his workers and the children continued to call him father madeleine and that was the thing that most made him smile
there , he had got down and the fiacre had taken cosette back to the rue de babylone
madame , he said , do you do a brisk trade in this montfermeil ?
he gave a jerk
numbera , rue du faubourg-poissonnière , in the number of five or six thousand , in a courtyard at an armourer ’ s
we drew lines we never cross
montparnasse again adopted a serious tone and , swallowing every consonant , he said : things
the cell next door was occupied by a very poor young man named monsieur marius
it was his majesty ’ s animal
madame magloire understood and immediately went and fetched the two silver candlesticks from the mantelpiece in monseigneur ’ s bedroom and placed them on the table with the candles lit
to paint the portrait of the child is to paint the portrait of the city , and it is for this reason that we have studied the eagle in this candid little sparrow
musketry alternated with grapeshot , without actually doing too much damage , if the truth be known
at eight o ’ clock in the evening he realized this and , since it was too late to go down to the rue saint-jacques , he said well !
but the camera lens is indifferent to all that
from each translation a party is born , and from each misreading a faction ; and each party believes it has the only true text , and each faction believes it holds the light
well , so be it ; but , sweethearts , remember this : you eat too much sugar
on the way there he ran into courfeyrac and pretended not to see him
listen , a pretty apple-cheeked baby brimming with health , who babbles , and jabbers away , and laughs , and smells so sweet when you give them a kiss—do you know what happens to that baby when it ’ s abandoned ?
i ’ m an old hand , you ’ re new
cosette did not bother to try and understand a thing and was happy beyond words , between the doll and the man
mother thénardier , as was her wont , had left her husband to it
i said to myself : blondeau , my love , you won ’ t have even a hint of an execution today
it was toward this corner of the square , so dimly lit by the reflection of a distant streetlamp , that the boy directed the two toddlers
nothing was as poignant and terrible as this face in which what we might call all the bad of good was exposed
he could not have said
an adept of the then very recent discoveries in the psychology of perception , this pioneer of abstraction would seek to clear the field of all the formal references of figurative art
france has its relapses into materialism , and , at certain moments , the ideas that clog that sublime brain have nothing left in them that recalls french greatness and are the size , instead , of a missouri or a south carolinanumber what can you do ?
he scarcely spoke , gave awkward answers , but from head to toe , his entire person screamed that he was not guilty as charged
the work of the engraver ’ s burin on its own would be too pale ; we need to pour concentrated prose that bites into the engraved lines
a name is a centre , centre—which is a profound association for you
the splendour of all that is immaculate and inaccessible is hurled at them , heaped upon them
bonaparte as the victor at waterloo—this was no longer in the law of the nineteenth century
marius went and ate even more than the night before
let ’ s not go too far , though ; in relation to jean valjean , this disregard and this erasure were only superficial
if only he were still young !
this is what he wrote :
he grabbed the two candlesticks
montparnasse had the furious humiliated look of a wolf that has been snatched by a sheep
con- fronted by such 'expressionist ' events , surely we can
i just mentioned eve , it is you who created her
at the convent cosette continued to keep silent
true or false , what is said about people often has as much bearing on their lives and especially on their destinies as what they do
i don ’ t know , replied the little girl
if you want to be happy , monsieur , you must never have a sense of duty ; for the moment you do , it becomes implacable
but on that score he intended to be discreet
old age goes to the end
why didn ’ t he call out for help ?
was it for something so petty that he had done all he had done ?
for in revolutions , the party in revolt is not the people , it is the king
his wife , the second one , had managed his fortune in such a way that all that was left to monsieur gillenormand , when one fine day he found himself a widower , was just enough to live on , and that , only by turning virtually the whole amount into an annuity , number fifteen thousand francs in income , three quarters of which would expire with him
he set to work
a whole new world appeared to his soul : kindness accepted and returned , devotion , miséricorde , leniency , the havoc wreaked on austerity by pity , acceptance of other people , no more definitive condemnation , no more damnation , the possibility of a tear pearling in the eye of the law , some indefinable sense of justice according to god ’ s rules that was the reverse of justice according to man
let ’ s not blindly accept what they tell us
it ’ s in that room that the court is sitting
i was wrong just now , monsieur
two divisions , the fifth and the sixth , were wiped out
jean valjean was carrying him in such a way that his chest was not squashed and he could breathe as freely as possible
father fauchelevent gasped and screamed :
and so , mastering some and mastered by others , crushing those below and suffocating under those above , vainly endeavouring to shake off the blows raining down on him , monsieur leblanc disappeared beneath this horrible pile of thugs like a wild boar under a howling pack of mastiffs and bloodhounds
you ’ d have said they were monkeys from the court of a tiger
this prognostic declared , the prioress immediately took cosette to her heart and gave her a place in the boarding school as a charity case
a chimerical reality appears in the indistinct depths
the senator mentioned earlier was a smart man who had made his way in life with a single-mindedness oblivious to any of those stumbling blocks known as conscience , sworn oaths , justice , duty ; he had gone straight for his goal without ever deviating from the path of self-interest and his own advancement
cosette did not know how to scale a wall
no way back up to the quai now ; no more ramp , no stairs ; and they were very close to the bend in the seine near the pont d ’ iéna , where the embankment got narrower and narrower , tapering off in a skinny tongue before vanishing underwater
you , cosette , and i , we ’ d have been three heads in the one green lifer ’ s cap !
he put the only extant copy under his arm and went out
is it condemned to the horror of hearing evil approaching through the denseness of the abyss and of glimpsing , closer and closer to it , beneath the hideous water , that draconian head , that great maw chomping on foam , that serpentine undulation of claws , swellings , and rings ?
for , if they had had a different neighbour , a less fanciful and more attentive neighbour , a normal , charitable man , obviously their destitution would not have gone unnoticed , their distress signals would have been seen , and for a long time already , perhaps , they would have been rescued and saved !
it continued to yield in silence
at the head and rear of the convoy , gendarmes on horseback trotted along gravely , sabres at the ready
reckonairs [ i reckon there ’ s ] a shopful of stuff
both sides took aim , at point-blank range , so close they were within earshot and could talk without raising their voices
what decision did he make ?
i grant these times this motto : dirty cleanliness
the bouquets of flowers had just had a wash ; all the velvets , all the satins , all the enamels , all the golds that come from out of the ground in the form of flowers were impeccable
he didn ’ t have a clue
he unfolded it and , as he happened to be near the lamp , he was able to read : the president of the circuit court would like to pay his respects to monsieur madeleine
nothing could be more ravishing and noble than all these fresh souls blossoming
in those hours of waiting , what did they do ?
and diving into the dark confidently like a man who knows his apartment , he took a board and blocked the hole with it
and so , given that we are in the nineteenth century , as a general rule , and no matter what people are concerned , in asia as in europe , in india as in turkey , we are against the seclusion of ascetics
i ’ d have to see , said mother thénardier
if you only knew how much we missed you yesterday !
among these men , battre , to beat but also to whip up , means feindre , to feign ; you whip up an illness ; ruse is their strong point
that must refer to the post houses
he continued to forge ahead , though , regardless , groping in the gloom
maybe he was there !
the little mouse looks like turning into a money-spinner after all
monsieur le duc d ’ orléans gave her good references
it ’ s not her fault
the gunners get themselves taken seriously
when they had put the church behind them , the man , seeing all the shops out in the open under the stars , asked cosette : so the fair has come to town , has it ?
you know what you have to do
sooner than that , monsieur le maire
there are twenty-six of us combatants left standing
it was a bizarre assortment
pagan mythology was going head-to-head with christian mythology
a fresh prairial breezenumber was blowing , stirring the tops of the plane trees
here ’ s how it goes : yoo-hoo !
as she spoke she reached up to grab the strap hanging from the mantelpiece
morality is the blossoming of sundry truths
marius could be in no doubt , they were clearly talking about her
for them , there is nothing two leagues past its gates
i ’ ve done you favours on more than one occasion
a driver looking for a tip is capable of anything , even of imagination
who ’ d have thought it ?
you must have been cold as anything in that coach
pardon me , monsieur innkeeper , what ’ s your name ?
we pass over the rest , and not the worst
the young girl tilted backward slightly and raised her eyebrows as if to say : what ’ s got into you ?
marius had reached that point of intoxication where the wall drops and the ice melts , and monsieur fauchelevent was now for him , as for cosette , a father
cosette had taken the grandfather ’ s arm and was taking a turn in the garden
koch , the blonde romantic who , in , settled in a gloomy valley near weimar where goethe once liked to walk and where , more to the point , he dreamed up his mephistopheles - that spirit that denies all
unemployment and poverty were now unknown
whatever will your family say , seeing me with a collar all crumpled ?
and marius , like the others , had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman monsieur leblanc
a bandit has two heads , one reasons out his actions and guides him all his life , the other is what sits on his shoulders the day he dies , when it is on the block ; he calls the head that counsels crime la sorbonne , and the head that expiates it la tronche , noggin
you did the right thing
monsieur le maire , i don ’ t want you to treat me with goodness , your goodness to others has made my blood boil
so you want to blast the apollo belvedere ?
the servant lamented in a corner by herself , the curé prayed and could be heard sobbing , the doctor dried his eyes ; the corpse itself wept
the relays aren ’ t manned , the horses are in the fields
how he protected his house
that ’ s more your style
he gave a deep sigh
what on earth for ?
some sucker ’ s fallen for the mother
how many times had his conscience , in a frenzy to be good , tackled him and brought him down !
we ’ re cutting straight to the romance !
dantonnumber has to dare it
novices wear the same habit , but all in white
what radiance in the anvil !
ah , you wicked old pig of a mayor , you came here to frighten me , but i ’ m not frightened of you
there is ecstasy in agony
not one has escaped
that done , he glanced down at his torn chemise with satisfaction
once madame magloire had said to him with a kind of gentle malice , monseigneur , you are always so keen to put everything to good use , yet there ’ s a useless garden bed for you !
at this point we might note the project of the multinational monsanto designed to genetically programme crop sterilization and designated by the telling name , 'ter
aided by science , which derives from man , and events , which derive from someone else , it doesn ’ t worry too much about those contradictions in the framing of problems , which seem to the vulgar to be impossible to solve
how did monsieur fauchelevent get there ?
the stranger was momentarily spellbound before this sweet and soothing scene
that simple question , and cosette ?
the day before the date set for the condemned man ’ s execution , the prison chaplain got sick
the good lord , having created the mouse , said : oh dear , i ’ ve made a boo-boo
the sister felt chilled by something unfamiliar that she detected in all this
gibelotte , some light on the subject !
he got this initial generous impulse under control and recoiled before such heroics
but nothing bearing any resemblance to a blow or an attack , not even some kind of self-defence , came from his hands
his imperturbable temerity stuns me
he ’ d escape our clutches
where are you going , you lout ?
he also saw , as if they moved in front of him in perceptible form , the two ideas that , till then , had been the twin rules of his life : to hide his name , to sanctify his soul
the quasi-fiction of the student is thereby in turn inscribed within a fiction about the work of memory as it extends across three works
a galley slave , sacred !
said marius once more
oh , thou who art !
was he actually the same man ?
yes , and a hand that blocked it
truth and justice , first and foremost
dead eyes—that is the opposite sign
not on your life !
the result was that her elder daughter was named éponine
the beach is perfectly dry , but with every step a person takes , as soon as he lifts his foot , the footprint it leaves fills with water
he had gone in because of the carpe horas and had gone back because of the carpes au gras
so little ’ uns are good for something , eh ?
a twin tubular apparatus , provided with valves and sweeping sluices , sucking in and driving back , an elementary drainage system as simple as a human lung , and which is already fully operational in several counties in england , would suffice to bring into our towns the pure water of our fields and to send back to our fields the rich water of the towns , and this simple two-way movement , the simplest in the world , would let us hold on to the five hundred million we throw away
things have reached such a pitch that a pitiful musician par excellence like bob dylan can bemoan the fact that
he did not even flinch
and what ’ s it to you if you do know him ?
finally , he let go of jean valjean , straightened up all in one go , took his club fully in hand , and , as in a dream , murmured more than spoke these questions : what are you doing here ?
a man replied : but there ’ s a light on in this room
you ’ ve put on a gorgeous cravat this morning , marius
lions turned to deer
cosette , completely rapt in the ecstasy of possession , saw and heard nothing anymore
all the windows were grated
bringing up the rue de la chanvrerie in conversation , he turned to monsieur fauchelevent and asked him : you know the street well , don ’ t you ?
there , he fell asleep and had a dream
if we think of nature as providence , society should think of itself as provident
they were bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the distant reflection from the torch
henri iv ’ s favourite swearword puts sanctity between a blowout and drunkenness
guyot , who led the charge of the emperor ’ s squadrons , falls under the feet of the english dragoons
he placed a kiss on that pale forehead beaded with ice-cold sweat
and for what motive ?
do you hope to feel no sting of desire , to pass up the nuptial bed and thumb your nose at love ?
there , i ’ ve singed my coat
but the father , the real world , that dump , those thugs , that episode , what was the point ?
great things had been done while it sat on the sidelines
what moved him was habitual indignation , the bitterness in his soul , a profound sense of the iniquities he had been subject to , a reaction against even the good , the innocent , and the just , if such there be
cosette , you ’ re happy ; my time is up
these two were there thanks to the gates being shut
no , i suppose you ’ re not the one who came to montfermeil , to my inn , eight years ago , the night before christmas , number !
what is ice-cold is sincere
i won ’ t stay long
as for us , we do not think so
so i ’ m supposed to fail in my duty of care toward all those poor creatures !
she searched in the dark with her left hand for a young oak bent over the spring that normally served her as support , found a branch , hung from it , lunged down and plunged the bucket in the spring
he stood stock-still , mouth agape
the thing was a cart , the being was a peasant from auvergne sleeping in it
to the cadran bleu
in the moat of vincennes , a monumental pillar rose out of the ground recalling the fact that the duc d ’ enghiennumber had died in the very same month napoléon had been crowned
the mysterious power emerging threatened the established order , which was suspect and sly
the gross , the twelve dozen , used to cost ten francs and sell for sixty
had he lost his scent for catastrophe ?
all the flowers opened around them and sent them incense ; they opened their souls and spread them out among the flowers
then i beg to reflect
mother thénardier handed him the folded bill without answering
a hand supports you , it is hers ; lips brush your forehead , hers ; you hear breathing right next to you , it is her breathing
for a condemned man , a mask is not a mask , it is a refuge
the driver decided to whistle and to swear at his horses instead
he was rich , with four thousand francs annual incomenumber—four thousand francs , annual income—a splendid scandal on the montagne sainte-genevièvenumber tholomyès was a wasted high roller of thirty
one of the small front wheels was up a bit on a pile of dirt beyond which an open grave could be seen
the bishop of digne had none of that harshness , peculiar though it is to many priests
a bed with a mattress and sheets !
the eldest of the seven children was eight years old , the youngest , one
that was the war waged by ambiorix , by artevelde , by marnix , by pelagiusnumber but ambiorix fought against rome , artevelde against france , marnix against spain , pelagius against the moors ; all of them against the foreigner
that would be the crowning glory of your ignorance
peace is happiness digesting
you ’ ll drink water , you ’ ll eat black bread , you ’ ll sleep on a plank with irons riveted to your limbs and you ’ ll feel how cold they are at night against your skin !
monsieur leblanc answered without showing the slightest emotion : i don ’ t know who you mean
towns , like forests , have their dens where the nastiest and most terrifying creatures they harbour hide
put me to use
not one spark of certainty or truth had shot out even from the most horrifying shock
between the old sewer and the current sewer , there has been a revolution
mass had scarcely begun when an old man appeared and said to marius : monsieur , that is my place
basque just happened to be in the courtyard at the appointed time—as though under orders
monsieur françois de neufchâteau , the praiseworthy keeper of the flame of parmentier ’ s memory , number did his level best to see that pomme de terre—potato—was pronounced parmentière , but he did not pull it off
one of them told us one day : to see the cobblestones on the street made me shiver from head to toe
how did this trust come into my hands ?
paris is the ceiling over the human race
it has had it with those two tenses , which are so good at conjugating their double absence
the murderer turned and saw in front of him the cold white face of enjolras
what do i care ?
gardens and meadows , with water in their roots and sunshine in their flowers , turn into incense burners and smoulder away , releasing all their perfumes at once
she rushed to send her daughters to bed , then asked the yellow man for his permission to send cosette to bed , too—she ’ s had such a big day today , she added , on a maternal note
what am i going on about ?
the words he most often uttered were a sensible fellow and naturenumber he did not use the latter in its general sense according to the meaning our age has assigned to it
a vocal mother : why are you crying , my child ?
what would be the point ?
jean valjean ducked out through the opening , stepped into the street , dashed through the hail of bullets , raced to the mattress , grabbed it , loaded it onto his back , and returned to the barricade
what was jean valjean ?
a convent is a contradiction
not going out anymore , he had reverted to it and preferred it
elsewhere , close to the seine , and even some distance from the river , at belleville , grande-rue , and the lunière arcade , for instance , you come across quicksand where a man can drop out of sight in a trice
we even called him jean-the-jack , he was so strong
he responded to each discharge with a verse
marius knew that the moment to intervene would arrive in a matter of seconds and he raised his right hand toward the ceiling , in the direction of the hall , ready to let fly with a pistol shot
he didn ’ t hear a word of what madame magloire had let slip
next to the old man sitting in the wheelchair stood a young boy , the little shepherd
how long were they left like this ?
even though it ’ s night , i can hear barbary organs and the machines in the mills spinning , i don ’ t know
but those breaths were enough to arouse and excite the whole of the natural world around them
he didn ’ t know it , of course , but the first positive result for him of this shift was to stop the cocked pistol from going off and to paralyze marius , for whom the urgency disappeared
as though he had a key , everything opened ; he could explain to himself what he had hated , he could fathom what he had abhorred ; from that moment on , he could see clearly the providential , divine , and human meaning of great things he had been taught to detest and of great men he had been trained to curse
gusts of hot air rose up from the depths of ’ number and ’ number and floated about
basque and the porter had carried marius into the salon and he was still stretched out motionless on the sofa where they had first laid him
twenty of them pile in a car built for six
at that moment , while he loaded his shovel , the gravedigger bent down and the pocket of his jacket gaped wide open
besides , he had seen for himself that personal assets had their ups and downs , turning , for example , into national propertynumber and being confiscated ; he had witnessed the vicissitudes of the tiers consolidé , number the consolidated third policy of number , and he did not have much faith in the ledger
he had noticed the streetlamp
ah , the strange contradictions of the human heart in its most sublime moments !
what happened next in the destiny of monsieur myriel ?
you ’ ll need a stone , too , but you ’ ll find plenty outside
the four frolicking couples , at one with the sun , the fields , the flowers , the trees , were radiant with happiness , too
an old man known as father fauchelevent had just fallen under his cart when his horse fell
inflamed convictions , embittered enthusiasms , agitated indignations , warlike instincts held back , exalted young spirits , blindly generous impulses , curiosity , the taste for change , the thirst for the unexpected , the feeling that gives us pleasure reading the bill for a new show and makes us thrill to the whistle of the stagehand at the theatre ; vague hatreds , resentments , disappointments , any vanity that feels that fate has failed them ; discontentments , hollow dreams , ambitions hedged in by high walls ; whoever hopes that collapse will provide a way out ; finally , at the very bottom , the peat bog , that mud that catches fire—these are the elements that make up a riot
he saw jean valjean perfectly well , but he took no notice of him
we have already sketched that sad little figure
this is the dead room , said enjolras
i don ’ t understand how he got out of there alive
never did marius set foot in the house
marius ended up knowing very well this rare , sublime , and gentle man , this rather lamblike lion who had been his father
it was a rather vast dimly lit enclosure , now full of din , now full of silence , where the whole apparatus of a criminal trial unfolded in all its mean and mournful gravity before the multitude
while we were chatting we got cold because of the open window
slang lives off the language
what a sorry man i am !
a few yellow leaves , left over from the previous autumn , merrily chased each other , like gamins playing
oh , i am playing , replied the little girl
people are crushed to death , trampled , others walk over the dead and over the living
we who believe in death are not among those who would reject this mysterious explanation
as for you , i poke my tongue at you
a fact to note is that before reaching the exit gate , the convict , who came from way down the sewer , had to have encountered a dreadful bog where it would seem he could well have left the corpse , but the very next day , the sewer workers working on the quagmire would have found the murdered man and that was not how the murderer wanted it
the driver , a black silhouette on his box , whipped his bony horses
there was something painted on the board that looked like a man piggybacking another man wearing a general ’ s big gold epaulets with big silver stars ; red splotches represented blood ; the rest of the tableau was of smoke and probably represented a battle
we could almost leave it there as far as courfeyrac goes and just say , as for the rest : for courfeyrac , see tholomyès
you could feel the truth in this coldness of the grave
surprised but not frightened , the insurgents had rallied
he had to do it !
one of these monsters was going to cart her off into the darkness ?
this is about the conflict between the poet and those bores , the railway workers who , laid out by heavy sunday drinking sessions , close off , by their abandon , the vespertine distance ’
even in the political stance we have just chided him for and that we are inclined to judge almost severely , we have to say he was tolerant and even-keeled , which is , perhaps , more than can be said for the man addressing you now
other than this , nothing much ever happened to him
even when young she had not been pretty
the wrapping paper was greenish and looked mouldy
to think—that ’ s the real triumph of the soul
at each shot you could see the slats of the blind quivering
a laughter too cynical to be frank
nothing could be more mournful than to see her frolicking and flitting , so to speak , about the room , like a bird with a broken wing , frightened by daylight
this guffaw was wanting in respect for the group
the sludge was dense enough to hold one man ’ s weight but evidently could not bear two
javert went on : you said fauchelevent , rue de l ’ homme-armé ?
he was always looking for any opportunity to educate himself and this ripper-upper of posters had gained his esteem
after a silence , he added : go tomorrrow morning
put the city to work manuring the plain and you just can ’ t fail
it was éponine who , at the champ de mars , had given jean valjean that evocative warning : clear out !
and that very evening , marius was installed at the hôtel de la porte saint-jacques in a room right alongside courfeyrac
at this point in civilization , the exact is an essential element of the marvellous , and artistic emotion is not merely served but completed by the organ of science ; dream must be able to add up
separately , marius and jean valjean would have had a chance to get out
in pulling in their rope , they had broken it and a bit had remained tied to the chimney on the roof
she had barely finished this verse when she cried :
they were right , these were jean valjean ’ s footsteps
he did not reply
the tender and savage tone in which combeferre was singing gave this verse a sort of strange grandeur
napoléon built—the figures are curious—number , number metres ; louis xviii , number , number ; charles x , number , number ; louis-philippe , number , number ; the republic of number , number , number ; the current regime , number , number ; in all , at the present time , number , number metres , or sixty leagues of sewers , form paris ’ s enormous entrails
he remained pensive for a moment
madame magloire shrugged her shoulders
and also as a result of that pact , charles and emma 's unhappiness is the exact flipside of the capacity of any life to be memorable
the age of history , then , is not the age of a kind of painting that is driven by world catastrophe , and by its own movement , towards rarefaction and aphasia
it could be said that death meanders in its throes
for her , getting out of here will be easy
ministerial councils fretted over the issue of whether the vignettes of acrobatics that spiced up franconi ’ s postersnumber and lured the street rabble should be tolerated
they peered into the dark barricade as you would peer into a lion ’ s den
he would toss off mediocre verses whenever he had the urge
this old geezer ’ s put one over on you !
long ago , in the days of history painting , people painted images of the great and their deeds
after all the great periods of art , after the great schools such as the classical and the baroque , after contemporary expressionism , are we not now head- ing for that great transgenic art in which every pharmacy , every laboratory will launch its own 'lifestyles ' , its own transhuman fashions ?
solus cum solo , in loco remoto , non cogitabantur orare pater nosternumber
a moment later , jean valjean approached her and begged her to go and change the thousand-franc note , adding that it was his half-yearly annuity that he had withdrawn the day before
yet you could dimly make out walls that intersected as though other things were growing over there , as well as the low roofs of the rue polonceau
amen , said fauchelevent , who stuck imperturbably to this way of extricating himself whenever he heard latin
when you learn finally to know and when you learn finally to love , you will suffer still
marius paid close attention to the man ’ s speech
but , as we said , nothing of this was betrayed outwardly
at the time when the action of this book occurred , which is , after all , virtually contemporary , there was not , as there is today , a police officer on every street corner ( an advantage there is no time to discuss here ) ; paris was crawling with stray children
one day he had done an errand for monsieur baour-lormian , number one of the forty
the little boy pressed his hand against him , and felt reassured
jean prouvaire was a tad more mellow than combeferre
the light of day seems to go out without , the moral light goes out within ; in the these dark shadows , men come up against the weakness of women and children , and bend them brutally to ignominious ends
then and there , alone in the darkness , standing trembling with cold and perhaps something else , he thought long and hard
marius had told cosette he was an orphan , that his name was marius pontmercy , that he was a lawyer , that he made a living writing things for booksellers , that his father had been a colonel , that he was a hero , and that marius had fallen out with his grandfather , who was rich
it is to this feeling that i appeal at such a decisive moment
you ’ ll find it cut off a quarter of an hour from here
marius had not stopped living at the gorbeau slum
succeed : that ’ s the whole idea
he doesn ’ t look like he has a sou to his name , yet money means nothing to him ; he pays for lagny and he only goes as far as chelles
a priest was needed to attend the prisoner in his last moments , so they went for the local curé
the man you are looking for is not this man , it is me
nothing is weirder than a barricade gearing up for an assault
they make bread to last six months , they bake it with dried cow dung
and he turned his head away so that she could not see him drying his eyes
come in , he said
how to be silent together , a sweetness even greater than talking ;
the little girl sighed as though a heavy weight had been lifted from her chest
there was no one there , which was hardly surprising , given how late it was ; but it did not look as though the place had been made for anyone to walk in , not even in the middle of the day
and he remembered that he had dared to feel sorry for himself !
i say every one of them !
the loopholes are only in the south wall ; the main attack came from there
i ’ ll pay , said the mother
less fourteen or fifteen thousand francs perhaps , said jean valjean
as they were leaving , thénardier stuck his head out the half-open door and shouted into the hall : whatever you do , don ’ t lose that letter !
while he was speaking , he had put his sack and his stick down in a corner , put his passport back in his pocket , and sat down
it simply makes those ranks liable to share the same image , an image of the same ontological tenor
pale and wan , with his neck bare , his hair wild , his perfectly womanly face , enjolras looked amazingly like the themis of antiquitynumber his flaring nostrils and downcast eyes gave his implacable greek profile that expression of fury and of chastity combined that , in the ancient world ’ s view , belonged to justice
to resemble the man in the street who pays his taxes , that was the sum total of his ambition
not one cobblestone out of line
a growl was heard , the growl of a big dog baring its teeth , standing in for the english
monsieur madeleine , who laughed scarcely more often than javert did , began to let loose
he escaped impulsively , like a wolf that finds its cage open
that can ’ t do any harm
which way should he go ?
he turned to his wife
the change was a set change in full view of the audience , for a day or two , at the rate of thirty sous a day , by means of a costume as closely as possible resembling ordinary average respectability
the prioress gave another little interior murmur , probably holy , then spoke up
she looked at marius with indifference , as she would have looked at a toddler running around under the sycamores or at the marble vase that was casting a shadow over the bench ; and marius for his part continued his promenade thinking of something else
he made gestures and signs that meant no !
we will limit ourselves to pointing those questions out
