0	it 's not work !
0	did not work with the original unit
0	whether wireless or wired it sounds as though you are in a tin can .
0	use as emergency back up only .
0	i ca n't believe how zildjian made this terrible product .
0	go with the groove juice , 100 times better .
0	i threw away this thing to the garbagge .
0	plus 2 days later it has a strange color .
0	i have also noticed that the sound is not the same .
0	i would n't use it on my cymbals though .
0	now i ca n't even remember which brand my cymbals are .
0	they perform a lot better than this at half the cost .
0	what i learned is that it works ok if you have smooth cymbals .
0	i however , have multiple cymbals some of which are of the hammered family .
0	the bells look ok but the rest of the cymbals turned out horrible .
0	worked like a charm .
0	sauce is too thick !
0	going back to kitchen friendly bar keepers friend
0	... .in volatile fumes .
0	that 's the only way that so many positive reviews have been written .
0	know what worked better ?
0	pinch of salt in vinegar mixed with flour .
0	sorry to contradict so many others ... just reporting what i experienced .
0	brasso polish works way better than this product .
0	i used an old socks and bam !
0	looks like a brand new finish .
0	either i did it wrong or this sucks .
0	made my cymbals look horrible ! !
0	a sony speaker that i bought at a goodwill for 2.00 was much better .
0	i purchased these speakers based on the reviews i read .
0	my experience was much different than those of the other reviewers .
0	specifically the indoor/outdoor equalizer switch labeling , location , and operation were much different .
0	the audio was neither clear nor loud .
0	the polk speakers performed much better in the same circumstances/settings .
0	the difference was dramatic .
0	the mounting decorator screws were missing from the box !
0	i could n't mount the speakers to the wall .
0	it took 2 weeks for their parts dept .
0	in new york to send them to me .
0	they also did not send the correct matching color .
0	they only had light beige decorator screws in stock and not white .
0	very poor quality control .
0	the speakers broke loose from the frame and tore the wireing out .
0	the flimsy cardboard packing was a shambles .
0	the only saving grace was the cost of the speakers .
0	that was low enough that i decided not even bother .
0	i would never do business with this company .
0	one was so bad the speaker was hanging out of the housing .
0	they turned out to be a complete waist of my time .
0	but they do sound good .
0	i ordered 2 of these , both came to be broken .
0	i received my order and it was broken what now ? !
0	i want my money back ! !
0	ca n't listen to a broken speaker obviously : -/
0	again online shopping is not looking good for me ... ... ... .
0	i ordered two of these speakers and both arrived broken .
0	not happy with this product !
0	i do not recommend !
0	not worth the money !
0	i am about to replace these with better speakers .
0	the 1/4 inch jacks stopped working .
0	one of the speaker had it crack it in
0	i 've ordered 2 of these , at different times .
0	they did n't bother with 2 cent metal clips to prevent that .
0	that is n't poor quality control , that 's *no* quality control .
0	the speaker arrived broken beyond repair .
0	i do n't like leaving bad reviews normally .
0	i had to spend a lot more to get one in time .
0	well i actually picked these up for my sons jeep wrangler .
0	bought 4 of them , all four were defective and did not work !
0	pyle is definately a company to steer clear of !
0	bought these to replace blown tweeters .
0	well if you have them on their own amp then they may work .
0	do n't bother with the 30 ohm .
0	the volume coming from these is not there .
0	so save your money and look else where .
0	all of them eventually degraded and were completely nonfunctional .
0	even some i never used and just kept in the box .
0	i took them apart to see what happened .
0	basically the material they 're made from just is n't top quality/built to last .
0	very low quality , low output sounds terrible .
0	the piezo element inside was cheap and of low quality .
0	just purchased and speakers are already malfunctioning
0	the other remaining unit has some serious , basic issues .
0	they spared no cost-cutting trick to manufacture these marvels of the low-fi industry .
0	i would rate 0 stars but it wo n't let me ! ! ! !
0	i must be missing something .
0	i hooked this up to my sub woofer out on my amp and nothing .
0	waste of money and they make you pay to send them back .
0	i disassemble to find the jack was broken .
0	it now works fine .
0	but my expectation is that these units would be inspected and tested .
0	obviously , it was not .
0	the 1/4 in was bad and intermittent .
0	did not feel secure when plugged in .
0	before i try using again .
0	the first speaker we received produced extremely faint to no sound .
0	a replacement was received that did not work either .
0	thanks to amazon for great replacement guarantee .
0	i found a .5 '' x .
0	speakers have no bass and immediately into distortion when turn loud .
0	not build for dj nor live stage concerts .
0	lasted about 3 months .
0	powerful woofer , weak horn .
0	boomy sound for voice .
0	i drive them through a 100w behringer power amp .
0	i really regretted buying it , its quality is too low for my liking .
0	guess it 's true what they say , you get what you pay for .
0	do n't waste your money .
0	power handling claims are a flat out lie .
0	received this mic sytem on july 1st for my church .
0	and i must say they worked awesome .
0	until mid august when the receiver box went out .
0	they hav a one year warranty .
0	i called company they said to ship to them to have them checked .
0	so i shipped them back to them a week later .
0	oh shipping cost me $ 34 .
0	thats $ 79 i only paid $ 98 for system .
0	so they received the system as per ups tracking .
0	well a week later tried calling company for an update .
0	voice mail is full .
0	i have to check to see if money order was cashed next .
0	i would buy pyle pro brand no more .
0	i learned my lesson .
0	maybe someone has had good luck with the company .
0	i cant find anything on that .
0	so wish me luck .
0	i will continue to try and call them .
0	oh and they are open only mon-thurs 9am-5pm eastern time .
0	the four `` included '' connection wires were all missing completely .
0	these mics really require you to hold them very close to your mouth .
0	they work ok overall .
0	it was delivered and it never worked from the start .
0	i returned it to amazon and will be refunded .
0	i connected my old nady mics and oh , what a difference .
0	i do not recommend buying these .
0	so i decided to go for this set of 4 mics .
0	the range , at least in my house , is excellent .
0	i do n't like the volume knobs in the front of the receiver .
0	they do n't seem to go with the level indicator lights .
0	i 've purchased many of those for other people and they are very realiable .
0	tried these microphones on 4 separate occasions before i returned them .
0	they cut out intermittently due to a bad connection for the batteries .
0	the mics started off great , but one stopped working in the middle .
0	i had to return the set .
0	i though this would work .
0	i am strongly not recomment this to a friend .
0	by the way does any of you know how can i contact them ?
0	i would not recommend this system .
0	i purchased for my singing group .
0	the mics had no range and poor sound .
0	i am extremely disappointed .
0	i purchased this item and it worked well for the first few weeks .
0	then i decided to use for a major event .
0	my sound technician told me it seems to be a problem with the receiver .
0	it really messed up my event as i had no mikes .
0	i brought these mics for a church .
0	out of the box one of the antenna broke .
0	altogether the sound comes and goes although i have fresh batteries in the mics .
0	which feel like toys .
0	they have no weight to them even with the batteries in them .
0	you get what you pay for ... a headache .
0	received the mics a few days ago .
0	poor sound , poor quality all the way around .
0	would not trust them to work at all out at a gig .
0	will be checking into returning the mics for a refund in possible .
0	not very good sound , uses batteries very fast
0	they work , but not really well .
0	bought these because i needed more mics than i had for an upcoming gig .
0	failed out of the box .
0	receiver just put out a low pitched hum on all channels .
0	also another reminder of why its smarter to buy multiple single mic systems .
0	that way when one receiver does n't work your only down one mic .
0	with a system like this your down 4 mics if the receiver has problems .
0	we have used it twice .
0	really feel shafted in this deal .
0	money wasted when used twice .
0	the microphone ( s ) worked just fine when using just one .
0	when i tried using the other 3 they did not work .
0	i even sent an e-mail with their name on it .
0	i will never buy from this company or brand again .
0	i repeat i will never buy this brand again .
0	three of the micro phones worked immediately .
0	three months later nothing worked .
0	tried to contact manufacturer and recieved no call return .
0	chalked it up to a lesson learned .
0	quit buying electronics online .
0	number 4 volume controller give a lot of problem and also one receiver/antenna came broken
0	no obstructions were in the way either time .
0	now only one is working .
0	believe me when i say that it 's bad enough to avoid .
0	it 's so dull it wo n't cut through the head of the drum .
0	did n't meet my needs .
0	it did n't fit my guitar screw whatever you call it .
0	only used it to cut string excess .
0	i got this mainly to remove bridge pins from acoustic guitars .
0	hard to get any leverage with it , as it bent several times .
0	the string cutter was worthless .
0	sent it back the day i got it .
0	after 30 minutes of trying it out , another string broke .
0	violins are the most beutiful interesting instruments .
0	they come in all shapes , sizes , colors , and price tags .
0	this violin i bought when i first started out .
0	the violin does have a major fault in that the action .
0	this violin has flat and high action , making it extremely hard to play .
0	i had to figure that out for myself .
0	but the basic installation was easy .
0	also , i was a little upset with the general look of the violin .
0	also the neck of the violin is not stained .
0	this is very cheaply made , and not up to standards .
0	thus my 2 stars .
0	it 's a great violin !
0	my husband plays the guitar and we 're already playing music together !
0	i 've learned my lesson .
0	the chin rest was cracked in half .
0	i was very unsatisfied with the quality of this product .
0	you can definitely tell that it is a very inexpensive product .
0	it felt like a piece of cardboard with some cheap strings on it .
0	you get what you pay for .
0	i was very excited to buy this violin .
0	i have given that violin to repair at a local store .
0	i am paying three times more i saved by purchasing online .
0	who threads a soft plastic cord ?
0	anyhow , the nuts kept slipping , as did the plastic pegs .
0	prepare for a fight when this thing gets unwrapped .
0	the varnish is high gloss and has drip marks on it .
0	the paint on the scroll at the bottom of the tuners very messy .
0	there are also white spots where varnish is missing .
0	look closer and you see some serious issues .
0	another sad fact is the quality of the components .
0	the pegs do slip , much more than they should .
0	it was broken , strings undone , rosin was just dust .
0	i tried to fix it and figured it just was n't worth it .
0	it is very cheaply made .
0	you 'd be better off buying a plastic pretend violin .
0	there was nothing redeemable about this toy violin .
0	in essence , it is a toy .
0	it took many e-mails and several weeks before i had the correct size violin .
0	i was also mis-informed about the shipping date .
0	i will not use this company again .
0	i wanted to give a gift to my neighbour for a special day .
0	so i very much dissopointed .
0	looks nothing like photo !
0	the case is also very flimsy , not much protection offered at all .
0	and ok yea , as other stated , the rosin was a joke .
0	antonio stradivari would have called this `` kindling '' .
0	recommendation is to reconsider .
0	go with quality at the outset , no matter the level of the player .
0	this is my first time writing a review .
0	however i felt the need to help someone else .
0	i was totally disappointed with this product .
0	very discouraging , and destroyed my enthusiasm to play !
0	this is a student violin .
0	it 's very cheap and you should n't expect anything fancy .
0	that being said , i have a few things to address here .
0	the good : this violin is exactly what i needed as a beginner .
0	i 'm not worried about great tone and expression right now .
0	but shop around first .
0	this tells me that everything included is of a higher quality than this one .
0	the bad : unfortunately , the bad outweighs the good here .
0	as stated above , i wish i had bought a different beginner set .
0	the reason is that this one is simply too cheap .
0	well , let me tell you something .
0	i spent literally over a week trying to get this bow to work .
0	the rosin that comes with it is cheap and brittle .
0	but after replacing the bow and the rosin , i 've gained some perspective .
0	the problem with this set is the bow itself .
0	then i had to repeat this process all the way down the bow .
0	i almost got half of the bow to work , then gave up .
0	it was a massive annoyance .
0	but only after spending an extra 60 or so dollars .
0	also , for some reason , violinsmart accidentally sent me 2 violins .
0	well , now i know those people are telling the truth .
0	fortunately , i was able to open the other one and just keep that .
0	i thought i was going crazy .
0	then i got a real bow and the sound jumps out of this thing .
0	that 's almost enough not to buy it in the first place .
0	i do n't like this violin .
0	first of all the string popped and went into my skin .
0	and it 's really light .
0	i thought it would be better .
0	well you get what you pay for .
0	ok violin but strings in needed to be adjusted - not spaced correctly .
0	bow a terrible disappointment , horse hairs fell apart straight away .
0	i thought to myself '' '' no worries '' '' and kept moving on .
0	when i tried finding my mute that i ordered .
0	it was n't even their .
0	worst crap i ever spent .
0	first the good ... the case is really nice .
0	its probably what your paying for .
0	it has two shoulder straps to go along with it .
0	great for the price ... the not so good .
0	.. the bow for starters is kinda crappy .
0	not great considering it wants to bounce when u play .
0	the varnish has runs in it .
0	big runs that are pretty ugly .
0	big gouges and some saw marks still visible .
0	the body has nicks and gouges in it that they just finished right over .
0	little high on the action but i can fix that .
0	whatever ... it got me playing again for cheap .
0	if that 's what your after then buy it .
0	the repairs on this instrument will outweigh the cost .
0	the total repair expenses will come out to be over $ 50- $ 100 .
0	this is not a 4/4 full size violin .
0	it is a 3/4 violin ... this is considered an error or false advertisement .
0	cheapest instrument i have ever used .
0	it 's a piece of crap .
0	the rosin the give you sucks , and pegs are plastic and cheesy .
0	do not buy ! !
0	do n't buy this it is a waste of world resources !
0	defective construction - the fingerboard is attached to the violin proper .
0	ca n't play the strings properly and the sound is terrible .
0	i would like a replacement .
0	so i would n't recommend this violin to anyone .
0	well happy shopping to yall .
0	do n't buy it , you 'll end up spending more money fixing it
0	very disappointed in this product !
0	going cheap was a mistake .
0	the bow hairs were frazzled and appeared worn .
0	the bridge did not even have the string slits precut !
0	the rosin was a waste of manufacturing .
0	it really should be marketed as a toy violin .
0	and the price was just too tempting .
0	you live and you learn ...
0	the instrument fell apart in less than 4 months .
0	it 's a pretty good violin for the price .
0	keep looking and field all reviews .
0	sadly , it was not great .
0	the bridge does not have the ridges .
0	maybe that is way i ca n't tune the violin correctly .
0	the tuning pegs keep moving as well .
0	they wo n't stay put when i ajust then a lil .
0	this does not meet expectations & i wish to return it- there is no paperwork
0	i actually need to return it .
0	waste of my time and money .
0	you should inform a customer of the grade of violin .
0	my daughter had no instrument for the first few weeks of school .
0	the chin rest was broken when we opened the case .
0	it was n't an expensive item so it did n't bother returning it .
0	the bridge has no ridges for the strings very poor quality even for 40 bucks
0	trash- you get what you pay for ...
0	the bow does n't work at all .
0	could n't even rosin it .
0	purchased a violin via amazon from austin bazaar , what a rip off !
0	looking forward to my cc statement !
0	violin is not what they say it is .
0	a bestler at it 's best !
0	im just annoyed with it , maybe it was just mine but ... rawr .
0	i recieved my violin today for my daughter .
0	i read the reviews on this product and i was really in the middle .
0	i think that is why it showed up broken .
0	i am trying to return the product now .
0	yes , this is a bargain ! !
0	also they did n't even include instructions on how to set up the bridge .
0	if i had n't known how i would have been very frustrated .
0	i was really unsatisfied with this product , even as a beginning violinist .
0	transaction was very smooth and received my violin well before expected date .
0	the bow is not the one pictured .
0	the chin rest is even different than the one pictured .
0	i purchased a student violin last year for about $ 20 .
0	i bought this product thinking it would be a good beginners violin for myself .
0	the color you see in the picture is not correct .
0	it 's more of a [ really shiny ] blueish-green .
0	it 's not a pretty color .
0	plus , it was n't painted very well .
0	there are paint dots where a clump has dried , on the front !
0	the strings where tangled up .
0	took me forever to fix it .
0	the strings were not placed in the correct order to begin with .
0	i could n't get one of the pegs to stay in its place .
0	unreachable by the violin entirely .
0	the bow is pretty durable .
0	also , the wood is nice .
0	so i guess i got what i paid for .
0	just received in mail today .
0	rosin was in three pieces and one of the strings was broke .
0	contacting customer service now for a refund ...
0	her professional opinion is that i need to return it .
0	the pegs on the violin will not stay in position to tune it .
0	we tried peg dope and even new strings to keep it in tune .
0	however , with it being unable to be tuned , it is useless .
0	at first the violin was great ( 15 first minutes ) .
0	not only that the violin had so much varnish the sound was muffled .
0	i honestly regret buying it .
0	i really thought i was getting a great deal .
0	i have n't played in a few years and wanted to relearn .
0	the day i got the violin the g string broke trying to tune it .
0	after replacing it i could n't get it to tune .
0	i tried for hours .
0	the second g string broke .
0	i already had tried that and the extra string broke .
0	the case was the best feature in this sale .
0	these instruments are not worth anything .
0	the key to a decent student instrument is quality set up .
0	do n't waste your money .
0	they deserve zero stars !
0	i do n't like the fact that i was played !
0	i thought nothing of it and proceeded to fix the violin .
0	i got out the bridge and it was just awful ... really ?
0	a white bridge with a nice glossy black violin ?
0	and the g-string just popped right off the tuning peg itself .
0	i checked the rosin and found it in 3 shattered pieces .
0	the product advertisers as a `` student '' violin , it is a toy .
0	it is completely incapable of staying tuned .
0	this is strictly a novelty item & not for someone serious about learning .
0	apparently the violin teacher said the instrument sounds wrong .
0	well since you e-mailed me looking for a review here goes .
0	junk , garbage , but i guess you get what you pay for
0	when my daughter opened hers we saw that it was broken .
0	it was not a shipping problem either .
0	it should have been inspected before shipped .
0	my 10 year daughter spent christmas watching her friend play with hers .
0	a million thumbs down if i had that many ! !
0	horrible horrible customer service .
0	i would give 0 stars if that was an option .
0	i received my violin on time and was excited to begin taking lessons .
0	i wanted to scream that out but no .
0	first the scroll was cracking off the finger board .
0	i tested it my self and played it it sucked monyey nuts !
0	the strings broke almost immediately and the bow had a bunch of threads hanging .
0	this is a toy .
0	it is not fitting properly and will never play right .
0	this instrument is cool .
0	hang it on the wall .
0	that is all it is good for .
0	i teaching beginning strings and have had this instrument come into my classes .
0	do not waste your money .
0	your child is worth more than this !
0	the violin was really poor quality .
0	i would not recommend this product .
0	the strings on the violin will not stay tight .
0	my daughter and i were very disappointed on christmas morning .
0	it wo n't stay tuned .
0	worst $ 42 spent .
0	ordered this a couple weeks ago and am very unhappy with it .
0	instead , spend a little more to get something that will be worth it .
0	also came with a cheap but decent rosin .
0	the case was surprisingly not bad considering the quality of everything else .
0	this violin was black too , but , had white striping details .
0	contacted seller a week ago and have not herd back sense .
0	you might not want to chance buying anything from this seller .
0	the only reason for one star is because they replaced the first violin .
0	the violin is low quality and will not tune in properly .
0	this purchase was basically a waste of money .
0	i do not recommend this seller at all .
0	for a beginner , it 's fine .
0	the students become frustrated because of their poorly constructed instrument .
0	please do n't get any of these instruments !
0	they are horrible ! ! ! ! !
0	i had to give a star rating ... wanted to give zero stars .
0	this violin is advertised for beginners but not even a beginner could use this .
0	to start things off , the violin ca n't stay in tune .
0	once tuned it quickly goes out of tune in less than a few minutes .
0	the violin on the other hand is okai .
0	i did not receive this one because it was ruined during transit .
0	the rosen was cracked and the timer was broken .
0	tuner doesnt even work and the bow was n't black .
0	also its so glossy and polished , its hard to use my sholder rest .
0	first , i had a very bad experience using amazon for the first time .
0	the new violin has given me more problems than anticipated .
0	i will be sending this instrument back asap
0	i 've gotten free bridges of much higher quality .
0	i wo n't even get into the physical defects or other issues .
0	my point is that , true , you get what you pay for .
0	if you 're this cheap/poor , at least get a cecilio or medini .
0	you 'll spend less in corrective `` upgrades '' to make them usable .
0	i 've never seen anything like it .
0	first violin i 've had that actually makes people laugh out loud .
0	this is the biggest turd i 've ever seen .
0	you should get a different violin .
0	this was very cheap , so i did n't expect much anyway .
0	the bow is messed up , so it can barely be played .
0	definitely not worth the 50 dollars i paid .
0	the bridge should have notches for the strings on it .
0	the buyer of this violin should't have to carve out the knoches themselfs .
0	this violin is made of plastic .
0	i am very disappointed in this .
0	no , because could not play with it , no sounds .
0	3. not from social daily deals ( z ) , only from amazon company .
0	thanks for asking , happy new years to all .
0	bridge kept popping out and violin came all scuffed up .
0	you guessed it ... horrible ! ! !
0	just not what i expected .
0	it 's no great violin .
0	the tuner is worthless .
0	the keys are always loose and it always sounds scratchy .
0	worth the 50 bucks though
0	there 's no use if i ca n't even complete one sheet of music .
0	i did not get a brigde or any strings when the violin came in .
0	i would love to get a refund
0	ordered it for my son as he wanted to learn how to play .
0	we could not get it to tune at all .
0	the pegs continually slipped .
0	contacted the company about sending it back and they gave us suggestions to try .
0	tried them and no luck at all .
0	why not just do that to begin with ?
0	worst thing i have ever ordered from amazon or any other website .
0	the seller admitted to using chalk to aid the pegs .
0	the hair on the bow was wide and stringing all over the place .
0	it 's supposed to be thick and organized in place .
0	the pegs are made of cheap plastic and not ebonite and were damaged .
0	so , it is impossible to tune this violin .
0	ebonite is a durable plastic as good as wood or better .
0	horrifically bad quality item .
0	currently working out a claim with amazon as the seller is not responding .
0	i am very disappointed in the quality of this .
0	the strings do n't stay on and the pegs keep slipping .
0	already had to have it repaired .
0	not what i expect from a new instrument .
0	you have to install the bridge .
0	taking it to a professional is a hassle .
0	i got it for my 4 yr old as her santa gift .
0	it says it is purple which is her fav color .
0	turns out to be very royal blue .
0	we have yet to be able to play it .
0	strings are loose and wo n't tighten .
0	product was presented as a working violin .
0	strings would n't stay tight .
0	could n't play at all .
0	very disappointed in this purchase .
0	all i can say is you get what you pay for .
0	i was a little bit naive about violins and their prices .
0	i basically wasted time , and money .
0	much brighter color purple.. not what i wanted !
0	horse hair on bow was all frayed and falling out .
0	rosen was broken and in pieces all over the place .
0	you get what you pay for .
0	do n't purchase this unless you want to be very disappointed .
0	it has n't even been played yet .
0	complete waste of money .
0	string on a separate chord broke .
0	this does not come with an extra set of strings .
0	received this for xmas .
0	was never able to get the strings to stay near in tune .
0	be prepared to replace the strings .
0	the bow did not even work .
0	the bow had to be sent back !
0	and , the bridge is too high .
0	just be ready to have a new bridge made .
0	other than that , the violin itself has a decent sound .
0	i was mostly disappointed in the bow not even working , though .
0	i am having someone repair it next week .
0	definitely would not recommend .
0	the wood is not very durable .
0	now i need wood glue to fix it .
0	and also , you would have to assemble it yourself .
0	i have to send it back ... does n't work at all .
0	my daughter was so sad .
0	i would buy this product !
0	this does not work .
0	its a child 's toy and nothing more
0	so basically a beginner/starter student violin was what i was searching for .
0	i was n't expecting professional but at least playable .
0	also a lot of the hair on the bow were detached .
0	i had to make repairs as soon as it got here .
0	after $ 10 in repairs and new nylon strings it sounds decent .
0	would n't buy it again .
0	this is not a quality product please shopper beware .
0	this is not a real violin .
0	i was so excited for this violin .
0	as a beginner myself , the price was affordable and reasonable .
0	on arrival , the package was damaged on one side .
0	it literally was all over the place , with some strands falling out .
0	i decided to keep inspecting further , still .
0	the rosin was destroyed and powdery .
0	trying to tune the strings is actually impossible .
0	i was very dissatisfied and do not recommend .
0	looks great , but is very cheaply made .
0	have to tighten it up every few minutes .
0	sound `` quality ' sucks .
0	the pegs also slip and that causes the string not to stay in position
0	would n't recomend to anyone
0	arrived broken and could not even tighten strings .
0	should have know , pay for what you get .
0	cheaply made , the bridge snapped after trying to tighten the string .
0	in the words of luke skywalker , `` what a hunk of junk . ''
0	i did n't get any batteries with my tuner .
0	it shipped very quickly , but it 's just junk .
0	occasionally i have new students using these instruments and they are terrible .
0	crescent uses to soft of wood for their instruments and the pegs often break .
0	it 's a cheap violin , plain and simple .
0	it is definately not made from quality wood .
0	do not purchase this violin .
0	first of all , you should never buy an instrument without playing it first .
0	i have to immediately tell them to return it .
0	it was broke when i got it
0	it 's pretty but that 's all .
0	i was really excited to get this and start lessons but i feel misled .
0	the wood that this is made of is not good quality to be playable .
0	the strings and pegs are n't good and even the rosin is cracked .
0	in the end this was n't worth it .
0	arrived with a broken string .
0	grand-daughter ca n't play it .
0	strings would not stay tightened at all .
0	as soon as you go to play , they loosened up
0	and they would n't refund my money .
0	it does n't work .
0	i will be returning it
0	the violin does n't make a sound with the bow it came with .
0	you can pluck it to make sound , but that is it .
0	the instructor said the violin was cheap .
0	off beat and more .
0	could n't use it we had to purchase another one
0	wo n't stay in tune .
0	but can be a good cheap starter violin
0	must have been damaged in tranport .
0	but it is beautiful !
0	must have been damaged in transportation !
0	but it is beautiful !
0	this instrument has not even been played since we got it .
0	the bow was broken upon arrival , and several other problems .
0	it was a total waste of $ 30
0	not pleased at all ! ! !
0	i did n't get the blue one .
0	i got regular wood color .
0	spend 400 $ and play a violin not a you
0	ordered in white , but came in black .
0	very disappointing , as white was what was wanted , and what was advertised .
0	my son never got to play because it could n't be tuned .
0	it was sent out for repairs and nothing can be done .
0	i am stuck with garbage that can not be used ...
0	please do not buy this .
0	i am a 30 year veteran teacher with a successful program .
0	at a very minimum , this will not stay in tune .
0	cheap i can handle , but this is below cheap .
0	the d string is the worst .
0	it wo n't stay put and unwinds .
0	the other strings stay in tune for maybe a minute before coming loose .
0	i ca n't even in good conscience sell this for $ 30 .
0	this product is a piece of crap .
0	what you see in the picture is the illusion of a bargain .
0	this was literally unplayable .
0	it is a little smaller than i thought but i guessed its good for learning
0	this has not held up very well .
0	it 's falling apart and has been repaired a couple of times .
0	we were told to pitch it , it 's time for a new one .
0	super cheap broke when strung
0	it doesnt even produce a single note .
0	this is not a music instrument its a piece of decoration .
0	i looked through the whole case and did n't find the bridge anywhere .
0	paint on a string instrument will make horrible sound .
0	could n't tighten the strings so we returned it .
0	may have just been a dud .
0	when i got this the sound post had fallen
0	bought this violin a week ago .
0	the sound is horrible and the tailpiece broke off after the first week .
0	needless to say it is now trash !
0	do not buy this piece of junk !
0	this was the worst thing i ever bought on here .
0	it was n't at all what the picture shows .
0	this is what i get for buying cheap things .
0	not even good for beginners .
0	the violin i received is unable to be played .
0	the bow is awful and this was a complete waste of money .
0	it included strings , a tuner , and rosin .
0	there was not owner 's manual which is needed for beginners .
0	they pull back out of the wood and lose the tune of the string .
0	buy from a music store .
0	do not order these .
0	they also have no name stamped on them telling who made them .
0	the only thing good about this is how quickly it arrived .
0	oh well , i guess you get what you pay for .
0	do not buy this for anyone .
0	although it is pretty , it has no other redeemiing qualities .
0	bow : some hairs were already broken when we received this .
0	electronic tuner : not accurate .
0	peg : sliding , no peg anti-slip fluid or chalk included .
0	that 's twice what i paid for it .
0	the violin is nice for a starter kit .
0	shipping was fast but it did n't come with the rosin or bow string .
0	bow not in good condition and need to fix
0	arrived broken , but on time .
0	it came cracked , does n't sound at all
0	this was a total disappointment .
0	we set it up but absolutely no sound .
0	nothing , nada ! ! ! !
0	however , i do believe it could be used for firewood .
0	the bow , bridge , and the strings/pegs were really poor quality .
0	it broke once l got it !
0	very disappointed , but you get what you pay for , i guess .
0	well , i was wrong .
0	this violin is made with very cheap materials .
0	when you hold it it feels like it may break in your hand .
0	the tuners are a cheap plastic and cant hold a tune .
0	the strings snap easy , very very easy .
0	the strings snapped as soon as she started to tune it .
0	i managed to get only the g string in tune .
0	just the occasional screech .
0	do n't waste your money .
0	take the plunge and go to a music shop and buy a real instrument .
0	great for at home use .
0	if placing in school for this do not use .
0	the bridge break easy and the string are poorly lined
0	do not buy cheap instruments .
0	it looks nice from afar though
0	it 's okay but it did n't come with the cd 's .
0	we have and teacher so she can figure it out .
0	im really frustrated with this .
0	i went through the whole pack of strings that came with the violin .
0	could 've been more careful ... the rosin that included was completely in pieces .
0	but the rest was ok
0	could not get this thing set up to even tune .
0	the bridge is very poor .
0	the case was nice .
0	violin received with broken string and bow .
0	did not work at all .
0	not even a `` good '' toy strings will not stay tightened/in place..returned
0	resin was melted and stuck to the inside of the case .
0	tuner was not the model pictured .
0	do not buy ! !
0	it 's so cheaply-made that it 's not even playable .
0	the strings were horrendous quality , as was the bow .
0	the g string wo n't even stay tuned .
0	not a single note was able to be played on this .
0	stay as far away from this 'violin ' as possible ! !
0	it arrived and the black finish was completely scratched up !
0	it was unfinished in places .
0	the fingerboard is some unknown painted wood .
0	i guess they expect you 'll always use inferior strings on this thing !
0	within hours i had the whole thing repacked and ready to return !
0	does not stay in tune at all ! ! ! !
0	does not work at all !
0	please keep your money not even good for a beginner .
0	it 's a toy .
0	not good quality at all
0	this is n't worth the trouble it puts you through .
0	this cost me an entire paycheck and all it does is frustrate me .
0	especially how its my very first violin .
0	ill post a picture if i could .
0	not s good sound but hey its for starters
0	its horrible and they cut corners .
0	i want to return it
0	i had to send it back .
0	the second one arrived with faulty tuning pegs .
0	it will not let us properly tune her violin .
0	was for my 12 yo to see if she was going to like it .
0	two strings broke off the get go .
0	the tensioners for the strings would not stay snug kept backing off .
0	rosin was like a brick and overall design is super cheap .
0	spent a little extra and get something a little better even for a starter .
0	i 'm a strings teacher who works with violins for a living .
0	these are cr @ p. do not buy this .
0	the only thing worse than this violin is its bow .
0	whatever you do though , do not buy this .
0	the item was not `` set up '' .
0	strings were loose- hair on the bow was coming out .
0	the chin rest was loose and the strings were plastic .
0	really really poor quality .
0	am i missing something ?
0	do n't buy this violin ca n't hold a tune to save its life
0	this violin is garbage .
0	do n't buy this product .
0	the g string was broken and the back up string is missing .
0	the violin did not come with a bridge .
0	this violin is not a used one as i ordered .
0	it is a sabotaged new violin .
0	very cheap , you get what you pay for .
0	i would rather spend more and get a lasting product .
0	the case and tuner are ok but the violin in so cheap its unplayable
0	it came in the mail already needing repaired .
0	i bought it last month .
0	looks , i am fighting to keep it in tune .
0	bow does n't work , make lot of noise .
0	i feel now that i wasted money
0	the pegs are all very loose and wo n't tighten .
0	the violin i bought does n't work .
0	they sent a guitar 6 strings small size not violin .
0	and when i just slightly tune in e string , the string broke .
0	the tuner and strings mssing from package when receivef
0	now i have to go out of town to purchase that .
0	the bow did not work at all !
0	had to replace it .
0	it felt very echo-ey .
0	the bow was n't the best either , the bow felt like cardboard also .
0	it doesnt come with a shoulder rest
0	string was broken when i got it .
0	and the other strings you could not tune the violin
0	i would give it one star but the violin itself is beautiful .
0	do not get this violin if you are thinking about actually learning violin .
0	mine did n't even come with the tuner .
0	the bridge was not even the right bridge for it .
0	the bow itself was bent .
0	like they say you get what you pay for .
0	saves you the hassle and the money .
0	lesson learned read the comments before buying .
0	horsehair too lose , wouldnt produce sound
0	it was missing items .
0	i only received the violin not any other accessory .
0	the strings were too short .
0	giving it one star .
0	not worth the money .
0	bought this as a starter violin for my niece .
0	and i specifically paid extra for the pink one .
0	also , i expected the violin to be heavier .
0	i thought it was too light ! !
0	the case was excellent !
0	you got what you paid , i over expected too much , no surprise .
0	the bow is missing as well as the extra strings .
0	and the back of the neck is not painted .
0	not worth buying at all .
0	the tuners are absolutely useless .
0	they do not work .
0	broken an missing everything else
0	there was no bridge .
0	the bow broke as soon as i tried to adjust the tightness .
0	nothing about the product was usable .
0	let me get this out of the way -- i know nothing about instruments .
0	it goes to show as i bought this off of amazon .
0	so we took it took a local violin shop in pasadena .
0	so we left the music store with nothing to show for it .
0	do what i did n't -- save your money up .
0	do n't waste your money like i did .
0	i was very disappointed in this violin .
0	do not buy this violin unless you only want it for decoration .
0	i would like to know how this happened .
0	so disappointed we were looking forward to a full size volin .
0	three days later we received a second volin .
0	this one was together and everything worked .
0	as a veteran public school orchestra director , please head my advice .
0	i see these unfortunate instruments brought in all the time to my classes .
0	these instruments are horrid .
0	i liken the tone quality to that of a cardboard tissue box .
0	the tension from the strings often pulls the button out from the bottom .
0	please do not be swayed by the low cost and colorful paints .
0	the strings were poorly attached .
0	bridge not set , up no instructions string not attached , and not completely painted
0	this violin has not worked out for my daughter .
0	my son is literally sitting on the couch crying this violin is so bad .
0	he saved his money to buy this piece of crap .
0	i can not believe how horrible this is !
0	you get what you pay for and this truly reinforces that sentiment .
0	recommend to look elsewhere .
0	the package is missing a bridge and also missing a rosin .
0	it was awful does not work at all .
0	it always too tight or too loose never fit in the right way .
0	e-tuner did not work .
0	first let me say that i am not a musician .
0	not even worth a star.delivered with broken string in a dirty box .
0	there was no tuner or other spare strings .
0	well , all i can say is , this product is a complete joke .
0	do n't waste your money buying it .
0	this violin is very poor quality and you really get what you pay for .
0	the one that arrived for me is n't even playable !
0	i bought this for a christmas gift for my autistic adult son .
0	however , when i opened it i got a big shock .
0	i am very disappointed .
0	plus , he ca n't play it with no sound coming out .
0	i am returning this item .
0	no matter what we did it sounded awful .
0	it had to be tuned constantly .
0	we also noticed the craftsmanship was horrible .
0	they paint actually left wet spots that dried wrong .
0	in addition the pain ran leaving little streaks and running bumps when it dried .
0	not all of the surface was smooth , which was very noticeable .
0	to be honest i would n't use it as toy either .
0	not a prop or even a display item .
0	it would not even make good fire wood .
0	should have known better-cheap cheap cheap .
0	bought it for a middle schooler who has been playing for 3 years .
0	she could n't tune it and her teacher could n't either .
0	this was basically a toy .
0	no sound comes out .
0	its more of a wall piece then an instrument .
0	will return asap ! ! ! !
0	2-stars only for the look of it .
0	this item was poorly made .
0	i want this item replaced so my niece can begin her lessons .
0	i knew it was n't a real violin , but geesh this is terrible .
0	she was disappointed and so was i .
0	the product received , late and wrong color , is actually fine .
0	this only came with the instrument itself , the resin and the bow .
0	the sound quality was n't that great either .
0	it 's a beautiful violin .
0	however , the bow , rosin , and case are all terrible .
0	the case is covered in , mildew spots also .
0	all the trouble has deflated my enthusiasm somewhat .
0	you get what you pay for i guess .
0	as it is , i 'm looking into that now .
0	it 's quite frustrating .
0	but it is a 'll quite a let down .
0	would n't hold the tune .
0	spent most of our time re-tuning it .
0	i got a violin , rosin , and bow inside of a case..
0	came with a broken string
0	string broken immediately , unable to get in right tune !
0	cheap materials and poorly assembled .
0	you get what you pay for but not even worth the time .
0	we ended up return it .
0	this looks like a violin , but that is where it ends .
0	the pegs are not fitted properly making it very hard to tune .
0	the tailpiece is made from what seems to be metal , very wierd .
0	oddly the highest quality item is the case , but not by much .
0	i have several years of experience and i have a hard time playing it .
0	not the string it came with either .
0	totally fell apart in 23.28 seconds
0	took forever to receive .
0	bent strings and not useable upon delivery .
0	will not stay tuned .
0	bought this for my 8 yr old son to start learning violin .
0	now we have to spend more on a violin that wo n't fall appart .
0	save yourself the $ and get something better than this !
0	still whaiting for it hope it gets here before easter it is a gift .
0	my violin is tuned and set up correctly .
0	the bridge is in the correct position even though the violin was shipped dismantled .
0	i rosined the bow with nice rosin i also bought on amazon .
0	i think the bow is defective .
0	basically an over priced `` toy '' .
0	do n't waste your money .
0	waste of money so far
0	no instructions were sent .
0	it 's just been sitting in my room , waste of money .
0	pay a little more for a better starter violin .
0	violin shaped object.. thats what grade school music teachers call it .
0	will not allow in a class or a learning type environment .
0	do not buy swap meet quality violins .
0	toys you will get what you paid for when buying this .
0	good luck getting refund fron crescent..look at reviews on ebay too .
0	horrible product i wouldnt buy this item .
0	my son was very disappointed .
0	do n't waste your money received violin missing bridge and can not adjust .
0	you will be doing your child and his or her teacher a huge disservice .
0	i would give this product ( and seller ) 0 stars if i could .
0	i bought this last christmas as a starter violin for my child .
0	its a toy at best , and not playable at all .
0	we also paid a lot extra for expedited shipping and shipping was not expedited .
0	if you want a playable instrument do n't buy this .
0	save your time and do not purchase this !
0	i was so excited when this came .
0	this is cheap plastic .
0	the pictures make it look fantastic but in reality , it 's pitiful .
0	this thing never made a sound , guys ! !
0	i will just spend the extra money to get a decent one .
0	do n't waste your money on this one .
0	also violin arrived with 2 1.5 inch scratches on side .
0	violin arrived not as pictured .
0	cheap low quality unplayable junk .
0	the case is moldy on the outside .
0	i 'm almost afraid to touch the violin as we are allergic to mold .
0	very cheaply made , sounds horrible .
0	missing a lot of stuff and barely put together .
0	more like a toy .
0	and it came with about 8 strands of the horse hair broken
0	its a piece of junk !
0	dont waste your money !
0	standard violin for beginners but the picture is misleading .
0	read the description and items included before you purchase .
0	expect to make the extra trip to the store
0	mine is a dcor item now .
0	can not hold a tune or even keep a string taught .
0	if i could give a worse rating i would .
0	didnt even make a sound .
0	the bow strings broke the first time we tried to use it .
0	the glue gave way .
0	then , while trying to break it in the bridge fell out .
0	we did n't find it until nearly a month ago .
0	it will cost us $ 70 to have a new bridge cut .
0	look elsewhere for your instrument .
0	the clip on tuner did not work either .
0	this product is absolute junk !
0	i guess you get what you pay for .
0	it was way to low .
0	cheap and hard to tune
0	not only did my violin have less than acceptable measurements ( i.e .
0	try to buy at a shop where you can inspect the damn thing !
0	the rosin that it comes with is also garbage .
0	i would have returned it if shipping was free .
0	wont tune & everything is loose .
0	spend the extra money if you want to actually play it .
0	the only thing i liked about this order was the case for the violin .
0	other than that , the violin was a bad quality .
0	i could not get a nice sound out of it .
0	i feel this violin would be best for toddlers learning to play .
0	it has a nice look to it but it 's also made of plastic .
0	i just wanted to try the violin to see if i liked it .
0	i did't want to get too expensive so i bought this one .
0	the biggest is not being able to tune it .
0	this is exactly what you 're paying for .
0	spend a little more to get something better .
0	good news is it does work , just sounds terribly .
0	basically everything in the product information is true .
0	but , pegs do have an excessive tendency to slip out of thir holes .
0	also , the curved side goes up .
0	yea right , not good insruction .
0	this gong looks great , but sounds terrible .
0	i can make the same sound using pans .
0	the item has good visual presence but the sound is annoying .
0	it is very tinny and cheap sounding .
0	i would not recommend purchasing unless you want it for decoration only .
0	it makes a sound ... that 's about it .
0	the noise that is produced is similar to a kitchen pot or skillet .
0	i 'm very disappointed with the purchase .
0	it does look nice but do n't expect an authentic gong sound .
0	this is tiny ! ! !
0	this was very cheaply made .
0	we left it with the nurses for other patients to use .
0	this is not a gong .
0	it is a cymbal .
0	i trusted the woodstock brand to have a good sound .
0	i guess that was a mistake .
0	i spent about 20 minutes playing with it and ultimately decided not to buy .
1	this item was exactly what i was hoping it would be .
1	otherwise , it worked great !
1	this polish has worked wonders on every cymbal i 've worked on .
1	just be careful not to take off your logos .
1	great product , left my cymbals with a brand-new shine .
1	i 'm part of the school of drummers that likes shiny cymbals .
1	unfortunately for me , this involves a lot of work .
1	fortunately for me the zildjian cymbal polish actually makes it much easier .
1	as long as you follow the directions you 're good to go .
1	this thing really works and really cleans your cymbals ! !
1	the problem is that it changes the color of your cymbals a little !
1	but over all it 's a good product !
1	good buy , well wrapped , on time and as needed .
1	even going lightly over the logos is risky .
1	it did the job and the black residue is gone from the polishing process .
1	a little goes a long way though !
1	keep your investment clean !
1	k 's a 's zbt 's whatever !
1	makes them all look great !
1	finish off with wd40 !
1	takes so elbow grease and time but results are incredible .
1	not too harsh on logos either .
1	works great on all my brilliant finish cymbals like my a customs .
1	use paper towels rather than a cloth towel .
1	cloth towels have a tendency to spread the black stuff around the cymbal .
1	with paper towels you just grab another clean one .
1	awsome on brilliant finish only ! ! ! !
1	excellent was able to clean a 50 year old zildjian cymbal
1	i 'm thoroughly impressed !
1	i have one picture that will show you juse how effective this is .
1	i do have a couple recommendations regarding the use of this polish .
1	worked great on my natural finish sabian cymbols .
1	i watched youtube videos on how to apply it and i got great results .
1	good polish removes stick strikes pretty well
1	it 's so shiny .
1	works like a charm .
1	best way to keep your cymbals clean .
1	works good with a $ 40 auto buffer that i purchased on amazon .
1	wow cleans cymbal very well
1	i cleaned my zildjian cymbals with this .
1	it did not discolor anything , it did not take away the traditional finish .
1	overall very pleased with it .
1	cleans the cymbal really well .
1	more product is needed to have a very clean shiny finish .
1	best used with a towel to rub off the tarnish in the cymbals .
1	to some magic powder and other fad items .
1	my cymbals look great .
1	far more important ... they sound brilliant .
1	you probably get used to it or think `` that 's normal . ''
1	well it 's not .
1	you bought the cymbals you have because you liked their sound .
1	so ... . duh ... keep em sounding that way .
1	my hints : wear latex/surgical-type gloves .
1	have lots of soft , clean , white rags around .
1	soft paper towels are ok too ( viva ) .
1	i do the whole side of a cymbal at once .
1	use newspaper for working surface .
1	start on the underside .
1	like putting on suntan lotion .
1	change the towel often .
1	you ca n't clean with a dirty towel .
1	the product probably says do a small area at a time .
1	the expanding concentric circles solve that problem .
1	this is hard work .
1	but the end result is wonderful .
1	i should 've waited because nothing else worked near as good as this did .
1	takes a lot of rags and elbow grease but made mine look like new .
1	it looks like hey faded a little though .
1	bought this after buying pre owned cymbals on craigslist .
1	not sure what they mean by `` brilliant finish '' , but i digress .
1	followed the process with all of my cymbals .
1	all the cymbals turned out great , especially the a custom china .
1	was like i was looking in a mirror .
1	10/10 would buy again in a heartbeat .
1	lots of elbow grease and lots of rags but it works .
1	bought this product for my son , a freshman in high school .
1	he was very pleased with the performance of this polish .
1	not too harsh , not too abrasive , but does the job .
1	note : i was not compensated in the anyway for this review .
1	this polish works wonders .
1	like the difference is incredible .
1	put on a small amount and spread it around .
1	any time the cloth gets black switch to a new part of the cloth .
1	way exceeded my expectations , thanks a lot zildjian !
1	easy to clean your zildjian cymbals .
1	drop a few drops around your cymbals , and wipe gently .
1	do n't need to work it in .
1	key is gentle motion .
1	made my zildjian hybrid shine like a new dime .
1	took off a star because i still have to do the work to shine em
1	best shine for the money
1	but this stuff works well .
1	worked very well on an old cymbal .
1	with a good amount of effort , this works well .
1	shined them up like a charm .
1	took the tarnish right off my banjo nickel plated parts .
1	no issues and fast shipping .
1	this is a good product .
1	works pretty good but did n't remove some of the tougher stains .
1	but i love my kit .
1	its good stuff , just watch the logos
1	polishes cymbals to look brand new !
1	i bought used hi hat pair on ebay ; the seller never cleaned them .
1	so , i got this and cleaned overall ... beautiful shine ! !
1	using this with my wuhan cymbals that i also purchased on amazon .
1	great product and works as advertised .
1	o yeah yust what i wass specting very brilliant and finish
1	excellent cleaner makes your cymbals look brand new .
1	i would recommend this to anybody that needs a cymbal polish
1	this worked just fine on traditional finish cymbals for me too .
1	just makes them a little more shiny ; )
1	this polish is really good , i have zht pros .
1	this is a very decent product and i would recommend it to anyone .
1	the product works very well .
1	the supplier sent the product very quickly and it arrived in good condition .
1	product works very well .
1	i have zildjian a customs and they look brand new .
1	i kept the polish about a 1/4 '' back from the markings .
1	to remove the residue rub away from the logo .
1	change the cloth often and you 'll be fine .
1	long story short my zbt 's were exposed to salt water from our aquarium .
1	overall a good product .
1	received these speakers on time and installed them the same day .
1	the sound flows nicely as i have other speakers throughout the house .
1	i would highly recommend these .
1	i tested them as main front speakers but did not handle bass well .
1	even certain tv shows with surround is great .
1	you can hardly beat the price as well .
1	unless you want to spend $ 1000 on a bose or something .
1	anyone with speaker wiring experience can easily do this .
1	they work so much better without the switch .
1	anyway its a great value and buy .
1	very well made - solid speaker housing , sturdy brackets .
1	installation very straight forward .
1	hooked up with 12 gauge cl2 wiring delivers impressive sound with decent low end .
1	feels deck and pool area with natural sound .
1	easy adjustment for targeting sound pattern .
1	great value i suspect will deliver great sound for many years .
1	good clear sounding speakers .
1	these speakers are well suited to my pool deck .
1	the pyle home pdwr53 would also work well indoors as surround-sound speakers .
1	very good response with the shipping .
1	i put the speakers in my garage .
1	they were easy to mount .
1	the old pioneer sx-550 drives them well .
1	i had to boost the base two notches from nominal but overall good sound .
1	the reduced price sealed the deal !
1	installation is easy , steel brackets are included .
1	wiring is by binding post .
1	good choice for the price , but not recommended for the high-end audiophile person .
1	great speakers , the sound is so perfectly proyected that it fills my backyard .
1	we attached these speakers to our home karaoke system .
1	we also used the pyle pro 600 watt mixer .
1	everyone loves to come to our house for karaoke .
1	my husband was looking at similar speakers but they were a little more expensive .
1	he told me i did good and was very delighted with them .
1	love how there 's three different hook ups on the back !
1	also like how there 's handles makes them easy to carry !
1	i ordered two of these speakers to try as a pair .
1	perhaps dropped during shipment ?
1	it still worked just fine .
1	a little disappointing , but ultimately worth the money .
1	it has what no other speakers have 3 different types of inputs .
1	binding post , 1/4inch , and speakon type .
1	plus it is well priced .
1	i also love them because i bought them from j & r music world .
1	so i was confident that they would arrive in perfect condition and they did !
1	my units were packed in 3 sperate packages each .
1	the sound is clear enough but the construction needs to be improved slightly .
1	great set of speakers .
1	pyle is your choice to go .
1	with size and weight it tops some others .
1	got a gig that you need some speakers this is your answer .
1	very light weight and easy on the back .
1	mine was shipped inside two protection sturdy boxes with much padding .
1	arrived perfect with no damage .
1	speakers as installed solid .
1	this is the best speaker bargain i have ever purchased .
1	perfect , extremely well packed and fast shipping on a great bargain .
1	not real powerful , but they 're not supposed to be .
1	i like the fact they are light .
1	i am going to add a handle on top for one-handed carrying .
1	right size for the space i have .
1	great sound for 8 '' speakers .
1	i purchased 4 of these through amazon .
1	apparently amazon fulfilled my order through different sellers .
1	in addition , the dust caps do not have the same logo pictured .
1	due to this , i my speakers are visually mismatched .
1	besides the different appearance , everything else is literally identical .
1	the specifications , weight , and sound are identical .
1	one of the four speakers arrived in perfect condition .
1	i use peavey , mackie , jbl , etc .
1	and some lower end like this one depending on the use .
1	for these speakers , i seem to have found the sweet spot .
1	i love this speaker !
1	wish i had another !
1	great sound and light weight .
1	like the speaker a lot just had shipping problems
1	my church is `` mobile '' right now .
1	we rent different places on sunday to worship .
1	i am the worship leader and by default the de facto sound guy .
1	we have a sound system but it 's much to bulky to move around .
1	i bought two of these speakers and a small amp to do the job .
1	i say for the price it 's a bargain !
1	these speakers look good and sound great .
1	using them in a high school weight room .
1	more sound and power than we will ever need .
1	sound is clear , bass is strong .
1	just a solid set of speakers .
1	these are just as advertised .
1	they sound ok connected to an ensoniq mr rack sound module .
1	however , the bass is n't well developed in these 8 '' speaker cabs .
1	if you need good bass , go for the 12 '' speakers .
1	for general pa use these are fine .
1	great bass and the price was right .
1	the first one arrived broken the and it was quickly replaced
1	can i pay the differents from the 8in for the 10in
1	i love the speaker but it has a horrible smell to it .
1	i 've been spraying it with fabric freshener every since it arrived .
1	i ordered two pyle-pro speakers and today they arrived right on time .
1	one small problem , one was damaged .
1	problem fixed in ten minutes and i have two inexpensive but nice speakers !
1	i purchased two of these speakers and mine were almost identical to another review .
1	one speaker was in perfect condition and one was apparently dropped then packaged up .
1	horn tweeter does not work at all .
1	the speaker that does work actually has great sound .
1	nice bass and clarity for the price .
1	i own a haunted attraction and purchase many different types of audio systems .
1	item was as listed .
1	very impressed with the power indeed !
1	found these added versatility to my set up .
1	the venue was a banquet room with relatively low beamed ceilings .
1	the sound was amazing .
1	i was running everything in mono .
1	it saves the cost of hiring a professional dj so our charities benefit .
1	for our sized venue , about 70 watts is all i needed .
1	it was definitely a two person job .
1	again , having the speakers raised to ear level makes all the difference .
1	i ca n't wait to give it a try .
1	the digital output went straight to my panasonic av receiver 's optical input .
1	looks like i 'll get rid of the radio shack mixer .
1	it has a microphone mixer built in .
1	the seismic audio 12 inch starts even lower at 50 hertz .
1	they came very fast and on time .
1	the sound is excellent .
1	i am now going to pass this info onto all of my music mates .
1	the price was amazing .
1	didnt realize how big the width was 7.5 '' .
1	muy bueno el producto llega a tiempo se ve en buen estado y todo .
1	ahora lo voy instalar en mi auto .
1	price was great , i needed three .
1	just installed them in wedge monitors .
1	have n't used them in a live setting yet .
1	these horn tweeters are really good for the money .
1	they came on time and undamaged .
1	they sound like a high quality horn tweeter .
1	this was a good buy for the money .
1	i have order these to replace my old ones that were blown .
1	items came on time and without any damage .
1	powered them up to ensure they work and they hit highs really nice .
1	still have n't installed them yet but all work as described .
1	had them a good year or so now .
1	it 's a good product .
1	not bad for the price .
1	received quick and work as expected for the investment .
1	really happy with this horn piezo my custom build box sound clean with this .
1	i 'll start off by saying that i used these tweeters for pro-audio use .
1	the pyle tweeters showed up in some searches and even on amazon .
1	i knew i could get them in a couple of days from amazon .
1	very nice bag for drum chimes .
1	bought for my son for his birthday to protect his chimes .
1	he has many drum cases but never has bought one for his chimes .
1	very nicely padded and looks like it will hold up well .
1	this case is lightweight and totally protects the chimes .
1	does what it 's supposed to .
1	the tre35 fits perfectly and it 's it 's well constructed .
1	i would recommend you purchase this to protect your chimes during transport .
1	would recommend to anyone .
1	the photo is of a one-piece garlein recorder .
1	the title states that it is a 3-piece soprano recorder .
1	this is very confusing and leaves one wondering what will be delivered .
1	the description is also lacking .
1	i own an aulos garklein and sopranino and i am pleased with the quality .
1	i wanted to have fun with my grandchildren while teaching them music notation .
1	this was a good way to start .
1	the 8 year old loved it .
1	the 6 year old was a bit too young .
1	they are both excellent quality and i would definitely buy them both again .
1	love them , i will be buying more seakers and amp in the fulture .
1	sipping was fast and the price was great !
1	you could almost use these as your speakers they 're so good .
1	i definitely recommend them and the sound via daisy chaining is great .
1	they 're definitely one directional .
1	they do their job well for the price .
1	the price was right and the performance was stellar !
1	definitely worth the investment .
1	works just as stated on the websites man awesome dude your gnarly man dude !
1	thanks for the great price
1	the only downfall is the vinyl covering .
1	the best part was turn around was only one day on a prime !
1	planning on ordering a couple more .
1	but i 'm pretty impressed with the sound .
1	so you get from the horn just the brightness needed .
1	over all sounds pretty good to me .
1	i have 3 of these floor monitors .
1	when they work , they work well .
1	the sound from the combined woofer and horn is very clean .
1	the bass is full , while the driver delivers the mid-highs crisply .
1	the only problem you may have is with shipping .
1	the new ones i got were fine and performed perfectly .
1	for the price , you wo n't find anything better .
1	so far so good .
1	i bought two of them and they are working great .
1	im using it for vocals and so far so good .
1	great sound for the price
1	works awesome ! ! ! ! ! !
1	i ordered this product as a church floor monitor .
1	because of the price , we did n't expect much .
1	we simply figured that it would be better than our current disfunctional sampsons .
1	the monitors sound spectacular , at least in comparison to our 200w 's now .
1	500 watts is no joke .
1	the minimum sound on the monitors is still quite loud .
1	anyway , we 're very proud to have these .
1	the sound is great and the build seems very solid .
1	it 's a good mic system for my church .
1	i love these mics ! !
1	they were perfect for the set up we had at our church .
1	the lights are color coded to make it easier to adjust them individually .
1	i have all good things to say about them .
1	i even have a suggestion that helps .
1	i highly recommend these to anyone and the sound quality is excellent .
1	thumbs up to pyle ! ! !
1	just wanted you to know what a top quality product this is .
1	keep up the good work .
1	i bought this mic set for karaoke shows .
1	i started with 4 and only had 2 shortly after .
1	the other 2 mics are still going after 2 years of abuse .
1	it bent the metal screen , but still functions .
1	not for pro vocalists , but good for karaoke .
1	i received the order in one day , with no extra shipping charges .
1	the system works great , i would recommend it to anyone .
1	nice product for the price .
1	its missing an rca out puts to connect to a home stereo .
1	otherwise a great product for the price .
1	when they work without drop outs they are wonderful .
1	tons of gain and great clarity , tone , etc .
1	it stays completely quiet until someone speaks and then the buzz comes through .
1	i have emailed the seller a week ago but no reply .
1	after buying a new cord at radio shack the buzzing went away .
1	very good product , well worth the money .
1	i would recommend this product to anyone .
1	i do small dj venues and this is the perfect product for the job .
1	would buy this product again .
1	right out of the box it was a very simple set up .
1	no need to set channels for microphones .
1	four mics , four volume buttons .
1	clear sound from these four microphones .
1	the receiver is super , really powers the mics well .
1	voice gain is good and there is no external sound picked up .
1	upon my initial test trial i found the system incredibly responsive .
1	battery life and distance range is approximate yes , but neither were grossly overrated .
1	this unit payed for itself with the lack of rental/late fees .
1	generally , better equipment than those rented also .
1	spend more if you 'd like , i stand behind my purchase .
1	these microphones are so sick !
1	the solution ... ..reflective tap .
1	i have experienced some cut outs on occasion but that 's expected .
1	nothing major and not long lasting .
1	the most expensive sets do the same thing .
1	the 110/220 power selection was important and gives me more options in practice locations .
1	great bang for your buck .
1	these wireless mics are working well with our church sound system .
1	easy to install and everyone is enjoying using them in our church programs .
1	i get the product in a short time and is working good .
1	for me i do not have any problem .
1	but every friday night the kids come to sing and dance .
1	now they can do both along with being the star sing along .
1	these microphones are great for the price .
1	i own a karaoke bar , the mics .
1	get dropped & brake so i have purchased a lot of mics .
1	over the past 16 yrs .
1	as long as these are available , i will continue buying them .
1	i love these mics .
1	& so do my customers .
1	they were shipped on time and in tact .
1	did n't want to deal with the manufacture after reading the reviews .
1	i 've realized you did n't included the bill into de boss .
1	i would like you to send me a copy of it to my e-mail .
1	it is yendely33 @ gmail.com .
1	thanks to you and have a nice weekend .
1	use for my church do n't understand the other output not enough direction encluded
1	i got this mic for my church and i never regret purchasing it .
1	working well , my daughter love it .
1	awesome equipment for the right price .
1	great unit very good and reliable .
1	the system was easy to install into the gator case and easy to use .
1	i like the graphics and separate volume control knobs for each microphone .
1	there ok for the money .
1	but the construction of the mics could be a little more rugged .
1	i think that under heavy usage this mics should be a little more rugged .
1	as a karaoke dj i use these mics because they are affordable .
1	this is the second pyle system that i have purchased .
1	great value , works great , just what i wanted
1	mics go out sometimes though
1	provides a lot of entertainment at new years and during birthday parties .
1	great ! ! ! !
1	very nice set for the money !
1	they work great at the start .
1	i enjoy using pyle equipment .
1	their price range fits nicely into my budget .
1	they offer great customer service , and their products are durable with good quality .
1	i recommend this pyle wireless hand-held microphone system .
1	the equipment is very good .
1	i have had problems with 2 microphones recently .
1	i am contacting the support to buy new ones .
1	overall the equipment is very easy to install and operate .
1	you can buy pyle equipments .
1	it was at the fairground there and they worked great !
1	i really like them and they have great sound !
1	can be set up with one channel or use four individual channels .
1	good quality for the price
1	i love this system , and would buy it again if needed .
1	no problems thus far .
1	very happy with this purchase .
1	works great for what i need .
1	clear sound from these four microphones .
1	the receiver is super , really powers the mics well .
1	voice gain is good and there is no external sound picked up .
1	these are great wireless mics for the price ! !
1	they have a good range and are very durable .
1	i was amazed that the microphones still worked perfectly after that .
1	these mics are awesome ... the only flaw is that they are not rechargeable !
1	i love the sound !
1	i have bought other wireless mics before .
1	more expensive name brand mics .
1	for the price you just ca n't beat this deal .
1	top notch quality , light weight , great sound .
1	shipping was much quicker than i expected .
1	i could n't be more pleased with my purchase .
1	i would highly recommend this product to anyone .
1	very low powered and mics feel light and cheap .
1	i would not recommend this for live applications .
1	this works very well !
1	easily cut a port hole in my bass drum head of the desired size .
1	tons easier than cutting by hand with an exacto knife .
1	works well , but i wish it 1/2 increments as well !
1	the best and roundest hole i ever cut
1	do n't really know what to say other than - it did the job .
1	not a good idea .
1	just be sure to take the head off the drum , duh .
1	yeah , i tried that .
1	cuts a nice neat hole , with a clean edge .
1	this little tool is a real jem !
1	this thing works so well i literally laughed out loud when i used it .
1	and you can use it multiple times .
1	and it still works !
1	perfect cutout in one try .
1	now my recording palette is enhanced in a very good way .
1	i wish there were better ( or any ) real instructions .
1	but it certainly did the job .
1	works like a charm !
1	the product works well but the package was open already when i got it .
1	i think it was n't worth it to claim this .
1	cutter worked as it should .
1	be patient and measure the center point correctly .
1	the most difficult part for me was picking the location of the hole .
1	after that it worked great .
1	used this on a remo fiberskyn bass drum head .
1	so the lower right will be the lower left when cutting .
1	works just as intended .
1	works great and takes very little time .
1	the picture of the cutter is pretty self-explanator .
1	i am super glad i did .
1	i did n't even need to trim anything .
1	i highly recommend this to anybody .
1	clever device that works as advertised .
1	makes a professional looking bass drum hole that looks factory installed .
1	ordered this nifty little tool , followed the directions , and it worked perfectly .
1	looks great , allows access for microphone placement .
1	great tool for the price .
1	not as clean as the hot can method but less chance to burn yourself .
1	overall though it got the job done .
1	4 starts for product being inexpensive and there for future uses .
1	i had the hardest time finding a christmas gift for my brother .
1	it 's perfect for anyone who needs to change a string on the go .
1	he said he was thinking of getting another to keep in his case .
1	there are a few areas of weakness , however .
1	otherwise , a good use of hard earned ducats .
1	it has worked wonders and come through in a pinch .
1	so this item has come in handy .
1	good for most things i need to do on a regular basis .
1	it was built with actual quality in mind instead of just quantity .
1	i purchased this for my son who is a guitarist and a budding luthier .
1	i like the combination of options on this one tool .
1	it saved me from buying at least four different tools .
1	this is a real handy tool every guitar player should have one .
1	string changes are easy with the assistance of this tool .
1	it was a great gift !
1	purchased as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend .
1	great tool for working musician
1	a bit overpriced for the overall quality .
1	this is a great thing to have in your case for any gigging guitarist .
1	excellent tool does exactly what it says .
1	best all in one tool on the market .
1	heavy duty good quality solid multi tool !
1	all my friends love it !
1	it has everything you could ever need for working on your bass or guitar .
1	it 's practical and has a great feel .
1	it also came with a cool carrying case .
1	all in all a great product .
1	even though the us allows up to 5 inches some countries do n't .
1	this is a great tool for traveling musicians .
1	the only complaints i have were the price and the design .
1	i think the price was kind of steep for what you get .
1	it 's a decent quality , but not $ 20 good .
1	the design can easily scratch your guitar .
1	i still think it deserves 5 stars though .
1	its nice to have an all-in-one guitar for gigs .
1	he was very happy to be able to fix the guitar by himself .
1	i purchased this violin about a month ago .
1	i received it about 5 days after i ordered it .
1	the violin looked really good .
1	but it did not come with a bridge attached .
1	i had to retune it all over again .
1	i started to get annoyed after doing this a few days in a row .
1	she said that the strings needed time to settle in .
1	she gave me some peg drops to keep the pegs from slipping .
1	i rubbed a little on the pegs and it seemed to work .
1	unfortunately , the violin does not play itself !
1	whatever sound i create on the violin is exactly what the violin produces .
1	even my teacher thinks it 's great .
1	a habit which is so often a trendy whim ! )
1	once i got enough rosin on the bow , sound came out !
1	i hope my super naive experience will help someone else !
1	i recieved the violin quickly .
1	it has a nice case , and the violin looked really nice .
1	there is a fine tuner for each string which is really helpful for beginners .
1	the rosin was included which was nice .
1	this was a great investment for a starting violin .
1	i use to work at one , and believe me they rip you off .
1	what shall i write ?
1	i have been trying to purchase one violin .
1	please tell me what type of violin i can order .
1	please let me know which violin i can order .
1	unfortunately i was not careful in tightening the strings and broke one right away .
1	but i doubt this is a fault of the product .
1	i have purchased new strings and hope to beginning playing again soon !
1	the resin that came with this package was not good quality though .
1	anyway , overall great product and great seller !
1	a dream purchase ! ..
1	definitely would buy it any other time too .
1	but i tell you what , i am very pleased with my purchase .
1	a small set of instructions would have been very helpful .
1	it is a beautiful violin .
1	it wo n't interfier with the sound quality .
1	oh well , like i said it does n't effect the sound quality .
1	i spent $ 4.00 and the new rosen worked like a champ .
1	before doing so i was worried that i had a defective violin !
1	the rosin included , is awful .
1	was very very easy once i figured out what to do .
1	and apparantly set tilted back ever so slightly towards the bottom of the violin .
1	apparantly if you keep it taught you can warp and eventually snap the bow .
1	( no one had mentioned that yet ) .
1	i thought that was how you store it.. no .
1	i felt really silly about that one .
1	but after you get all that straitened out it is very satisfying .
1	so all in all this was a great purchase and i am very pleased .
1	who knew i could buy a violin this cheaply ?
1	if you are like me , and not really sure .
1	first off , this is not a $ 50 violin .
1	otherwise , though , it 's a fine instrument .
1	the rosin is n't great , but it works .
1	the violin itself sounds fine .
1	but i do n't know that for a fact .
1	but this is fine for what it is .
1	my instructor was impressed with the price i paid for this violin .
1	he thought i paid at least $ 200 .
1	it is a great beginner 's violin , well worth its price .
1	i recommend this violin for any beginner , student or adult .
1	it is made well for its price .
1	great violin for its price !
1	i was a little hesitant about buying this instrument .
1	i was worried that the quality of the sound would not be good .
1	this made a difference in the quality of sound .
1	this violin is cheap .
1	both in construction and price .
1	it is , however , a decent instrument ... with a few caveats .
1	a rental , if available , however , might be a better option .
1	2 ) the chinese-made bridge is small , flimsy , and poorly designed .
1	bad quality control leaves these things somewhat random in their effectiveness .
1	4 ) the strings .
1	like most things on this violin , they skimped a lot on the strings .
1	they certainly assist in the tin-can sort of sound you 'll hear when playing .
1	-- all excellent quality for students ) or an anton breton or some such .
1	i received the violin , and this is more that i expect .
1	i recommend buy it .
1	this is the 1st violin i bought .
1	the case is a nice case also .
1	would reccommend purchasing from this supplier in the future .
1	this violin was an exceptionally good bargain .
1	everything was as promised and defect free .
1	my daughter loves it .
1	being a newbie , it was difficult to set up at first .
1	i got some better stuff from amazon and it works great .
1	it arrived right on time , nothing broken , nothing out of the ordinary .
1	now i can practice at home and leave the schools violin at school .
1	thank you , would buy from again .
1	i am very impressed with the company that sells this violin .
1	i rarely ever write reviews , but this company is worth the praise .
1	violin was as advertised .
1	good quality , good sound , nice finish .
1	arrived on time and was packed very well to insure against damage .
1	it looks like a toy .
1	it 's a bit oddly resonant but really not bad at all .
1	works adequately but dents very easily .
1	this is a beautiful beginners violin .
1	violin was well packaged , clean .
1	otherwise , we like it a lot .
1	update still very satisfied .
1	strings have reached the point adjustment holds , great fun , sounds good .
1	my family loved it .
1	great product for the money so i bought another one in a different color .
1	they sound like they cost a lot more .
1	next time trying the colored violin !
1	i ca n't complain at all .
1	for the price , this violin is usable and actually decent in appearance .
1	you 'll need to do a few things first : 1. buy rosin .
1	it 's great that they include one but it 's pretty terrible .
1	just go buy a different one .
1	i got a nice rosin for $ 2.50 nbd 2. buy new strings .
1	it was pretty easy to do and the violin sounds and feels phenomenally better .
1	3. customize your bridge .
1	it 's a cheap bridge but it does work .
1	it stays without issue once you do that .
1	i may have to sand the bottom or something .
1	i intend to work on a solution that today .
1	it 's good for the price .
1	for the price i was amazed .
1	but do plan on getting strings .
1	i spent about 200 % more for strings than i did for the violin .
1	and plays better than could have hoped for .
1	got it for my son to learn with and he 's doing well .
1	but do plan on getting good strings .
1	great violin for my daughter for school .
1	thought it was great .
1	daughter took it to school and brought it right back home .
1	i would definitely recommend this violin for a beginner , it looks very nice .
1	and i received the violin very quickly .
1	i bought this for my daughter , and so far she 's loving it .
1	the sound it projects out too is not bad for the price .
1	i will definitely recommend it .
1	the violin is beautiful and accoustic and well cut and sound ours great .
1	the quality is very impressive for a price so low .
1	i look forward to learning more .
1	delivered as promised and when promised .
1	it is well worth the money .
1	i love it and i recommend it .
1	a string broke when she tried to tighten where do i get more ?
1	the quality of this violin is great for the use of beginners .
1	are a bit sloppy , but they have n't caused any problems so far .
1	the quality of the rosin is definitely debatable .
1	however , it was definitely worth the money .
1	good product for the money
1	great violin , worked flawlessly , and would recommend
1	sup up ! ! !
1	it was better than paying 20 a month to rent a used one .
1	my daugter and her teacher think its comparible to rentals .
1	the only issues is the wood had a small chip .
1	the rosin was broke and the carrying case ripped at one of the seams
1	great communication from seller !
1	great item for price !
1	wish it came tuned .
1	but a great product for violinists !
1	the bows , nonetheless , could have been a bit more sturdier .
1	hence , you may need to consider buying a better quality bow .
1	this item exceeded my expectations .
1	the case on it 's own is worth the price .
1	it is a full sized violin .
1	we bought this for our daughter for christmas .
1	over all i would recommend this for a child or beginner .
1	this is a decent quality first violin .
1	it came with a case , bow , and rosin .
1	we have not used this violin yet ; but it is beautiful .
1	this is alright for newbies .
1	just right for beginners .
1	it is a very generic violen but it serves it purpose .
1	so heads up get an extra bow .
1	very fast shipping..excellent value.. could n't ask for a better experience .
1	it also fits within my gifting budget .
1	but as for the fiddle itself i am highly satisfied .
1	so if you are a beginner then this should be a good violin .
1	it 's a great instrument for learning
1	pretty good tone for a cheap violin .
1	this is a very good product and well worth the money spent .
1	i understood that i bought a cheap violin .
1	i understodd how to place the bridge .
1	here is what happened to me .
1	first off , my instrument did not arrive until the lates time possible .
1	aside from deliery problems , the thickest string snapped after i slackened the strings .
1	it was coming undone .
1	i also feel that the rosin is cheap ; cheap for a cheap instrument .
1	now , all of that aside , i love my new violin .
1	also , who cares about the pegs ?
1	all you have to do is push and twist .
1	the case is not nearly as 'flimsy ' as i thought it would be .
1	this violin is beautiful !
1	it has a wonderful sound and easy on the fingers .
1	i would highly recommend this to anyone .
1	this is an excellent violin for new students .
1	broke string setting it up , but had ordered extra .
1	plays well and is an enjoyable instrument for our sons and granddaughters .
1	i bought this violin as a gift for one of my neices .
1	i really liked the violin although i am not an expert .
1	this is a very good starter violin .
1	it was shipped pretty quickly .
1	i think i received it in less than a week .
1	my son loves it !
1	the case can be carried like a backpack which is very handy .
1	also , i was happy to see it came with a bow and rosin .
1	this was a great buy !
1	let alone a shoulder rest .
1	this violin has a beautiful tone to it looks gorgeous and is really neat .
1	just received my violin .
1	product is as expected , is as picture .
1	this was a pretty good deal for less than $ 50 .
1	did i mention the price is the best around !
1	here we would have paid $ 100 + for the set up .
1	with a little score reading foundations i started playing several tunes already !
1	rosin is not glued on the channel so it tends to break .
1	the violin , bow and case were beautiful and well worth the money ! !
1	but ... it is a beautiful violin and is worth the cost .
1	violin came in just a few days after ordering .
1	it was exactly as pictured .
1	it has a nice light satin finish to the wood .
1	the rosin worked fine .
1	the tuning pegs will need pushed in a bit to get them to hold .
1	i play a few other instruments though so i am a little familiar .
1	getting the strings in tune for any violin seems to be tricky .
1	so be careful ! !
1	because you can break a string easily .
1	probably not necessary for students .
1	i used a guitar tuner to tune the strings .
1	the strings on the violin were just fine though .
1	and overall , the violin is pretty much ready to go .
1	just needs tuned after you get it .
1	the bow seems to be fine and no problems so far .
1	overall very good deal .
1	it is high quality for the price .
1	it has a rich deep sound .
1	do n't be perturbed if at first it does n't sound perfect to you .
1	give it a little time .
1	every bow stroke sounds a little better until you get everything coated and stretched .
1	hope this review helps you out .
1	for the price , it is a very good violin .
1	it 's a wonderful violin and well worth the money i paid for it .
1	i look forward to enjoying playing it often .
1	i love this product !
1	will certainly recommend this product to others when given the chance !
1	sounds like a student violin .
1	i have lots of musician friends .
1	when i received it , it smelled like it had just been painted .
1	our drummer thinks it was spray paint .
1	but as a student product i think it is great ... ! ! !
1	at some point i may have it stripped and finished .
1	just what i was looking for great sound .
1	a great starter violin for anyone , and it plays and sound great .
1	this violin is awesome !
1	it was a great purchase for my student violinists .
1	i 'd recommend it .
1	it 's better quality than i expected for such a good price .
1	excited for my daughter to open it christmas morning .
1	this violin is beautiful and exactly what my son wanted .
1	i was very pleased with this violin and case .
1	it came in a very nice protective case with rosin .
1	its very shiny black and has the wow factor .
1	it will be muched used by the young lady in my family .
1	nice quality and beautiful instrument .
1	teacher says that it is because it is painted and the sound gets muffled .
1	she plays it at home all the time for practice and for fun .
1	it is a very loved instrument .
1	would still purchase from seller again in future .
1	i bought this for making music videos , i do n't play violin .
1	a member of our band in the video plays a short solo .
1	for just over $ 30 it works great .
1	i need lessons though !
1	i am absolutely in love with this violin .
1	the sound quality is great and it was very afforable !
1	i love this violin !
1	it is better than i expected .
1	i found the case to be nice and the violin is beautiful .
1	took me awhile to adjust strings and bow .
1	taking longer still for me to remember how to play remotely well .
1	it is so easy to use this violin is worth the price .
1	it may not stay into fray a long time but it works very well .
1	it is a great tool for beginners ( like myself ) .
1	this purchase is the best for a beginner .
1	nicely constructed , with a rich shiny coat of black paint .
1	the sound is very good .
1	it 's lightweight and easy to handle , so also good to arthritis hands .
1	i happen to see this buying other items .
1	i play the violin , first you will need to set the bridge .
1	its not hard , it will sit under the string between the f holes .
1	the curved side will face the finger board .
1	place it under the strings and stand it up .
1	it will sit between the little notches on each f hole .
1	center the feet with those notches .
1	do not glue it on .
1	place each string on the notches on the top of the bridge .
1	now it should look like a violin but the sound is everything .
1	it needs to be in a perfect spot for the violin to sound right .
1	that can weld the peg shut and you cant turn it .
1	push in with force as you turn the peg .
1	sorry about yelling at you , grace .
1	the instructions helped me .
1	thanks for your service and the nice case .
1	this violen has exellentsound quality .
1	i have no problems with it .
1	the violin arrived today , within a week of ordering it .
1	the case alone was worth the money .
1	i suggest going on youtube for set up instructions and tuning advice .
1	for this price , the violin is unbeatable .
1	an excellent starting instrument and a surprisingly high quality case .
1	this was a very good experience all around ( minus the wait ) .
1	i just have not had the time to do a review .
1	everyone loves the fact that her violin is black .
1	it came fast in its own case and is really nice .
1	we have not had any problems with this violin .
1	i will be ordering other things from here .
1	i received my package today and my wife loved it .
1	will most definately order from seller in the future .
1	he likes it and shows it off
1	so i took a chance on this painted violin .
1	bytheway , buy your own strings .
1	tuning is extravagantly hard because the pegs wo n't stay in place .
1	basically , you 're hamming it farther in .
1	luckily , the wood is malleable enough .
1	but as long as you keep playing , it stays in tune . )
1	i 'm not in debt , and i get to enjoy myself .
1	works well and all products were definitely included .
1	a little assembling to do but a good buy for sure .
1	this violin was great !
1	great starting violin for the price .
1	for the price this seems like a good little violin to start on .
1	the estimated recieving date was between the 27th and 5th .
1	it came early on the 26th .
1	the tuner is decent , however i suggest downloading a violin tuning app .
1	the rosin works if you read the directions .
1	the pinstriping is n't perfect and the wood does have some blemishes .
1	but with everything costing under $ 40 i ca n't complain .
1	the bow is very sturdy and works nicely .
1	over all i 'm very impressed .
1	also notice that the brand of this model is crescent .
1	i love the color it shipped fast and very easy to set up .
1	i do not know why others wrote about problem .
1	i would recoment it .
1	i like the violin and all the parts that came with it .
1	for the price , this is a decent violin .
1	she used a utility knife .
1	they also tuned it for her .
1	she needed peg dope , but since then , it 's been fine .
1	this violin is cheap but comes with all the necessary tools to play .
1	i bought a supplemental tuner and a shoulder rest .
1	the bow is pretty bad quality .
1	the frog is already falling off and many of the horse hairs have broken .
1	got the job done for my brother .
1	that 's enough to get you making noise .
1	i did n't order a fretboard sticker , but i think i should have .
1	all in all , this product is decent .
1	i expected something polished , but for the price it came out great .
1	i bought this for my wife ( she 's the talented one ) .
1	being a guitarist , i 'm spoiled with set bridges and locking tuners .
1	after a little fumbling i got it .
1	the tuner is handy and will work with other instruments as well .
1	overall i 'm pleased .
1	it is a realy good deal..my wife loved ... and mi baby girl too .
1	amazon is the best and the easy way..
1	this tool is really good .
1	great sound and quality .
1	i liked how quickly and was delivered .
1	color tool admire elegant .
1	the only thing not good rosin .
1	thank you , good job .
1	this has been my experience with the violin so far .
1	why 5 stars then ?
1	the strings on the violin are amazing .
1	the strings ring out nice and sound beautiful .
1	the digital tuner works just like any other chromatic digital tuner .
1	it 's as accurate as the snark tuners i own .
1	this will be more than enough to start you off !
1	i am looking forword to hearing my son play his new vilion .
1	perfect starter violin , good sound and good quality .
1	the violin was pretty good in size and weight .
1	the color was fantastic .
1	the only problen was that the bridge was not attached because of shipping purposes .
1	the sound quality is great , especially for how cheap the price was !
1	i was shocked , i would recommend this product to any starter !
1	the strings are low quality but good to start out on .
1	give it a couple months then upgrade them .
1	it 's great if you need a violin to start learning on !
1	my sister is picking this up while i am learning guitar .
1	was better than expected , came early and was overall pleased with this purchase .
1	it came with everything needed .
1	i would suggest picking up some better rosin .
1	it is a violin for 40 $ .
1	does it sound great ?
1	does it hold its tune ?
1	what i got was a cheap , functional and playable violin .
1	i ordered this product and it was not exactly what i expected .
1	i was contacted by the seller immediately and they remedied the problem expeditiously .
1	this is my first violin .
1	i am self taught and when i learn something i research a lot .
1	violins naturally are work to learn and play !
1	know what you are getting into !
1	it will not be professional quality , because well.. it is n't !
1	at least they were nice enough to include any , i guess ! ) .
1	but the one included does in fact work just fine .
1	then i had an issue with usps ( lucky me !
1	awesome worked well for my son !
1	the crescent is a clean , decent starter violin .
1	this particular finish was quite nice ; looks just as pretty in person .
1	i highly recommend this style violin !
1	i think this was a great price for what you get .
1	it is absolutely well worth every penny .
1	came quickly and can not wait for my daughter to open it christmas morning .
1	overall , i 'm happy with my purchase .
1	well packaged and a great bargain for the price .
1	i received it on time and was very pleased with the quality .
1	what a great find !
1	did n't expect the quality for the price - extremely impressed !
1	would recommend to everyone beginners - advanced
1	it was beautiful everything we wanted for our son and more .
1	and rhe price was just what we were looking for .
1	should be a great first learning item .
1	for this price , it 's more than worth it !
1	the violin is shiny with a nice wood color .
1	the sound is nice and loud .
1	the electronic tuner is great .
1	once we put rosin on the bow the violin was able to be tuned .
1	she was so happy when she opened it christmas morning .
1	i think it is a great starter instrument for anyone .
1	it 's a cheap entry level instrument .
1	it 's great for a beginner but that 's all .

1	i am very happy with my purchase .
1	set up was incredibly easy .
1	the violin comes with a relatively well detailed instruction manual .
1	the quality of the product is much better than expected .
1	the violin itself is also constructed rather well .
1	the construction is all wood and very light .
1	the bridge fits snugly without any modifications .
1	the pegs will slip during tuning , as with all violins .
1	simply apply light pressure while tuning , or purchase some peg drops .
1	the strings ( once in tune ) are adequate .
1	the bow and rosin work well with this outfit .
1	the frog glides well and setting the desired tautness is very easy .
1	my package came with the crescent mt-60 tuner .
1	luckily i was correct on the first try .
1	for the price , the quality can not be beat !
1	this is such an awesome item .
1	i 'm very pleased !

1	other than that , great buy !
1	i like it a lot .

1	she is teaching herself how to play and this is the perfect starter instrument !
1	excellent price for a full size violin with bow and hard case .

1	my teen liked that she could select the wood color

1	this villain got to me before the date they gave me .
1	also with my daughter just learning its perfect for her
1	i love m violin .
1	still unsure how the tuner works instructions are sketchy at best .
1	i see a number of people commenting about plastic pegs .
1	the one i got has lacquered wooden pegs .
1	for the money you ca n't go wrong .
1	my toddler loves it , great product for the price .
1	definitely better quality than i expected .
1	it 's a great starter/student violin , but be warned .
1	there are youtube videos of how to remedy this problem .

1	the truth is that it is an excellent product .
1	i loved it and i plan to buy another one .
1	best violin that is under 50 dollars .
1	works great , comes with everything needed to sound great .
1	recommend that this is for a beginner
1	you always hear horror stories about cheaply made violins .
1	on that following birthday he presented this to me .
1	it was perfect for what i needed .
