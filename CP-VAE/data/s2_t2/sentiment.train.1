the book reads like a storybook in paragraph form .
the book has both a contents page and an index for easy referral .
i especially liked the fact that an index was included .
so many crochet books do not include this .
the index makes it very easy to find information on a particular topic quickly .
the recommendations for people just learning to crochet are fantastic .
i learned with a b-1 hook and a fingering weight yarn .
i always appreciate having a teacher with a sense of humor !
i thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a few things as well .
i would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the art of crochet .
easy to understand and a prompt service too

maybe some experts can pick up a few pointers too .
this book is a great source for every level of experience .
i 'm a beginner and it was recommended to me .

anyone wanting to learn to crochet will truly enjoy this book .
this is a must for your stitching library .
what do you say honey , a few more hours of crocheting this evening ?
i decided i wanted to learn to crochet .
this was ( and continues to be ) an excellent resource .
there are sections pertaining to pattern reading .
this book was that help i needed !
it shows every stitch and step in great detail with diagrams to help .
it also goes into some of the more advanced techniques , including tunisian crochet .
i really recommend this book for all crocheters .
everyone could probably learn something new from it .
therefore , i ca n't really comment on the projects .
it is more of an instructional book .
i bought this book to help me to become a better crocheter .
this book was great for that .
never heard of it !
could n't find it !
) , but the guage that they give in the pattern is weird .
i had to calculate ratios in order to choose an appropriate yarn !
i am much more confident reading patterns and trying out new stitches now .
i would definitely recommend this book .
jazz is very much a living , oral tradition .
what an amazing book !
all of these artists bring such vital and unique music to the world .
there is a thread that runs throughout all of these artists .
they have humility , drive , and an almost selfless commitment to their craft .
billy hart 's conversation was very touching and humble .
every chapter has taught me something about my own musical development .
i hesitated at first , but nabbed the kit on a lightning deal .
the cd and dvd are easy to follow along with .
she loved it , wo n't stop playing
i decided that i wanted to learn to play the ukulele .
it 's certainly not the best ukulele but you get what you pay for .
it is a very nice instrument for the price and seems well-made .
she 's been enjoying it for months now .
bought last christmas for my grandson .
great gift for a 10 year old who wants to learn .
the sound is great and the book is easy to understand .
it 's good for beginners
a little harder than i thought it would be .
my 13 year daughter received this for christmas .
i wish the instructions where a tad bit easier to follow .
other wise no complaints great buy !
this is a nice little ukulele !
i assume this is the fault of the strings more than the ukelele .
either way , it now holds its tune with no problem .
i got this kit in 2013 before it was remodeled with dvds .
mine happened to shipped without the book .
alfred 's was so good to us .
he was , and still is , very impressed by them .
play every day to get the strings stretched as quickly as possible .
this uke is simply a cheap wood laminate or veneer .
yes : i like the uke for kids .
and this uke being laminate is fairly sturdy .
is this the cheapest of the cheap ?
was n't then , is n't now .
it 's also not student or professional level either .
those are way more $ $ $ .
you 'll have a way better instrument that you 'll be happier with longer .
if you ca n't though ... budget instruments exist for a reason .
i 'm looking into acoustic electrics and solid wood ukes now .
my 16-year-old loves this and taught himself to play .
basic starter ukulele , works just fine !
5 stars for this set .
learned playing the instrument after only 3 hours .
i bought this as a uke for my sister 's wedding .
i was worried about buying a musical instrument that i had never touched before .
this one delivered and the quality is exactly what i expected .
keep tuning and playing and you will enjoy it .
we also used it for the guest list at the wedding .
i recommend this starter ukulele kit .
i has everything you need to learn the ukulele .
great ukulele but i ca n't tell if it 's real wood
great for the price , has a hard time staying in-tune .
my daughter learned to play the ukulele very quickly .
the lessons are easy to read and allow you to go at your pace .
the ukulele was adequate for her to learn .
i wanted it soon , and it was on primenow .
i bought a tuner and a simpler instructional booklet .
my other instructional booklet has also helped me more .
i have n't tried the dvds yet , though .
the gig bag is a giant joke .
if that 's what 's pulling you towards this kit , turn around !
this is a good starter package .
the bag is not padded but still good to have .
i ordered the guitar for my granddaughter for christmas .
she was delighted and so were we .
she has already had three lessons and has done great .
a `` gig bag '' is included .
not very protective , but it 'll keep the dust off .
overall , a nice value for the money , and suits its purpose well .
great product , now both my grandson 's can play .
it 's just perfect !
g'daughter received this for christmas present last year and plays if often .
it was a good package deal and was worth the price
my daughter loves it !
great for a beginner .
book is helpful and pretty straight forward .
the two year old boy loves it !
this is a good sturdy ukulele , and the book is easy to follow .
great for a beginner !
perfect starter for my 9 year old .
going to buy another one for myself so i can learn with my son .
the included instructional dvd is a bonus and helpful !
very easy to follow and lots of fun
i 'm writing this nearly four years later .
then it was tuning daily .
after a few weeks of this , the uke held a tune great .
the `` firebrand '' ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood .
it 's kind of dead-sounding .
they make fine adjustments quite smoothly , and hold well over time .
they were all , however , finished to a much higher standard .
i left empty-handed , but will probably get a better uke sometime soon .
it promptly went into the giveaway pile .
we have n't watched the dvds , because the book has been great .
so it 's not the c am f g combo very common on youtube .
update : i changed the strings to the aquila nylgut aq-4 set .
it 's really very good !
nice product for the price .
excellent deal for the set !
it has everything that my good niece needs .
thanks for the unequaled service !
my wife just loves it
fun , functional starter .
just what i ordered .
gave this to my 11 year old grandson and he loves it .
a full kit with everything you need to begin at a good price .
my 15 year old granddaughter loves this ukulele .
and learned to play it in no time at all .
exactly as advertised and prompt delivery .
very happy with this purchase ,
having fun learning to play .
the dvd instructions are very easy to follow .
not real wood but fun to learn to play .
the book is hard though
got this for my 10yr old daughter .
she enjoys playing on it , able to play comfortably .
i bought this guitar for my six year old grandson .
it was everything i had hoped for .
i would recommend it to everyone .
the tuner works great for our frequent tuning needs .
it was a nice thought though .
all in all a great starter kit .
glad we bought it for her !
wish the guitar came with a peg to attach a strap .
otherwise , nice starter set for my just-turned-8 year old .
perfect for children to learn on !
complete except for stand .
ordered stand and extra picks separately .
child is ready to learn .
guitar did n't come with shoulder strap as it states .
good guitar though for the price .
my granddaughter just loves this ukulele !
so glad `` santa '' saw this on amazon and bought it .
the ukulele itself is pretty sturdy .
the strings are plastic and hardto push into .
the case is very cheap very thin .
i love that the book comes with cds for easy listening !
nice sound great price .
took it on a mission trip to belize and gifted it to the church .
i see tons of people complaining , `` it does n't tune well !
whether it be a 1000 dollar instrument or a 30 dollar instrument .
how long does it take to break in an instrument , you ask ?
a good hour or so of playing , at least in my experience .
but this is a ukulele , not a flute .
alrighty then , enough about the instrument , the other stuff it came with .
but it gets the job done oddly efficiently .
for my daughter 's 13th birthday .
good value for the price .
bought as a gift , the person enjoyed it .
i think this is great for beginners .
haters will hate but i love this uke .
you get what you pay for and this little guy does the job
love love love this .
i am learning so much .
absolutely great little instrument .
stays in tune for a while once you break it in .
product exactly as described .
my teenager is very satified
this was a very nice ukulele for a beginner .
my son absolutely loves his ukulele .
we have yet to start using the book and cd .
i feel this is a great beginner instrument for my 5yo .
our son is so excited

my daughter has learned quite a bit from the book and software .
this guitar is exactly what it is - an entry level guitar for kids .

this is a wonderful kit for the beginner .
i was impressed with the overall quality of the guitar and the teaching tools .
note : the guitar definately does not come with buttons for using a strap .
i bought this for my 9 year old daughter to learn on .
i highly recommend this for any parent with a guitar interested child .
overall , i highly recommend this product !
we will probably end up getting lessons for him .
for someone starting out this is the way to good .
always some adjusting needed but not much .
great for the price , my daughter loves it .
do n't think she 's put it down much since christmas .
i 'd recommend buying an auto tuner .
very easy to learn .
package was left on my porch in the rain/snow though .
nicely constructed and has great sound at its affordable price .
arrived on time and in great condition with everything included .
only issue was that it cant hold a tune .
i bought this guitar for my granddaughter , it was her favorite gift .
she has been playing it non stop since she received it .
this is the perfect size for my six year old .
he loves it and is starting to watch the videos .
i think he wants to be a disney star some day .
i also e-mailed the seller and they said no it will not work .
conflicting messages , quite annoying .
i bought this for my 8yr old son .
good size and build for my son .
i picked on it some , lol .
as far as delivery , packing and that goes .
i was pleasantly surprised , the guitar seems very well made .
it 's the perfect all-in-one starting kit for a kid .
otherwise , happy customer .
very pleased with my 9 yr old 's first guitar .
our son would not put this down !
this is a good beginner ukulele .
this was a gift .
no idea how it 's doing
because it was new it was a little hard to keep it in tune .
however , it got better the more i played it .
the quality is nice .
also , the paint job should probably be improved .
but other than that , it 's really easy to learn .
bought for my daughter for christmas and she loves it .
i purchased this as a gift for a friend who really wanted to learn .
its a neat little set and he adores it .
my son loves it .
i expected better , despite the price .
i 've never experienced this with any other instrument , cheap or expensive .
however , the audio cd and the dvd were not included .
ok , my bad .
so , i 'm completely happy with this item .
perfect little instrument and hobby .
i am very happy with this purchase .
wont be using the book , dvd or case .
the case is very cheap and noisy .
the book is not `` beginner friendly '' .
i have never owned , played or even held a ukulele .
over all , perfect first ukulele .
its ok for the price .
but good money spent in my opinion .
and sounds great when tunned
i love alfred 's beginner book !
it has even help this old lady master the guitar !
my five year old has no trouble following , either !

thank you for such a great product .
i would highly recommend it .
ukelele is great and carrying case is good too !
love that it cane with extra strings .
great book and not bad quality ukulele for the price !
i eventually want to upgrade , but i 'm satisfied with this uke !
i 'm pleased with the product .
the strings must be stretched and broken in before they will stay in tune .
my firebrand ukulele plays great and sounds great .
do n't expect anything high quality- it 's thirty dollars .
for thirty dollars , you get what you pay for .
the uke itself is light .
i did n't even bother with the original strings because of other reviews .
the tuning held fine on those after retuning it a few times .
and it is not a toy .
that does n't make it a toy .
if you want something fancy , save your money .
still working on it but it 's a great starter kit
this is a beautiful guitar .
i mean really nice .
you will be amazed at the beauty of this guitar , trust me .
the electronic tuner is really difficult to understand , maybe it 's me .
the included cd however makes it very easy to tune the guitar .
nice course included also , good for beginners .
this is a great package , unbelievable quality for this price .
it 's beautiful , solid and my daughter just loves it !
good price and nice set .
she only wishes that a strap came with it .
my kids ( ages 6 and 9 ) are really enjoying it .
having a case come with it is a good idea .
the tone is pleasant -- plenty good for a beginner .
i 'm very pleased that i bought it .
this is a kids size guitar that has good sound .
it comes with everything your child needs to learn .
product was exactly what i expected .
best quality that you can ask for the price paid .

overall a really good choice for starters !
alfred 's kid 's guitar arrived in perfect condition .
this classical style guitar is a good choice , especially for youngsters starting out .
comes complete with dvd , music book & tuner .
my 10 year old daughter just took up guitar lessons .
turns out , this was perfect .
and for the price : $ 50.00 , we could n't go wrong !
great price for a great starters ukulele kit .
i would recommend this product to anyone interested in ukuleles : )

the guitar as a whole feels more solid than i expected .

bought it as a christmas gift for my little sister .
she adores this , it is prefect for learning on your own .
for the money this is a great buy .
my one complaint is that the uke loses it 's tune fairly easily .
but for the money it 's definitely a good buy .
nice quality and sound .
being prepared with this fact , i went ahead and clicked 'place order ' .
grandson loves his ukulele and it helped him learn to play ! ! !
it 's cool for kids
i would recommend buying a tuner like the snark-6 and some aquila strings .
nice ukulele and text cd also dvd !
i bought this for me sons 13th birthday and he loves it .
he found the book easy to follow and has learned .
this was a great gift .
however the strings did not last very long .
i absolutely love it .
the little carrying case is very nice also .
also , the thought of listening to a ukulele was not something i relished .
she loves her ukulele .
for a beginner - this is a great combo set .
she ca n't wait to take it to her performing arts camp this summer .
it comes with it 's own bag and travels very well .
she even took it on our disney cruise and played for the talent show .
great value for anyone looking to pick up this instrument .
just wished it came with earplugs !
it 's a nice little ukulele and great for the price .
it has a good tone and feel .
however , the case does absolutely nothing .
i would have loved it but the strings were n't real .
what a great package comes with a perfect case and instructions to help you learn
i have purchased three of these for my adult kids .
it is a nice beginner set and it was a lot of fun..
case is flimsy but its great to start off with .
book and cds are great tools .
good enough for a young child .
good product , fast delivery !
the book is not super helpful but everything else is great .
the strings will stretch for a while .
the case is a joke .
for what it is , it suffices .
great purchase for the price .
birthday present for my wife , gon na learn to play it myself .
seems like good quality , not a toy
we 've enjoyed the instrument .
it 's a good starter piece .
i bought this for my daughter and she loves it !
good cheap ukulele ; got what i ordered .
i never know what to get my brother-in-law .
its my baby uku . !
for the price and what you get .
bought this for a seven year old for her birthday .
best gift ever , and the price is right .
product as described , thank you .
my grandson is very happy with his new uke !
i love it , thanks so much..
lots of fun learning a new instrument .
perfect ukelele for a beginner .
it is a very nice beginners instrument .
the learning disc and book are both very helpful .
the ukelele does fall out of tune easily though .
very nice for the price .
i brought this for my 10 year old daughter .
she loved this ukulele ; it was easy to play and hold .
for the price , material and speed of service .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
1. this is a real uke .
but rest assured , there is nothing not a ukelele about this product .
2. this uke is the proper size .
this is a soprano uke .
it is the smallest style of uke .
it is a normal , soprano sized uke .
most people likely wanted a concert size uke .
if that is what you want , buy a concert size uke .
this is a soprano .
3. this uke will stay in tune .
you will find it goes out of tune quickly .
when that happens , tune it .
tune it again and again .
this is part of playing music .
even if its every minute or so , this is normal .
it gets better i promise .
any instrurment has to be `` trained '' to stay in tune .
so this product specifically , how is it ?
at the price i got it for its perfect .
49 is too much , but 37 was good .
what your getting is a perfectly normal soprano uke of budget quality .
you wo n't notice unless your really looking for it .
soprano 's are great for price and portability .
some people prefer a richer sound that comes from a concert .
this is n't the fault of the uke its just how the insturment is .
you 'd have this problem with any soprano uke .
its been a blast .
i 've really enjoyed this product .
its a cheap uke .
i wo n't dispute that .
but that 's what most people want starting out .
and you likely will , eventually , want a higher quality uke .
but that is pretty much true of every instrument ever .
the book is cool .
getting into an instrument always requires patience and dedication .
if you give it time , it will give you music .
quick shipment item is perfect !
my grandson loves his ukulel .
very nice for the money .
does not come pre-tuned .
excellent starter package at good price .
the uke was of good quality for a starter
good for a beginner the strings are a kind of cheap .
this is a complete starter kit .
the ukulele is well-made .
you will have to learn to read music ( they show you how ) .
you will have to learn the chords ( they show that too ) .
as always , it is a matter of practice and more practice .
oh , and did i mention practice ?
perfect for first timers .
yes , nylon strings require lots of tunning .
there 's an app or 20 for that .
once we dialed it in , its been nothing but good fun .
this was bought for a gift .
the set arrived promptly and in good condition .
my daughter was delighted with it and began learning and practicing immediately .
my child loved it .
she was playing a song by the end of the day .
very easy to follow and learn .
great product for the price
uke made in china but seems to be fairly well made and good starter .
for a beginner this has everything you need .
great for the beginner ...
granddaughter was really excited when she opened this !
arrived as scheduled , really nice , was purchases as a gift .
it 's ukulelishly adorable , and it actually has a decent tone .
thanks , israel kamakawiwo'ole , for making it cool .
everything you need to start your lessons !
i did add a tuner which came in very handy .
our 7 year old grandson was very pleased with it .
it came awesome , just as expected and in the right time .
i am enjoying my ukulele .
i had one a long time ago .
it came with a good teaching book with a cd and a dvd .
i did purchase a tuner from amazon , which works swell .
i am learning to play already .
it is fun to play .
it is a good way to learn to play .
the ukulele works and sounds good and it is great for the price
we got this for my husband just before christmas .
depending on the situation of course .
given as a christmas gift to my 12 yr old daughter .
she & i play guitar .
was worth my $ to me .
ordered this last , got it first !
good bought for xmas gift
i got it as a gift and he loves it .
the kit is worth the money
my daughter wanted this to learn ukulele on her own .
a good musical investment that is easy to learn and understand .
she does not read music but still learned to play with this .
my son loved it !
may change to steel strings .
my daughter is now an overweight hawaiian man !
it looks a little bit fragile and that is concerning .
my husband got this for me as a birthday present .
but , for a beginner , i would not trade it .
looks great and plays great !
my son complained about tuning difficulties .
great for a kid !
have n't open this yet .
i 'm even writing my own songs now .
great product and great price .
i think a pick should have been included with this .
great product , i love it , arrived as expected
my new ukelele is awesome !
it 's a great starter kit for those who want to learn .
the ukulele is very nice and sounds very good
bought for a child 's present .
very good quality for little ones to learn to play .
after researching , i decided to go with this set because of the price !
anyways i 've had it now for 4 months and i still love it .
my granddaughter loved it !
taught herself to play in a week .
uke is a quality instrument .
very happy with this purchase .
not saying i 'll ever play in public , but i 'm having fun !
cute little ukulele , just what my daughter wanted .
my boyfriend loved this kit !
i would definitely recommend this to family and friends !
my daughter plays it and it has a very good sound .
i would recommend it .
this is a great starter uke !
my son loves it ! !
great inexpensive starter kit to see if you 'll get into ukelele playing .
this little cheap uke is n't a bad starter ukelele at all .
in fact , it surprised me with its distinct `` plunky '' sound .
i love it strings were lose as a goose but i fixed
the only downside is that it does n't stay tuned for very long .
we always have to go and re-tune it , which can be frustrating .
great shipping time and ukulele
my son plays it everyday
it 's not too hard
it is simple and tiny .
we gave it as a gift and he is playing often .
this worked out great .
it 's not a high quality instrument .
but , it 's only $ 30 !
overall , great for starters who have an interest in playing ! !
little small but i got it for my son to learn how to play .
he is very happy with it .
this is a great starter kit ! !
great starter ukulele comes with everything ,
this was a wonderful purchase !
i got it for my sons 9th birthday a year and a half ago .
he has been playing it regularly ever sense .
it is easy to learn from the dvd and book that comes with it .
it sounds quite nice and has held up under much use .
always loved the sound of a good uke .
i never played an instrument before so i was ready for failure .
it 's been 5 weeks and i can comfortably play 15 different chords .
i 've never had so much fun and i highly recommend this package .
bought this as a gift and was happy with my purchase .
great sound for such a small instrument .
well worth the price .
my 16 year old grandson loves it .
the lessons are pretty easy to understand and straight forward .
practice practice practice ; it is not a tough instrument to learn .
thank you , naomi p .
this uke has become one my prized possessions and i absolutely love it .
this is probably the best purchase i have ever made for myself .
i am really happy with this started pack .
it has everything you need to start learning ukulele .
i enjoy learning to play ukulele on my own .
it is fun and a different learning exp
we learned to play thanks to this kit .
the real jewel in the crown 'tho is the instruction book .
it 's not the kits fault .
i am just not too good at making music .
i later bought a xylophone & have much better progress .
this product is good fpor someone who wants to play the ukuele .
i am too lazy .
the xylophone is easier for me .
for this price this ukulele is amazing .
the bag should be replaced but every thing in the package is great quality .
it comes with an extra set of strings which is helpful .
made my grandson very happy !
i loved it ! !
it is cute and good to play .
but i have to adjust tune for several times in one day .
my husband wanted this for christmas .
this is a great package for beginners .
2. the ukelele : the ukelele looks and feels decent .
it has a sticker that says made in china .
it comes pre-strung but it is out of tune .
since the string is nylon , i gave it a chance to settle .
it could be that the string included is a cheap one .
but after 1 song , you have to tune it again .
i could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more .
that is an easy fix .
each song have a chart on which chord you will use .
this is a great price for the package .
my wife was wanting this for her birthday and this was a great price .
the instrument is well crafted for the price and tuning it was a breeze .
they also included a cd and dvd to walk her through it as well .
you can always trade up later .
i bought this ukulele a few years ago as my first ukulele .
i eventually put some aquila strings on it and it sounded pretty good !
all ukes sound different and i think it 's just a matter of preference .
overall , i recommend this uke to anyone starting out .
i got one for my boyfriend and one for me to learn together .
he 's done well picking up the different strumming methods .
the dvd is easy to follow and very helpful .
if you do n't get it , rewind .
i am very happy with this purchase .
great value for a decent ukulele !
the gig bag is n't very good , but i ca n't complain .
i have n't used the cd yet .
this was a great beginning kit !
not the highest quality , but a great starter instrument with a good price .
for a true beginner , i found the dvd especially helpful .
for the price , the package exceeded my expectations and has been fun .
you get what you pay for and this is no exception .
i love the book with the dvd and cd .
it was a great deal for what i paid .
i used utube video to tune it .
i love using it and am ready for the next level .
highly recommend this ukulele .
this came in quickly with all the needed components .
for the money , it 's a great beginner instrument .
i would definitely recommend this to others !
it 's really nice !
good for any level learner .
i would n't ask for a better handbook or manual .
this was a present for my fickle daughter .
i know nothing about these instruments .
the strings are plastic .
on regular guitars , metal strings are used .
but for the price , this was perfect for a beginner !
its sturdy wood and all the material and instructional dvd are nice .
makes it a lot easier to learn .
purchased this as a christmas gift for my fiance .
definitely the best purchase i 've made yet .
i am trying to learn to play for my granddaughters .
has everything to start out with in this starter pack .
the first one arrived without the cd 's .
this is great if you want to learn the ukulele .
i would recommend this to anyone who would love to learn how to play .
bless you , alfred .
learn a new stringed instrument !
it hurts the fingers and stimulates the brain !
all the tuning and the chords are here .
i ca n't wait to dig into the cd 's and learn the rest !
i wanted something cheap and easy for beginners .
this one was perfect for me .
my son loved it .
spent hours learning instead of playing xbox .
good quality and easy directions all a plus
daughter loves it and carries it around everywhere she goes .
i on the other hand thought it was a very nice package .
definitely worth the price !
the ukulele is small but so appropriate for first time users !
must get for a potential musician : ) .
within 1 day music was pouring from my son 's room .
reasonably priced and great sound !
go for it ! !
bought this ukuele for my 13 year old son .
it is definitely not an instrument for someone looking for a long term commitment .
for beginners , and for the price it is a winner .
they do n't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings .
you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch .
it only took me about half an hour .
these people just do not know how to read .
it is a great buy though , considering the price .
i highly recommend this product .
easy to follow steps and directions .
a carrying case and extra strings are a definite bonus .
besides that , everything is great !
i lost my husband !
what a revolting developement this is eh ?
nice product for the price .
this is a really nice little instrument .
my only gripe is the nylon strings .
not that they are bad , only i prefer steel .
the manual and dvd and cd were good to have .
really fun for beginners !
i would recommend for any beginner or intermediate looking for quality and affordability !
my child loves this !
i bought this for my 87 year old father .
it is a very nice instrument and he was very pleased with it .
arrived quick , great quality , came with instruction booklet and carrying case .
was a christmas gift and the recipient loved it .
it 's the perfect starter for my beginner daughter .
they love them and are having a great time learning together .
this is a nice quality instrument for a beginner .
they began to play it almost immediately .
instructional booklet very helpful .
made a wonderful gift !
my son loves it ! !
good quality , not expensive and comes with everything you need to start .
great product my kid is having a lot of fun with it .
she is learning a lot .
i love this inexpensive complete starter pack .
it has everything that a uke beginner is looking for .
i recommend the starter pack to anyone looking for a good and affordable set .
i could see a beginner worried that it always sounds funny .
it would be nice if the song book included hawai ` ian songs .
this is , after all , a pretty hawai ` ian instrument .
i bought this as a christmas gift for my daughter .
so cute and easy to carry around .
it is the perfect size !
i did recommend this to a friend .
no broken strings etc ... i do suggest getting the auto tuner .
awesome starting kit for uke players .
all in all this can get the beginners into playing .
can you do something about it .
my son has been waiting for it.. thanks and god bless !
only thing missing was a pick or two .
perfect for my 7-year-old son who decided he wanted to take ukulele lessons .
the sound is very good and the size is perfect for a child .
i really ca n't understand how i got this for this price .
the book it comes with is wonderful on it 's own .
it 's a cheap ukulele , yes .
it 's pretty decent though .
it has pretty good sound though and is easy to tune .
good value for starters .
i figured if i really liked it i could buy a better ukulele .
i am ordering a better instrument and going to buy more books .
this package was exactly what i was looking for .
i purchased this ukulele simply because it was cheap and came as a pack .
i have n't had any issues with any aspect of this instrument .
stretch those strings out !
you can either buy a tuner or download one onto your smartphone .
i have an android phone and downloaded the app gstrings .
i ca n't wait to start learning how to play .
my biggest complaint are the strings .
they are nylon and tend to have a very muted sound .
i even took it to hawaii on a semi-spontaneous vacation !
my brother love it very much .
he play it everyday .
that is a real lukulele , not a toy .
i chose for the pricing .
good place to start .
will move up as i progress .
the quality of the instrument is sufficient for my needs .
i purchased this for my sister who has now taught herself to play .
the ukulele is well made for beginners to intermediate players .
it 's pretty sturdy and the sound is good once tuned .
it came with everything it was supposed to and was shipped very quickly .
one was tuned and placed in my hands and i immediately named it .
i was so happy , engrossed and transported .
this is uke is great for me .
having a lot of fun .
the ukulele is great if you are just learning the basics .
as far as the instruction book goes , it worked well for me .
i particularly liked how it showed different strums you can use .
i play lots of instruments and wanted to learn the ukulele over the summer .
good quality for the price , girlfriend and her daughter love it .
i would recommend this sight to others .
thanks for the great deal
got this to get started playing the ukelele before i visited the amazon rainforest .
't is perfect for their small hands , and mine .
get it , use it , live it , love it .
i like it very much lol
the instructions for playing the chords are simple and clear .
i recognize most of the songs and are easy to play .
only problem is the strings .
sting one ... play 's `` dead '' meaning it will not stay in-tune .
this is a great little ukulele kit .
has everything you need .
you will be singing and strumming in no time .
bought this for my 3-year old daughter .
it is light weight and small enough for her to handle .
produces a good sound too
very reasonably priced and the product arrived within the week .
he really enjoyed it till he sat on it and broke it .
only problem he really had with it was tuning it .
i am having a blast learning to play this ukulele ! !
i would suggest this for all ages !
this produce was great .
the uke seems great .
i would suggest purchasing the electronic tuner .
it was harder to tune than i figured .
the ukulele is very good quality i highly recommend it
when it arrived in the mail it was in my arms 24/7 .
overall it met my expectations by teaching me how to play the ukulele .
my son is 15 and is loving the ukulele .
this item is well made and is with standing a beating .
it appears to be very complete and it wo n't empty your pocket book
the ukulele was just what i wanted .
it came with a book and extra strings .
i enjoy playing it .
i would recommend this product .
it is a well assembled pack , perfect for learning and beyond .
i gave this to my wife for her birthday .
she practices with the book every night .
the dvd is fine and the case is what you would expect .
i bought this for my daughter who wanted to learn to play .
i got it only 2 days after i ordered it !
we have n't used the dvd .
the internet is much easier .
this has been fantastic for teaching myself the ukulele .
i have n't needed to change the strings and it 's still looking good .
so i just learned from youtube vidoes and also music sheets online .
the item and content are great - just not great for a little kid .
still takes practice and work ... i will learn it and love it
this set was better than expected ! ! !
the ukulele is professional quality & the sound is really good .
all the accessories that came with it was an added bonus .
can not say enough good things about it !
would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn to play !
i received it earlier than stated .
it had everything it said that it was supposed to have .
but again it is a great product .
now to learn how to play !
later when i have achieved more experience and talent , i can upgrade .
hint-get the snark sn-6 ukulele tuner .
but for learning the uke.. it really ca n't be beat .
it 's a perfect learning instrument .
there are better uke 's on the market ... those are for pro 's .
this is a starter unit .
frist thing is how to tune the ukulele
too early to say i have learned to play at this stage .
who can be stressed playing a ukulele !
my girlfriend thinks its sexy and its a good beach uke
for the price , i am surprised at how nice it is .
the carrying case is garbage so toss that and the rest is pretty nice .
can i play yet ?
nope , not even close .
i am having a great time learning the uke .
it reminds me of hawaii everytime i plink away at it .
everything i need to learn to play the ukulele was included in the box .
let the learning begin !
like the other reviews the strings are cheap and stretch a lot .
i should have popped for a martin though .
she absolutely loved it .
was a gift for my husband and he loved it .
it is quite simple to follow and the dvds are definitely very helpful .
overall i 'm happy with this .
easy to learn with cd .
still learning and having fun with it .
entertaining my nieces wth sing alongs
the book and instrument are just fine for a beginner .
this kit has everything you need , and the uke sounds great !
easy instructions and good tuning cd to come with it .
the expression of journey 's music comes out very well with this piano book .
this ukulele is fine for me .
it is a good starter as i am just 15 months into playing guitar .
the dvd is very easy to folllow and challenging with play along songs .
keep it in tune , it is a beautiful sound .
this is a really great starter kit and the price was right .
also , the ukelele is sooo cute !
other than those two things it seems fine for a beginnner .
as i was playing my ukulele i thought i need to share this review .
now that i can play decently , i still find this uke sufficient .
overall , the quality surprises me for what i paid for it .
i hope other beginners and casual uke lovers find this review helpful .
the entire package is well worth it !
i would recommend for anyone who wants to start playing .
this is a nice ukele to start with .
it brings all you need to start having fun .
decent construction for the price .
i would recommend for beginners and those careful with their belongings .
everything we needed to learn to play .
looks good and reasonable price ; firebrand is the brand on the instrument itself .
comes with a detailed book , cd and dvd .
nice way to introduce someone to playing the instrument .
i was n't expecting much from this really - the price is very in-expensive .
but i was pleasently pleased to see the quality of the ukulele .
great present - books and cd 's included for easy learning .
it was a gift , and i would recommend getting a tuner .
other than that it was a great starter kit for a beginner .
not the top of line , but great product for the price !
it is quite simple to follow and the dvds are definitely very helpful .
my daughter has wanted a ukulele for a long time .
this fit the bill perfectly for a beginning ukulele player .
came in a timely manner , instruction book is very clear .
ukelele looks adorable and durable .
strings are plastic , just in case you were wondering .
came in a box , just as described .
i am 72 years old -- have never played a string instrument .
this ukulele is so much fun -- i am having a ball .
so much fun that i ordered 6 for my grown children for christmas .
can not wait to show them that an old dog can learn new tricks !
this item was bought for a friends 14 yr old son .
the `` teach yourself to play '' was a plus .
let me start by saying that this is a fantastic product .
the uke : it 's fine !
if you 're prepared for this , it wo n't be too frustrating .
after a day or 2 , it was fine .
the book & dvd ( i used them together ) : fantastic !
perfect for a true beginner .
overall , this is a great product !
so i purchased this set for him for his birthday .
it 's very nice for a beginner .
my daughter loves it !
many easy songs for a newbie ( only had 12 lessons ) .
if you like journey 's songs , you 'll like this .
great for a beginner or intermediate level player .
sounds adequately like the original journey songs .
makes me feel like i 'm better than i am .
the songs are great .
i bought this book for a fmaily member and they were delighted with it .
really , what more could you ask for at this price ?
i 've always wanted to try out the ukulele , and now i can .
give it a try !
this was a good starter pack , especially for the price .
so i had to buy another pick .
the strings to tend to get out of tune quickly .
it seems to be the same string that goes loose in 2-3 days .
at the deal-of-the-day price it was a downright steal .
perhaps better quality strings would work better .
but a nice little instrument for a beginner , or for taking camping !
the book was unexpectedly high quality .
( have n't watched the video yet )
i bought this ukulele kit for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves .
she has been using the chord chart in the book and various websites .
most of what she is playing are from popular , fun songs by ear .
the instrument itself seems very cheap .
it is a dull brown with no grain and looks like pressboard .
i do wish there was some kind of electronic tuner included .
the tuning method for a ukelele is very different than a guitar .
it is a unique instrument in jr. high .
i 'm thinking about getting a mandolin for her next .
i have been considering picking up the uke for about a year now .
overall , i agree with some of the previous posters .
get used to it .
it just takes time and repetition - but is sooo worth it .
the ukukele sounds beautiful to me .
the product was exactly as described and even better than i imagined .
i would highly recommend !
i bought this for my 9 year old nephew .
i played the dvd and followed along .
i am offically hooked on the ukelele !
i am keeping it for myself and will probably order another for nephew .
i 'm hoping it will be a good transitional instrument to the guitar .
this uke is a great beginner instrument .
got here is reasonable time !
you just have to work with it !
good for the price , and the book is quite helpful !
first of all , i 'm really impressed by the quality of the instrument !
it 's a very solid little thing and puts out plenty of sound .
another reviewer mentioned that the strings slip .
tune it at least once a day if you can .
this starter pack is a seriously amazing deal .
was easily able to work around it .
i 've been studying classical guitar for 2 1/2 years .
the a-frame makes playing a lot more comfortable .
i 'm able to sit upright when i 'm playing .
when i used a foot stool i slouched over .
it 's a one-time buy ; do n't pass it up .
an investment that will save your back as you age .
my guitar a-frame support is exactly what i needed for my guitar !
i can literally play sitting anywhere .
so simple yet so essential .
it is just what i wanted and needed .
super quick delivery , item as described
it 's pretty easily adjustable .
this is the one to get .
this guitar stand works exactly as advertised .
there is also a demonstration video available on youtube .
but boy , was i wrong .
the instrument in general is easily to learn , but hard to master .
it is very easy to install and remove .
and most importantly i get the right support in a variety of chairs .
this guitar support is an excellent product .
bought it sight unseen and it turned out to of excellent quality .
this is a major advantage over the other guitar supports .
this is a major advantage over the other guitar supports .
just got this today .
it 's very adustable , compact and easy to store .
it 's exactly what i was hoping for .
it 's an excellent deal .
this is a neat little instrument .
i would definitely recommend getting the `` how to play '' book .
really fast shipping and exactly what i expected .
i then purchased a feadog d tinwhistle , and did very well .
both are appropriate and beautiful for irish music , and celtic music in general .
i am very pleased with this tinwhistle - and glad i stuck with it !
great for fun and civil war reenacting .
so glad this product is available .
otherwise the two use an identical design .
i ca n't believe guitar center does n't carry anything like it .
now that i 've tried it i 'm thrilled and relieved .
thank you so much .
this a frame was absolutely amazing as well as compact and portable .
it gives you more freedom to adjust it to a certain position .
where have you been all my life ?
this should be standard for all classical players .
( get the cheaper one though . )
no more pain finally !
no more with this amazing support !
plus the support folds in when i put away my guitar on its stand .
thank you for making this !
pure and simple awesomeness !
i like the way they are so adjustable .
the a-frame classical guitar support is everything i 'd hoped-for .
the service on this was also outstanding .
this is carolinda at troubadour music , the seller .
i am trying to figure out what is happening in your case .
we have never encountered a '' snapping '' noise on any instruments here .
you are welcome to return the the changer for a refund of course .
our teenager requested a pennywhistle for christmas .
he played it almost all afternoon , and loves the sound .
plays in-tune and is a nice product for the price .
the penney whistles were exactly as advertised and arrived in a very timely manner .
firemen are my hero 's and vets too .
oak really knows how to make a good product !
the whistle is perfect !
i actually play it more than my d now !
i 'd buy it again .
this tin whistle is great .
alright , i have played the recorder before , but not much .
and i am a beginner .
more for playing reels if you will .
youtube has some excellent comparison videos where you can hear the difference .
very high quality whistle .
very nice to play .
no rough edges on the holes or the body .
very handsome as well .
black mouthpiece on shiny , plated brass .
not as easy to play for a beginner as the clarke , though .
its great for that , its simple and the sound is very full .
i 'd recommend it if you wanted the instrument for the sound .
all in all , its great .
very beautiful to look at .
lost somewhere by deliverer .
promptly and politely replaced by retailer .
this unit has a very nice tone .
i have a clarke sweetone and the oak classic is noticeably cleaner sounding .
i am just starting to learn so ca n't really comment much on playability .
four stars for possible note challenges yet to be confirmed .
great whistle , comes with chord chart too .
i watched an episode of star trek where captain picard played a pennywhistle .
i decided to give it a try .
it 's fun to play and fairly simple .
after two months i 'm still having fun learning various songs .
clean , clear sound and fun to play .
this is my second oak d whistle , always good to have a spare .
indestructible and easy to use , came quickly .
i 'm very satisfied and i have had fun with it .
was delivered within a week or so .
heft and feel is great .
nice sound comes from it .
i hope someday i can play as beautiful as this pennywhistle looks .
bought this for a friend as a gift for christmas and she loves it !
she uses it all the time -- no complaints .
just a great little whistle .
i have a wide assortment of whistles but no oaks .
like the feadog it 's better than most all un-tweaked generations .
11 bucks well spent and my 8 year old has his very own whistle .
good way to start !
the look of this whistle are amazing .
the mouthpieces are perfect .
just as described and shipped on time .
the whistle plays great and i would for sure buy it again .
pretty -- though it does n't look wooden !
i 've bought several d tin whistles in the sub-fifteen dollar price range .
the sound / tone is classic .
i 'm quite satisfied .
i find it easy to play .
the small pamphlet that comes with the whistle is minimal at best .
the shipper could send it in a better package , though .
i was amazed that it arrived in one piece .
you 'll be glad you did !
graham 's writing and presenting style are excellent .
this book answers many questions as to the why and how of bowen therapy .
five stars are not enough for either !
i love the assessment piece that has been missing from my training . ''
you need to read this book if you are serious about bowen .
you wo n't be disappointed .
this is a good uke for a great price .
my 16 yr. old granddaughter was thrilled to receive this gift .
she has been playing it nonstop since receiving for christmas !
it has been truly well received .
with the cd and dvd and book - it works together perfectly .
a hit all around !
i got this as a valentine 's day gift to help me relieve stress .
i even use him to help teach piano .
i know i will be !
4 stars indicates this item met ( but did not exceed ) my expecations .
the geared tuners hold the tune well .
the fretboard is straight .
( very easy to do after watching a video online ) .
the new strings definitely improved the instrument sound .
really would like to learn to play a guitar .
thanks for your help .
the idea behind this product is genius !
and is the reason i give it 5 stars .
but seriously $ 50- $ 75 ? ?
it 's a piece of plastic !
all you 're doing is delaying the actual learning process .
why not just start by playing the actual chord .
`` but the strings hurt my fingers ! ''
those calluses to guitarists are like a toolbelt to the carpenter .
and wants to pony up the dough to do so .
if thats the case , i beleive its the perfect product .
practice , practice ... practice and good luck
you can play tons of songs by just using this little thing .
this was bought for my daughter who wants to learn to play the guitar .
it has been fun and very helpful in getting her started .
it was a real pleasure to deal with the seller as well .
bought for my hubby .
i bought this so he would play more wo his finger tips bothering him .
hes played a guitar for about 50 years and says its the real deal .
he loves being able to hold a button down instead of the guitar strings .
my house will be filled w music again
the instructional dvd is very helpful .
the digital tuner is a great bonus .
there are 2 different types of chord buddys .
perry explains it all in his youtube channel search chord buddy
my husband seems to be enjoying
easy to install on guitar .
after 2 days , playing the major chords without the tool !
very happy with this purchase !

i 'd recommend this to anyone that wants to start out .
a good 'quick-fix ' for someone wanting to play the guitar quickly .
iv learned several songs and seriously show off to my friends .
wish you had more chord options id give you 5 stars .
possibly an idea for the future
this has helped me so much in learning how to play the chords with ease
the idea of this guitar learning system is great .

great way to learn guitar
shipped fast and is a great package deal
now i need to practice
this allows her to be able to play and get strumming down for now .
not made real well but it is o.k .
waiting to hear the results
it is a christmas present .
i feel that the old one is a good one .
that is why i bought this one early .
wonderful product confident with learning songs in book in a day
great product for beginners that want to learn guitar .
otherwise get a teacher .
seems easy to use .
very good novelty and entertaining piece .
but not for serious learning .
works great and easy to understand
i received my chordbuddy .
it is a very unique product .
i have arthritic hands and am unable to make the chords .
i have not played in 60 years .
i found this at amazon .
it works as it says it will .
i would recommend it anyone .
i just play and sing for pleasure .
for someone who thought they could not play anymore it is great .
i like the system .
i can start playing immediately
i 've been struggling learning chords and strumming .
she commented that it 's great for older people who have developed some arthritis .
good product , good price , fast delivery !
did n't work real good sold on ebay
this is amazing ! !
we went through nearly the entire book ! !
easy to use ! !
we will recommend this to everyone ! !
they did a great job with this product
just started the dvd and was playing 'chords ' that same night .
i saw this on shark tank and immediately purchased it .
i was playing instantly ! !
easiest , most encouraging way to learn the guitar
great , great , great product ! !
easy to use and great instructions .
learn to play songs fast with this product
the chordbuddy is awesome !
i am very musically inclined but with small hands musically challenged .
after seeing a commercial i thought i would give it a whirl .
i bought a cheap yamaha acoustic guitar and ordered a chordbuddy .
i learned it quite fast .
only 4 chords , 4 buttons .
i scoured the internet for 3 and 4 chord songs and found many .
i found strumming was just natural for me knowing music so well .
if you have a good ear for music , strumming patterns will come naturally .
so i invested in a zager ez play zad20 guitar .
they are hand made in nebraska .
i have ordered replacement pads and booties from the great people at chordbuddy.com .
they are so nice and always helpful .
the sharks do n't invest in crap .
it works believe me .
all just those 4 chords .
i would n't hesitate to go anywhere and play if asked .
can i suggest zager ?
hey , have fun with it .
making music is heavenly .
it will bring you joy i promise !
the device actually seems to work .
it reignited my daughter 's interest in guitar .
i have bought many books and this is the best .
it helps keep you motivated .
works pretty good , my wife asked for this .
i 'm a professional guitarist and she is a singer .
she always wanted to play guitar but claimed she was not able to learn .
chord buddy did exactly as advertised , instant guitar .
she learned a few songs and learned how to strum etc .
but you still have to practice .
bought for my husband to learn , and it 's working .
easy to learn , good quality
it really work 's , i can play the guitar again .
i was curious as to how the chord buddy would work .
shortly thereafter i was playing labamba .
not as easy as stated .
but i will keep trying
i have however leared the buttons with the correct fingers .
my only problem is the strumming rythem .
i would suggest this product to anyone
the device seemed to work fine .
you can actually play songs that are recognizable very quickly .
this device presses down strings at the same time .
however at least you will know what the cord is suppose to sound like .
looking forward to learning all the chords .
just what my granddaughter needed to help her reach all the strings .
my husband loves this !
my grandson who is learning to play guitar , loved it .
especially , the song book .
its ok but does n't complete back off a chord as well as it should
this was my favorite christmas gift of all !
best thing ever for beginning guitar players .
works great , fantastic product .
great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
thank you tyler perry for a great invention .
god bless , larry k. kiss on entertainment
i bought this for my husband for christmas .
my experience was great initially .
chord buddy is a fun way to learn to play the guitar .
the green tab kept getting stuck .
returning though hope to purchase another for myself .
chord buddy is worth purchasing .
the song only has three cords in the entire song .
so , i got my guitar and installed the cord buddy per the instructions .
i hope this suggestion helps .
it did take a while to get the unit installed properly .
and i removed two of the rubber feet to prevent buzzing strings .
having done those two things , all of the buttons are playing perfectly .
now for the hard part - making sure i practice regularly !
my daughter is learning how to play guitar with the chord buddy !
what an awesome product to learn guitar : )
i think that it is a good product .
this product had my 5 year old nephew playing songs in 10 minutes .
i 've played for 30 years .
love the cord buddy , play nice sounds within minutes .
unfortunatley i broke it after week trying to adjust it .
i am so happy what great customer service .
i played my first two songs today ! !
i really like my chord buddy .
i feel like i can really play my guitar when i use it !
great product and fast shipping
so easy to use , love it !
pretty awesome cheat to learn how to play !
not for classical guitar i was so sad to have to return it !
i put it on this morning and im playing ! ! !
ok there are drawbacks .
the construction could be stronger .
maybe if it was made of metal ?
i would buy a second if it was made better .
but i just sung amazing grace and accompanied myself .
at 44 i never did that and always wanted to. ! ! !
i do n't no what i would of done without it .
who ever invented this thank you .
easy to use that is for sure .
i love this ! !
no way would i ever think i 'd be able to play a song !
instead i 'm able to begin playing it ! !
the chordbuddy exceeded my expectations .
it appears to be an excellent learning tool for beginner guitar players .
i would highly recommend this product to others
i bought this for my son who is learning to play the guitar .
this makes it very simple and is easy to use .
great tool for those of us who never played an instrument before .
i did not get the small rubber feet and had trouble eliminating bad strings .
did not fit on guitar as well as seen on tv .
still trying to figure it out .
a little harder than it seems .
or it was just me .
this came in the time expected and was just like the description .
i am hoping this will get her using her guitar more .
i bought this for my 12 year old daughter .
it does everything it said it does .
i just got the chordbuddy .
if you go to youtube you can get instructions .
you will need to press firmly on the buttons to avoid buzzing strings .
i was also surprised at the quality of the lesson material too .
have fun and strum away !
i believe it will work !
as of yet i have n't given it to her !
i am sure it is going to work for her ... ..thank you .
truly helps you learn to play and sound like a professional guitarist ! ! !
will work with someone with patience ! !
will give to my son as he just bought a guitar .
already i 'm playing like a pro !
i look forward to playing every day now that there is no frustration anymore !
may not work for everyone , with someone know how to play .
i would only recommend if you are buying a standard sized guitar .
thank you so very much !
its a great product easy to use .
this is no magic bullet .
you either got it or you ai n't .
so far i ai n't .
but maybe some day ... ... .
this is the greatest thing happened to a guitar , i love it .

easy to assemble on guitar .

[ ... ] for more information
like anything practice is the key .
item arrived just as described.new in package .
sold in stores for much much more .
great item for beginner or anyone wanting to learn
gave me instant confidence and easy to follow video .
once you put it on , you keep picking guitar up and keep practicing .
makes learning fun with perfect fingering every time .
no more wrong notes .
focusing on strumming techniques ; instructions provided on video !
once perfected it will be an easy transition to learning notes using fingers !
i quickly lost interest , though .
perhaps having the option to download the manual would be better .
i 'm glad i bought it , though .
just hope i use it more and learn more from it .
have n't really had the opportunity to really know what i 'm doing .
he thought it was a great item to get me started .
he has played since childhood and plays well so that impressed me .
easy to use and it works .
the information is well written and practice will have you playing sooner .

having fun playing a few songs .
great product , great buy !
this would be a great tool for the beginning guitarist .
maybe , it would / was fitted to an acoustic before i got it .
you start by learning strumming techniques .
you can then move one key at a time and learn to finger chords .
meanwhile this gets you playing right away .
sometimes i have to adjust it just right so the chords play correctly .
at first i had a challenge .
well , it was worth it .
i sas the inventor on the shark tank sev .

i could n't believe that i could actually play a guitar without taking lessons .
within one week she is able to play five songs well .
i am a newbie guitarist and was looking to try this .
the video is a bit cheesy , but i liked the product .
seems sturdy and works good .
i would recommend buying a guitar tuner purchase ! ! !
otherwise this will be worthless !
a little pricey , tho .
now if they would develop one for a ukulele i would be happy too .
once i had this setup correctly , i hit a chord , and smiled .
it works just as its supposed to .
i am just a beginner .
was playing chords within an hour .
very happy with it .
set-up took a little time .
after that i was flying .
easy on the fingers .
the dvd is very helpful .
makes it fun to learn .
should have bought two .
must be dedicated , but a well put together program .
i 'm not far enough along to say much about it yet .
but i do like the fact that i can move at my own pace .
it 's like having training wheels for your guitar .
i purchased this for a student with special needs in my beginning guitar class .
it absolutely did everything i needed it to .
i just got this very nice item !
i higly recomend if you wan na jam as a star !
go for it with out hesitate !
the product arrived intact , and promptly .
i so prefer shopping on amazon as opposed to ebay .
i do recommend actual guitar lessons for anyone trying to learn how to play .
it 's more fulfilling in a classroom setting .
thanks for your services !
i advise anyone to shop with you .
i will say , it does n't fit all guitars .
the chordbuddy is an excellent idea .
it appears they have cheapened the item compared to the buddy on the dvd .
i have trouble with one chord constantly causing a vibration on one string .
i have tried taking pad off and no luck .
claims comes with different depths of pads , but not so .
i just keep adjusting the unit and continue to practice .
the dvd is very helpful and informative .
if you want to learn to play guitar this is the right tool .
within an hour you can start playing songs
started playing songs without any problems as indicated on video .
play my guitar everyday now .
so much fun learning .
he has been practicing ever since and is getting better !
about the chordbuddy ; 1. the instructions were some what easy to learn .
the bigiest problem was teaching rythym , the the struming hand .
we travel around the us and the world .
i take my guitar with me all over the place .
thank you for your invention , i 'm singing and having fun .
are you going to invent a chord buddy for a electric guitar ?
the chord buddy is amazing .
it actually works and is made with quality in usa .
the guy on the video has an awesome teaching style and techniques .
as he suggests , i review the lesson plans on the dvd many times .
he has broken down the learning process in 2 steps .
this the the best way to learn guitar .
i was skeptical but it really does work .
my son really enjoys this practice aid .
easy and clear directions .
this makes learning to play fun .
makes playing easier but have n't transitioned to real chords yet .
have not been practicing as much as i should .
it shipped fast was just perfect was playing guitar in 5 min .
great product good songs to play fit prefect on guitar
it 's pretty sweet .
i am a beginner so the cord buddy is perfect .
it did what it was suppose to .
hard to keep it tuned .
i like it and would recommend it to anyone
( it 's been over year now ) .
because of chordbuddy , i 'm back playing and having a good time again .
this is a great invention for many reasons i.e .
learning guitar and/or rehab .
i have great difficulty playing chords with my left hand .
with this i can strum along with the music they provide .
this is the easiest tool to learn and start playing the guitar .
the inventor really cares and wants you to have fun with this learning system .
i recommend this to anyone that wants to play the guitar .
i am a intermediate player .
i know these chords .
i am getting older and my hands getting slower .
so i bought this to use to save a little on my tired hands .
it was shipped quickly and i recieved it on time .
the chord buddy has helped me a lot .
and hit the road .
( only kidding ) russ
allows one to have a easier approach to learning the guitar .
this is due to your strumming and plucking getting better and pushing harder .
thus a good way to learn the guitar .
i have always wanted to learn guitar , but it was so frustrating !
it 's not perfect .
the instructions are clear and the installation was easy .
no big hurry for that .
i want to say this to travis perry .
you 're the man !
most of all , i 'm having fun with it .
the system of learning is sound but remember to practice daily to get better .
does what it 's advertised to do .
service from perrys music llc was early delivery and packageing was top notch .
thank you , usps and amazon for your great service
my grandson really loved this and is now playing without using it .
he is requesting lesson books now to learn more songs and cords .
helping my son to teach himself to play the guitar .
he says he could n't do it without it !
hi , loved the chord buddy .
i just got a new guitar for christmas .
i am also brand new to playing , and this is very helpful .
i like the beginner cheat method to help me learn .
my husband really liked receiving this for christmas .
thank you to watching the shark tank and learning about the chordbuddy .
that in itself whets his appetite to learn more ... nice idea ...
turns out that it was a great buy .
the chord buddy made it possible for him to enjoy playing again .
he is so happy now .
cons : none so far .
thank you chord buddy for making my husband truly happy again !
the concept is exactly like the wii guitar hero with its color code cords .
thank you , great christmas gift .
my husband as wanted it since it aired on shark tank .
again , thank you for great product .
my daughter just loves how quickly she is learning guitar .
this has made it a very enjoyable process !
what and awesome gift !
the next day , she was playing songs .
i saw this item when it first appeared of the hit t.v .
show `` shark tank '' .
i definietly recommed this product .
i like the ease of introduction to the guitar that chord buddy allows .
i am excited to begin my next lesson !
some of the chords sounds a little off chord .
the dvd has really come in handy .
and he has enjoyed being able to play songs right from the start .
this product does what it is supposed to do .
it provides `` training wheels '' for learning guitar chords .
the unit comes with an adjustable vice screw for different size guitar necks .
it helped me and it is worth the time to review .
the song book is designed to be a progressive learning tool for beginners .
you want precision then buy a bmw .
i was n't playing guitar in 5 minutes .
did n't expect to .
to learn how to play , you must eventually take the training wheels off .
i have other instruction , as well .
how much it helps , check back with me .
if $ 40 is a lot of money , maybe research all options .
if $ 40 is not a lot of money , buy it .
you can google 3 chord songs , ton of them .
this could help you with them and maybe you get lucky .
i 've become an instant guitar player .
the video instructions are clear and helpful in learning the device .
great tool for a beginner .
got it for the wife and she could n't be happier .
this is an amazing product .
we think it would be very helpful to any begging guitar player .
particularly anyone who has handicapped hand/hands .
i believe that is why it was created ...
got it for my oldest daughter for birthday .
she is now learning to play all by her self .
he was so excited to get it !
a little capricious in the fitting
i never used it yet .
but my husband tried it out .he plays in a band with a guitar .
and his comment was , he was amaze on how it let you play .
he said you have to learn where the color are with your finger .
it was a bit awkward for him because he can play a guitar .
but he said it would be great for me to teach me .
the chordbuddy is as good as advertised .
my daughter really enjoys playing with the aide of the chordbuddy .
ever since i was a teenager i wanted to learn how to play .
not really having time to give to lessons as i grew older .
raising a family and devoting time to a career .
no previous guitar experience is necessary , at least i do n't have any .
i find it relaxing learning how to play using the chordbuddy .
i first saw this on shark tank and just had to try it .
dvd is ok , but home- made .
i wish the buttons were marked with what key they were .
works perfectly no issues at all .
price was fairly good .
my son-in-law is enjoying using the product .
my wife loves this thing .
it really does what it is advertised to do .
not trying to write a novel on how good it is .
i would recommend this .
but the product is awesome and helpful as a practice aid .
follow the directions to use correctly .
they should have called chordbuddy the
... ..highly recommend , its quick and easy to install and easy to use .
it is a great product for beginners like me .
i will continune to use and learn with this product everyday
i saw this on shark tank and had to have it .
would recommend to anyone wanting to learn the easy way .
easy to use , instr .
easy to understand just hope it 's durable .
have arthritis and probably not be able to play without it .
easy to install , and worth the price
after purchasing one , i must say that will was right .
that being said , it wo n't teach you to play the guitar .
that 's going to take practice .
but that being said , talk about immediate gratification .
you ca n't go wrong with this product .
in my mind it 's highly recommended .
my mother on the other hand does .
plays the four chords it was intended to play .
other than that , it 's awesome !
this product is helping me learn how to play the guitar .
good quality and service .
the price was right , also
the chord buddy is excellent .
it was a gift for my boyfriend and he could n't be happier .
the item arrived sooner than expected works great !
i love the chord buddy ! ! !
i just ca n't say enough .
if you love music , you will love this ! ! !
i first saw this on shark tank and was immediately impressed .
simply does what it says !
and the accompnaying songbook that comes with it is wonderful .
anyone can play the guitar in less than an hour .
marvelous product and i thank shark tank for featuring it .
otherwise i would never have heard about it .
one of the best value products we 've bought from amazon .
5 minutes into the instruction video we were playing a song .
his teaching method in the video is perfect .
that in itself would have been worth the $ .
my favorite part of owning this is it the instant gratification .
you pickup the guitar and in minutes your playing a new song .
it is a wonderful aid and can help anyone learn guitar as a beginner .
even have my child using it to learn and it makes if fun .
i paid an instructor to learn which did n't work .
i think it is awesome and i 'm having fun learning .
my adult son , with autism , has always wanted to play the guitar .
the videos online and on youtube are dead on .
this is really a great tool to jump start learning the guitar .
i strongly recommend this .
as your mother always said .
`` you still have to practice '' .
and i love that is is made in usa .
i purchased the chord buddy after seeing it on the shark tank .
looked like an easy way to learn guitar .
eventually i gave it a chance .
the dvd is a good bonus .
he guides you thru songs and shows u different techniques of strumming .
just do n't buy this and expect it to be easy .
it 's certainly not , but with a lot of practice u might .
would recommend this product to other people .
very easy to use and makes learning fun .
very happy with this product .
the item came extremely fast and it was nicely packaged .
it included everything that it described and in great condition .
it was everything i wanted to purchase and expected , thank you .
thank you so much !
we saw this item on the show called shark tank .
the chordbuddy was our last straw to learn how to play .
we ( my husband and i ) both played songs within minutes .
the videos were really helpful .
overall , super cool item .
this is just what i was looking for .
thank you for helping bring music back into my life .
it does fit a narrower neck guitar like a fender steel string .
she loved it and wants one for her husband so they can jam together .
absolutely fantastic learning device .
make music 5 minutes after recieving it .
you can not go wrong buying this guitar attachment .
i wish i had had this 20 years ago ...
i , as many others , saw chord buddy on a tv show .
the more i watched the more intrigued i became .
so off to the internet i went to poke around .
found it on amazon at a good price and grab it up .
i have n't been on facebook in a week ! ! ! !
thank you ! ! !
awesome invention , and thank your daughter too !
as the question states , can this be used with a left handed guitar ?
( im trying to load the site but its not working ) thanks : )
chordbuddy works exactly as advertised .
i can pick up my guitar and play with no more frustration !
she likes it very much .
and the price was great .
i think i may finally learn to play the guitar .
he helped me put it on my guitar correctly and tuned the guitar .
now it 's all up to me .
i received it pronto and was pleased with purchase .
eventually will have time to learn from the book and cd ... .
i had rouble reaching red , blue , yellow and blue buttons .
my chord buddy arrived today .
tip : vies travis 's installation video on youtube .
there are a few nuances that help with the install .
installation took me less than five minutes .
i spent more than three hours playing guitar and i had an absolute blast .
tip ; take highlighters and color code the songs .
i saw this on shark tank and loved the concept .
he is an accomplished guitarist , but is having problems with chords .
this helps him make music again until he regains strength in his left hand .
thank you for this wonderful invention !
i wish it was capable of playing more than four chords .
i also hope work is being done on getting one to fit classical guitars .
this is a great product and it works just as advertized .
the only thing that does not live up to expectations is me .
all in all i highly recommend this product .
this product is amazing , simple and fun .
the system really works but you have to dedicate time and lots of practice .
attached to guitar pretty easily and has worked well so far .
this guitar playing aid does function as advertised .
when the company makes other chord groupings available of course playing will be enhanced .
the chordbuddy seems to be reasonably sturdy but like anything it has its limits .
i use it to compensate for lost ability to adequately finger chords .
i can recommend this product .
not quite as fast as we thought it would be .
it , s going to take longer to actually learn to play .
was sent out quickly .
packaging was well done .
we love the chordbuddy and my daughter already wants the other chord add-ons .
just follow the dvd .
if you practice you will learn .
i just did the first part with the dvd and i was very inspired .
all i have to say is that i can play the guitar now !
recommnend it 100 % .
practice , practice , practice is all you need .
i purchased the chord buddy after i saw it on a television program .
guitar playing was too difficult for her .
thank you for the offering of this incredible device !
it does not fit on a junior guitar
first time and never held a guitar before in my life .
i even tucked my kids to bed with me playing the guitar .
my son loves it !
i love it very much .
i bought this for my brother who is turning 6 years old .
the cd is just a bonus !
very good harmonica and easy to learn lessons great value
very nice gift for our grandson .
he was quickly playing it .
the sound was nice .
we hope the instructions will be helpful for him .
helped my husband learn easy !
bought this for my husband to learn to play .
easy to follow instructions .
my grandson was playing within hours of opening .
my aunt loves her gift !
bought as a gift .
great for a beginner .
i am 50 years old just starting out .
in minutes i was playing jingle bells .
easy to read and understand for the young are old .
this was a gift , and the recipient loves it .
i bought this item for my nephew who just recently joined the navy .
he enjoys it so much !
great little book ... sized just right for taking anywhere .
that 's a much-appreciated feature !
195 beatles songs with ukulele chords !
this is everything you could hope for in a uke version .
the chord diagrams are right at the top to review before starting in .
the binding is what you 'd find in a hardback book .
bend it as flat as you ; d like .
you 're probably not going to break it .
the book is laid out to all but eliminate page flipping .
songs that take up two pages start on the left-hand page .
great booki every beatle song ever recorded !
some tricky chords but well worth the price !
i 'm just starting guitar and i love it .
i 'm having fun using this book to both learn and rock
it 's still my go to book for begining students of all ages .
it 's very user friendly .
i highly recommend it .
both phase 1 and 2 are excellent quick-starts for budding guitar players .
i used this book for my guitar class in college .
it 's a great book for beginners .
i think my fingers are too short to play a guitar !
i love the cover on this ! !
wonderful book for beginners ! !
my son is doing great !
good book , learned some things that other material have not explained .
for a beginner this is a good one ! !
my student loves this book .
this books proves to be handy to any self-learner .
the eagle cartoons and illustrations are funny and go straight to the point .
besides , it has an affordable price : )
great book for beginning guitarists .
covers tabs , chords and note reading .
i use it for ages 7-adult .
for a beginner it is kinda tough to follow .
but am getting the hang of it .
perfect book for all age beginners , shipped earlier than expected too .
started to take guitar lessons and this came on the recommendation of my instructor .
it breaks down how to read notes , play chords , and strum .
everything worked out great .
excellent book and very detailed
the price was very very good .
excellent book for beginners i would recommend this book
i have greatly improved since ordering this book .
my instructor uses it when i go for my lesson each week
i have n't learned anything from this book yet .
still waiting for my git to arrive .
i have phase 2 also .
has me rocking out !
these can , t be beat especially for the price .
looks pretty good , but only time will tell .
this book was bought as a christmas present for my oldest son .
my son is taking guitar lessons and needed this book .
he is doing amazing and was extremely happy when his book arrived .
now you just need to practice , practice , practice .
i think this is a great book to use if you are teaching yourself .
it is easy to understand and i think the steps build upon each other .
outstanding on the fundamentals and proper techniques .
this book explains & outlines things as they need to be at this stage .
perhaps the best point is that it is a fun book to go through .
i highly recommend this book and the volume 2 to learn to read music .
it is the perfect launching pad
easy learning and fun !
my kids are playing tunes after just a few days !
would recommend it for any beginner .
my son just started playing electric guitar and has enjoyed this book .
it 's easy but not too easy and he 's doing well .
very good book for begining players .
tought me more than my 120 dollar 8 lessons could have ever done .
plus im not forced to go to class at 48 years old
i have a number of beginner guitar students i am teaching .
this book addresses what most books do n't : technique .
i plan on getting phase 2 for my students as well .
i got this book years ago when i was first learning to play guitar .
well worth it at > $ 10 .
this is a true `` teach yourself '' book .
this is important because learning any instrument can be very frustrating at first .
15 years later i 'm still playing guitar and would highly recommend this book .
i found this book to be a confidence builder .
the large diagrams are very helpful and show the fingering positions without any guesswork .
far exceeds my expectations .
glad i did , works great and use the software often .
it works great with windows 10 and it ` s very user friendly too .
editing and cutting is a snap with audacity .
maybe i 'm missing something here .
audacityaudio recorder and editor is a very good choice : ) !
received in good condition .
it 's free at audacity web site and a newer version .
good recording software and easy to use .
no pop up ads makes it real nice for free .
we love this software !
still had to purchase that tho but price was fair .
highly recommended to all djs
nice violin for the price and for relatively novice violinist while learning .
strings are of poor quality .
i spent about $ 75 to replace all the strings .
the violin sound is rich and vibrant .
; starter music cds , a tuner , and a shoulder/chin rest .
this violin does not come with these previous mentioned items .
the pegs slipped a few times , but i expected that with new pegs .
a gentle push got them to stay in place .
the set includes all the parts that are listed in the description .
everything looks as i expected it to .
overall , i am very surprised and pleased with this violin !
edit : i 've had this violin for over a month now .
the strings have stretched many times due to the humid weather .
the violin itself produces a beautiful , bright sound .
still no discrepancies , and overall i am still pleased with this gift .
i will be using this as my go-to violin during my studying .
after over 6 months of reading i settled on the vif violin .
and i could not be more pleased .
and the craftsmanship was better than what i saw at my local music superstore .
no runs in the varnish .
the finger board was smooth and real ebony .
( not dyed hard wood like other violins in the same price range . )
the piffling is also real inlayed not panted on .
the bow was is much better than i expected .
( no warping or twisting like cheaper bows . )
the case ... it is nice but could be better .
( the only week spot in the set . )
a very good investment for the starter violinist of any age .
also comes with a `` certificate of authenticity '' .
this instrument is well worth the money .
i conducted listening tests and decided it was lackluster .
i ordered the k10 .
my ears were correct .
the srm 450 is just a good speaker , not great .
the mid-frequencies lacked detail which is something on my `` must have '' list .
the srm 450 was very loud and the hf driver had very good dispersion .
the lf driver was mediocre .
watts is not an issue here .
the qsc k8 , k10 , k12 all sound the same .
additional listing indicated the low end bass was tight with much less distortion .
power was ample and the speaker is very very loud .
just to compare everything i hooked up my klipsch 8 '' 2-way bookshelf speakers .
i do n't think klipsch makes pro audio speakers anymore .
too bad because they are great .
i use these home models at home and am very happy with them .
if all you need is lots of volume , either will work fine .
i have been using qsc k10s for close to a couple of years now .
i have thus far been thrilled with the significant sound improvement i have experienced .
the volume and clarity that these 10 '' speakers produce is truly impressive .
one thing that 's great about this 10 '' model is the throw .
i do n't want to downplay the bass response on these though .
signal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back .
just plug a mic , an instrument , and an ipod directly in .
ergonomics are well done too .
knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate .
carrying two at once is easy ( 32 lbs .
each ) and saves you a trip back to the car .
the build quality is solid .
after drying out , it did n't happen again .
i have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold .
the signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel .
once you readjust the levels , you 're back in business with no issue .
i like this speaker .
un-muddied left hand bass and crisp high notes .
i 'm hearing subtleties in my keyboard that i have n't heard before .
really helps prevent feedback from the condenser mics .
i just order another pair of this babes !
one of the best speakers on the market .
i 'm used to pretty high quality gear .
so i got these mostly because of the good reviews .
i 'm using this as a floor monitor ( not for audience mains ) .
as a monitor , this is great .
compact , light and very portable .
good sound quality and plenty loud .
great loudspeaker for home karaoke .
beautiful , crystal clear sound !
a bit more money then the competition but worth it .
i 'm now a qsc fanboy and proud of it .
this is an excellent karaoke speaker .
the bass is stronger than i expected .
best bang for the buck .
the best on earth , that 's all i can say .
-am a professional musician and band owner .
trust me they are the best on earth !
i own 2 of these , 2 ev elx 115p 's and 2 kw181 .
the 15 's are just to heavy and the handles suck .
these k10 's are fantastic .
specially with the totes .
the main reason i purchased for buying the k10 's .
weight , warranty and size !
the footprint of the k10 's are fantastic !
i bring up the other brands because given the price of these are higher .
try other sites and you might get a deal on these .
best powered speakers i have found .
superb sound and clarity .
solid construction and versatile .
everything stated in specs .
using for keyboard stage monitor .
clear , bright and powerful .
i lov it ! ! !
of sound i get with this speaker .
i would recommend the qsc case too .
the mini-mixer built in the qsc k10 is very handy too .
channel one accepts an xlr or 1/4 '' phone plug .
it has a switch that lets you select mic level or line level .
line level would be for a powered instrument such as a keyboard .
each channel has a volume control .
i really like this qsc k10 .
i am so happy with the speakers
i bought these offered in a special bundle on amazon .
they are in a class by themselves - really a top product .
i have pro speaker gear from jbl , mackie and cerwin vega .
what can i say -- -- they are the very best .
i am thinking about getting the k12 's .
excellent speaker for playing live acoustic music !
better than fishman sa200 or bose l1 in my opinion .
i bought this for my work .
we use it in our gymnasium for special events and music .
endied up buying another one for a different site .
it is awesome for vocals - rich and full , excellent clarity .
awesome for acoustic guitar and violin - very natural sounding .
very good for recorded music .
this thing is loud but still very clear .
if they were n't so expensive , i 'd have bought another one already .
i think i need a sub for the bass , though .
these are expensive but worth every penny .
i 'm an instructor and need something loud and bassy !
( which usually needs about 800-1100 watts . )
i have no complains.. might lighter than my previous pa speaker .
looking to pair this up with a sub woofer !
spend the money now for this unit .
then you wo n't need a dj for larger events .
( tho it is nice ! )
these speakers definitely have a decent sound .
i would pair them with the sub for the best sound .
i do have a couple of issues with my speakers though .
the shipping boxes are not the most protective .
hence , both grills had dents in them from shipping .
i do n't buy it since the other speaker 's fan is much quieter .
still i think the speakers are a good buy .
definitely blew my mind .
unbelievable power from such a compact unit .
way to go qsc .
you out did yourself with the kseries
i was too embarrassed to tell them the sub-base speaker was n't even working !
as a proud owner , this unit simply leaves the competition in the dust .
the unit exceeds my expectations .
qsc left nothing out .
the unit is superb .
i can only compare these with the yamaha dxr ( ? )
i own both , being a two keyboard household .
i prefer this one , but both sound great .
i could not be more pleased with the sound and energy from this speaker .
i just added the kw181 subwoofer and wow .
highly recommend this speaker setup !
i love my qsc k10 -- -this thing is amazing !
it 's baffling how well this 10 '' speaker can deliver quality sound .
it can handle multiple inputs incredibly well .
people will love the sound they put out .
the clarity is great , you will love them .
these are great speakers and i am very satisfied with their audio perfomance .
there is one thing that needs improving .
there needs to be a way to tighten the speakers to speaker poles .
this is a great speaker system .
after comparing three major brands . ( yamaha , jbl , qsc ) .
i think this is the top of the line .
i can recommend to anyone to buy this .
got this for my mil who loves wooden toys for her grandkids .
this has held up against the roughness of the kids .
our granddaughter loves this along with her book that is helping her to play .
my granddaughters both loved them .
grand daughter , age 9 , enjoys this product .
our 4-year-old twin boys love this instrument .
you wo n't be sorry with this purchase .
i bought this for my daughter .
she is really enjoying learning how to play it .
when it arrived it was in good condition and sounded good .
this is a great lap harp with nice sound .
the sound is beautiful , the strings are strong .
i would highly recommend this for an individual with simple musical talents .
you can see my books here on amazon .
just look for world of harmony music .
we bought this for our niece and our grandaughter .
every home should have musical instruments and this is a good coffee table item .
i did fine tune before giving however it was only a little bit .
a case would be a great addition .
but there 's probably only enough string to do that one more time .
that is the only problem we 've had .
i would still buy it again , we 've really liked it .
i was delighted to find it still available .
i used an online tuner , so no tuning knowledge is needed to play .
lovely to play , wonderful gift .
such a lovely instrument .
any age can play so long as they 're careful with it .
my six year old can use the music sheets just fine .
should have a electronic tuner to help keep it in tune .
i bought this as a gift .
it seems pretty nice , arrived out of tune .
the paper song sheets do n't seem to line up exactly with the strings .
very easy to play and sounds great .
love my lap harp .
i 've wanted one since i was a child .
now in my 50 's , i love the soothing sound this makes .
yes it will be out of tune .
only very small tightening is required to get it into tune .
once you tune it three times , it will stay that way .
sounds great for the price !
works and sounds great for what it is !
a nice quality for the price .
goes out of tune quickly , but most lap harps do .
but its a beautiful instrument visually and is a lot of fun to play .
wish it came with more songs though .
seems very solid so far .
this is such a fun , beautiful music maker !
my little children feel like pros because it 's so easy to play .
even my husband and i take our turns playing it regularly !
it arrived safely in a timely manner and sounded great to me .
we still have n't tuned it and it sounds great .
i bought this for my son for his 4th birthday .
i love this instrument and the music sheets that came with it .
i think it 's a wonderful introduction to instruments for him .
i do think it 's easy enough to re-tune though .
would recommend this product .
beautiful sound and well built .
i am so in love with this product .
it is well made but i believe the instrument is warped .
i returned it as it is frustrating to play it .
good , basic instrument .
very touchy ... can go out of tune easily but otherwise beautiful
the tones are rich .
beautiful sounding harp for a nice price .
i love this lap harp !
by the way , i tuned it by ear .
this harp sounds amazing and plays well .
i 've already played them all .
now , will be ordering more music sheets from amazon .
i 'm glad i bought this lap harp .
i am very happy with my purchase !
this came severely out of tune and took hours to get tuned .
a string even broke before we even got to play it !
great for all ages .
got it for my 11 year old daughter for christmas .
may want to order some extra picks .
we 've already lost several .
my granddaughter has been playing it since she got it .
great introduction to music !
a bit out of tine but i like it to fool around with .
it seems well made .
but not available i guess .
it was very out of tune when i got it .
but it was still very nice
kids love to see progress and not feel overwhelmed when learning new things .
we gave this to a friend 's daughter .
she loved it ( so did her 3 other siblings ) !
got it for my wife , very happy
plays beautifully out of the box without tuning !
i purchased this for my 5 yr.old granddaughter at the suggestion of her dad .
it include music and you can buy more songs as you progress in ability .
it has a beautiful sound too .
i plan to get another one next year for my grandson .
the children in my classroom enjoy playing this instrument .
i ca n't wait for my daughter to open this gift .
simply lovely to look at and listen to .
the sheet music is kind of haphazard to read .
and no key to explain musical marks i.e .
some notes are shaped differently from others and 2 numbers written under song titles .
in time for the holidays !
perfect for anybody ! ! ! !
price is very reasonable .
music sheets make it easy to play .
i suggest too getting an electronic tuner ! ! !
ez-tuner 8 works great .
get this- you will love it !
this was a great way for her to immediately play songs she could recognize .
easy and sounds really great !
this is a great lap harp for a young child .
the cards that come with the harp are easy to follow .
i use this in my job as an activity coordinator with alzheimer 's patients .
it 's great for sin-a-long when a piano is not available .
this is very simple to use and provides tons of satisfaction from playing music .
great for all ages .
my daughter has loved playing this lap harp .
it sounds great and the music is easy to follow and learn to play .
overall , my only complaint was that the instrument loses its intonation rather quickly .
that is my only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 .
they both love them so much and have such a great time playing them .
nice lap harp with music that actually shows half/ full/quarter notes .
easy for a 7 year old to learn .
it 's a lot of fun , too .
an easy way to add lovely music to your life .
my kids 2-7 love it !
they all can play it easily .
enjoying this misic maker very much .
with out having much musical experience i can play very relaxing beautiful music .
it 's very calming .
it is very practical with no large investment .
very beautiful sounding and easy to tune with the debbie center yt video .
my grandchildren love this and have played it lots !
perfect way to get your 3 year old started in music .

i recommend this to everyone .
it was my favorite instrument when i was young .
purchased for a friend and she is delighted with the product .

my kids age 4 - 13 all love this .
tuning was tricky but not too .
i ordered this for my six year old granddaughter for christmas .
she was able to play all the songs that she already knew the melody .
it is a great way to introduce a young child to an instrument .
it gave her confidence that she could succeed .
the lap harp is lovely and very easy to play .
it was a little out of tune but easily adjusted .
everyone who picks this up loves it .
it sounds really cool for how easy it is !
i 've also enjoyed the humbling experience of tuning this thing .
hint : go slow .
got for 8 year old granddaughter .
she really enjoys it .

ordered this for my 8 year old granddaughter , and she was thrilled .
she had used one at school and wanted one for her birthday .
my granddaughter was thrilled with the harp .
comes out of tune super easy .
beautiful sound when in tune , though .
a lot of fun around a camp fire
this is a great little instrument for kids and adults alike .
my grandson likes this very much .
theis is a great beginner instrument .
not for a professional gig , but it 's playable .
one of the sheets describes which strings should be turned to which note .
try the tuners you can find on the app store .
this was one of my favorite purchases this past christmas .
it is very easy to use and sounds beautiful .
i do strongly believe that every household should have one of these harps .
the adults had as much fun playing as she did .
i would n't mind having my own .
purchased this for my 4year old grandson because he loves music !
it gave him a real boost to be instantly successful .
i bought this for my 6 year old daughter .
she loves this , as does everyone else in the family .
it 's so inconsequential to us that we have n't even tuned it yet .
it came with a pick , and extra string , and a tuning tool .
it is easy to play and store .
i purchased ours from magic cabin , but this is the same instrument .
it has been a real joy for all of us .
in fact , it 's no problem .
tighten them just a little bit .
just a little bit of timing and practice , you feel like a success .
rhythmical noise , but still just noise .
very easy to pick up and play immediately .
it would be nice if it came with more songs and a sturdier box/case .
17 year old plays this all of the time now .
the music it comes with are familiar songs .
my grandson will love it !
got this for a friends birthday .
she played it all day and her teen aged son borrowed it .
she has seen little of it since .
it is well made , actually quite pretty .
it is not a toy .
made in the u.s.a. try it you will like it .
she took to it immediately and played tunes with its cleverly noted papers .
we bought this as a gift for our granddaughter a year ago .
she absolutely loves it .
one of the strings finally broke last night and she is heartbroken .
i am shopping for new strings today .
liked the songs included with this harp
gave this as a gift to an 11 year old .
she has not put it down yet .
highly recommend for any age .
not to bad for a mass manufactured children instrument !
it does not stay in tune as well as i would hope for .
this is a wonderful instrument for playing around the house !
good for entertainment and learning all at the same time .
it is not a professional instrument but great for fun .
a present for my grandson .
he loves making music on his own .
and , it sounds good too .
he performs for us all at 8 years of age !
this is a great product .
it is easy and fun to play .
this is a cute little lap harp that is easy to play .
the directions are simple and easy to learn
gift for 6 year old granddaughter .
she loved being able to play tunes that she recognized right away .
she told me the other day that she plays it all the time .
unfortunately the local store sold out before i could buy one for her .
i bought this product used and it is difficult to tune .
the strings were warped and needed to be replaced .
the harp itself is heavy-duty and will stand up to use .
a new harp may have this corrected already .
the tuner is really hard to use .
it came out of tune but is fun to play .
a better tuner is needed .
also , better to have actual piano or tuner to get it pitch perfect .
i downloaded a free program on my ipad that helped us tune it !
a really cool instrument the whole family can play .
it arrived on time and ready for her to enjoy !
i purchaed two of these for christmas presents .
my 8- and 10-year old kids love playing on this .
tuning is a bit time consuming -- one small tweak changes the tone substantially .
a digital tuner is really helpful .
just look for world of harmony music .
that being said , sadly , they do always arrive out of tune .
i think they 're really sensitive to climate changes .
this took about a month to get to me .
then when i tried to play it , it was very out of tune .
adjoining strings sounded the same note .
they can tune it up and explain the notes .
it is two octaves in the key of g. it has a nice tone .
it comes from belarus , so it is like having a folk craft item .
the tone is very bright and ringing .
it is fun to play .
it comes in a box , which i would keep to keep it in .
it seems there is also a carrying bag available for this .
it is good quality and not too big or heavy .
hohner kids beginners harmonica was a great christmas gift .
i purchased this item for my 4 year old mildly autistic son .
just love to see this kid smile .
my 22 month old loves it !
nice sound , not obnoxious .
i got this harmonica for my daughter 's first birthday .
i tried to blow on her face as i was playing it .
we kept on trying , but she just did n't get it .
and one day ( couple of weeks later ) , she just got it !
i was probably more excited than she was .
first she played it so so gentle you could hardly hear it .
but now she loves it !
now they do have some minor down sides .
also the leather on the ear piece has been known to crack very quickly .
100 % worth the money .
not much more to add than has already been said .
great isolation with these -- that 's the most crucial to me .
and i 'm really impressed with the warm yet very present sound .
it does not matter weather or not you are a dj .
these headphones produce tremendously clear sound .
no matter what application you intend on using them for .
go get a pair you will not be disappointed .
over the years i have broken a lot of headphones .
this one by far is the best built set i have ever owned .
i play 2 to 3 times a week .
thursday and friday at ninfa 's and on saturday at the club .
not only are these sturdy but they sound like no other headset .
the 107 db sensitivity is outstanding .
my nine year daughter thinks there very comfortable .
out of all my head- phones .
there the most comfortable .
i 'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about .
there worth every penny .
the sony headphones are they best i have experienced before .
i recommend them to anyone who owns a music player of any kind .
sound , styling , performance , finally !
great for trance and house music dj 's !
my only problem with them is that the headband is rather uncomfortable .
i suggest you try them on and feel for yourself .
these headphones sounds great .
it driven by a 50mm drive unit , and massive 3000mwatts .
looks futuristic and its optimized for isolating outer ambient-noise .
they are very professional headphones , though they are very hard to get .
but if you see them , get them !
pros : great sound .
good for podcasting or dj application .
cons : kind of heavy .
cant really wear for too long .
value : good value .
they hold up well over time .
buy again : yes , for the applications i mentioned .
i wouldnt get them to be my only pair of headphones , however .
i was happy with it until it finally died mid last summer .
it lasted nine years which tells what a good product that sony had made .
i just love these headphones .
wish they were still made in japan .
can be a wee bit difficult changing the leather muffs but can be done .
best ever sony headphones ... sadly discontinued in favour of the overpriced mdr-1s
after 1 year , still going strong .
great sound ... you do n't need to spend more money with bose .
i 'm 51 old club jock , these are the best headphones .
anything can last if you take care of it .
i have had mine for over 10 years and still in mint condition .
because i take care of my s*** ! ! ! ! ! ! !
my husband loves this !
he tried purchasing a different model and that did n't seem to please him .
the newer models have smaller drivers and less freq .
ear cups are more comfortable than ever now and less itchy .
use them for pro studio use with headphone amps and they crank .
good service , good item !
i always order these .
they seem to last longer for me than they do for other people .
maybe it 's in the care , i do n't know .
i keep using these and they never fail me .
i highly recommend them .
got a pair of these years ago .
surprisingly they lasted me about 3 years until the cord finally gave in .
great for djing or listening to music in general .
awesome sound and cancels out any noise other than the music your listening to .
other than that , it 's a good buy .
great true sound quality .
have used these style headphones for over 20 years in recording sessions .
as with most `` sony '' products , they last and perform as expected .
all of them at least started to crack or completely came off .
-ear pads start to deteriorate fairly quickly .
i 'm sure you can find replacements .
-price has skyrocketed , at least here on amazon .
excellent bass response and comfortable fit .
although a discontinued item , it is my most coveted pair of headphones .
loved the sound but they started showing signs of cracking .
was expecting to happen but always sucks when it finally falls apart .
great isolation , and sound was very good .
they still sound good though if i hold them to my head though lol .
i bought a pair at a box store at least 7 years ago .
i think there great .
my sister is a professional dj .
she can not use any other headphones .
perfect lows and highs .
they look great and work great .
i was very worried i would n't be able to find these anymore .
guitar center said they stopped making them .
ca n't beat it .
i have long since let mine go , but i regret it everyday .
good luck , and keep on the beat !
i picked these up for about $ 93 a couple years back .
ca n't believe how the price fluctuated ( something i missed maybe ? )
anyways , these things can jam !
sound quality is superb and unchallenged , especially when compared to dre 's beats .
i just love music .
i have used the top of the line pioneers , not a fan .
but the 350 -400 dollar price is crazy .
they use to go for 120 until they were discontinued .
so basically someone ripping you off to the max , what a greedy scumbag .
but hey you if you got money to burn , do it .
my did break after 5 years of heavy use .
where the headband and the earphones meet .
had to but gorilla glue on them and now are just fine .
i bought these back in 2010 and never get sick of them !
can crank them up full blast without 0 distortion !
they make everything and anything sound so much better !
mids and highs are very clear .
bass is great too .
very pleased with this purchase and the price point is right on .
i 've been buying these for over 10 years now .
this is my third pair .
no , they are not crappy .
a product can only make it so far .
i do n't baby my stuff .
having said all that , i have no regrets .
i will continue to buy this headset even when the next ones break .
great for gaming , music is fricken ' awesome .
i expect these to last me forever .
these headphones are reasonably priced and have very little wear .
kind of bulky and fagile so be very careful with the cord .
i highly recommend for a djs !
i got a pair of these in mid-2011 .
my main complaint is this .
when i bought mine , the total was $ 91 , including shipping .
at $ 75 they were a great deal .
at $ 275 , it 's highway robbery .
best dj phones for the price !
had mine for over a year and they have n't broken !
quality is good and sound is great !
i would strongly recommend any dj or producer to buy these .
do not however buy these if your are looking for mastering cans !
plus , they achieve this without making your ears feel uncomfortable .
overall , great product for recording/mixing or general listening purposes .
these are probably the best headphones i have ever bought in my life .
where they do n't stand up though , is durability .
expect them to break , and to be very sad when they break .
they 'd be a lot nicer if they were n't made out of plastic .
i was just beside myself .
i was so happy to find the exact pair on amazon !
these are truly excellent headphones for itunes , my homework and movies .
sony deff made a good job on this one .
i 've owned these headphones for 8 years and they truly never fail me .
i have coworkers who have bought the noise cancelling bose headphones .
all he heard was the movie .
my headphones now have a cloth ear pad that is actually more comfortable .
( as long as you take care of them ! )
really good set of cans ... very good overall ... all genres .
these things need power to perform at there best , amp hungry .
they are very neutral phones , sounding quite even in the whole register .
they have the sennheiser 202 which are very close to the 505 's .
definitely not for casual listening and definitely not for all genres of music .
i expect some wear and tear after that many years of use .
the sound however remains superb .
clear , bassy , and loud .
i have to give these headphones 5 stars despite the physical design flaw .
these are truly a beast of studio headphones .
i will buy these again if this pair ever goes bad !
phonologically , i ca n't tell the difference .
i have owned two sets of these headphones .
i broke the first one after about 4 years of usage .
the sound quality is simply awesome .
nice sound , not canned , not over rumbling .
i would give 5 star rating , with one exception .
the headphone has no volume adjustment .
i do not know how this happened .
this is my first such an experience with amazon .
may be i should approach amazon .
i was very pleased with how perfect they sounded plug into an ipod .
i took them on every convoy .
i 'll never buy any other head phone .
my husband loves these .
he is a dj and uses them often .
they are great quality and price !
very satisfied with purchase .
so i ordered one for myself and one for my friend .
the products arrived in good condition .
this is fine during music but too annoying to me during movies .
i have a good sized head ( ! )
and there is no play when the headphone sits on my head .
it is having a very good fit .
have n't seen others writing about this .
can anyone share their opinion ?
this is the second pair of these headphones i have bought .
it also has a killer base and u hear the song so clear .
sturdiness=10 strong and solid .
been a working deejay for 15 years .
the v700 has been a work horse for me .
i have two pairs that i keep in separate cities that i play in .
nope , tried them on , and they worked just fine .
i understand sony has since strengthened that swivel area .
i never had anymore major issues after that .
these headphones are great .
just baby them like you normally would something this expensive .
the best headphones out there under $ 200 .
( and i got mine for $ 60 as a refurb , haha ! )
i could n't disagree more .
i hate dance , rap and anyting to do with a club or dj .
these phones are excellent for rock or anything i 've tested them on .
you really ca n't go wrong with these .
the sound quality of these is astounding .
do n't believe the negative rants ... .
i have bought a total of 4 pair of theses headphones so far .
this is the best out there .
so far the best .
my final point is directed to anyone considering purchasing these headphones for non-dj use .
these are not for you .
what can i say about these headphones ?
the fact that the cord stretches 10ft .
which brings me to another topic .
sure they sound less lively and sq downgraded , it still sounded pretty good .
other than that i would still recommend these .
still intact no sign of wear and tear .
love the fold up design .
glad to see they are still making these .
i was very happy to find the exact same pair on amazon .
they are a sound purchase .
got these after researching a lot of headphones .
these headphones are great for a dj .
i love these bad boys !
these headphone are really good .
this headsets retails from sony for $ 149.99 which is not bad at all .
the fact you can get em cheaper here is simply a plus .
the overall construction is pretty solid .
they are plastic but seem to be pretty heavy duty .
you will hear sounds that you did n't know exsisted before .
i 'm not making that up either .
i purchased mine back in 2003 from amazon .
i still have them and use them , although not as often .
they are amazing ! ! ! ! !
i paid $ 150 at the time and now they are practically free .
i highly recommend them .
i bought these headphones after alot of research .
what more could you ask for ?
that 's all i could ask .
the headphones also work flawlessly with my lenovo laptop computer 's headphone jack .
the noise isolation is pretty good , just not perfect .
great headphones , especially for the price .
probably not the headphones ' fault though .
sound quality is dead on .
overall , this product is good .
only thing i do n't like about is the construction .
i read many feedbacks about how easily the hinge can break .
but the sound quality is worth it !
great headphones , great sound while they worked .
long story short ... good headphones , great value .
also the seller was as advertised .
new was new and the item arrived on time in perfect condition as advertised .
for the price you ca n't beat it .
nice and comfortable , really loud with good punch .
i am more then happy with these headphones .
i highly recommend this product .
thats why i am here buying another pair .
i decided to try these headphones after reading the reviews on it .
i was on a budget , but i wanted quality .
the bass is unreal .
however , i would not recommend these for casual music listeners .
i bought this headphone five years ago here at amazon.com .
it is still alive and working .
i love this headphones ! !
they do last long !
this is my second pair of sony mdr-700dj 's .
i was impressed with the sound but could only use them at home .
i am very much pleased the second time around with my mdr-700 's !
they could be a little more comfortable , especially when i 'm wearing glasses .
they fold up to be fairly compact for the style head phones they are .
it comes with a 1/4 '' adapter that screws on , great feature ! !
it ensures a better connection than the typical adapter .
i will keep it simple folks !
i bought them , i tried them , i love 'em !
very versatile so far !
i 'm no sound expert , but i know what i like !
and these sony 's are great !
shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival !
i researched several different types and brands before i bought this pair .
the headphones clamp onto your head gently but make a good seal .
i am very pleased with my purchase .
sound quality is amazing .
one of the best places to find these fakes ?
i have been there and done that .
the best way to tell ?
the fakes are very uncomfortable , and break very easily .
the real sony version is amazing !
i 've had these headphones for almost 10 years and they worked great .
used on many gigs , sessions , and just normal music listening .
other than that , great headphones for under $ 100 .
i sometimes have to dj events .
if you 're a bass hound just sick with these sonys .
they are quite comfortable too !
use caution when buying these headphones used or on ebay .
they are durable , and imo of very high quality .
these headphones have been an industry standard for years .
sound quality is great , and so is the comfort .
note that these will break where the ear cups pivot , or the elbow .
i still love them though .
the clarity is excellent .
purchase an extended warranty if possible .
to keep a long story short , these headphones are super reliable .
if it says sony , then it 's usually good .
this holds true here .
they have rugged construction and cancel all outside noise when worn .
they also sound great .
i 've seen many dj 's rockin these headphones with their gear .
you just ca n't go wrong for the price .
i have owned a pair of sony mdr-v700 for ten years .
i bought them when i was a freshman in high school .
these headphones are the most glorious piece of electronic equipment i have ever owned .
you can hear everything ! ''
however , i am looking for a new pair of headphones .
this is my second pair of these dj headphones .
i 'm now a believer and i will be getting my pair soon .
these head phones are amazing quality .
this is the only problem i have with these headphones .
when i bought these they cost the o.g .
price and were $ 180 .
well needless to say i never had any problems with them ever .
the sound was nasty , bass deep and they killed anythin i ever played .
i loved plugging these in and bangin .
there is no distortion ever .
for some reason , this page exists .
just buy through amazon and save the money .
nicest headphones i 've ever had so far .
but honestly u do n't need it lol .
so far i am very impressed with this mic .
especially when you consider the price tag .
high value to price ratio .
with this mic i can plug it directly in to my korg prx4 .
i would highly recommend it to others for this purpose .
the casing of the unit is rugged .
i have been able to record everything from street musicians to dave bruebeck concerts .
most people are not happy in this situation .
overall , worth every penny .
perhaps there is a modification out there to improve the output gain .
i think it cost me about $ 6 , if that .
i brought this microphone to record violin playing .
the result was amazingly well .
sony does make a professional microphone with similar technology .
the difference between that one and this one is the connector .
for this consumer product , they purposely made it not xlr .
the simlar microphone with xlr connector sold over $ 200 each .
the other reviewers wrote some great info about this microphone .
some drawbacks are the relatively bulkyness of this unit as compared to others .
this microphone is very compatible with many different devices .
md is the best though .
not every md player has the appropriate mic jack .
double check the technical documentation to make sure .
do n't be fooled !
very few md `` recorders '' actually record with a microphone !
there is no sensitivity switch .
also an mp3 player that allows digital recording comes in really handy .
i use the ms-ms907 microphone on a weekly basis .
it operates on a single aa battery and is highly efficient with energy consumption .
i would recommend investing in either a minidisc recorder or a mp3 recorder .
the ear cushion covers my whole ear fits snug so it drowns outside noise .
all in all nice headset .
well worth the money !
thats how much i liked them .
the noise cancellation is awesome .
the seller had them at a price i could afford .
the purchase was easy with no problems .
first off these headphones have the same sound technology as the sony professional headphones !
the only difference is that these have a dj style .
i also enjoy the slinky/coil type of cord .
i enjoy the headphones very much !
i 'm a professional dj , and i 've been using my mdr .
4700dj for almost ten years .
they 're the best dj monitor headphones i 've owned .
the sound is great , and the construction is definitely solid .
i purchased these for my husband two years ago .
he has absolutely loved them and has completely enjoyed them .
yesterday they broke and before purchasing another pair here , i checked the reviews .
so ... if you have bought these and they broke , contact sony .
it seems that there may be a manufacturing issue here .
otherwise they are great and i just ordered a new pair .
hope these last longer .
i 've tried a lot of headphones and earbuds over the years .
i returned four different pairs of various brands before i bought these sonys .
i 've had mine for over two years and they are in pristine condition .
i have a small head and they are heavy though .
they hurt my head/ears after a good 25 minutes .
the pads have been deteriorating from extensive use .
you really get what you pay for .
so if you 're rich go ahead get the mdr7509hd .
these one 's are good for me ...
i recently purchased these headphones to replace a 139.00 set of bose headphones .
these headphones blow the bose ones away .
years ago i owned a set of the sony mdr-5000 yet lost them somewhere .
anyway , i was attracted to the bose because of the name , etc .
the sonys are the exact oppositte .
they are built solid and exactly what i needed .
you will not be sorry if you do the same .
okay , okay , i caught your attention .
the recordings are unparalleled .
highly recommend this unit .
i also used it with my outdoor drum circle .
buy it ! ! !
i put them on soundcloud and everyone remarks on how amazing they sound .
great mic , ca n't say enough about it .
i do n't think the sound quality is so impressive .
it is a little too small .
the wire is thin .
not so easy to change battery .
i 've got many great recordings from it .
sound quality is very good overall .
... and still going strong .
i love these headphones .
i 've traveled with them a lot .
i 'll buy another pair when these expire .
okay , now the flaws .
the two earphones want to be touching one another .
a friend who has these headphones has described them as `` head clamps . ''
i have always put up with this flaw , however .
the sound is held in very well , which is optimal .
they lasted that long .
i have never had a set of headphones last that long before .
do n't let this flaw scare you out of buying these headphones .
if you start to notice the plastic cracking , you 're in for trouble .
this purchase was well worth my money and another great purchase from amazon .
they are used on a daily basis and abused from time to time .
never once have i had a complaint about these .
great sound and great build , do n't hesitate to purchase .
thus far i have no complaints .
also the price is about $ 50 more expensive .
the sony are rated at 3000mw and the pioneer at 3500mw .
the frequency response is the same so no competition there .
also still in one piece ( no cracks or breaks ) .
you ca n't beat the sound quality for the price .
i 've used this mic for recording v.o .
for film and also lyric tracks for music .
for the money you ca n't beat the quailty
have to quibble though with the word 'digital ' in the description .
there is nothing digital about this microphone and that 's just fine with me .
the stereo separation is nice , not too much and not too little .
the fidelity is amazing for the price .
the sound is crisp and clear , the fidelity and quality are superb .
this microphone is ideal to record life acoustic performances , ex .
recitals , operas , symphony concerts etc .
it is excellent for live performances in concert halls etc .
well worth the money .
it 's stereo , which most mics like this are n't .
sound quality is good and it uses a aa battery .
i like it and use it regularly to video interviews and comments from folks .
i recv 'd the mic in a reasonable amt of time .
it is easy to use .
i think it performs as expected .
the mic puts out a low signal .
i have n't tried it for vocals .
external audio interfaces run on firewire and usb2.0 and start at about $ 30 .
not a warm-sounding mic but nice to have and not expensive .
seems very durable and of course it 's quite compact .
because you wo n't need headphones !
sony usually makes some fine product , and these headphones do n't disappoint .
these are amazing headphones .
great bass , great sound , and they get realy loud .
i love these head phones .
only issues with them is that durability is not that great , handle carefully .
hi 's and lows coming clear and sweet .
these headphones have great bass as well as clear highs .
they seem much more balanced than many of the reviews make them seem .
no durability issues either so far .
well i decided to go with this one because it was more powerful .
gaming is amazing with these .
i regularly walk around in these .
bought this after it was recommended to me on the soundslides board .
i use it with my edirol r-09 hr to record audio for photo slideshows .
to hear a sample of it , click on the slideshow here .
for the extra 15 bucks , the sony ms907 is easily worth the upgrade .
i purchased this microphone to use with our canon video camera .
i film concerts w/ a cammie that has an external mic output .
this microphone has given me excellent results .
very , very clear sound .
have never gotten any hissing or cackling .
does a very good job at filtering out excess noise ( i.e .
people around you ) , and picks up the sounds of a concert well .
you can also adjust how the mic picks up the audio .
a very good microphone , i highly recommend this item .
it makes all the difference .
my son had one that he used with a creative labs nomad jukebox iii .
they all love the recording quality .
that 's tough to do , get them all to agree on a mic .
it 's traveled around a lot and holds up very well .
i 'm a professional piano technician and part-time musician .
this is a good general use mic .
it is not a pro level mic .
for decent portable recording this stereo directional microphone can not be beat .
it has two directionality settings of 90 and 120 degrees .
i get many compliments about my recordings .
that might be the only negative .
it also comes with a voice/wind cover to muffle air noise .
this headphone was recommended to me by a sound engineer .
i thought : he 's talking of my situation ! !
after that i decided to buy them .
five star for this headphone considering it 's intended for dj'ing .
i can tell you , these headphones kick a** in style !
sony takes pride in themselves whenever they release a product .
sony has them labeled as professional dj headphones .
take care and ... . will somebody turn that d***n music down ?
great headphones for the money and they look great too !
a very delightful and wonderful product !
comfortable to wear with high quality music .
these matched with the cowon d2 is simply crazy .
otherwise phones are great .
i 'm not a dj , but i do love music !
these headphones make everything sound better !
sounds that i 've never heard in songs are apparent with these !
i bought these headphones for there great specs which they live up to .
the bass is big , deep , and roomy .
even with the remarkable bass there is excellent imaging in the midrange and treble .
the bass does n't overpower the rest of the frequency range .
the 7506 's just seem a tad more accurate .
i have no long term use with either .
so i will defer to others as far as long term durability .
i 've had the same pair for two years straight .
if you 're a dj , the single cup function is great .
in my opinion , these are the best headphones ever ! !
i had to buy headphones for three reasons .
1. i live in an apartment that is n't `` noise '' friendly .
yet when the bass came into the song there was none .
2. when watching movies at home the 1/4 jack packs extra punch .
so when action sequences start i want to hear them .
stylish and i got mine for a great price on here .
i 'm more than happy with my decision .
these headphones are a must buy .
they are very comfortable and have really good sound .
i would recommend these headphones to anyone .
overall , these headphones are a great purchase and i will buy these again .
do n't block out much noise , but work well in most situations .
man , it 's a good mike !
i use this very affordable digital stereo microphone for recording trainings .
battery life is good , and sound quality is excellent .
this mic picks up little background noise .
as most mics do , it offers a close-range mode and extended range mode .
i love the fact that it is simple to use .
there is no learning curve here .
out of the box and ready to go .
this little mic is amazing .
i would have paid twice as much as i did .
way to go , sony !
i am very pleased with the performance of this microphone .
the clarity and the depth of sound is terrific .
the microphone , with its two different stereo angle options , offers great flexibility .
this is a great microphone .
it has great sound when used with my sony mz-rh1-hi-md field recorder .
it picked up conversations in a large conference room during a presentation .
i was amazed that it picked up relatively quiet conversations from very far away .
all that was necessary was to turn up the volume when i play back .
so i will be able to normalize this with audio software .
i look forward to further use .
i am happy with the mic though .
still much better than if i use the mic on the camera .
this is the best sounding microphone for the price .
i think i paid around $ 60 for it .
beautiful sounding mic , very natural quality .
sound quality is good to excellent .
it picks up foreground and background sounds well .
great price for sony product .
this has been a wonderful microphone for me .
they told me this was the microphone she used , and i bought it .
low profile is the name they give it .
i love this little microphone .
it works considerably well with my md recorder .
so this mic is just perfect .
i call it my `` mini-studio in a bag '' .
and for reference the md recorder i am using is a hi-md sony mz-m100 .
nothing compares.congrats sony ! !
you have come up with another winner .
i have had great results so far and highly recommend this product !
this is a really good microphone !
seeing is believing , so try it !
the unit seems to be a cost-effective solution for my kind of use .
i just purchased the sonys and i 'm excited to share the experience .
comfort : the 700s are all-day comfortable .
the earcups fit around your ears , so there is no annoying pressure there .
they 're attractively designed , too ... with a professional style .
sound quality : like i said earlier , sony has worked magic here .
but they do n't stop there ... the mids and highs are equally well-produced .
but they sound so good ... you wan na keep cranking the volume !
buy them ... you will not regret it !
i bought these headphones 3 years ago ! !
i use them for everything , movies , music , and games .
the sound quality is amazing , it feels like the sound is live .
as far as audio quality and aesthetics , these head phones are awesome .
i use them mostly for music and some fps gaming .
standard dj headphones , great for everyday applications and dj'ing .
not great for noise canceling at all .
the cord can stretch for miles though without any stress on the wiring .
can handle very loud applications with almost no distortion .
i mean , they are industry standard amongst global dj 's ...
i use these headphones for two to three hours a day .
i absolutely love the clarity of sound they provide , very rich sound .
i 'm very happy with that .
they are the `` kobe bryant '' of headphones.. all around greatness !
i was looking for an upgrade from my tinny sounding jvcs .
my only complaint is as one other reviewer mentioned , the comfort .
after a little while the phones become painful around the ears .
this may be due to the weight or the design .
the sony mdr-v700dj monitor series headphones are awesome .
i had a pair and they were stolen .
i am in the radio business and recommend these highly .
great sound and clarity .
this is definitely a good buy .
the sound is clear and loud , perfect for any mp3 player .
it is also very comfortable .
its a bit pricey , but well worth it .
also , the wire for the headphone is extremely long .
sounds good , worth the money .
but really uncomfortable , hurting my ears after 1 hour of using .
the product itself is very durable .
i love these headphones , there so comfortable and the sound quality great .
this headphones are for dj remix use .
so you hear what the mixer is intended to mix .
i use these headphones for cds that utilize binaural beats .
additionally , they are very comfortable .
they most certainly meet my needs .
sound great , whether using them with his ipod or on my computer .
love the long coiled cable and professional design .
would recommend to all .
stuff breaks , this is a fact of life .
expecting them to last a lifetime because of the pricetag is simply naive .
they are time tested and proven .
the sound is top notch and immersive -- the bass is tight and deep .
in the looks department , you ca n't go wrong with the sony mdr-700 .
the folding capability is also nice for portability .
i believe the term is : buy nice or buy twice .
so i got them and am very pleased .
they sound quality is great .
rich , deep bass and comfortable ear cups make these a joy to use .
the folding feature is also very useful .
these are my favorite headphones for listening to opera .
the sound is clear and present , full-bodied and rich .
mine broke at the ear cup hinge .
just be alert to the shoddy workmanship .
i have had these headphones for more almost 2 years now .
yes i agree they are not built that solid .
i have also experienced no problems whatsoever with the ear cups/padding .
maybe i just got lucky !
these are great headphones .
the headphones are very comfortable ... to a degree .
they 're a bit heavy but eventually you get used to it .
the problem is what everyone says is the problem .
all in all , worth getting but beware of that ear issue .
i mean , what else can i ask for ?
i love these headphones , as well as the mdr-v600 headphones .
just an idea , but try using sanitary headphone covers on all your headphones .
i believe you can buy a bag of 100 on-line for about $ 18.00 .
it 's definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones .
these headphones pound ! ! !
you can feel the bass if you know what i mean .
crisp , clear highs and no distortion at high volumes .
the ear cups could be slightly larger .
if you love bass and superb audio quality , these babies are for you .
the sony mdr-v700 's have all around good sound and deep bass .
i highly recommend these headphones ...
i 've had mine for 4 years now and they 've been fabulous !
we probably have 25 pair and they all work great .
buyer beware these are heavily bootlegged on the internet .
make sure the word `` sony '' appears on the jack connector cover .
otherwise its very difficult to tell if they are the real deal !
if you love mixing it deliver clear sounds , bass is very distinctive .
i just bought my second pair .
it looks like the build quality is about the same as it was before .
there are a few problems with them , however .
i am very happy with these headphones .
i 've had these headphones for years .
i use them for listening to music as well as for creating electronic music .
they sound great with any device and can get quite loud if needed .
some might prefer to have a detachable cord but it has never bothered me .
after 45 min or so they began to hurt my ears .
overall for true professional dj work they are great and highly recommended .
they stay comfortable despite what some say .
exceelent quality in sound though be careful cause they look quite fragile .
100 % worth the 90 $ i paid for them .
- they can take way more volume than you can likely handle without distortion .
- they totally block out outside noise .
at a coffee shop , no one can tell your music is outrageously loud .
- intense rich bass .
definitely the way to go .
i have owned my pair for over five years .
a friend of mine got his pair soon after i got mine .
they are n't the most comfortable headphones around , but they 're just fine .
i shopped for months before i decided on these .
i am no audiophile but the sound quality is really nice .
but a five minute break fixes that .
great bass ... very comfortable even after hours and hours of listening .
i use them for my studio work .
would make the same purchase again !
i just purchased my second pair after neglecting to maintain my old pair .
highly recommend these even for those of you who are n't djs .
these are perfect for drowning out the sound of my coworkers at my desk .
it 's an experience , these are .
i 've owned 5 pair of these headphones in 8 years .
their redeeming quality is the sound , which is nothing short of amazing .
the first time i tried these on , i was hooked .
the audio quality is top shelf .
i 'm using my wife 's mdr-v500s until i can find a suitable replacement .
i have been using mdr-v700 headphones for several years .
they are great for both studio production and nightclub work .
just like new and for a great price .
for the price you are really getting something nice .
pros looks awesome , which is one of the main reasons i bought them .
they have terrific sound , and the closed cups ensures very good isolation .
you can pretty much hear them pound your head .
they look really good though , so i give them top marks in style .
they sound great in that environment without requiring another power source .
this is my second pair of mdr-700 that i bought .
the sound of the sony headphones are like nothing i have ever heard before .
it sounds amazing ! ! ! !
i recomend all dj 's to get this item .
thank you amazon.com ~dj shant~
i use this mdr-v700dj and they 're excellent .
the sound is excellent and so noise cancelling .
there exist better headphones , but *more* expensive .
i 've seen myself many djs using them .
they do actually cancel out some noise because they cup your ear so well .
they cups fit nicely and are extremely comfortable .
they are very well designed and feel quite strong .
definately worth the cash !
these sound awesome , and i am not a dj .
i was just looking for some old fashioned , ear thumping headphones .
my first pair was the mdr-v150 .
these headphones are a huge step up from the v150 .
i would highly recomend to anyone looking for a nice pair of headphones .
the design is by far the best part of these headphones .
they still work great and have gone through mild abuse .
if you love bass , these probably ca n't be beat .
another reviewer said they are like instant subwoofers and it 's true .
they even move if your bass is beating hard enough .
the tips of my ears get red and hot .
that is the only reason i 'm in the market for a new pair .
alright , bought these headphones a few months ago .
the bass is awsome ! !
pros : -bass -highs and mids -confortable cons : -very delicate .
this are the best headphones i 've ever heard .
they compare to the $ 500 and $ 600 sets .
they came packaged great and arrived on time .
i was little scared buying this product from amazon .
its hard to trust places you 've never bought from .
but , my product turned out better then i expected .
it showed up on time and was packaged with care .
i will buy from amazon again .
this new headset from sony is the best i 've ever heard .
the spacial clarity is excellent .
without a doubt , these headphones are the s -- t !
the earcups seal my ears so that i can concentrate on my mix .
i get both awesome bass and highs .
it 's that simple !
if you 're a pro dj , you ca n't go wrong with these .
everytime i buy any product i search for price first .
additionaly , delivery was perfect , earlier than offered .
i 'm not a dj at all .
i wanted sometihing that would block out everything that my parents had to say .
so i went with these .
these headphones are awesome and i do like them a lot .
these are easily the most powerful headphones i 've ever owned .
the frequency range is absolutely stellar .
they 're for anyone that loves good sounding music .
these headphones are fantastic !
they are extremely comfortable and easy to use .
comes with nice white case and they fold farely easily .
the sound is spectacular , giving impressive bass !
amazon.com shipped them frightenly fast .
i ordered them and the next day they came ! !
i 've had my headphones for 3 years .
i 'm an amature dj and could only recommend these for dj use .
face it , it 's plastic and it can break .
and it 's not the best design for durability .
but it 's not gon na happen to everybody .
2nd , they 're not designed for audiophile sound quality at moderate volumes .
so stay away from ipods .
they 're just not gon na drive these headphones really well .
it 's not gon na happen .
like i said , these are specifically designed for dj 's .
very transparent and smooth lows .
a lot of it is going to depend on the sensitivity of the drivers .
these headphones are perfect for me .
also the high pitches come in loud and clear through these headphones .
my only issue with these headphones is the fact that they are so powerful .
especially when using them for dj'ing .
i also partially lost hearing in one ear for a few days .
other than that , i have no issue with these headphones .
highs and midtones are well represented .
however , for pure sound , i preferred the sony 's by far .
so my bottom line ?
pros : 1 ) sound - my favorite sounding pair to date by far !
these headphones are candy for the ears .
they will not let you down and are worth every penny paid .
i really enjoy my pair of these headphones .
they deliver top notch sound with killer bass .
they can at times be uncomfortable after extended listening periods .
i 've had mine for about 7 months and use them almost every day .
it 's been with me for over ten years !
now , i will use them with care .
but after around 3 years of use , the swivels broke .
both left and right joints are cracking after approximately three years of moderate use .
luckily , it is still functional even with the cracks .
i just wish that it would last just a bit longer .
this headphones gives you excellent sound !
and please do note that this is not a trivial fact .
everything in them is designed to suit this purpose , and no other .
i 've tested them in indoor and outdoor parties and they are invincible .
they are way to bassy in their overall delivery of sound .
for home/portable use , i strongly recommend the sony 7506s .
every situation has its best headphones .
djing : 700s - audiophilia : 7506s
you should know a couple things before you read this review .
one , i 'm not a dj and most likely never will be .
i 'm just a 15-year-old kid who likes his hip-hop .
also , i 've never owned really high-quality headphones until now .
before , all i had was the $ 20 behing-the-neck kind .
so the obvious question is , is it worth this much money ?
i got these as a christmas gift , but i knew the price .
you get a more full sound with these than with cheaper kinds .
it 's clearer and richer .
these are n't amazing changes , but they are definite improvements .
but the biggest change , of course , is the bass .
you do n't just hear the bass .
you can feel it .
it vibrates in your ear .
there 's not much of a bad side .
not much of a price to pay .
but $ 150 is a pretty big price to pay .
listening to music on these is n't a spectacular , life-altering experience .
it 's a noticeable enhancement .
just to get this out of the way , these headpones sound great !
these headphones sound great and i love them .
i only have a few complaints .
the headphones are a little heavy resulting in the headphones slipping off my head .
they have superior sound quality and the swivel-ear thing is magnificent .
they 're not just for dj 's anymore .
the sound is fantastic , the bass is deep and rich without sounding muffled .
amazon.com 's price is very competitive .
i has this headphone .
it is the best.because sound is like some audio .
i mean so powerfull .
so if you put full sound , you may have concert .
now , you want buy just click buy it is good choice .
and by dj , i mean the live-performance variety , not the studio-technician variety .
and , for djs , these headphones are excellent .
the headphones perform admirably in all cases .
you really feel the music .
i was very impressed .
a word to the wise .
if you are a dj , you really ca n't go wrong here .
if you want comparible sound for home use i suggest the bose triport headphones .
sounds better than my stereo systems .
sound is ultra-clear , pure , clean sound .
bass hits very low and hard , awesome for rap songs .
rock songs play great also , guitar riffs have never sounded better .
comfortable to wear , have n't had any problems .
never enjoyed the movie more !
you will not be dissapointed !
they are incredable and simply ca n't be beat .
they simply ca n't be beat for the sound quality , bass reproduction ...
these are excellent headphones !
their bass is astounding , and mid 's and highs are clear and crisp .
i 'd reccomend these headphones to anyone who wants great sound .
this is the best mic i have used for my podcatsing needs .
it 's very solid and well made .
i bought this for my daughter , a beginning flute player .
she says she likes it better than the stands at school .
i checked out a demo of techno ejay and was hooked ! ! ! !
anyone into electronic/club music should get this product .
hours of fun and the mixes sound professional .
well , needless to say , i did n't buy it .
this is an awesome , easy to use program that has many worthy features .
i love this program anyone can use this .
an easy instant gratification fix for the not so musicaly inclined .
great idea nd it does octave the boomwhackers !
the caps were a great addition to the whacky music boomwhackers set .
i highly recommend getting these for your boomwhackers !
without the end caps , the boomwhackers tend to have a more hollow sound .
you can hear the note , but it is n't very strong .
love these and love this instrument !
these make boomwhackers sound like a musical instrument !
tons of fun in my rhythm class
these work well to extend your boomwhacker set down an octave .
necessary to use these to get the most out of boom whackers .
boomwhackers and octavers perform as they should .
it 's not a bad sound by any means , just a different sound .
it is more native or tribal sounding .
love to add these to my class sets of boomwackers .
the kids prefer the ower sound .
they are how they perform with the tubes .
great value and they really increase the depth of the sound for my boomies .
also prevents bending of boomie tips .
these are great to give you an extra octave !
these fit my boomwhackers well .
they appear to be durable .
as a suzuki piano teacher , i work with small children .
even though they 're young , their repertoire is quite extensive .
bought two sets to use .
gives me greater options as a music teacher .
decent price , great service .
the boomwhackers sound so much more resonant with these tubes .
they are more expensive in the catalogues .
the instrument is in pristine condition !
nothing broken and nothing missing .
will order again from same seller if i need another instrument !
**updated review** this is my response to the comment made on my review .
it was a one-time use instrument .
nevertheless , i would say that the sound quality produced is consistently good .
no wonky sounding pitches -- high , low , or mid-range .
a+ plus on that .
our son has been using this for several months as a beginner .
needed one for school and it works perfectly !
exactly the same as the schools if you need a replacement too !
great quality recorder for elementary music teachers .
it performs far better than i do
i got this for my son for music class in school .
it will be handed down to my daughter when she gets to school .
very happy with the quality of this recorder .
great product for price .

that 's common and easy to correct .
it 's a musical instrument .
you have to learn how to play it .
go to youtube for help .
this recorder sounds clear and loud .
hole spacing seems correct .
the holes are easy to cover and there is a clear distinction between notes .
at the price offered at the time of this writing ( approx .
my son loves the recorder .
he 's playing one tune after another .
bought for our niece and she loves it !
great sound ... thank you !
wish it came with a cleaning rod .
it 's worth it .
and get `` it 's recorder time '' add a learning book .
it 's full of all sorts of repertoire .
nice recorder - basic but entirely suitable .
friend of mine separately ordered one thinking the same thing .

very good for under $ 20 soprano recorder .
idk the proper wording ) .

this is an excellent , high quality , beginner recorder .
start with this if you are looking to learn to play one .
what an excellent value !
so long , i like it
very well built , wish it came with a spit valve cleaner
secondly , you can indeed get very nice music out of it .
- the experience of the player is what matters .
my daughter 's yamaha runs sharp in about the same area .
beautiful tone and easy to clean .
do n't go with a one piece recorder that they push at schools .
my son loves this recorder .
same one the school uses in 4th grade instrument intro classes .
perfect for my daughters 4th grade music class .
really like that it comes with a carrying case .
very sturdy , great materials and i like that it comes apart for cleaning .
i would expect nothing less from yamaha
hey , it 's a yamaha !
yamaha makes every thing well.. i love this recorder : )
cheap enough to hand out to kids .
for the money , it absolutely ca n't be beat .
i would definitely recommend it for anyone .
very nice recorder for the price !
includes a fabric bag .
arrived fast and is as described .
perfect use for my daughter 's college course .
i thought i 'd have to spend a lot on the next level recorder .

now , if i could just play it better ... .

this specific model is highly recommended by my child 's music teacher .
bought one for both parents so that we can play along .

good quality , nice size !
good for any body .
my daughter loves it , and i have to listem to it lol

a great parent-child quality time project for the involved parent .

i was really surprised at the quality of these recorders .

great quality and value .
i am a senior citizen learning a bit later than most folk .

it has held up well and i would recommend .
best price and product .
so 5 stars for durability and price..
perfect for the money to get my toddler to learn play flute
the yamaha yrs24b is a great flute for beginners and students .
sounds great , my son love it
needed this for school !
great price , fast shipping .
i absolutely love this recorder .
but i am a little dissapointed in the fingering chart .
also it has a great sound .
do not learn the irish tin whistle before you learn to play this .
it was a lot harder for me to play .
clearly i was wrong to give this fine recorder such a rating .
it 's a basic recorder .
good for beginners and getting kids interested in music .
amazing quality at very low price .
my son loved it .
my 5 yr old son like it .
both kids have one and they love them .
my first recorder so i have nothing to compare it with .
playing is fun and improved my music reading skills .
the instrument is well-made and sturdy .
it works much better than the cheaper ones that you would find at toys-r-us .
on top of that it came in a very nice pouch !
the instruction is very sample and clear .
my 8 years old girl can get a simple melody in 3 days !
as expected for a recorder !
very nice product and quickly delivered .
perfect for my third grader
for a cheap recorder they are in tune and sound good .
give them as gifts to revive music in our culture .
this instruments plays very smoothly and bring back memories of my high school days .
it 's a great instrument .
highly recommended in my country
nice for kids ! !
my son loved it !
i bought this for one of my students .
she 's very happy practicing every day with it .
i 'm not good at playing it but my toddler is and its authentic .
worth the price and inexpensive too .
great recorder for the price .
comes apart easily for cleaning and has good sound .
my daughter enjoys playing with her flute .
will buy another one if needed .
great price and quality .
now it 's up to me .
works well , easy to clean
other than that its a great choice
bought two for older kids to learn simple notes .
but my five yr old plays the most !
helped them all get excited about music !
they are definitely student/beginner instruments , but they sound good and are very sturdy .
i bought this to replace the recorder i bought at walmart for $ 1 .
the sound is clean and much louder that the cheap one i have .
i really like it .
the plastic makes it convenient to clean it up after he uses it .
this recorder is easy to play , and has nice tones .
in a word , it is better than i hoped .
my son loves music .
he loves to play music .
however , a lot of his toddler music instruments do n't make real music .
this however sounds like real music .
looks durable and well made , but hard to play .
and really liked it .
thanks for all the resources you have for all i need
basic wind instrument to start teaching children the basics of reading and playing music .
it sounded like a charm .
my son needed this for school or else he 'd lose points .
his teacher loaned him his until this one came in .
this one was exactly like the one the teacher owned .
my son loves it .
this is just as advertised -- a solidly built student instrument .
after struggling with inexpensive dime-store varieties , it 's a pleasure to work with .
sounds was good for the price point .
i had never seen a recorder before except in pictures .
it 's fun to play , and i 'm enjoying it very much
my son is happy .
arrived in great timing .
good price.. for a yamaha recorder .
i would recommend to a friend .
these are great ! !
they 're durable and they do the job !
no complaints here ! !
this is good overall , but sometimes the sound does not come as intended .
i hope it is the way we are playing it .
it meets the needs of the music teacher , who required specifically this brand .
although my kids had used other kind of recorders , they like yamaha the best
i even went back a bought a few more .
i first tried it , oh,35 years ago .
someone i knew from bavaria played one .
35 years latter , i got my own .
plays great and a very fair price .
great quality for a very good price .
that 's all i have to say , , , is that enough now ?
it looks just like the ones we played in elementary school !
very good well-made plastic 3 piece baroque tuning recorder !
buy two and play along with your children !
i had to look up on youtube what notes each hole were .
this flute is a very high quality item for the price .
kids love this flute .
sounds good and is easy to learn to play .
perfect choice for a student starting to be interested in playing an instrument !
it 's not too expensive and relatively easy to learn to play .
this recorder seems well made and comes with a canvas bag .
overall , a simple device that works as described .
also , she suggested that we get a `` 3-piece '' one .
this just means that the recorder can be broken down into 3 pieces .
these are great for my kids to use at school .
ca n't beat the price !
as an adult , i have dabbled in music these last 10 years .
i have an assortment of wooden recorders that cost over $ 100 .
the recorder i play the most is the yamaha yrs-24b !
considering the price , i do not understand why anyone would buy anything cheaper .
still a good quality instrument for the price .
i made the mistake of buying a wooden recorder before this one .
it did n't work .
so i looked around and found this yamaha .
the yamaha was purchased based on other reviews here .
wow what a great purchase .
the notes are clear and the instrument is made from high quality durable plastic .
my 1 and 3 year old makes `` music '' with it .
and it 's easy to clean .
the price was fair and it has a great shine to it .
this is a great recorder for children .
for 5 bucks you absolutely can not go wrong .
this item delivers exactly as described .
the price ca n't be beat .
i highly recommend this product , i would buy it again if needed .
after that point it got a lot of use .
maybe someday her kids will play with it too !
for the price , you simply ca n't beat it .
it never needs repairs !
i purchased this for my 3yr old grandson .
the recorder comes in its own draw string bag .
it seems to be made well .
not flimsey or fragile .
very happy with product .
item was exactly as expected .
daughter loves it and is getting a lot of use out of it .
perfect for my 3rd grader .
he really likes it .
seems to perform fine .
will know with time how it holds up .
my daughter came home from school and wanted a recorder !
found this brand new recorder for 4.99 and she loves it !
my daughter was really happy when this arrived .
it is made of the highest quality and came with a carrying case .
our music teacher recommended yamaha , and she was spot on .
kids who bought the cheaper ones did not sound very good at all .
you can tell the quality , and it is only a few bucks more .
i am very happy about my product .
if someone else want to get this instrument , i 'll recommend it .
this recorder is the best in the market .
sounds are very clear and right .
it 's loud and shrill , which is all i needed it to be .
and would definately plan to purchase a lot more in the near future
i bought this for my daughter so she could practice over the summer .
it 's good quality and the pouch that it comes in is perfect .
i ca n't imagine anything better short of making it from real wood .
i purchased this instrument at the advice of my son 's school music teacher .
he loves to take it apart and spread the pieces around his room .
was great and worked awesome ... . until my dog ate it .
haha , but honestly though , it worked well and was easy to clean .
my 18 month old loves it .
seems sturdy , well made , easy to clean , and it is loud .
he 's happy when he plays with it though , so i 'm happy .
bought as toy for grandson for his music collection .
holds up well to child handling .
also great tone for serious music .
the recorder is great .
i think it is a little advanced for his size .
but he 'll grow into it soon .
this was purchased for my 5th grader .
does n't squeak too much .
i also love the design and color of it ok ?
and i also hope this review helped you make a very wise chose .
procrastination is always my friend .
needed to purchase a recorder for my childs 4th grade music class .

very nice instrument at a great price .
quality is as expected from a maker such as yamaha .
very nice beginner musical instrument .

i bought it so i can learn how to play israeli music .
i 'm still learning how to play jewish music for my lord .

it is easy to use for a 4 yrs old kid .
the sound is good and my daughter loves it .

it 's very beautiful !
very happy with product !
my daughter loves it and it works so well .
i am really happy with the product !
we purchased this for our 4 year old daughter and she loves it .
it comes with a felt bag for storage , which is great .
she plays with it all the time and we 're very happy with it .
this recorder is easy to play and has a good tone .
these were a great value .
i would recommend any other parents to get them here online .
this is a good stuff , my kid loves it very much .
also it has a good price .
i 'm very satisfied with it .
it really met expectations .
bought this for my young son who is obsessed with music .
el producto llego rapido , la calidad del producto llego en perfectas condicionse .
it works just as what i expected .
nor is it dark brown .
it 's good for the price , nice for beginners .
i was surprised how well this recorder sounded .
i wish it came in more color choices .
my daughter loves it and has several friends ask her where she purchased it .
the tone is quite good for such an inexpensive recorder .
a great beginner/student or backup instrument .
after my two older children got one from their school .
he thinks it 's `` neat '' .
kids really love it .
now he is on the top of the world .
they will probably learn with recorders similar to this in school .
a quality product you ca n't go wrong with .
for the price and material , i was expecting a lesser quality purchase .
but that was not the case .
a good price and a good quality product .
has a number of advantages over the usual recorders for children .
i bought this for my six years old son 's christmas !
it arrived in time thanks to the seller !
it has a great , pure sound for such a great price .
my son enjoys it a lot !
it is also quite durable and can withstand rough treatment .
this is the recorder from your childhood .
for me some amount of quality , accurate pitch and low cost were important .
this recorder met those handily .
the yamaha ysr-24b , uses the baroque fingering system .
the yamaha ysr-23 uses the german fingering system .
intonation is better with the cross-fingering of the baroque system .
this recorder comes with a canvas bag and a fingering chart .
i purchased this for my daughter who is still practicing on it .
it is fun and it was certainly worth the price !
it has a great look .
you can take it apart to clean it well unlike most recorders .
i expected more from yamaha though .
it is n't that great for young children because of that .
very nice color and construction though .
excellent product , shipped really fast and the quality was great .
highly recommend this company .
the carrying case was a great bonus too .
i bought it for my daughter to use in daycare .
packaging was nice and it came with a sleeve .
the ivory yamaha yrs24b soprano recorder took me by surprise .
i purchased a different model of similar price for myself .
the difference between the two were quite noticeable .
yamaha just seemed like so much better quality overall .
i especially liked the super smooth finger holes .
they beg to be touched .
( my other brand recorder did n't have this and i was jealous .
my fingers are much happier now . )
it also comes with a manual/maintenance guide .
the yamaha yrs24b soprano recorder is my son 's first instrument .
i ordered this recorder on amazon and it came faster than i expected .
using this , my son is able to learn his music basics .
he carries it to school whenever he has music class .
for a plastic recorder yamaha soprano is great .
the price is affordable and this one is great for starters .
happy with the find .
now i can show and do some performances .
thanks you very much .
glad this came in so fast .
it is sturdy and has held up well .
the pitch seems fine -- at least compared to other soprano recorders .
the color is a little annoying but it does come in an excellent case .
the price simply can not be beat .
it is exactly what i needed as a beginner of this instrument .
my children love it and they will play with it once in a while .
learning how to play it is very easy in my case .
this recorder has a nice weight and quality sound .
i bought one for each of my grandchildren - they love them !
these are good recorders .
my only disappointment is that they do n't come with cleaning rods .
she has n't recieved it yet , but i think she will enjoy it .
my 8 year old neice loved this as a christmas gift .
it appears to be a very high quality product .
highly recommended product ! !
bought this recorder for my 5th grade son .
it does its job and my son says it plays and handles well .
just handle it with care and it will last .
over 30+ years ago , i played recorder in elementary school .
i remember loving it .
so , i did a bit of searching on amazon and found these .
within three lessons , my kids were playing recognizable songs .
i bought this for my 4 year old grandson .
it plays very well .
it held up to a 4 year old using it .
the recorder arrived promptly to our out-of-state grandson .
i purchased this recorder for my 9 year old daughter for school .
this instrument sounds and looks top of the line !
thank you for the fantastic discount for a quality item .
this recorder is good balance of quality and price .
the color makes it look more like an instrument than a toy .
it seems to have less moisture problems than the clear candy colored sopranos .
yamaha makes a fine recorder for a inexpensive price .
i bought this item as a gift for a one-year-old .
he really enjoyed blowing and hearing the sounds .
then i bought two more for two little girls as a gift .
this is item is an excellent gift for a small child .
the price was just right .
this is a really good product .
my daughter loves it .
she needed it for her music class and it worked wonderfully .
this was bought for a 4th grade student for music class at school .
they needed to bring it by the end of the week .
the seller was fast ! ! !
the product is great !
my son loves it and it has a great sound to it !
works great and shipping was fast .
hi , i want a flute but do n't have enough money for that .
this is a good item .
the recorder was shipped , in excellent condition , on a timely basis .
i am very satisfied .
this is a really nice , inexpensive recorder for learning on .
as i said , excellent recorder for the price .
the sound is decent for a plastic recorder .
this is a good choice for a beginner recorder .
instead of the $ 2 one piece recorders , splurge : - ) .
i bought this as a stocking stuffer for a friend .
now i want one .
bought this for my 4th grader since they are playing recorders at school .
it 's been toted back and forth in his backpack with no problem .
came with a great little fabric bag to keep it clean .
i purchased these recorders to teach to my second graders .
they are good quality for the students .
i have had a yamaha recorder for 15 years .
i recently bought this for my friend who likes mine .
i am a loyal yamaha consumer .
cant go wrong with it .
it is well made and has good sound for the price .
( key words here are `` for the price '' . )
do n't expect it to compare to and `` real '' wooden instrunment .
the c40 is my first guitar and i could not be happier .
it is well built , pretty and sounds beautiful to my ears .
it sounds so good other people do n't mind hearing me practice .
and i even get compliments on the pretty sounds i make with my yammy !
the c40 stays in tune .
it 's not loud .
( i do n't want loud at this point ! )
i am happy the c40 exists and that i could buy it .
if i ever buy another guitar it will probably be a yamaha .
this is especially true with guitars .
so what does that mean , and what should you be looking for ?
folk ( acoustic ) guitars have slightly curved fretboards .
the soft strings give the guitar a full , but soft and gentle tone .
it is not designed for playing heavy metal .
it is a guitar for a small room , not for a stadium .
ymaha is instrumental makers in hamamatsu japan .
especially the most famouse instruments are pianos , grand pianos .
the popularlity to classical guitars may be inferior to yamaha piano .
but the cost performance is great .
you may think that 10000 $ guitars is very high !
gc is used solid woods , and is made by hand-made without machines mainly .
thank you for reading poor english .
it play 's great and sounds great too .
it came fresh new in box .
in very great condition .
no problems all all !
materials far surpass what you would expect from a student instrument .
easily the best sub $ 200 classical guitar .
exactly what i was looking for
i bought it used and it looks like new .
shining , no scratches , clean and sounds beautiful .
very nice one with reasonable price
my husband loves it .
it 's just what he needed .
i moved to the states 2012 and that 's when i bought this instrument .
i would recommend it to beginners or players on an early intermediate level .
for the price , the playability and the sound are really good .
if you want to get truly great sound you pay 8000 us-dollars and up .
then , invest in an instrument with price 1500 us-d and up .
got the item on time and in great condition .
my 15yr old loves it and was very pleased .
beautiful color and design .
i have been playing classical guitar for over forty years .
i was pleasantly surprised after tuning it to find such nice tones .
i think to get something better would be an upgrade of several hundred dollars .
came with the strings already on .
took only minutes to tune it .
i 'm back to playing after many years .
would recommend for beginners as well as experienced players .
the nylon strings are easier on your finger tips than a steel string guitar .
it stays in tune .
my son is equally happy practicing on it .
it was also very well packed and shipped promptly .
perfect for my beginner and intermediate students !
did n't play much but it sounded amazing as far as i could tell .
this guitar is exactly what you 'd expect from yamaha !
it has a rich , warm tone with awesome sustain .
the volume is great and projects better than i would have expected .
it 's also very lightweight ; i was expecting it to be heavier .
very comfortable to hold and play .
it tuned very easily and had no slippage or issues staying tuned .
no fret buzzing at all .
this guitar may be the best value available !
easy to play and sounds great .
feels great , sounds good , holds tuning !
the classical guitar i owned previously was an american made harmony guitar .
i bought the yamaha c-40 used for $ 70 .
it is vastly superior to the harmony in both sound and playability .
this is a great guitar for the money .
i would recommend it for your first classical guitar .
great sound and suitable for age 12 and up through adult .
good looking , too .
packaging left a little to be desired .
it just came in a box without protective styrofoam inside the box .
but the guitar arrived without any damage .
purchased for my daughter who has been playing guitar for 3 yrs now .
she gives it 5 stars .
bought this for my fiance after a house fire ruined the one she had .
sounds good , easy on the hands , durable .
very good instrument for beginners !
this is without a question a great guitar and a great deal !
the sound is amazing .
it comes with yamaha guitar bag and toner and cd .
i ca n't ask more for this price
bass note are vibrant on this .
overall , nice instrument .
great guitar for a great price .
still in a very good condition after so many years of use .
this is a nice entry level guitar at a good price .
the service from the seller was great .
this really is a great guitar .
it has a solid spruce top .
the plywood side and back really do n't diminish the overall sound that much .
i ca n't believe one can buy a guitar this good for the price .
switching the strings to dadarrios new carbon strings really brought this thing alive .
yamaha also makes a 3/4 size and 1/2 size for younger people .
i played the 3/4 size and it is just as nice .
i am very pleased with my purchase .
my son loves this guitar .
it was suggested by his instructor .
it has a great sound .
as always the best price on amazon !
excellent guitar for the money .
this is very useful stuff .
i was very glad about this guitar .
this is simple but goot stuff .
thanks a lot for in-time delivery : )
this is a very nice guitar for the money .
delivery was really quick .
i always loved these yamaha classical guitars .
perfect sound , easy to play and very inspirational .
it is my main composing guitar at this point , i simply love it .
perfect addition to my collection .
it 's lighter than i thought .
sounds okay , not so good but still can not be complained about .
shipment is fast and careful .
i 've been playing classical guitar for about 15 years now .
not professionally , just for fun .
this is what i expected , and at a cheap price .
this guitar was exactly what i needed to start learning how to play .
it is affordable and has a great sound .
i was a very cost-conscious buyer when i was considering different models .
totally happy with the purchase !
he really loved it !
this guitar shows quality but is great for a beginner .
ok , i 'll admit it ... i am guitar crazy !
to me they are just good fun .
i review this guitar based on its features versus price .
that 's why my friend gave it to me .
now it plays really smooth , easy on my fingers .
this is not something a casual guitar player or newbee knows .
the sound is good for this price range .
i even go further to install a preamp/under-saddel transducer to turn it into electric .
plugging into an amp , it sounds amazing .
i can play , amplified , on stage with it .
this is a nice guitar for the money .
i bought it mainly for strumming chords , and it has a nice sound .
my son ended up using it so much i gave it to him .
it 's nice to see him learning on it .
its a good guitar to learn on .
it stays in tune and produces warm tones .
you really ca n't beat the price for this quality .
i bough this guitar for my youngest brother as a gift .
it is a great instrument for everyday practice .
i 've always been a fan of yamaha instruments and electronics .
i like this guitar .
it sounds and plays nice .
if you want nicer , you will have to pay more .
this is a great beginners guitar .
nylon-classicals are famously finicky to temp and humidity .
mine is far more stable than my teacher 's .
i picked up this one and fell in love with it .
: ) well built , good sound quality .
wondering why there 's no `` yamaha '' logo on guitar 'head ' ...
this guitar has a strong neck and keeps its tune for a long time .
many people have played this guitar and just love how it sounds .
you wo n't regret buying this guitar .
classical guitar strings are nylon .
keep guitar away from extreme heat .
this guitar looks nice and has a gloss finish .
the neck is not too big or too small , it 's just right .
back then i transferred easily after a couple years to my gibson j-45 acoustic .
easy and fun to play .
even my instructor who was a hardcore classical player noticed .
the same price and it was not as nearly as good as this one .
you can trust yamaha on this one , this worths every penny .
and still you can re-sell it or keep it for the visits to play .
i really recommend it .
the action is high , but that is the classical guitar for you .
the strings are far apart ... again the classical guitar for you .
my advice is play it for a couple months and then form your opinion .
otherwise you are just frustrated because it is new .
so i can switch back and forth at will .
i have owned several guitars , steel , nylon , 12-string and electric .
the tone is clear and balanced throughout the fretboard .
many guitars in this price range sound more like a toy than a guitar .
this one goes miles beyond that in comparison .
but otherwise this is the best bang for your buck in my book !
i bought this guitar for a friend of mine for her 16th birthday .
this gives me an unbiased approach to the guitar .
martin '' , i 'm obviously going to like how it sounds and all .
the finish was excellent and the fretboard was absolutely even with no flaws .
yamaha totally skimped on the strings which is rather odd !
after restringing the guitar with the d'addarios the difference was night and day .
and it sounds pretty damn good .
some people complained about the cheapness of the tuners .
i do n't see any issues with them , they work just fine .
it is a very nice looking guitar .
very impressive on first looks .
it was one i bought used from a friend 's guitar teacher .
i loved that guitar .
never did i have a single complaint about it .
i 'm not saying the other brands did not sound good .
what i 'm saying is the yamahas sounded great .
having the free shipping option was a major plus .
there is only one reason i needed to call the yamaha customer support line .
i needed to ask where the serial number is located .
i could n't find it to save my life .
my guitar was wrapped very well for shipping .
it came with `` the yamaha guitar quickstart dvd . ''
a `` welcome '' sheet with some good basics for beginners was also included .
it is so good to have another yamaha classsical guitar back in my life .
i am very happy from my purchase .
the guitar sounds very pleasent and the price is totally fair .
i was amazed that i got such a great guitar for only $ 100 .
the finish is excellent and the tone very pleasing .
if you 're starting , this is a nice guitar to start with .
this is the perfect guitar to get that authentic spanish sound .
it is my weapon of choice !
this is a great progam .
the only thing i do n't like , you cant scratch .
but they have prerecorded scratch beats .
i totally recomend this software to anyone .
one can not go wrong with the mixman .
it 's a great back up without the nasty copyright blues .
a riot and a real hitmaker .
this is the coolest piece of software .
its cool that you can export to mp3 .
the sound you get is amazing .
i would definitely recommend this to anyone .
i am a pc music mixing veteran and i 'm very familiar with mixman .
when you 've recorded your completed mix , you just click the save button .
the price is also reasonable for mixing software .
my kiddo loves it ... although not as much as he loves drums .
pricey toy but with tender care and love it would last for more generation .
my daughter 's eyes lit up on christmas morning when they they saw this .
easy assembly ... .took about ten minutes .
it made our christmas !
i got mine a couple of weeks ago and i love it .
but other than that , i think it is great .
the schoenhut concert grand piano is fantastic .
this piano is an investment that will do just that
we had to dismantle this piano partially before we could assemble it .
the cover also had a broken screw which we replaced .
at best the sound could be described as clanky .
this little piano is beautiful , obviously well constructed with good materials .
what a fun little piano !
we have it sitting next to our boston ( steinway clone ) .
i love to practice my pieces on it .
downside : let it air out outside !
chinese finish ... ..really stinky .
unbox it outdoors on a nice day .
then it 's good to go !
super fun -- good quality
excellent quality and delivery .
it looks really pretty .
does not sound good at all .
really toyish ! ! ! !
but a little kid wo n't care .
i purchased this piano for my grand daughter who is 20 months old .
her father is a pastor so she relates it to church .
she is having an amazing time singing and playing her baby grand piano .
amateur use , so have less judgment as to its performance characteristics .
minster cables are the best ! !
i use this cable frequently .
never had any issues with it .
great price from the vendor .
i highly recommend the item .
it has a life time warranty i love
30ft is a practical length for live performances and in the studio .
i have always been a fan of monster cable quality and design .
personally , it 's the only cable i buy .
some might t honk the name is not worth the price .
especially at this price .
received two 30 ft monsters for $ 30 , unreal !
these have never let us down since we 've used them .
everything is tight and tidy .
all sounds recorded through it were crystal clear and had great sound quality .
the signal does not sound not degraded .
i am pleased and would recommend this cable .
if you are looking for mic cables look no further .
monster delivers the best quality out there and you get to decide your length .
i dont have to worry about bad connections or noise from the cable .
came with a quality cable tie .
high quality cable that i highly recommend .
i searched for awhile and this is the best price out there .
you could really tell the difference in the sound with the new cable .
it made a big difference .
i will only buy monster cables in the future .
they cables are pretty awesome .
i have friends ( musicians ) that love these cables also .
love the monster cord and special end that protects the plug .
thanks for a great product that is easy and great to use .
two of my microphone cable went bad .
so i decided to buy a good cable .
i had monster cable before .
i thought they were overpriced .
did n't make any difference .
but not this one .
my mic volume increased like 5 times .
maybe the old cable was unbalanced .
anyway , buy this cable .
unbelievabe clarity and volume !
these cables work well and come with that great monster lifetime guarantee .
i 've had a couple of these for about a year with no problems .
monster cables are very good cables and i received the cables i ordered .
item received as ordered .
be carefull if you want to use this cable with shure sm57 mic .
i 'm gon na have to buy a different mic clip .
they barely outlasted the warranty .
the words `` lifetime warranty '' were the clincher .
thing o ' the past .
tunes it right out .
the signal becomes its own electronic shield against noise .
cheaper cables use a side-by-side or linear configuration .
the jacket resists twisting and uncoils smoothly .
velvety-quiet signal transfer and audio quality that 's good to the last note .
the performance of this cable is astonishing .
it is a must have item !
exactly what i wanted for the right price .
these cables will pretty much out last me .
it is not exactly like the picture .
so , 4 stars .
this is my first cable and i am a guitar beginner .
it works well for my taylor 210e and a qualified mini amp .
good cable if you are not critical about 2 plugs without angle .
perfect for my epiphone sheraton ii .
monster cables are well constructed .
got this one because i wanted the 90 degree plug .
it is very sturdy and will definitely do the job .
this monster cable filled the bill and she is quite pleased .
which means i 'm pleased !
the cable sounds great but most decent quality cables do .
i think the quality control on monster products in general is very good .
i would recommend this product to others .
i bought it for my son 's guitar .
i have used monster cables for years , and with good reason .
the lifetime warranty is worth the price alone .
monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either .
you cant go wrong with monster cables .
so good that i bought another one .
love the heavy cord and gold connectors .
i just learned last night how to coil them up .
i guess i should read instructions more carefully .
but no harm done , still works great !
i am very happy with this cable .
i am so glad i did .
what the more expensive model has going for it is looks .
i was impressed at the speed at which the product came through the mail .
i would recommend to anyone interested based on this order .
it 's everything i wanted ! ! !
: ) 5* great product and an appropriate price
i use it on my lap top computer to restore and clean audio files .
overall , i 've enjoyed working with this product .
highly recommended for the price !
it also has extensive track management features .
real-time simultaneous monitoring of most effects and one direct-x plug in is possible .
when i first started a restoration project my primary concern was quality .
it is extremely efficient .
all in all , magix has filled a huge void in this category .
i would like to try steinberg 's clean !
i bought this yamaha as a gift for our daughter-in-law 's birthday .
another thing that amazed me was how quickly it arrived .
thanks for making the givers and the birthday both very happy .
what a great keyboard !
i am learning to play the piano in my spare time !
the built-in lessons really work .
i am learning at my own pace .
there are a lot of great songs built in .
i love lesson # 2 for the right and left hand .
i have n't learned all of it yet .
i ordered the keyboard with a stand and ac adapter which are essentials .
this keyboard is not touch sensitive which i think makes it easier to learn .
the psr-170 is an affordable , versatile , quality product .
i would buy it again without hesitation .
great for beginners , but more advanced music needs will need more .
does exactly what i bought it for , works great , very happy
but it is not very sensitive .
works just like it should !
good product , good seller
heavy but works like a charm with authentic feel .
all as promised - would do business with them again
use it daily on my keyboard
expected yamaha quality was there .
i 'm guessing it works .
nice , solid pedal .
does not work with line6 equipment .
not yamaha 's fault .
very happy with this purchase .
its yamaha bro u know its dank

as described , shipped on time .
works great with my yamaha keyboards .
low profile keeps it from getting kicked around much .
rubber on bottom keeps it fairly in place .
nice replacement for a yamaha keyboard .
no frills , just works .
much better than the flimsy plastic pedal that came with my yamaha piano .
the reverse polarity thing is a know problem that has been around forever .
bottom line : good quality pedal for the money .
it works well and stays out .
nice action ; comfortable ; stable .
great price and fast shipping .
works perfectly for our church needs !
product arrived as promised and performs as advertised .

excellent quality build for an inexpensive pedal .
good price too ! !
what can i say ?
this has been and still is the industry standard volume pedal .
i use 4 of these in my gig rig .
you ca n't go wrong .
yamaha 's equipment is always first-rate .
overall works really well for a keyboard pedal / the price .
bought it so my sons yamaha keyboard has a pedal .
no problem so far .
great expression pedal , i have 3 of them .
always reliable in my experience and they have a nice even feel .
i use them for multi keyboards on stage and in studio .
yamaha flips the polarity .
i will update this review if i have any issues .

it was exactly what i needed .
dope and good quality with little suttle features like adjusting how far it goes down
great replacement ca n't even tell a difference
this is an awesome , dependable , sturdy pedal .
yamaha fc7 might be the cheapest volume pedal with decent quality .
you might not be able to find any better pedal at $ 30~40 range .
it 's just attached with thin double tape .
so i put thick wood board under the pedal ans now it 's perfect .
product delivered when promised and was as advertised .
i 'd recommend this if you 'd want to practice with it .
pros- it 's a good size and length cons- not a comfortable angle .
you do n't have as much control with it .
ordered this at the same time as the power cord just to have it .
good solid pedal but not switchable .
polarity is normally closed.. make sure you can use it .
the yamaha fc4a piano pedal is just what i was needing .
i use for the piano in church , it works very well .

works great with my tascam dp-008 as a punch in/out footswitch .
shipped on-time , as well .
happy with the product .
honestly not a great deal to say about this pedal .
it functions , and well .
works on pretty much any synth , certainly every one i tried it on .
can throw you off when playing .
set them both up in our bedroom and the result is amazing .
worked well with my nord .
otherwise , does the job of sustaining .
and it does n't drain the battery too much from my yamaha .
simple on off switch that only needs to be pressed once .
pros : only needs to be pressed once , long cable .
cons : rubber top padding seems to be coming off .
i use it with my hammond xk-1 .
make it more like a piano

pedal polarity did not match my roland keyboard .

i use it near-daily on my roland fa-06 .
fyi it 's very sensitive .
had one before cause it was really good so why not buy it again .
bought another after this review : )
nice and smooth press , no clicking or noise when pressed .
does exactly what it is supposed to do and appears to be built well .
not cheaply made , should be a long lasting pedal .
this is a great pedal !
sturdy rugged and works as expected .
however there is a solution .
this one is just what i was hoping for .
it is affordable and perfect for my uses .
i bought this even though this is more expensive than other pedals .
if you have yamaha keyboard , just buy this .
just plugged it in and it works like its suppose to do .
i 'll see how long this one lasts .
i had a fc3 and that one lasted about 2yrs before it started squeaking .
works great with my yamaha ypg-235 !
high quality , great performance .
the spring offers enough resistance to give close to real feel .
mine have held up fine through numerous shows with no issues whatsoever .
some people might not like the heavy weight , but i love the heft .
no accidental kicking it around with stage antics , and built like a tank .
one of the best out there .
long throw , and have had several .
works fine for our yamaha and nord keyboards

this works great with it .
just make sure and follow the directions to plugging it in .

just what we needed .

seems to be pretty solid .
so far so good .
it is quiet and works perfectly
i had also purchased the kurzweil cc-1 to compare pedals .
the cost for the fc7 was less than 1/2 of the kurzweil cc-1 .
overall , yamaha fc7 wins , hands down , over the kurzweil cc-1 .
also thanks to other reviewers , i had no trouble with reverse polarity .
attention : unplug the keyboard before plugging in the sustain pedal ! !
it 's not a big deal if you do n't though .
it does n't slide on a wood floor , either .
works great and delivered faster than expected .
works perfectly after setting up the yamaha djx

it is a rugged pedal with plenty of cable .
these are great pedals .
it sustains with the pedal up , right ?
it has reversed polarity because you did n't unplug your adapter .
pedal works as advertised .
good option to have when needed .

so i think it is essential equipment .
i will have to order the model number for casio only .
i had no problem returning it and getting reimbursed .
perfect should have bought it years ago
i am very satisfied with this pedal ordering from amazon .
i am giving it 5 stars because it did what it guaranteed !
( 1 ) reduce click sound ( 2 ) not slide around .
so far it is so good , it does not make any annoying noise .
but this new one does not slide around !
i put it one top of a carpet , by the way .
way better than the plastic , squeaky roland version .
this pedal is heavy duty and smooth .
only drawback is the weight , it 's pretty heavy .
but still hands down the best .
a good price and a very good product .
it seemed to be a great buy .
over the years i have had several .
i always go to this pedal as long as the polarity matches .

i use two of these to trigger my alesis sr16 for live performance .
works great like the last one that our bunny chewed through .
great grip on your foot and great price .
i bought this to use with an old yamaha spx90 .
my only complaint is that it only has one function .
the chord could also be longer .
i specifically looked for this one .
it wo n't go anywhere with a carpet .

delivered in its original box
excellent product , thank you !
sturdy design and the cord fits nicely inside when packed up .
works perfectly as intended .

it 's well made , and is very easy to push down .
i 'll probably replace the rubber with something that has a better grip .
works very well , and was timely .
nice solid feeling pedal .
long , thick cord with a quality connector on the end .
works great as an effects switch with my mg10xu .
works great ... good value .
does what i needed it to do .
feels good to me .
note some devices ( my roland rd-500 keyboard included ) need an adapter .
a good value for the money .
only concern i have is i wish the cord was longer .
a nice addition for my use of the piano setting on the keyboard .
wish i had gotten one a long time ago .
i purchased a keyboard for our winter condo .
i love my piano and could n't get used to no pedal .

music sounding better with the yamaha fc-5 sustain pedal for portable electronic keyboards
i wanted a sustain pedal for quite some time .

i have been using this pedal for the last 15 years .
i was using my bands pedal and now i thought of owning .
have tried other brands in stores and was not satisfied .
i 've had no problems or issues with it !
works just like the original one !
i should have purchased this a long time ago .
exactly what i was expecting , and totally meets my needs .
i got it to have it if i needed it .
if i was really good i can see the need .
but this is a keyboard not an organ .
thank you amazon for selling professional music gear on your site .
i dread the thought of stopping in my local guitar center to buy anything .
anyone that 's had that experience knows what i 'm talking about .
received it in just a couple days in flawless condition right to my door .
no traveling around and haggling with vultures who work off of a commission .
this was no exception .
the packing was excellent , lightning fast , and the seller kept me informed .
does what a sustain pedal is suposed to do .
price ok. after a year of using it it still works perfectly .

just what i ordered .
i bought this to use with my tyros 4 and it worked just great .

it works perfectly with my synthesizer .
this guy is made out of metal .
so far so good .
have n't had any issues with it .
works like it 's supposed to work .
serves it 's purpose .
so far , this footswitch is working very reliably and is solidly built .
i 've found a way around it .
this way i avoid this awkward foot position when it 's fully muted .
it only took about 10min to switch my brain and use it in reverse .
and i 'm not changing back - it works and it 's very comfy .
i got it to use with my new nord stage keyboard .
it does what it is designed to do .
especially for an inexpensive portable machine like mine .

make sure it fits your piano !
simple and works as advertised .
has multipule uses with other on/off type devices .
i would recommend to anyone .
build quality was better than expected , very nice pedal .
does what i need it to , and makes the organ sounds more expressive .
the fc-5 sustain pedal is the one that goes with this style keyboard .
the pedal is very durable and functions the way it should .
it is a good price for a genuine yamaha pedal .
( the issue turned out to be the jack in my keyboard . )
we needed this for our son 's outdoor wedding .
now i will have it on hand whenever i need one .
i had tried to find this online but thought my keyboard was too old .
delighted to have it .
these do n't need much of a review ; they 've been around forever .

yamaha is better than the m audio pedal by far .
there is nothing special about this product .
it works like it should .
this pedal works excellent with my old yamaha electric keyboard !
i use this pedal to advance my tama rhythm watch programmable metronome on stage .
this pedal feels solid and works very smoothly .

it sounds great and has no flaws at all .
-this sustain pedal works as great as any other pedals out there .
good sound - does n't linger after release and no vibration .
the pedals worked as advertised on drum kit .
it was definitely a worthwile purchase .
my grandson plays with the drum kit everyday .
no , this pedal does not feel the same as a conventional piano pedal .
yes , it does tend to walk away .
but it does the job of sustaining notes at a very affordable price .
it is also very lightweight and travels well .
save heavier pedals for heavier duty keyboards .
what can i say about a sustain pedal other than it works great ?
low profile , easy to depress ... all i can think of .
works s it should and it does n't weigh too much .
it could be smaller and a little cheaper , but no big deal .
this is a great peddle .
but it works perfect .
i am glad i got it .
i am very pleased with this product .
it 's very easy to set up .
the pedal is very effective .
good price and good product .
yamaha is very good .
worked just fine as an expression pedal for my zoom 505ii .
you need a `` continuous control '' pedal for digitech devices .
the price was great .
controls volume by default and works well .
very large like hammond expression pedals .
originally wanted moogerfooger pedal , this was second choice .
no polarity switch - would not work with casio .
keep swinging and playing music fats waller is the best !
got this for my yamaha ex5 in addition to the fc3 and fc7 .
i needed the whole set to setup different parameters and control to each .
got this guy and it works perfectly with my yamaha ex5 .
very sturdy in its construction .
great control/motion over the volume unlike other controllers that have a smaller range .
yamaha pedal for a yamaha keyboard .
this is the recommended pedal for my synthesizer and it works like it should .
i 've tried other cheaply built boxes , and they lasted about two weeks .
this sustain pedal works great and is better made than others .

really it would have been problematic not to have it !
i 'm enjoying this pedal .
the pedal keeps its position where i set it .
i have not used the boost function yet so do n't ask about that .
an added bonus is the pedal angle adjustment for using it standing vs. sitting .
at last ! ! !
i got my new yamaha volume pedal .
the pedal works perfect with my electric keyboard .
just plug it in and it works .
this was a specified gift an individual wanted on her amazon.com wish list .
she likes it so what more can i add ?
for the money -- very durable .
i have two of these .
they are built like a tank , operate very smoothly .
i like the fortissimo feature ( spring return ) .
it is a very good value for the price .
the only negative i would give it is big .
very sturdy for on stage applications .
just unscrew the pedal and swap out the contacts .
i 've tried a few volume pedals out there .
this is the top of the list .
other volume pedals out there feel cheap and plastic by comparison .
very wide dynamic range .
note that the roland lasted many depressions over 12 years of use .
from the photo it looks cheap but it 's very solid .
the rubber on top grips foot well too .
i bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard .
it does just what i wanted it to do .
purchased this pedal for the yamaha ydd40 portable electronic drum kit - wow !
really impressive considering the low price .
100 % satisfied with this product !
i was ready to return it until i read the other reviews .
it works great now .
thank you very much !
i bought this to replace my old one , which had a missing screw .
i dig it 's compact form factor and reliability .
it worked as expected with the ydd40 yamaha drum set i purchased from amazon .
boy did you all come through .
less than two days delivered .
i purchased the yamaha fc7 for the keyb exp organ module .
some people refer to it as a long throw volume pedal .
besides the expression pedal on my b-3 it is the best i have used .
the price does n't hurt either !
i was extremely satisfied with my purchase .
overall its a great sustain pedal .
this pedal worked great and feels very durable and solid .
it acts as a simple *normally closed* switch .
i ordered the sustain pedal to use on my old yamaha keyboard .
it works great , now i love playing on my keyboard !
it depresses notes beautifully and never gets jammed or stuck .
this item is exactly what was need for my yamaha keyboard .
bought this for my roland juno-g. works great .
expression volume sweeps from low to high very nicely .
product is made tough .
i 'm sure i will enjoy this for years to come .
note : i have not tested the yamaha piano like pedal .
i actually purchased this to act as a foot pedal for a yamaha y-dd40 .
i have n't tried any other foot pedal though .
got this thing because of the great reviews .
the footpedal works just fine and is a must for any keyboard without one .
when lifting the pedal the sustain stops immediately .
overall i would recommend the pedal .
i plugged it into my yamaha psr-520 digital keyboard .
it must be me .
but it did not make any difference .
may be , i do not know how to make it work .
i had ordered another yamaha `` piano style '' foot pedal .
it is sitting idle next to this one .
is there any screw/nut to be adjusted ?
i needed a sustain pedal for my yamaha portable electronic keyboard .
thankfully , amazon was able to provide on at a reasonable price .
it works very well .
if amazon.com has what you need , i would recommend doing business with them .
the foot petal works great !
i 'm very happy with it !
the price for the petal was also very reasonable .
i 'm glad i purchased it .
the pedal operation is very smooth and well controlled .
the pedal stays at whatever volume setting you choose with no slipping .
the sustain pedal i purchased through amazon .
was easy to install , had plenty of cord , and it works great .
i am very pleased .
this pedal is made for yamaha keyboards .
being made of metal , not plastic , it 's very durable .
travel with at least two of these if you 're a yamaha multi-keyboardist .
they 're easy to store .
built like a tank and does all it 's suppose to do .
heavy construction which means it will last for years .
i love my yamaha products because there built with quality .
pro : the pedal is very sturdy .
has got the yamaha quality .
yet to find out if it works with an extension .
con : yet to find ...
fits perfectly with my electronic keyboard .
nice and its metal with a rubber top !
heavy and feels very quality .
if your anything like me , you have gone through a few pedals .
nice rubber top , with metal ( no plastic here ! )
good , long chord ( but not ridiculously long , which is good ) .
quality to cost , this is your best bet , right here .
it 's an expression pedal and it works just fine .
i got mine used , and it arrived in a dirty filthy state .
had to clean it first .
so that 's why the 4 stars .
consider spending the extra bux anc get a new one for 5 stars .
for a basic sustain/momentary latch controller , these little guys are great .
the casing is made from metal and feels very durable .
plugged it into my piano and it worked with no problems .
this yamaha fc-5 sustain pedal works perfectly with my yamaha dgx-200 .
the pedal feels very well made .
the cord is exceptionally thick and flexible as well .
could n't ask for a better made product .
this is a great little pedal .
i use the fc-5 in conjunction with my yamaha psr-e213 .
it plugs in and plays perfectly .
it creates a semi-realistic and beautiful sustain .
this does exactly what it supposed to .
it has a pretty solid build and feels like it will not break easy .
if you are looking for some cheap sustain , this is your product .
this is only a stupid switch .
it works good , push to contact , leave to no contact .
this sustain pedal is decent , especially for the price .
overall , great buy for the price .
this product did the job and works great .
this pedal works great with our keyboard .
i kept having problems finding it with my foot or having it move .
( glue would work too . )
i even put little rubber feet on the other side of the board .
this setup works perfectly .
it will get a great deal of use on stage .
it works just as advertised without any trouble at all .
quite a strange bug related to a product .
overall , this works just fine for me .
i 've been using it with my ypt-300 , and it is working perfectly !
this sustaining pedal is just what you need with your new keyboard .
better off going with a casio pedal if you own this brand of keyboard .
this yamaha pedal feels of good quality , and it functions as advertised .
otherwise , the polarity is incorrect , and the pedal may not function correctly .
my music is a little better but the pedal itself works great .
i read the comments about it working backwards and tried some experiments .
to fix it just turn the power off and on again .
the peddle itself looks fairly well constructed especially considering it 's low price .
this is a bargain and certainly fills the bill for me .
get used to this and i am sure you will appreciate the bargain .
i purchased cakewalk hs2002 when it first came out .
there is a lot that you can do for a home studio !
this is not for beginner musicians .
recording audio and midi so easily is so amazing in this product .
you get a bunch of loop writing programs to install as well .
i am in 180 degrees of opposition to the `` sour grapes '' reviews .
having read the review after ordering i was worried .
however haveing spent just a day with it my concerns are gone .
for drum loops use `` fruity loops '' ( on the cd ) .
cakewalk is as competent a sequencer as any individual musician could possibly need .
yamaha is really good at producing good-sounding guitars at low prices .
unlike other cheap guitars at the same price , these do n't sound horrible .
however , yamaha is merely average when it comes to true guitarists ' guitars .
many squier guitars that cost around ... are not that good .
another thing about squiers .
they are not as well built as some yamahas .
their amp jacks tend to get loose every once in a while .
another important thing for beginners .
the slimmer necks make it easier to play if you 're a beginner .
you get everything you need with this package .
the guitar book is pretty good although there are better ones .
it comes with an extra set of strings and picks .
its a good deal , i highly recommend it .
granted , you will need pedals to assist you and perhaps a decent amp .
if you do n't like it email me at jcsilva1606 @ gmail.com rock on
i bought one of these thinking it would be a peice of junk .
but it is very sturdy and it sounds good .
the best part is it comes with evrything you need .
and it stays in tune for ever .
i recommend this guitar for begginers and advanced .
but the price here is a bit high .
but if you go to sportsmensguide.com you can get it for 50 bucks cheaper .
i recieved this guitar package as a christmas gift only a few days ago .
my first time to play a guitar was on christmas day .
the method book is very easy to understand .
in my opinion , the guitar sounds and looks great !
i am very pleased .
the price is highly economical .
i have seen many other beginner packs selling for more than $ 300 .
it is also manufactured by yamaha , which is a very trusted brand .
i love this guitar .
it is well built and great if your a beginner .
it even includes an amplifier .
$ 200 for a guitar and amp : great .
it has cool tuning machines .
i have a more advanced guitar though now .
clear audio instead of ticky like before .
i even put it near the engine of my car and revved the engine .
did n't get overwhelmed and captured all of the audio .
this mini microphone attaches to my voice recorder and is a perfect fit .
i 'm using this recorder for acappella singing .
bought this item because i needed to improve the efficiency of my recorder microphones .
i gave this accessory to my husband as an early christmas present .
he uses it through biking to recording our daughter and it does its job !
makes the video voice quality all the more amazing !
i received this mic in a very timely manner , and it works good .
all is well ... thanks..
i used it to mic a recital .
the sound quality was excellent .
i would highly recommend this product to everyone !
very nice , very sensitive for the price .
hope this helps to anyone interested on buying it .
i have made , with this program , over fifteen songs .
i highly recommend it .
i was plesantly surprised when it arrived !
nice construction and awesome sound pickup .
i need to buy another .
i purchased this microphone just to compare with the mics i own already .
what more could you ask ?
it 's pretty stable too and not too heavy .
like another poster , i use the atr-30 mic for ham radio .
the money saved had paid for a good bit of quality coax .
and my expensive heil collects dust .
give it a shot , you wo n't regret it .
it is a great one in this price range .
i love the product and in-time delivery .
i had no problems with purchase or delivery .
i might even get a second one for a spare .
this microphone is the best for your money especially from amazon .
this microphone is crisp and clear .
no static can be heard and is a very inexpensive piece to add .
i would recommend it .
i needed a second microphone for our karaoke music stand .
the sound quality of this microphone is perfect for our needs .
it comes with a stand .
we did n't need that anyway , but just to let you know .
i could n't be happier with my purchase .
the mics were just what i needed for my television production class .
this is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice .
the cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality .
do recommend this purchase .
by far the easiest cable i have ever worked with .
lesson learned , always get a longer roll !
this product worked just as advertised with great pleasure .
sounds great , a huge upgrade from my old cheapo walmart wires .
i used this in my home theater system for all speakers .
this was perfect , and cheaper than what could be found in local stores .
i used this cable to wire the speakers on my vintage 68 mustang .
i bought this stand about a year ago and can not be happier .
it was easy to assemble and is easy to use .
it is very sturdy .
i have kids under 5 and they play on the keyboard all the time .
the stand has taken the abuse and never once tipped over .
this was a great buy .
very easy to put together , adjustable height , and very strudy .
not much to it but that is what makes it good .
the casio stand is very suitable for the purpose that i purchased it .
it was the free shipping that clinched it for this killer and burly stand .
this is a great stand for beginners with beginner keyboards to use it with .
this is a great stand for the price .
but for beginners it 's a perfect fit .
does what it 's supposed to do .
i 'm surprised to see so many negative reviews for this stand .
i use this with my 61-key yamaha psr-k1 keyboard .
it is a very stable and sturdy stand .
i 'm 5 ' 8 '' .
this appears to be the standard size for this type of stand .
the product is wonderful .
it is sturdy as promised .
the problem is the instructions and assembly .
i was naive in thinking that it would come already put together .
the problem came with the assembly .
once , the stand was finally constructed , the next issue was adjustment .
i am disappointed in the construction part but the end product is great .
blame this one on `` operator error . ''
also it is strong and so stable .
of course , you need to have all the screws otherwise you are screwed .
: - ) anyway , i am happy with the stand .
assembly is easy- the instructions , however , are unnecessarily complicated .
just look at the picture and go from there .
so yeah , the stand is fine , and i recommend it .
the product is fine , so i rated it a 5 .
i worried for nothing .
stand is perfect for my casio ctk-720 keyboard .
and what a great price .
it is sturdy and does not take up a lot of room .
my husband put it together quickly with no problems finding the parts .
told me to be sure to give it a rave review .
assembly was not really a problem .
they logically go together , but my advice : take your time .
think the process through .
a little bit of rocking , true ; but nothing unmanageable .
well , that 's about it !
not much to the stand , really .
that 's why i 'll give it a *5* .
it 's fine ... .
got all the screws and went together well .
supports the casio keyboard well .
i received the stand with all pieces in the box .
the assembly was easy and very logical to understand .
the instruction manual would be difficult for most people .
but since when do you need instructions for something as simple as this ?
the stand is sturdy , so it should last a long time .
i think the product works great .
it is very sturdy .
i did have a problem putting it together .
the directions were hard to follow .
once assembled it is easy to adjust the height .
just make sure you have some patience before opening the box .
this stand was a perfect fit for my keyboard .
instructions were easy to read and item was easy to put together .
hightly recommend this product .
the instructions were written in engrish ( see engrish.com ) .
i do n't have any problems with my knees hitting it .
amazon packed this into one of their boxes .
all the parts were there .
the only gripe i have , it 's a little difficult to put together .
i am happy with the product .
first , some of the screws are pre-threaded and they need time to locate .
this is a sturdy design that takes some simple assembly .
it is however versatile and simple in design .
this was a great deal .
easy to install and works great !
it is very sturdy and perfect for our casio keyboard .
***the screws are already in place in the stand , when it arrives .
the keyboard stand was well packed and easy to assemble .
the stand arrived quite quickly , with all the screws in place .
it holds the extra weight just fine .
i bought this stand for my yamaha psr275 keyboard .
i thought it would fit , but it does n't .
other than that , it is a nice stand .
it 's easy to assemble .
i thought they were missing , but in fact they were there .
after reading the other reviews i was expecting problems with delivary .
it was in perfect condition .
( the screws are screwed into the ends of each leg . )
overall i was very pleased .
i did n't experience any problems at all with this product !
it only took a short time to set up , and is very sturdy !
i bought it with the psr-175 keyboard through amazon.com .
easy to assemble.. very sturdy.. i have 4 kids too.. not a problem ...
when i ordered this item , i had serious reservations because of other reviews .
i reported this to amazon.com .
when they sent the new one , it was boxed up like fort knox .
the new stand is sturdy and easy to put together .
the scan for media found loads of songs i forgot i even had .
i urge you to buy this software as it is outstanding by anybodys standards .
the killer feature for me is the super-tagging option .
( i suggest the dvd waking life ) .
i 've personally begun and abandoned the process many times .
once , i think i stopped to watch round 12 of the nfl draft .
look , up in the sky !
it 's a bird !
it 's a plane !
you 'll notice that the software has already highlighted its best guess .
`` smith_how_come_so_soon_now.mp3 '' becomes `` the smiths-meat is murder-how soon is now.mp3 . ''
you even control which fields go into creating the filename !
goodness piled upon goodness .
from the minute i purchased it i was completely blown away !
it 's easy to use and easy to sort your music .
my only question about buying it here would be why ?
you can download the product directly from their site and it costs less .
seems they do that right before an update .
musicmatch jukebox 7.0 is an excellent product .
i have a very fast burner with buffer under run prevention .
the program is properly configured to respond to your specific needs .
a true bargain in my book !
i just purchased musicmatch jukebox plus and i love it .
it does more than just convert audio cd 's .
it 's very user friendly and it 's well worth the price .
very happy with all aspects of the purchase and with the product .
just the keys are not enough if you want to play the big songs .
anyway i am satisfied with it
ca n't find this at retail stores , even though they sell the keyboards .
this adapter is necessary to operate my keyboard .
works well to keep your keyboard going without using expensive batteries all the time .
just plugged it in and away we went .
my granddaughter is three and enjoys her keyboard a lot .
now we do n't have to keep buying batteries .
she is just fine with the cord ... we were concerned needlessly .
ordered this separately from casio keyboard .
it arrived considerably sooner than the keyboard i had also ordered .
hav n't bought a battery yet .
cord is plenty long enough .
definitly recomend getting this accessory
i bought this for casio sa75 keyboard .
its working perfectly fine .
i recommend to others .
i 've tried it a few times with no problems .
a brief inspection proved the worst of my suspicions : a karaoke machine !
the woman is 40 years old for crying out loud .
what could i do ?
what was i to do ?
i grabbed the microphone ( a very nice professional-looking one ) and started crooning .
this unit is stronger than i had expected for such a lightweight package .
it was very simple to assemble .
i 'd even recommend this unit for light road travel .
we gave this to our nine year old daughter and she loves it .
bought this item for christmas .
we had lots of fun until the camera burned out .
the big river has great sound .
the sound really carries .
so i plan to buy more .
i bought this for my brother .
he says it is a very nice harmonica and has a good sound .
got this harmonica from my sister last christmas .
it 's in very good quality sound and very responsive .
hohner knows how to make a nice sounding , quality harmonicas .
they have been making harmonicas over 180 years .
this is a cheap harmonica that plays well .
i could n't tell the difference between them .
many famous harmonica players use the hohner big river harmonica .
what does that tell you ?
the big river is a great playing harmonica at a low price .
what more could you ask for ?
this was my first harmonica and it still is working great .
overall , really good .
i recomend it fully .
these harps have a nice , bluesy sound .
sent these in christmas boxes for kids in other countries .
i pray they will find teachers and learn how to play them .
this harp is great - sound , quality , everything .
the shipping was shockingly fast .
all in all , a very positive experience .
my husband chose this harmonica for himself .
as he has it , he is quite pleased with it .
not squeaky and well tuned .
i would definitely recommend this to others .
this is a good simple harp to start with .
it is easy to use and has a good sound .
i bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend .
he loves it , and the dog hates it , haha .
the harmonica was in good condition .
the sound is beautiful , the playing is easy .
definitely worth every penny .
i learned the song fairly quickly and this harp sounds incredible .
this harmonica sounds great !
this is a cool looking cheap cable which works well .
i bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault .
you 'll be able to hear them rattle .
i bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables .
it 's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident .
the green cable is good for that .
it works exactly as described .
and so cost effective !
plugged everything in , started up the game and it all worked great .
this fender cable is the perfect length for me !
sometimes i find it a bit too long but i do n't mind .
the build quality is great and i know that it will last .
fender cords look great and work just as well .
nice way to add color to your rig .
i just needed to replace my old cable and this did the job .
and its 18 foot length is great .
this is a great cable for instruments .
everything sounds clear and it 's a good length .
the color gets many compliments .
be the guy to introduce this to the group and they 'll love you .
candy apple red is dyn-o=mite ... will order candy apple green next time !
standout color is eany to find on stage .
not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better .
these are actually very reasonably priced for 18 ' cables .
do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab .
you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose .
once again fender does n't disappoint .
these cables are the best , they improve the sound of my guitar tremendously .
it also eliminates some buzz i get when i hook up extra pedals .
great cables , ca n't do wrong with a fender .
i am fairly happy with these cords .
that was the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars .
sounds wonderfu , no static or distortion , love the bright vidid color too .
great color and perfect length .
my daughter loved it .
have n't noticed any interference or too much noise from cable itself .
using with line 6 spider ii amp .
this is a pretty nice cable .
it 's very cheap for the quality of signal it passes .
overall , i 'm very happy with this purchase .
this is a great cable for all guitarist !
sharp looking ... ..sturdy and top quality !
looks great with a red guitar .
even works fine for drum triggers .
well made and it looks great with my candy apple red tele .
this was perfect and was fast .
amazon comes through again !
i like the bright color so i can identify my cable .
perfect length for a rehearsal .
i would buy again or point a friend or fellow musician the same direction .
price is right too .
very nice guitar cables from california cables !
bright red shows up on stage .
they are made very well and should last for quite a while .
get yours now at a great price .
get a couple for the musicians in your life for christmas !
this cord is extremely great quality .
i put it through a lot of wear and it always holds up !
i would recommend this to everyone .
i 've had this cable for several months now .
it 's performed well .
does n't feel cheap the way some other instrument cables do .
the candy apple red color goes well with my guitar strap .
the length is ideal .
guitars sounds great using this cable .
shipping an delivery was very quick .
midi cables are one of those things that either work or do n't .
this works well and is very affordable .
i have had great luck with all the hosa cable i 've purchased .
midi music is another world using this cable i can explore it .
good cable , good price .
it is what it is and does the job .
need a cheap midi cable that works ?
works and have n't had any problems with it .
hard to mess up a midi cable though lol
great for recording e-drums into daw .
they 're midi cables .
no errors and well made ... what else could you want ?
do people use midi anymore ?
it 's a cable .
it does cabley things .
not very flexible , would n't buy again .
more like a network cable than an instrument cord .
gets the job done but meh .
pretty basic product , worked how i needed it to .
husband is happy with product .
ca n't top that combo .
who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place ?
good price here too .
hard to find just 10 ' mike cords .
usually longer ones are only obtainable .
so , there you go !
it has a limited lifetime warranty so it 's hard to beat the deal !
good product from a reliable company .
received the product very quickly .
i am very pleased with the audio quality from the xlr cable .
i will purchase same brand in the future .
have had zero humming or interference with other equipment that 's connected .
what more can i say
item just as described ... would buy again !
cheap to buy , cheaply made .
you get what you pay for .
nicely made , long , and no issues whatsover .
a very solid cable thus far !
it is a cable and it works
just standard midi cables .
great quality and a nice length .
lots of fun when using a real kit .
i 've been using it for a couple of months without a hiccup .
connects the 'ol doepfer lmk4+ to the usb interface beautifully .
like my fist connecting with bad guys ' faces .
great but i should have bought longer ones
it fits the hole it was made for , and it works as advertised .
i needed a midi cable from my edrums to the rock band midi adapter .
i use this to connect my mpk midi controller to my roland integra-7 .
cool does the job ! , no problems
it functions just as well as expensive alternatives from what i can tell .
yes loved it perfext timing ! !
works great for desktop microphone use .
have had no problems with this product
great product at a great price !
i 'd order again in a heartbeat !
i use this for live audio .
i bought this microphone for the karaoke system in my house .
based upon its price , basically i did not expect much from this one .
it 's a good mic .
i do n't have much experience with mics in general .
other than that , it 's standard .
this mic is a very good buy for its price .
it is lightweight to handle , but has excellent frequency response .
have been using it for a month and have no complaints !
this is a well-made full sized microphone .
i 'm using it with a digital voice recorder for interviews .
seems to work great !
this is a decent microphone for $ 20 .
it comes with an adapter with it so it fits both sized connectors .
the on/off button is easy to use .
it 's a great addition , and i plan on using it lots .
it 's a midi cable , not much to say .
arrived as advertised and on time .
it was what it was supposed to be .
works perfectly , no complaints
if you need a midi cable , this is the way to go
good quality spans in place .
a quality cable , no questions asked .
never had a problem with hosa products and these cables are no exception .
perhaps they fixed a problem ?
the cable is durable , yet very flexible .
that means these cables get some actual road use and they hold up .
cheap , but surprisingly good cable
does just what i ordered it for .
nothing much to say about .
get 's the job done .
thanks for building this cables .
great quality , great product .
easy to tell which side is up .
i was surprised how long it took me find a 5 prong midi cable .
this works like a charm .
i do n't know what the odds are of finding another 5 prong .
not much to say here .
the build is average , but the price is great .
cables work as intended .
this is my favorite product .
i always get many compliments in this .
i will definitely buy this again .
good cables , exactly what i needed !
i 've investigated thoroughly , and it 's definitely a mic cable .
3 feet is the perfect length to accomplish this .
so for that i give it a 4/5 but i 'm still satisfied !
never had a problem with hosa cables .
do n't like the name .
works as its supposed to
the only way i will buy my cables in the future .
they work just fine .
works great and fast delivery .
work great , just get them man
these are just what i needed to make connections .
ca n't go wrong with hosa cables .
they hold up well .
cheap enough to have extras too .
no issues with this purchase or seller .
stands up to stage use for years on end .
i 've owned and lost a few of these .
works fine with yamaha keyboard and digital drums
nice strong and flexible cabling .
met my needs for length from my midi keyboard to my computer midi interface .
cable seems to be well built of quality components .
mounts and works well .
very great quality cables !
i bought a bunch and they all function perfectly .
and at this price , ca n't go wrong .
fits like a glove & works like charm ! !
good cable , no noise as of yet
great cables at a great price !
clearly better quality than other low cost cables i 've bought through amazon .
relatively heavy cable ( about 1/4 inch outer diameter ) .
these cables are built well .
i would recommend them .
this distance needs to be kept short and this cable worked out just fine .
terminal ends seem real solid and the cable itself is of good quality .
sound is really nice when hooked to karaoke machine .
love that it has on/off button .
works like a mic .
works great - has the extra voltage pin required for voodoo labs ground control pro
fine , as expected and came fast .
workes prefectly , great price !
so far a good quality cable , have had no issues
nice cables without spending a lot .
this xlr cables are great and provide excellent sound quality .
cables work fine , very flexible..
work fine and the look is very dignifying .
it 's a mic cable .
two connectors linked by a length of cable .
what more do you want ?
i love the metal connectors and the insulated cable .
easy to handle and sing your heart out .
this little microphone exceeded my expectations .
it improved the casset 's sound quality mightily .
i am more than pleased .
my only suggestion is that you purchase a foam to cover the microphone .
love this microphone use it for my voice recorder nice sturdy heavy .
i was worried about how cheap it was .
but the quality is that of a $ 50 midi cable .
should have bought this one in the first place .
works great with my m-audio midi keyboard .
simple , good price .
works for me just fine .
great product as expected from hosa .
quick delivery thanks to the seller and to the very affordable amazon prime service .

i like my purchase and recommendations for all .
used this between a wireless microphone receiver and an amplified speaker .
just what i needed .
it 's a mic cable by hosa , what else can i say ?
hosa has been around for a long time .
cable seems well made , we 'll se about durability .
i use this hosa pxf-110 unbalanced interconnect cable , xlr3f to 1/4 in .
it 's working very well .
good price and shipping on time .
this item is as advertised .
would recommend product and store front too .
wanted rean connectors ( long story ) , but they do the same job .
they serve my purpose very well .
this is a good cable for the price and it got here early
works just like they are supposed to .
i got this to connect a few audio processing effects to my audio interface .
the cable is worth buying .
happy with the whole transaction , will buy more
it is an xlr microphone cable .
they are well built and will last .
miidi cables do n't have to be fancy .
get the length that best reduces your cable clutter .
they are good midi cables .
well built and they last .
you do n't need fancy cables for midi
i needed this cable for a project !
good product delivery on time
great length to connect my midi controller to my computer .
fits perfectly into the 5-pin din jack on my korg volca bass .
the cable works as exspected .
thats abvery minor issue tho
did what a cable is supposed to do .
good quality - good price - well packaged
a great cable for the short distances .
not much to go wrong here .
bought these for connecting a dual wireless microphone receiver to my mixer .
easy and quick setup without a mess of extra cable laying around your gear .

i purchased two of these for a karoke system and they work great .

the mic has a great sound , feals heavy duty .
no batteries needed and great price !

bought this for my daughter to use for karaoke .
excellent volume and seems quite sturdy .
fantastic price and great quality .
i luv to karaoke and this worked wonderfully well with my karaoke/p.a .
great unit , works very well .
works well with sdp-6 and beatbuddy
works great , saved me a trip to guitar center .
not a lot to tell , it is a midi cable .
but it is constructed well with metal ends , and was reasonably priced .
i would buy it again .
i would recommend a minimum 10 ft cord .
i would have gotten the 15 or 20 ft cable if ordered again .
use this unbalanced cable , not a balanced one if connecting to a mic .
it works just what i needed
got just what i expected .
this is great for my microphone .
i have the ddj sb2 and i love it .
this cable is good .
so do n't expect magic .
it 's nice being able to consolidate the equipment and cable clutter .
i would recommend this to anybody .
the cable fits snugly into the receptacle .
seems to handle audio just fine so i find it acceptable .
happy to place it in my kit .
solid mic cables at an affordable price .
i use these to run from my mixer to jbl powered speakers .
sound is clear and no problems so far
hosa products are a good bang for the buck .
strain resistance seems like it should hold up well under medium duty use .
i have never had a problem with hosa cables .
i use them for everything in my home studio .
well made and i 've never had one fail .
these cables work fine with powered speakers that have xlr inputs .
xlr microphone cables are line-level and work fine with powered speakers .
xlr mic cables can be used with powered speakers , but not passive speakers .
xlr speaker cables can only be used with passive speakers .
most xlr cables available on amazon are microhpone line-level , including these .
i have mine connected to my m-audio keystation pro 88 and focusrite scarlett 18i8 .
no signal errors are showing up .
no problems and everything as advertised .
does what it does .
what else could i say ?
i bought this cable as a shorter replacement .
leads me to wonder about its longevity .
these deliver that so far .
arrived in two days connected to my keyboard and works perfect .
great product at a great price !
it 's a midi cable and it works
finally a short midi cable !
still rockin ' 2 years after purchase and working perfectly .
works perfectly after a year !
i bought these to go from my board to the amp .
we use them for a mobile church so they take a beating .
they are still going strong .
the xlr adapters are made from stronger steel than other cables .
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap audio recording solution .
i like hosa and rapco cables .
never have any complaints on the quality and reliability .
will definitely purchase more as needed .
this is of high quality , and is exactly the size i need .
detail is good taken care of .
perfect short xlr cable .
i needed something short for a run from a desktop mic to a mixer .
fittings seem to be high quality .
the 3 ' cable is perfect .
so far , no connection issues .
sound quality is good .
less likely to trip over long cables .
pretty good for the money but not a top end cable .
however for the price point this was pretty good
using to connect microphone to analog mixer and it functions very well .
good product for price .
lighter duty , great for home use , not recommended for professionals .
good price , great delivery !
does what it says on the tin !
perfect for what it is !
the cable jacket is nice and soft feeling .
it is not that hard and stiff pvc coating .

perfect , sturdy , and stable .

add a pop filter , and you 've got a decent microphone .
it does the job .

been using for gigs on my midi foot controller and it 's been reliable .

these are great and inexpensive cables .
they are well build and inexpensive .
i will purchase these cables again .
just needed to go from the mixer to the cordless mic piece .
long cords are a mess .
much like other hosa products i have purchased , these are solid cables .
i am using to run mics to a mixer .
these are quality cables with clean sound .
i would recommend this product .
great non-kink cable , no noise , great connectors .
this was exactly what i was after .
before i used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches .
good music to all !
each one has worked flawlessly and been the best value .
i look for hosa when i look for audio cables .
it was perfect for this application .
i have n't used the cables long enough to comment on durability .
needed a shorter cable .
could n't find one locally but found one here on amazon .
it does what is expected of it .
the cord is nice and flexible .
moldings around connectors are going to work out nicely .
not sure how long it will last with regular use .
but i will update this at that point .
packaging was of good quality as well .
excellent service and the midi cables are great .
i will be in touch .
works great , shipped fast !
this cable is very good quality .
i would recommend this as a serious studio cable .
it 's a sexy cable .
does the trick for my home studio .
works just like it intended .
good length , and did n't gouge me on price .
the cables were fine .
very well made , felt solid , and fit the port very tightly .
sturdy construction no complaints what so ever .
fast shipping item as described .
works great , does n't look cheap
this item fits the bill for that .
i tested it with several microphones and the audio quality seemed adequate .
the volume level was perfectly adequate as well .
so from a technical perspective , it worked perfectly .
the build quality of the product is also good .
it works for that purpose .
trs stands for `` tip , '' `` ring '' and `` sleeve . ''
note : the wiring diagram reflects the cable 's internal wiring .
a sticker labels `` pin 2 hot . ''
it did the trick .
it would probably work , just no real stereo effect .
does what it 's supposed to !
a good affordable replacement .
working well so far .
they worked and arrived as scheduled !
works exactly like it 's supposed to , not much else to say !
i 've been more than happy with this cable .
so far it has functioned flawlessly !
thank you ! ! !
timely and i got exactly what i wanted .
no issues , works as expected .
the cable is soft , flexible , and easy to manage .
the metal connectors and strain relievers are sturdy and fit well .
not the best on the market , and not the worst .
hosa is a go-to brand for decent quality at a fair price .
ca n't go wrong .
work well and as it should .
the midi cables are just what i needed ... thanks !
great price , alto go !
i purchased as gift ; my friend loves it .
he had it for a month now and it works as expected .
and it really looks nice ;
my daughter loves it .
plug it into an amp and away they go !
we 've had it for a year now and it works as expected .
i bought 2 of these for an outdoor pa system at a baseball field .
for the price , they were fantastic .
quality built , nice acoustic performance , long cord .
quick shipping and the item is in great condition .
way worth the price !
highly recommend this seller to any/everyone ! !
i would have given it 4 1/2 stars if i could .
very sturdy cable without any feedback .
i would buy this product again in a longer length .
cable was perfect for my needs .
replaced a defective one .
worked fine , but it 's a little thin
this cable is perfect and the quality is great .
i usually pay over 30 dollars for this type of cable quality and length .
i give it a 9/10 .
i highly recommend this cable and most of the hosa products .
use it every week at gigs .
solid , no problems with the solder joints .
a good quality cable at a very good price .
no complaints , great value .
no problems at all with this cable , very high quality !
nice solid cables , with excellent support at the ends .
there are times when a short mic cable is needed .
in my case , i use it for my wireless receiver to the mixer .
the quality is real good and the connections are snug for a good connection .
i have never had trouble with hosa ,
luckily this one is also durable and cheap .
would n't hesitate to buy another if i needed it .
could n't find better at this price point .
perfect for my midi guitar pedals .
this is all you need for a good midi cable .
this deal exceeded my expectations !
the lenovo t420 was a great deal at the low price offered .
the pc was in great condition and worked perfect .
i added another 4gb ram to max out the ram at 8gb .
this will be a super laptop .
shipping was very fast .
i would recommend buying from this company .
excellent , durable , great quality
just what i needed .
no need for any setup .
just remember midi out goes to midi in .
and midi in goes to midi in and every thing just works !
hosa products are the only i trust for live performances .
these are really long , and they work .
what else is there to say ?
best midi cable i 've used
this is a simple but a little unusual adapter .
first , it 's construction is pretty light weight .
second , the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it .
it pays to shop around !
great product , great service will order again if i have a need .
better than average quality for this price range .
just fine - like the picture shows .
this midi cable works perfect !
pretty heavy duty jacks .
great functioning cable ; perfect length needed for my application .
spend the extra few dollars and go the pro route .
i use them in the studio but they would work well on stage .
i believe the same to be true for their pro audio cables .
it looks really nice .
it 's one of the best midi cable i have ever seem .
you need a 10 foot midi cable ?
well , this one is just that .
it 's a cord , and it works .
the metal connectors have a quality look .
they are also pretty flexible .
get them , you 'll be happy .
the metal connectors have a quality look .
they are also pretty flexible .
get them , you 'll be happy .
good quality for the money .
just what i needed .
had no problems with this cables .
just what i needed .
for my purposes this worked out great .
perfect size for connecting multi-vocal effects units .
well made connectors , quickly shipped and durable .
for that , it does well .
it suits my desktop recording needs perfectly .
i would definitely order other cables made by hosa .
all in all a very good cable .
sound quality is clear and i hear no extra noise or hiss .
i would buy these again in an instant if needed .
no need for a long review but it works .
i haved used them all and still prefer hosa .
i am hard on cables .
i have yet to have a hosa cable fail me .
i actually use these for my mic cables and to run powered speaker signal .
these cables are rugged and well made .
they snapped in easily and were the perfect length for my home theater setup .
excellent cables for the money !
it 's a cable .
no weird noises in the background caused by it .
what more can you ask for ?
it works , and arrived quickly .
just a cable that does what it should .
great quality at a great price .
recommend them to anyone .
these cables work well , even in very warm situations .
it gets quite hot back there , but the signal stays true .
i would buy these again .
great price good selection .
fast delivery as always .
i 'm very pleased with this microphone .
the volume level is good .
it 's a quality microphone at a reasonable price .
for just $ 15 , this mic is a bargain .
it picks up my voice clear and loud !
do wish the wire is a couple feet longer though .
i personally have 3 microphones that range from $ 5 to $ 200 .
shipping was on schedule so no complaints here at all .
this is a great cable ... a little smaller in diam .
this thing is built like a tank .
the connectors are made with a chunky metal jacket that 's smooth and bright .
oh ... the connectors are heavy .
the soft limp cable bends easily and has a quality feel .
however , the shield is not connected to the metal jacket around the connector .
perhaps this is to prevent ground loops between metal-cased instruments .
the rubber strain relief on each end is n't designed to prevent wire pullout .
a simple metal crimp holds the cable tightly .
while lesser midi cables may have only three conductors , this one has five .
the two extra lines carry 5-volts from one instrument to the next .
some gear use this to detect when other gear is connected .
the plugs fit nicely into midi jacks .
it 's a firm and solid connection with very little wiggle .
the shiny metal makes them easier to locate behind a dark rack or synthesizer .
there are never any missing/stuck notes or noticable latency from first instrument to last .
the aforementioned `` floating '' metal jacket does n't degrade the midi signal .
a tiny kvetch ... the screw on one connector appeared to be slightly crooked .
i thought initially that it was loose or cross-threaded - it was neither .
the screw-hole was not chamfered neatly all the way ` round .
this affected nothing electrically or mechanically , so i simply screwed it back in .
the screws on my five other hosa midi cables were both straight and tight .
four stars for performance and quality - with one extra for value .
they are quite inexpensive for what you get .
i 've spent many hours happily clogging midi streams through these .
stop reading and buy some so you can too : - )
much nicer than the cheap plastic ended midi cables .
looks and feels better , but also locks into place a bit better .
i made my first song on garageband using these .
what else can i say .
hosa cables are as much a part of my music as the sounds themselves .
i 've used these cables for years and they 've always performed 100 % .
these cables function great for the intended use .
i like the quality of the connectors , and the flexibility of the cable .
there is no memory effect to deal with in these midi cables .
would recommend these cables to anyone , especially at this price point .
only works if you also have the 25 ft stereo headphone cable too !
works great with my gh5 ( for such a cheap price ) .
i 'll review again , if anything changes .
worked perfectly between an external microphone and camcorder .
it 's very useful to hook up my mic to my yamaha mox8
i miss this thing .
it was stolen along with other equipment .
great little strong adapter .
well it 's a midi cord so it connects two midi ports .
exactly as described and they work fine .
best price for midi cables this length that i could find .
not much else to say really .
an excellent value for the money .
the cables arrived one day after ordering .
i only asked for two day , but hey i am not complaining .
thick cable , great sound quality and good quick/secure connections .
3 ft is good size for on camera connections with zoom mic .
the build quality seems good , with descent-quality connectors .
i have used it to patch together audio gizmos .
the hosa xlr cables are affordable and very heavily made .
i have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere .
i decided to purchase shorter cables and the hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly .
you really will not be disappointed with these .
i was having problems with noise in a recording system .
replaced a 15 ft generic cable with this and the noise is gone .
the connectors are well made and heavy gauge .
this is actually a pretty nice cable .
i honestly was not expecting something so solid at this price .
i am going to buy a third !
good length - i can stretch it anywhere in my home studio .
hosa produces my favorite midi cables .
recommended purchase for your midi setup
i 've been using this cable for a few months with no issues .
solid construction for an economy cable .
does n't have the fancy name , but suits the purpose .
works like a charm .

came quickly as well .

it works great i use it to plug additional mic for interviews .

what 's there to say ?

it fit my needs perfectly !

it works and it 's cheap and fair priced
i use it to plug my casio cz101 into massive and it works great

just shows how great of a connection the audio jack has !
great purchase , works as expected

works as described and not 100000000 $ like all the other adapters .
does the job and for a great price !
one snag i ran into it how the wire itself is not one foot .
maybe altogether , but not the wire .
just something you may want to consider .
perhaps include a short extender in your order just to be safe .
just what i wanted .
not sure how long it will last but it works
this is the one i want to buy .
it 's works great !
did the trick but looks cheaply made
useful and handy works as intended

received it in just a couple days in flawless condition right to my door .
no traveling around and haggling with vultures who work off of a commission .

it took 2 weeks to arrive from us to istanbul , turkey .
( which is pretty fast ) .
strongly recommend the product .

all items were delivered as promised .
works well for my purposes .
i use it for recording drums when i need more versatility .
all other midi i record through direct usb .
what can one say about two cables ?
this cable has work great .
no issues despite the length .
happy with its performance .
i have relied on hosa quality for 20 years .
high end cable snobs may disagree , but never a problem here .
these are my favorite cables .
the cable is flawless and a great bargain .
there is no latency - would have to be waaayy longer for that .
price was right , easy to install , arrived quickly .

i would tell anyone to get this great product .
i have no reason not to expect proper results from it .
i recommend this seller .
when you need this , but do not have it , you feel it !
i use this cable to connect my microphone to my computer .
so it was n't the cable 's fault , just my own personal issue .

this is one of those , it is what it is posts .

it 's a cable what else i can say ?

midi cables in the local music shops are outrageous .
yet they want as much as a monster cable for them , ridiculous .
i will be back to buy more if i need it .
do n't buy the hype when purchasing digital cables .
the one from radio shack seems more robust .
if you need a midi cable this buy this .
or go to radio shack for one .
i 've had good luck with hosa cables .
midi , patch , etc .
have n't encountered a bad one so far .
yes , i can say how i like it with the stars .
i do not like to be required to write more
it 's a midi cable .
i have n't had any issues with it .
the rubber grip near the edges is a nice touch .
works with canon t3i to any xlr microphone .
great quality and no reason to give it anything less than 5 stars .
not sure if it mixes down to stereo or just mono or mono stereo .
will update review when i figure that out .
researched reviews you can trust , cody tubbs tubbs media productions www .
appears to be reasonably well made , for hosa that is .
i really like this thing .
wish i would have thought of this one .
great bang for your buck !
it works fine for the handy type recorders .
but forget hooking this directly to a pc .
way too much noise .
i needed this cable to attach my samson microphone to my olympus digital recorder .
i rated 4 star because this product works the way it suppose to work .
nothing fancy , just a nice , solid , well-made cable .
some would say yes and some would say no .
the connectors are solid and well-molded .
they have good strain reliefs .
the cables are thick and comfortably pliable without being wimpy .
it 's very durable and it worked without a problem .
the cables work as they should and the price was great too .
make sure you get the proper length of cable for your needs

cable is of decent quality and reasonable length given the cost .
i 'd probably grab a couple more just to have handy .
good build quality , and it does its job quite well .
you ca n't go wrong with it .
well , it works fine .
connectors fit firm and there is no play .
i thought that the cable itself would be 1 foot .
the entire thing including the xlr connector is 1ft .
the cable itself is only 7-8 inches .
you ca n't go wrong with this cable at this price point .
but it works splendidly !
but in my case it was just right .
still 4-stars , but found another use .
i have a few hosa cables .
they do the job .
there is no quality loss , and there is no volume loss .
i suggest buying a longer cable .
you can always shorten it by wrapping it up .
it was as described well and it works fine .
what more can you ask for when buying a cord ?
exactly as described , well made , does its job perfectly .
i have had no problem with it .
i bought this to use with the rode ntg2 and a canon 5d mk3 .
but time will tell .
i mount both items on mini tripods with this short cable connecting them together .
it 's a great match for the application .
we needed this adapter and this was the cheapest and most professional replacement .
justice for kurt cobain .
works as it should .
it 's long enough to fit easily from the microphone to the camera body .
value is excellent for the price .
right out of the phantom power , to the extension , to the pc .
i 'm all set .
i do recommend a f/m 3.5 extension like i said
system < /a > & nbsp ; into something more useable .
another reason why i love this is it 's noise free .
firm fit , solidly molded ends , reputable branded cable .
seems like it 's good quality , too , and stays well connected .
have have no problems using these to line up all my gear .
like totally awesome dude !
these cables are built well and you simply ca n't beat the value .
a great addition to my home studio .
such low noise ratio .
so happy this thing functions so correctly !
does exactly what i needed it to do .
hosa makes great cable products
these midi cords have worked great for me .
have been using them now for about a month .
this cable works for its intended purpose , and does it well .
does what it is suppose to .
i use this to go from a maschine to a midi keyboard .
usb is faster so if you can do it that way , do it .
but this is a great product for the price .
the ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality .
if you need a one-foot midi cable , this is certainly one of those .
i used it to connect the midi-pro box to my rock band squier guitar .
this cable worked as expected .
it seems to be very good quality .
i always get great service at amazon .

it was long enough for my needs .
purchased 3 of these and all work fine .
no manufacturing issues , appears to be a good quality product .
quality sounds good from a first impression .
as long as it holds up , i 'm satisfied with the purchase .
high quality and with great shielding !
buy it , you 'll love it .
this is my first xlr cable , so i ca n't compare it anything .
compliments my vixia r40 when i want to use an external mic .
it works , what else is there to say ?
i have a panasonic g6 , which works great for movies .
built in mics are good , but nothing like external mics .
good price , very solidly built .
this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable .
pin # 3 then ties to pin # 1 with the ground wire .
item worked very well .
just plug & play , works like a charm !
i purchased a shotgun mic and the chord was too long for my dslr .
get yourself one today !
this works just fine due to the short wire .
no extra wire to deal with or hasel with .
it is a 1/8 '' stereo ended angled plug on one end .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
it works fine and is as advertised .
no complaints and the price was great .
yes , i would recommend this to others .
it did exactly as advertised .
ca n't lose with this product .

much cheaper than guitar center , best buy etc .
i needed it to connect my native instruments maschine to an akai mpk49 .
this is perfect for what i was looking for .
great , long cable at a great price !
i use this for recording with pro tools and midi
this cable does the trick , and it was cheap , cheap , cheap .
i consider that a win .
the quality is good .
nothing to complain about .
and the shielding cable seems fairly thick .
it was a few dollars cheaper than the same thing at best buy .
hosa makes great high-quality cables , and this midi cable is another shining example .
they 've been tossed around and mutilated in all sorts of bags and cases .
bought this for the short length and it is perfect !
well made , xlr 3 pin adaptor to mini .
this works perfectly with the dynamic microphone and camcorder i bought on amazon .
i like this cable for a very special need .
also be careful on which microphone you use .
this little hosa xlr does it for me .
and i really like it 's neat , stylish design .
used between our digital video camera 's mic-in port and the wireless mic receiver .
so for this application , this cable is highly recommended .
this one feels sturdy and fits well in the sony a57-slt jack .
i am happy with this purchase .
cable helps me record onto my laptop .
works as it should .
minor clean up in post .

i would definitely recommend to others
work it as is and good price !
not much to be said .
it 's a midi cable , and it works just fine .
the quality seems about right for the price .
this is all you need for a good midi cable .
the cable itself is soft and flexible , has about a half-inch bend radius .
i use these cables to connect my midi controller keyboard to a synthesizer module .
have n't had any problems , seems to work perfect .
this is a great little cable .
i bought this microphone for use in an it department for occasional audio recording .
it certainly does the trick .
the cable is of good quality wire , and the connectors are well constructed .
very simply , this connector will not introduce hum or noise into your setup .
being a dslr shooter comes with its advantages and disadvantages .
obviously audio is the main problem that we all face .
this little guy took control of the situation and slapped it like a pimp .
cable arrived a day earlier than expected , and works exactly as advertised .
a really fine hosa product that exceeds expectation at a great price .
this item performs as advertised .
low noise and great durability .
works perfectly to power my system !
fast shipping and high quality cable .
thank you fit find on microphone it just what i wanted
i just wish the xlr connector was neutrik !
instead of the 1 ft. for my dslr shotgun mic .
it is a little tight .
this product corrects that by sending the mono signal into both stereo channels .
just received this cord and it seems to work as expected .
what can you say about an adapter cord ?
clear audio for the price on a canon dslr and i highly recommend it .
i got a 15ft one .
just buy it , you know you want it : )
works the way it 's supposed to .
90 degree trs is a nice touch .
the hosa angled 1/8 stereo to female xlr cable is pretty great .
why is it pretty great ?
plus , this one is angled .
reasonably priced , works as advertised , and ships quickly .
with only one exception , this cable is not designed for a stereo camera .
this cable is a balanced cable .
this is not that cable .
i do n't really know what else to say .
the wiring seems fine , though a little on the fragile side .
with normal home/amateur use , this will work fine .
for what it is , it 's actually just fine .
this is exactly what i need for my shotgun mic .
quality and construction are decent and it does its job .
huge improvement in audio quality .
this cable for the price you can not go wrong .
it has not failed me one time since i have purchased it .
( about a year ago . )
use this in conjunction with my samson headworn system and it works very well !
it does ok for what it is so i gave it 4 stars .
just the right length to reach the ports on the camera .
no hissing sounds what so ever .
i could not be happier with this purchase .
the weight and angle of this cable are perfect !
the price is right too !
bought this in conjunction with my mackie thump .
i use it to plug in my iphone .
very good construction and materials .

it is ideal for connecting a shotgun mic to a dv camera . ''
if you are using a mono microphone , you are looking for the xvm102f .
it handles the stereo separation quite nicely .
it 's even capable of phantom power , if you need that .
bought this for my canon t2i .
works perfect and great quality .
i ordered this to use regular stage microphones with the tascam dr07 digital recorder .
dynamic mics just do not put out enough for this use .
perhaps it needs a stereo xlr condenser mic .
you just have to make sure the plug doesnt get pulled from your camera .
it has worked flawlessly the first few weeks that i have owned it .
i use nothing but hosa cables in my studio .
i highly recommend using hosa .
worked well felt a little cheap .
yes it works great !
needed new interconnect cables for my studio and these work perfectly .
good product at a good price .
good cables and length .
the gauge is a little on the thinner side .
we shall see if they hold up with time .
good cable , better than the one the mic i got came with .
hosa makes great cables - no exception here .
high quality , has withstood the rigors of mobile/wedding dj use .
as advertised ... hosa products are always of good quality/design .
use this to connect my ipod to a bose l1 live sound/stage pa system .
just what i needed .
these are cheap cords they break after a month !
works great , very affordable .
your basic xlr to 1/4 trs cable .
no issues , works fine .
quality cable for casual use .
perfect for studio use .
as far as quality goes ... ... .so far , so good .

and the price was a good deal for the hosa cable brand .
yes , i would recommend this cable-set for anyone on a tight budget .

hosa makes good stuff , this is no exception .

1/4 '' adapter to a 1/8 '' cords do not work well .

the cable is logn enough and does the job in my man cave .

the sound is good and connection is tight .
i can also change this cable with my kareoke so it works for me .
never shop at ( unnamed major guitar/bass/drums/accessories store ) for this type of item .
this is a fine and inexpensive cable for practice use .
when i first got it , one end was partially unscrewed .
i 'd guess it came loose during shipment .
what the heck , just tighten it up .
after all these years of playing i had never thought of that before .
also , when it was brand-new i got some static noise through the amp .
unplugging the cable and plugging it back in cleaned things right up .
overall it does what it is supposed to do and is a good value .
really , you should just buy a whole bunch .
works great from my i pad to amp
i have it connected to my laptop from my 24 channel mackie to record .
although that is my fault and i can not hold it against the product .
now they sound the way they should .
( silent when nothing is playing )
it fit the bill perfectly .
this worked without gender reassignment surgery and it 's very high quality .
works exactly as described .
just what i needed .
please check with your mic manufacturer ...
much lighter than i expected .
seems like solid craftsmanship .
i plugged it into my mic and it 's perfect .
great adapter for me in studio use and will buy more if needed !
well worth the money .
genuinely pleased with my purchase .
going to buy more .
would buy longer lengths next time around
seems built pretty well , and sounds good .
ca n't beat it for the price .
overall this is a solid cable and the pricing is where it should be .
looking it over , i was very impressed .
this really looks like a nice , quality cable !
good , thick cable and the connections seem solid .
i 'm very happy with this cable .
would i gig with it ?
maybe - but i 'd carry a few extras , just in case .
at this price , that 's an easy thing to do .
great cable and great value .
just what i was looking for in a cable and price was great too .
it 's a cable .
i do n't get any hum , and it works fine .
this cable is durable , inexpensive and an excellent value .
it is nice and long with good flexibility and i would reccomend it .

i used this to play music from my computer/phone to my guitar amp !
( put it in the headset plug in ! )
ehhh might want to go with a gold counterpart .
otherwise this is a functional cord !
if you 're simply into quick cheap functionality , this product is for you !

wish they could be smaller , but these are definitely solid .
wires are as good as the connections they make .

firm fit , good build quality , and the price was right .
you ca n't really go wrong if you need a new guitar cable .
keep a few of these around as spares .
you really ca n't have too many of these cables .
i 'm always losing them .
this was a christmas gift for my husband .
he actually picked it out , but i made the purchase .
it was exactly what he wanted and he 's happy so i 'm happy !
this is a good solid cable with no problems .
quality is above-average and they 've held up well since i bought them .
the cables were long enought and seem to be of good quality .

came quickly and serves its purpose well .
exactly as expected performance for the item ordered .
will purchase more hosa cables .
jacks are nicely finished and well polished .
very flexible , solid and quiet .
nothing special - just a regular instrument cable .
decently durable , decently inexpensive .
nothing particularly special though .
at least hosa is a brand name that i 've used before .
this is your basic , black electric guitar cable but it works great .
nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough .
in my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around .
from experience they tend to just die without notice .
i have a feeling this one will last a long time .
it is built sturdy and sounds really good .
i recommend this product .
great cable , but how can you mess this up ?
just what i needed at the time !
this is well made and just what i needed !

i bought two and use them every day
this is a very nice cable for the price .
i already bent one end of it though , fortunately it still works fine .
inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic .
have n't noticed any hum or crackles .
for sure a good buy .
i would order another one .
solid metal tips protect the jack from breakage or splitting .
g'head , give it a whirl .
needed a long cable for a guitar .
not a professional guitar player , but the sound i 'm getting is good .
nothing bad to say in my opinion it 's a good manufacturer quality cable .

i see no reason not to buy this cable again if another is needed .

this is good cable .
excellent 1/4 '' plugs .
grade a+ cable at a very affordable price .

the 25 ft. cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft .
works well and seems to have no feed back problems
perfect for what i need
good product and swift delivery - thanks !
i would buy again .
nice patch cable to use from cd player to mixer
another quality hosa product !
the 10 ' cable allows is the same length as most guitar cables .
it does n't force me to be super close to the amp .
i can scoot back and and comfortably play and use my pedals without interference .
the construction appears to be rather durable .
i have n't noticed any noise interference while using the headphones .
what more can i say .
the cable works perfectly for my needs .
i needed this to use a 1/4 out to 1/8 in .

i would recommend this to a friend .
the other one 's been doing okay so far .
we use these at band practice for mics that do n't have switches .
that 's about what it is .
hard to argue with the price .
good to have in you bag of adapters
i would n't recommend this adapter for power transfer between xlr cables .
every musician should have a converter in their arsenal .
works perfectly as a connector to make my microphone setup possible
this works really well for me .
feels well made and sturdy .
i got this cable for the cigar box guitar set up i put together .
plugged in with lots of violent movement and no complications .

i 've got probably 30 hours of practice time on it now .
no noises or crackling to speak of .
wish i had bought a longer one but that 's not the cables fault .
very nice for the price .
they come unthreaded fairly easy though .
but if you do n't move them around , should be fine .
top quality , heavy cable with well made ends .
they are a hosa product , they are high quality .
cord worked perfectly for my keyboard .
i have noticed no reduction in quality of the sound .
the r/l channels are passed through with no issue .
the cable does not feel cheap as some other audio cables do .
tl ; dr : it 's a good stereo 1/8 to 1/4 cable
i got this around january 2013 and it still works .
i would definently reccomend it
not much to say here .

it can unscrew pretty easily , but this is hardly a problem right now .

good quality and performance for non-gold plated contact product and i 'll buy more .
i 'm not willing to pay the premium for gold plated versions .
just what i needed .
great if you can still get them ! ! !
i was unaware of this when i bought this adapter .
used it for a mic cable extension .
for the price , fantastic .
but for seven bucks it gets the job done .
recommended if you are doing the `` beginner '' thing and testing the waters .
otherwise , spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting .
and boy was i impressed .
zero issues with this cable so far .
i 'll update this review if/when it breaks .
caveat : i do n't perform on stage .
these are strictly for home use .
the plugs fit tight and are reliable .
what more can i say ?
buy hosa and i do n't think you 'll be disappointed .
this certainly fulfills the requirements .
works just fine for me and what i need .
i did n't need anything fancy .
just a connection to a little fender amp i have .
with strong clear sound at a great price .
works great on my 100 watt amp .
almost compares to a monster cable .

cable came at a very good price .
am very pleased with these cables .
good quality product and low price .

it does not feel cheap at all .
the signal is super clean .
i would definitely buy from hosa again .
i am pleased to say that it is a solid piece of equipment .
no buzz whatsoever and it appears and feels to be of very sturdy construction .

a nice combination and easy way to get the output to any amplifier .
wonderful sound and durable .
good length , as well .
what can i say , hosa makes a wonderful product that works every time .

this was an interim solution until my custom insert cables arrived from the supplier .
used to put a mic into an effect pedal or amp etc .
i am pleased with the performance and build .
its affordable and it works .
and it was deleivered on time too ...
i do n't find this to be an issue .
tl ; dr it works perfectly .
it helps combine the sound into one audio track , which works for me .
solid , quality product .
this product comes in handy .
i can not tell the difference in sound quality but it is good .
the only problem i have is that the cables are too thin .
the could have been a little more thick .

thanks for having a source for small and very special items .
i had a helpful volunteer run 500 feet of xlr cable backwards .
pulled out the adapters and saved the day .
i have also recommended the male to male adapters .
i would recommend these to a friend but none of my friends use them .
it works fine at this time .
i would recommend to others .
it is a very good option for mics w/o an on/off button .
it does well what it is supposed to do .
reason for four stars : it could be a bit smaller .
delivery was prompt and price was fine
works perfectly , highly recommended
it 's a cable .
it feels appropriately rubbery .
it works like you would expect .
love this , good deal , works great on behringer , bass modeler !

a good cable for a decent price !
made my life so much easier !
this did the job beautifully !
exactly what we needed , delivered on time and works fine .
great , in a pinch .
fast ship and good connections
does what i paid for it to do .
these did the trick .
they are well constructed and solid .
i used them to change the genders on our snake to feed the mains .
this allowed me to connect my xlr mic to my camcorder .
i was surprised how much i had to search for such a simple product .
the price was right and the quality was excellent .
i will definitely tell my band friends about using this store .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
no complaints so far .
works perfectly , great price , handy connector .
would recommend to all who need this kind of connector .
and did i mention the great price ?
works as anticipated ... great accessory for my business needs !
sounds go in one end , and come out the other .
exactly what i need .
excellent product , very happy with it
did n't work for what i needed i guess but the cord seemed fine .
the cable works great !
works perfect , thanks .
good product at a fair price , what 's not to like ?
it does the job and is very solid .
a must-have for customizing your cable length .
much cheaper to replace this if it breaks then the amps control .
none of that with hosa .
as the title says , it works .
but , no issues besides that .
could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall .
nice adapter and it works great .
if you are in need of xlr to 1/4 '' adapter this one works !
note ; combining signals is a different matter all together .
in that case you do want some sort of tranformer isolation device .
they also have amic level unit just like it .
but for splitting , have no fear .
your signal integrity will be fine and your devices will be safe .
the 1.5 foot cable is very short but that is what i wanted .
plan to get one more .
does the job nicely .
great quality aaaa+ would buy again !
great cable for its price .
just what i needed .
good quality fast shipping .
not mad at all .
well made , solid construction .
this one was done right .
do n't use them much but very nice to have a few around .
great price , and fast shipping !
will most likely order again .
shipped super fast and it matches the description just as stated .
couldnt be more happy with choosing this !
i does what it should
these are well made and connect solidly .
quiet -- no hum other noise problems .
inexpensive solution to send one audio source to two recorders .
perfect to chain multiple speakers !
sometimes you are only given one output and these works great for those occasions .
it 's a splitter .
cheaply made and extremely useful .
this is a must for wedding/event videographers .
i guarantee it will save your behind on numerous occasions .
just be careful when handling/storing this adapter outer walls bend easily .
hosa seems to be a good brand .
used for school plays for feeding boom box or computer audio into audio mixer
perfect for my needs !
does what it should do .
nothing else to say really .
works like it is suppose to .
looks like a quality cable .
not the highest quality , but a great value for the price .
works as designed fits snugly into the jacks i use it with .
this cable allows me to run my amp/processor/guitar straight to my laptop for recording .
the quality is good , does not really add any unwanted noise .
for the price , definitely worth it .
this does exactly what it needs to do .
or some other audiophile type stuff ?
good solid quality and does what is it supposed to do .
6 more words to do ha !
dirt cheap , it works just fine .
i would recommend this quality product and buy additional adapters the vendor .
the product arrived on time and worked perfectly .
very handy to have a few of these lying around .
i remedied this by adding a label with electrical tape .
it 's amazing how much adapters like this used to cost .
i manage a classic rock band .
i recently ordered a bunch of stuff to replace aging gear .
cables , mics , stands , snakes , etc .
we have now been out on a couple of gigs with the stuff .
it is all good quality and working fine .
does exactly what i expected it to do .
it did everything i hoped it would do
works as advertised , nothing more , nothing less .
top , ,amazon seller , ,10/10 , ,big , ,thanks , , ( )
the cable worked perfectly , no flaws or issues , over 1 year later
fast shipping , great quality
as described , good product
very happy with the product , even though not made in usa .
i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for gear .
what else can i say ?
if you need an xlr gender changer , this ca n't be beat .
now i can record with 6 channels , and monitor with 2 .
( it 's an 8 channel xlr snake ) .
why do i go through all that you ask ?
hence the word adapter ... : -p i love it .
my mistake , not theirs .
you can not tell theres anything there except the mic and you .
these are so cheap on amazon .
hosa makes the best adapters , insert cables , etc .
you can always count of them .
thanks ... ... ... ...
works great for us .
works great for my needs
this works great for me .
i never touch their mixer and just handle my own mix .
worked just as expected .
not bay for the money
the first tracks we layed down are good sounding .
splitter works just fine for my needs
i have used this for over a year and it works great .
i am able to talk to my co-announcer without covering up my mic .

opened one additional input for me .
connects an ipad , ipod or iphone to a pa system
the cable works fine despite that it has molded plastic connectors at both ends .

this product is really high quality and has n't messed up once .
just what i needed ! ! !
perfect length and reliably built !

it 's a cable .
otherwise not a lot to say .
i like when items are exactly as described .
very happy with this purchase .
it is what is is .
i 've had no problem with it .
prefect length for a headphone replacement cord and well made .
using this cable to sync my pocket wizards with my studio strobes .
so far so good , good solid connection without any issues .
these cables are perfect and very easy to use .
just plug your iphone to the speaker and its works amazingly .
came fast - came well packed - well made - very professional quality
useful , even if i replace the femal xlr to male
they do n't feel cheap .
they do n't feel like they 're about to break when you touch them .
they work beautifully as is .
buy them if you need them .
exactly what is should be !
another great product from hosa !
does what i need it to do
very useful for a patch cord in my studio
this adapter cable fills my requirement exactly .
i appreciate the availability to find the variety of unique patch cables here .
very good quality and fits without any looseness or popping sounds .
it looks to be well-made and it works fine with no noticeable noise .
larger diameter ) plastic case to fit tightly into the socket .
that 's not the cable 's fault , it 's apple 's ...
i do not notice any audio issues with it and its a thin cable .
easy to wrap up and keep with your supply of cables !
great price and supper fast shipping .
so far so good ; it seems to work fine .
i 'm glad i got the long one .
sometimes i need to extra length .
had to get a replacement .
these cables work like a charm .
i would recommend this product and the company hosa cable to everyone .
thus far the cable has performed well with good fidelity .
for occasional use i would purchase this cable again .
so useful for connecting electronics to amps or mixing boards or pa systems .
came quick , good quality and nice long cord .
sorry for the late review however i was very pleased with this purchase
needed these to split out my amps in my rack from my driverack pa2 .
so far so good , it 's definitely a great product for the price .
it does the job you need it too and does n't break the bank .
lots of reviews here complaining about the quality and length of the cables .
both are valid complaints , but not for the price of this product .
it 's worked for me as i have plenty of spare cable .
get it , use it and remember how much it cost .
perfect to split mono mike into xlr l-r pre amp .
as a semi-pro dj this is good to have .
have used it daily for over 6 months now and have had no issues .
i would purchase this cable again .
10 ft is great stretch for some of my speaker and mic needs .
cable thickness is great for those worrying of pinching .
for the price , it works well .
if you need something more quality , it will cost a lot more .
i have had no problems with mine .
i would buy it again .
i use this for my headphone amplifier .
seems to work well .
i have no complaints .
it is compatible with my headphones .

use them about once a week and sometimes even more .
worked exactly as i expected .
simple to use and the seller got it to me really fast !
works great , seems to be sturdy enough .
arrived fast and works great
the foh can hook up to the other side and do their thing .
.good price , handy adapter .
seems built well enough but not terribly heavy duty
i think the zoom h4n is a very good product .
sent my audio via stereo , like i needed .
5 stars , no hesitation .
good price packaged great and shipped fast what more could i say .
put it to test use and it seemed just fine .
i hope it will hold up but other than that im super happy .
i will order from this seller again soon as they have great prices .
the auxilary side doesnt fit my samsung galaxy s4 phone case .
would be a 5 star if it did fit .
however i can hear a `` hum '' sound when song playing is done .
that 's why i deducted one star .
this cable seemed a good combo of quality and price .
i use it to plug my phone into my amp for pandora .
provides a nice clean sound ,
works perfectly for what i need it for !
hosa makes great products and this is another example of their quality .
note that these are essentially passive cables , i.e .
works very well with my application that i need it for
bought this before my last gig .
no problems yet ! !
i recommend for the price .
excellent , both stereo channels to power amp and no power loss
hosa makes great products .
this splitter is solid and does the job-
no sound degregation or interference .
seems to be a top-notch built cable .
this cable connected the amp i bought nicely .
it 's solid , it works well , no complaints .
does what it 's supposed to , built like a decent cable .
very satisfied with this product .
the price was reasonable as well .
the size is convenient too .
thank you very much .
i used it to connect my computer to a headphone amplifier .
good length and good quality cable .
not much exciting to write about a cable that just works as expected .
works well - and several months later is still in use .
this cable is great !
for the price , it 's already a plus .
it does its job , and i 'm pleased with this item .
i 'd recommend anyone to purchase this .
i have n't had any problems with the hosa cables i have purchased .
there are lots of helpful variations of connectors
i use this to connect my computer 's audio out to a headphone amp .
light and plastic but works well enough .
using them for amp micing .
best sound i 've ever gotten from a mic .
is a great product ,
very fast delivery and product meets my needs .
will consider for future purchases !
for $ 40 these are fantastic mics .
works as expected , and at a good price from this seller .
why pay more for something that does what it is suppose to do ?
flawless.. had it for about a year.. no problems
good quality cables and connectors
did exactly what i needed it to do without a hitch !
exactly what i needed .
my mic is monaural and i need to input to a stereo ipad dock .
now it records on both .
( through the focusrite dock ) .
works like a dream .
useful for the price .
i bought these mics instead of the q4s .
for the money , these are quite wonderful .
they actually sound like my sure sm58 .
i bought them to record toms on a drum kit .
they work quite well for this purpose .
better than i was expecting !
thank you very much .
a sturdy cable that seems to be very high quality .
no more misplaced adapters .
a worthy addition to my collection .
the price is good too .
use it all the time a good buy good quality and shipped on time

i would recommend this to anyone .
have to turn the mixer eq down .
these microphones work well .
great price for this product .
great purchase for me .
i 'm in a 3-piece folk band .
reasonably priced , great sound quality , sturdy mics .
the padded gig box is an added plus !
great for travel and mobility .
for the price these mics ar amazing .
work so incredibly well and just ant recommend them enough .
almost as good as my shure sm-58s .
hot signal , good windscreen , great clarity , fat bottom .
great mics for the money .
and the price makes them a great bargain .
this thing works like a dream .
appear to be well made , great price .
very good item for very good price .
it worked as i expected it to and felt like a fair value .
fair price and good product .
not much to say about these simple items except they look and work good .
time will tell if they stand up to hard use .
cable arrived on time and well packaged .
it did its job and did it well .
actually i could say great -especially if you consider price .
this is used to input my cell pnone-mp3-player into a pa system .
i use it for live sound nest '57s and '58s .
a great vocal mic .
loved everything about these mics except they do n't have an on/off switch .
that is why i did n't give it 5 stars .
if that is not important to you ... they are perfect ! !
does not pick up exterior feedback .
good value for money - sounds pretty good
the mics are medium-low quality sound and for the price , real good .
work well ... sound great for the price
liked them so much for the price that i have purchased another set .
remember , not hi end , but very efficient
was far better than i thought it would be .
clear crisp sound that is very close to my expensive mics .
really great variety at a reasonable price .
i was unable to find the exact item i needed locally .
the perfect connection without adapters .
was shipped very quickly .
the cable is solid and i have n't had any problems with it yet .
overall great product for a great price with great quality .
i have not recorded any hiss , distortion , glitching , clipping , etc .
caused by the cable .
works well and handles repeated inserting and removing .
this cable works perfectly so far .
i would have no problem recommending it to anyone .
price is good too and was shipped promptly
played several gigs with it .
seems to be pretty reliable comparing to other units on amazon .
great product thanks ! !
werkz fine with my eos c100 dual xlr input : )
good quality and good durability .
no complaints and very satisfied with performance .
the connection sticks very well .
no worry about loosing out ! !
this did exactly what i needed .
i have a focusrite 2 channel digital interface that records mono on each channel .
i use this to get a stereo recording using both channels on one track .
nice item , thanks .
work okay for my small amateur group
can miss at this price its awsome
this mic is fantastic .
i purchased these on an impulse because of the great reviews .
i use shure , audix , mxl and tc mics .
the tonal quality is up to par also .
leave the expensive stuff at home .
stock up on these for live gigs and open mic nights .
tight pattern , but no feedback
great addition to the band ... for back up equipment .
good quality and love the fact that they were packed in the case .
they are clear and easy to set up .
thanks for a great product and a great deal .
only had a couple weeks but have worked great .
we bought this for our church .
mica are nice but the case is just a hard plastic .
bought these for my first big audio upgrade for my podcast .
gets the job done .
an immediate project and low budget..so i got these .
thank you arrived safely packed !
nice set of beginners mics !
ca n't beat that !
they are also very durable as i move those cables around frequently .
love it and would buy more !
transfers the signal perfectly .
yep , that 's about it .
i also use the cybersync transmitter and receivers .
for guest to write whatever they want .
( also another reason to have an assistant ) .
also that 's why i needed the ac power cord for my camera .
the ipad is also plugged into power .
hope this helps someone else setup an awesome photo booth as well !
arrived on time and was a lot cheaper than most other cables .
i cant tell any difference from the others
well built sturdy cable .
i 've had no trouble with this .
i have several similar hosa cables that all work well .
rack mount patch unit would be better .
much better than trying to make my own adapters .
great buy , no problems , would recommend .
used to split the signal of the wireless microphone to my two speakers .
( mobile dj application )
works fine for me when i need it .
does exactly what it was purchased for !
like the padded case , and the sound quality is great !
packed in nice case .
used them live with my carvin pa. they performed well in an outside setting .
have no issues with them yet .
i use them primarily for recording insturments , not for vocals or live performances .
i would recommend for any small church , school , or hall .
they have that pro look to them withy the pro price .
on the negative side they pick up everything .
all in all they sound good
i love the dynamics of these mics .
i guess we 'll have to see how long they last , lol !
but they are a great product for the price .
i would buy them again in a heart beat .
for the price , the sound is great .
weird i know but it happened .
anyway the stereo cable cleared it right up .
that cable was the one i needed and i 'm very happy with it .
i recomend it to everybody because is a very good quality .
great quality and great performance .
i use it from my amplifier to my digital recorder .
no static is picked up at all .
works fine just like pretty much all hosa products .
i like the rubber cable casing as well .
definitely proof that hosa products rule .
you never know when you buy cheaper cables online .
this particular cable is solidly built .
exactly as advertised and it works .
a hard item to find when you need it , but you had it .
i 've had no problems yet .
after all , what can i say ?
: - ) so , i 'm pleased .
great mics for a low cost .
after a thorough research , i settled on this great deal .
they come in neat case to boot .
for the price , you get 3 incredibly decent microphones with clips and case .
pair with some cheap foam covers and you ca n't go wrong .
i recommend these to anyone with any type of budget , high or low .
just started using the mics .
so far so good .
they arrived on time and are easy to set up .
i will provide additional feed back as they are used more .
very good quality and exactly what i needed .
this splitter is perfect !
good gear for recording , arrived on time
very short but performs well
it does what i need , and it was very reasonably priced .
this adapter helped me to output my dj software straight to a powered speaker .
i usually buy gold plated connectors but did n't see this type in gold .
it has good shielding .
you cant run any effects with out some sort of pre amp .
if you use it clean there is no delay on this through pc speakers .
there are cables out there with nicer insulation and better `` feel '' though .
used this for my home pc karaoke uhf wireless microphone set .
the cable met all of my needs .
the cable does the job for which it was purchased .
the quality of the materials seems to be good , too .
what can i say ?
it 's a cable .
it appeared as-if it had been removed already and re-inserted .
this is exactly what i needed to make a connection between two audio devices .
the cable works well and i am pleased with the purchase .
the cable works very well in this application .
it is light and flexible with no distortion noted .
very good condition , great price .
this was a great value and i would definitely get this kit again .

good product -- fast service
very satisfied with this product and vendor , highly recommend
just what the doctor ordered .
very good , quality mics !
thanks , i will be back .
this product does exactly what you would expect and need it to do .
it comes in handy quite frequently .
i always keep it in my camera bag .
works great , i can now record in stereo with one mic .
very well put together with rubber covers .
i would recommend this product to others
this dual splitter works perfect .
i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings .
the most important part of video is the audio .
i always say , half of video is audio .
this product has improved my productions beyond it 's price sold .
they work perfectly and have n't failed me once .
delivery was as promised , all in all an excellent experience , thank you .
used this at several events already and no problems at all .
this is such an awesome and really great product !
definitely worth it to give it a try .
i 'd purchase again .
they do what they need to , they feel sturdy and have no noise .
i would buy them again if i needed to .
this works so great .
it really does work great .
my dad likes these pack
this mic saved my life .
not the best microphones , but great for the price .
i am a dj and do karaoke shows as a business .
i bought these to give them a try .
the carry case is very nice .
they seem solid enough , they have weight to them .
i do n't think they are very sensitive though .
the sound quality is good enough .
these mics have made great live recording for the bands that i manage .
sounds decent for home jams with garage type band good enough .
better than what you pay for but no 900 dollar mics .
bought these expecting them to sound bad and thye ended up sounding pretty great .
very happy i decided to buy this
this cable worked very well for what i wanted to do .
what else is there to say .
i use it to connect my drums to my amp .
as always , hosa is a good value .
this cable connected my laptop to my direct box .
item was sent promptly and as described .
just what i needed .
no shorts , no static , just like it 's supposed to do .
bottom line , i would recommend this product for its value .
works like it should .
used for running ipad to a mixer for live music .
i highly recommend hosa cables .
i bought this cable and now i have clean clear sound .
very happy with the quality of this product .
what i love is the price and value .
in other words , they are inexpensive , but not cheap .
you can also use these to mic amps .
the case will maintain mics in good condition for time to come .
2. noisy venues - such as small bars .
but was great for vocals .
i would recommend it for any pa .
the samson r21 microphone kit has met all the needs and expectations as expected .
the low price was even better .
this was an awesome deal .
i rated this product five stars !
hosa has some good stuff out there for a great price .
this worked great and the price is right .
this product is awesome the quality is great also !
and for the money perfect !
hooked them up into my mixer and the sound was great !
this is the perfect solution to that .
split the signal so it goes to both channels .
it comes in handy when i need l & r channels for one mic .
it 's in my beg just in case .
i rarely use it .
what i liked about this cable is the way the cable moves and feels .
simple yes , chincy no .
works well and seems well put together .
the price is great , the quality is great !
simple cord for plugging in small units into our board .
so far no problems .
this review will be short and to the point .
my headphones came with a short 4 ' cable and only a mini-plug .
i needed a long cable with a 1/4 '' plug .
i had patched together an extension cable with a 1/4 '' plug adapter .
while it worked , it was not the ideal solution .
enter the hosa cms110 .
it was exactly what i needed .
my stock cable was very thin .
i was also suffering signal loss due to the extension cable and adapter plug .
the improvement was more than i expected .
the hosa cms110 is a highly recommended accessory .
this cable was what i needed for a project and available via amazon prime .
works as described by transferring sound from your ipod to the stereo system .
great value , too !
this is a good cable .
the ends can screw off .
good for sp/dif digital audio .
the cable is a very good one .
for the price you get a big deal .
some know what they want but have no idea how to make it work .
so , yeah , it does what i need it to do .
this is not a bells-and-whistles piece of equipment .
it does its job as expected .
i took off a star due to the somewhat flimsy construction .
not as thick as a monoprice cable ( those are heavy duty ) .
great for the $ !
the quality is fine and it does what it 's supposed to do .
good price for a good product .
works fine for splitting off of a single xlr input/output .
otherwise , no problems .
we have not yet used the dual xlr male cable .
we have it when we need it to extend our cables with more hookups .
great price versus function point .
easy to connect digital services within my studio .
perfect quality , buy it .
heavy and strong cable , sound comes perfect .
excellent quality cable from hosa .
as mentioned in another review this cable fits very tightly .
these cables are user serviceable .
they simply unscrew so you can re-soldier breaks quickly .
over-all good cable , but be careful .
you can easily damage your gear when unplugging .
i would purchase again .
i highly recommend this product .
good spdif for the money .
this is my first spdif and so far its been great !
connection is tight and fits perfectly and feels like it 'll last for years .
this is a solid product .
i ended up not needing it so ... i returned it .
however , it worked fine and gets the job done .
the product was shipped timely and everything was as described and working as expected .
i would recommend this product and service to others .
perfect for recording in stereo directly into my audio sound card .
the audio driver picks it up perfectly .
a must have for anyone with a decent sound card for home recording sessions .
but it is a very good cable .
what can i say it does what it suppose to do .
as expected from hosa another great product .
solid construction and great sound reproduced .
i would recomed this product to everyone .
and , the price is right .
not a huge problem , especially since i purchased this adapter .
the quality is fine , especially given the price and the convenience is awesome .
good product great price .
no noticeable noise added to my ears .
they continue to work to this day .
they are built tough enough for moderate use and do the job for cheap .
these cables work , they 're cheap , and they sound fine .
as such , these seem good for musicians just playing for fun at home .
if you have a slew of pedals , then this is a must have .
i 've been looking for a set , and these are the perfect ones .
