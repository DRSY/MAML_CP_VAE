this item was exactly what i was hoping it would be .
otherwise , it worked great !
this polish has worked wonders on every cymbal i 've worked on .
just be careful not to take off your logos .
great product , left my cymbals with a brand-new shine .
i 'm part of the school of drummers that likes shiny cymbals .
unfortunately for me , this involves a lot of work .
fortunately for me the zildjian cymbal polish actually makes it much easier .
as long as you follow the directions you 're good to go .
this thing really works and really cleans your cymbals ! !
the problem is that it changes the color of your cymbals a little !
but over all it 's a good product !
good buy , well wrapped , on time and as needed .
even going lightly over the logos is risky .
it did the job and the black residue is gone from the polishing process .
a little goes a long way though !
keep your investment clean !
k 's a 's zbt 's whatever !
makes them all look great !
finish off with wd40 !
takes so elbow grease and time but results are incredible .
not too harsh on logos either .
works great on all my brilliant finish cymbals like my a customs .
use paper towels rather than a cloth towel .
cloth towels have a tendency to spread the black stuff around the cymbal .
with paper towels you just grab another clean one .
awsome on brilliant finish only ! ! ! !
excellent was able to clean a 50 year old zildjian cymbal
i 'm thoroughly impressed !
i have one picture that will show you juse how effective this is .
i do have a couple recommendations regarding the use of this polish .
worked great on my natural finish sabian cymbols .
i watched youtube videos on how to apply it and i got great results .
good polish removes stick strikes pretty well
it 's so shiny .
works like a charm .
best way to keep your cymbals clean .
works good with a $ 40 auto buffer that i purchased on amazon .
wow cleans cymbal very well
i cleaned my zildjian cymbals with this .
it did not discolor anything , it did not take away the traditional finish .
overall very pleased with it .
cleans the cymbal really well .
more product is needed to have a very clean shiny finish .
best used with a towel to rub off the tarnish in the cymbals .
to some magic powder and other fad items .
my cymbals look great .
far more important ... they sound brilliant .
you probably get used to it or think `` that 's normal . ''
well it 's not .
you bought the cymbals you have because you liked their sound .
so ... . duh ... keep em sounding that way .
my hints : wear latex/surgical-type gloves .
have lots of soft , clean , white rags around .
soft paper towels are ok too ( viva ) .
i do the whole side of a cymbal at once .
use newspaper for working surface .
start on the underside .
like putting on suntan lotion .
change the towel often .
you ca n't clean with a dirty towel .
the product probably says do a small area at a time .
the expanding concentric circles solve that problem .
this is hard work .
but the end result is wonderful .
i should 've waited because nothing else worked near as good as this did .
takes a lot of rags and elbow grease but made mine look like new .
it looks like hey faded a little though .
bought this after buying pre owned cymbals on craigslist .
not sure what they mean by `` brilliant finish '' , but i digress .
followed the process with all of my cymbals .
all the cymbals turned out great , especially the a custom china .
was like i was looking in a mirror .
10/10 would buy again in a heartbeat .
lots of elbow grease and lots of rags but it works .
bought this product for my son , a freshman in high school .
he was very pleased with the performance of this polish .
not too harsh , not too abrasive , but does the job .
note : i was not compensated in the anyway for this review .
this polish works wonders .
like the difference is incredible .
put on a small amount and spread it around .
any time the cloth gets black switch to a new part of the cloth .
way exceeded my expectations , thanks a lot zildjian !
easy to clean your zildjian cymbals .
drop a few drops around your cymbals , and wipe gently .
do n't need to work it in .
key is gentle motion .
made my zildjian hybrid shine like a new dime .
took off a star because i still have to do the work to shine em
best shine for the money
but this stuff works well .
worked very well on an old cymbal .
with a good amount of effort , this works well .
shined them up like a charm .
took the tarnish right off my banjo nickel plated parts .
no issues and fast shipping .
this is a good product .
works pretty good but did n't remove some of the tougher stains .
but i love my kit .
its good stuff , just watch the logos
polishes cymbals to look brand new !
i bought used hi hat pair on ebay ; the seller never cleaned them .
so , i got this and cleaned overall ... beautiful shine ! !
using this with my wuhan cymbals that i also purchased on amazon .
great product and works as advertised .
o yeah yust what i wass specting very brilliant and finish
excellent cleaner makes your cymbals look brand new .
i would recommend this to anybody that needs a cymbal polish
this worked just fine on traditional finish cymbals for me too .
just makes them a little more shiny ; )
this polish is really good , i have zht pros .
this is a very decent product and i would recommend it to anyone .
the product works very well .
the supplier sent the product very quickly and it arrived in good condition .
product works very well .
i have zildjian a customs and they look brand new .
i kept the polish about a 1/4 '' back from the markings .
to remove the residue rub away from the logo .
change the cloth often and you 'll be fine .
long story short my zbt 's were exposed to salt water from our aquarium .
overall a good product .
received these speakers on time and installed them the same day .
the sound flows nicely as i have other speakers throughout the house .
i would highly recommend these .
i tested them as main front speakers but did not handle bass well .
even certain tv shows with surround is great .
you can hardly beat the price as well .
unless you want to spend $ 1000 on a bose or something .
anyone with speaker wiring experience can easily do this .
they work so much better without the switch .
anyway its a great value and buy .
very well made - solid speaker housing , sturdy brackets .
installation very straight forward .
hooked up with 12 gauge cl2 wiring delivers impressive sound with decent low end .
feels deck and pool area with natural sound .
easy adjustment for targeting sound pattern .
great value i suspect will deliver great sound for many years .
good clear sounding speakers .
these speakers are well suited to my pool deck .
the pyle home pdwr53 would also work well indoors as surround-sound speakers .
very good response with the shipping .
i put the speakers in my garage .
they were easy to mount .
the old pioneer sx-550 drives them well .
i had to boost the base two notches from nominal but overall good sound .
the reduced price sealed the deal !
installation is easy , steel brackets are included .
wiring is by binding post .
good choice for the price , but not recommended for the high-end audiophile person .
great speakers , the sound is so perfectly proyected that it fills my backyard .
we attached these speakers to our home karaoke system .
we also used the pyle pro 600 watt mixer .
everyone loves to come to our house for karaoke .
my husband was looking at similar speakers but they were a little more expensive .
he told me i did good and was very delighted with them .
love how there 's three different hook ups on the back !
also like how there 's handles makes them easy to carry !
i ordered two of these speakers to try as a pair .
perhaps dropped during shipment ?
it still worked just fine .
a little disappointing , but ultimately worth the money .
it has what no other speakers have 3 different types of inputs .
binding post , 1/4inch , and speakon type .
plus it is well priced .
i also love them because i bought them from j & r music world .
so i was confident that they would arrive in perfect condition and they did !
my units were packed in 3 sperate packages each .
the sound is clear enough but the construction needs to be improved slightly .
great set of speakers .
pyle is your choice to go .
with size and weight it tops some others .
got a gig that you need some speakers this is your answer .
very light weight and easy on the back .
mine was shipped inside two protection sturdy boxes with much padding .
arrived perfect with no damage .
speakers as installed solid .
this is the best speaker bargain i have ever purchased .
perfect , extremely well packed and fast shipping on a great bargain .
not real powerful , but they 're not supposed to be .
i like the fact they are light .
i am going to add a handle on top for one-handed carrying .
right size for the space i have .
great sound for 8 '' speakers .
i purchased 4 of these through amazon .
apparently amazon fulfilled my order through different sellers .
in addition , the dust caps do not have the same logo pictured .
due to this , i my speakers are visually mismatched .
besides the different appearance , everything else is literally identical .
the specifications , weight , and sound are identical .
one of the four speakers arrived in perfect condition .
i use peavey , mackie , jbl , etc .
and some lower end like this one depending on the use .
for these speakers , i seem to have found the sweet spot .
i love this speaker !
wish i had another !
great sound and light weight .
like the speaker a lot just had shipping problems
my church is `` mobile '' right now .
we rent different places on sunday to worship .
i am the worship leader and by default the de facto sound guy .
we have a sound system but it 's much to bulky to move around .
i bought two of these speakers and a small amp to do the job .
i say for the price it 's a bargain !
these speakers look good and sound great .
using them in a high school weight room .
more sound and power than we will ever need .
sound is clear , bass is strong .
just a solid set of speakers .
these are just as advertised .
they sound ok connected to an ensoniq mr rack sound module .
however , the bass is n't well developed in these 8 '' speaker cabs .
if you need good bass , go for the 12 '' speakers .
for general pa use these are fine .
great bass and the price was right .
the first one arrived broken the and it was quickly replaced
can i pay the differents from the 8in for the 10in
i love the speaker but it has a horrible smell to it .
i 've been spraying it with fabric freshener every since it arrived .
i ordered two pyle-pro speakers and today they arrived right on time .
one small problem , one was damaged .
problem fixed in ten minutes and i have two inexpensive but nice speakers !
i purchased two of these speakers and mine were almost identical to another review .
one speaker was in perfect condition and one was apparently dropped then packaged up .
horn tweeter does not work at all .
the speaker that does work actually has great sound .
nice bass and clarity for the price .
i own a haunted attraction and purchase many different types of audio systems .
item was as listed .
very impressed with the power indeed !
found these added versatility to my set up .
the venue was a banquet room with relatively low beamed ceilings .
the sound was amazing .
i was running everything in mono .
it saves the cost of hiring a professional dj so our charities benefit .
for our sized venue , about 70 watts is all i needed .
it was definitely a two person job .
again , having the speakers raised to ear level makes all the difference .
i ca n't wait to give it a try .
the digital output went straight to my panasonic av receiver 's optical input .
looks like i 'll get rid of the radio shack mixer .
it has a microphone mixer built in .
the seismic audio 12 inch starts even lower at 50 hertz .
they came very fast and on time .
the sound is excellent .
i am now going to pass this info onto all of my music mates .
the price was amazing .
didnt realize how big the width was 7.5 '' .
muy bueno el producto llega a tiempo se ve en buen estado y todo .
ahora lo voy instalar en mi auto .
price was great , i needed three .
just installed them in wedge monitors .
have n't used them in a live setting yet .
these horn tweeters are really good for the money .
they came on time and undamaged .
they sound like a high quality horn tweeter .
this was a good buy for the money .
i have order these to replace my old ones that were blown .
items came on time and without any damage .
powered them up to ensure they work and they hit highs really nice .
still have n't installed them yet but all work as described .
had them a good year or so now .
it 's a good product .
not bad for the price .
received quick and work as expected for the investment .
really happy with this horn piezo my custom build box sound clean with this .
i 'll start off by saying that i used these tweeters for pro-audio use .
the pyle tweeters showed up in some searches and even on amazon .
i knew i could get them in a couple of days from amazon .
very nice bag for drum chimes .
bought for my son for his birthday to protect his chimes .
he has many drum cases but never has bought one for his chimes .
very nicely padded and looks like it will hold up well .
this case is lightweight and totally protects the chimes .
does what it 's supposed to .
the tre35 fits perfectly and it 's it 's well constructed .
i would recommend you purchase this to protect your chimes during transport .
would recommend to anyone .
the photo is of a one-piece garlein recorder .
the title states that it is a 3-piece soprano recorder .
this is very confusing and leaves one wondering what will be delivered .
the description is also lacking .
i own an aulos garklein and sopranino and i am pleased with the quality .
i wanted to have fun with my grandchildren while teaching them music notation .
this was a good way to start .
the 8 year old loved it .
the 6 year old was a bit too young .
they are both excellent quality and i would definitely buy them both again .
love them , i will be buying more seakers and amp in the fulture .
sipping was fast and the price was great !
you could almost use these as your speakers they 're so good .
i definitely recommend them and the sound via daisy chaining is great .
they 're definitely one directional .
they do their job well for the price .
the price was right and the performance was stellar !
definitely worth the investment .
works just as stated on the websites man awesome dude your gnarly man dude !
thanks for the great price
the only downfall is the vinyl covering .
the best part was turn around was only one day on a prime !
planning on ordering a couple more .
but i 'm pretty impressed with the sound .
so you get from the horn just the brightness needed .
over all sounds pretty good to me .
i have 3 of these floor monitors .
when they work , they work well .
the sound from the combined woofer and horn is very clean .
the bass is full , while the driver delivers the mid-highs crisply .
the only problem you may have is with shipping .
the new ones i got were fine and performed perfectly .
for the price , you wo n't find anything better .
so far so good .
i bought two of them and they are working great .
im using it for vocals and so far so good .
great sound for the price
works awesome ! ! ! ! ! !
i ordered this product as a church floor monitor .
because of the price , we did n't expect much .
we simply figured that it would be better than our current disfunctional sampsons .
the monitors sound spectacular , at least in comparison to our 200w 's now .
500 watts is no joke .
the minimum sound on the monitors is still quite loud .
anyway , we 're very proud to have these .
the sound is great and the build seems very solid .
it 's a good mic system for my church .
i love these mics ! !
they were perfect for the set up we had at our church .
the lights are color coded to make it easier to adjust them individually .
i have all good things to say about them .
i even have a suggestion that helps .
i highly recommend these to anyone and the sound quality is excellent .
thumbs up to pyle ! ! !
just wanted you to know what a top quality product this is .
keep up the good work .
i bought this mic set for karaoke shows .
i started with 4 and only had 2 shortly after .
the other 2 mics are still going after 2 years of abuse .
it bent the metal screen , but still functions .
not for pro vocalists , but good for karaoke .
i received the order in one day , with no extra shipping charges .
the system works great , i would recommend it to anyone .
nice product for the price .
its missing an rca out puts to connect to a home stereo .
otherwise a great product for the price .
when they work without drop outs they are wonderful .
tons of gain and great clarity , tone , etc .
it stays completely quiet until someone speaks and then the buzz comes through .
i have emailed the seller a week ago but no reply .
after buying a new cord at radio shack the buzzing went away .
very good product , well worth the money .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
i do small dj venues and this is the perfect product for the job .
would buy this product again .
right out of the box it was a very simple set up .
no need to set channels for microphones .
four mics , four volume buttons .
clear sound from these four microphones .
the receiver is super , really powers the mics well .
voice gain is good and there is no external sound picked up .
upon my initial test trial i found the system incredibly responsive .
battery life and distance range is approximate yes , but neither were grossly overrated .
this unit payed for itself with the lack of rental/late fees .
generally , better equipment than those rented also .
spend more if you 'd like , i stand behind my purchase .
these microphones are so sick !
the solution ... ..reflective tap .
i have experienced some cut outs on occasion but that 's expected .
nothing major and not long lasting .
the most expensive sets do the same thing .
the 110/220 power selection was important and gives me more options in practice locations .
great bang for your buck .
these wireless mics are working well with our church sound system .
easy to install and everyone is enjoying using them in our church programs .
i get the product in a short time and is working good .
for me i do not have any problem .
but every friday night the kids come to sing and dance .
now they can do both along with being the star sing along .
these microphones are great for the price .
i own a karaoke bar , the mics .
get dropped & brake so i have purchased a lot of mics .
over the past 16 yrs .
as long as these are available , i will continue buying them .
i love these mics .
& so do my customers .
they were shipped on time and in tact .
did n't want to deal with the manufacture after reading the reviews .
i 've realized you did n't included the bill into de boss .
i would like you to send me a copy of it to my e-mail .
it is yendely33 @ gmail.com .
thanks to you and have a nice weekend .
use for my church do n't understand the other output not enough direction encluded
i got this mic for my church and i never regret purchasing it .
working well , my daughter love it .
awesome equipment for the right price .
great unit very good and reliable .
the system was easy to install into the gator case and easy to use .
i like the graphics and separate volume control knobs for each microphone .
there ok for the money .
but the construction of the mics could be a little more rugged .
i think that under heavy usage this mics should be a little more rugged .
as a karaoke dj i use these mics because they are affordable .
this is the second pyle system that i have purchased .
great value , works great , just what i wanted
mics go out sometimes though
provides a lot of entertainment at new years and during birthday parties .
great ! ! ! !
very nice set for the money !
they work great at the start .
i enjoy using pyle equipment .
their price range fits nicely into my budget .
they offer great customer service , and their products are durable with good quality .
i recommend this pyle wireless hand-held microphone system .
the equipment is very good .
i have had problems with 2 microphones recently .
i am contacting the support to buy new ones .
overall the equipment is very easy to install and operate .
you can buy pyle equipments .
it was at the fairground there and they worked great !
i really like them and they have great sound !
can be set up with one channel or use four individual channels .
good quality for the price
i love this system , and would buy it again if needed .
no problems thus far .
very happy with this purchase .
works great for what i need .
clear sound from these four microphones .
the receiver is super , really powers the mics well .
voice gain is good and there is no external sound picked up .
these are great wireless mics for the price ! !
they have a good range and are very durable .
i was amazed that the microphones still worked perfectly after that .
these mics are awesome ... the only flaw is that they are not rechargeable !
i love the sound !
i have bought other wireless mics before .
more expensive name brand mics .
for the price you just ca n't beat this deal .
top notch quality , light weight , great sound .
shipping was much quicker than i expected .
i could n't be more pleased with my purchase .
i would highly recommend this product to anyone .
very low powered and mics feel light and cheap .
i would not recommend this for live applications .
this works very well !
easily cut a port hole in my bass drum head of the desired size .
tons easier than cutting by hand with an exacto knife .
works well , but i wish it 1/2 increments as well !
the best and roundest hole i ever cut
do n't really know what to say other than - it did the job .
not a good idea .
just be sure to take the head off the drum , duh .
yeah , i tried that .
cuts a nice neat hole , with a clean edge .
this little tool is a real jem !
this thing works so well i literally laughed out loud when i used it .
and you can use it multiple times .
and it still works !
perfect cutout in one try .
now my recording palette is enhanced in a very good way .
i wish there were better ( or any ) real instructions .
but it certainly did the job .
works like a charm !
the product works well but the package was open already when i got it .
i think it was n't worth it to claim this .
cutter worked as it should .
be patient and measure the center point correctly .
the most difficult part for me was picking the location of the hole .
after that it worked great .
used this on a remo fiberskyn bass drum head .
so the lower right will be the lower left when cutting .
works just as intended .
works great and takes very little time .
the picture of the cutter is pretty self-explanator .
i am super glad i did .
i did n't even need to trim anything .
i highly recommend this to anybody .
clever device that works as advertised .
makes a professional looking bass drum hole that looks factory installed .
ordered this nifty little tool , followed the directions , and it worked perfectly .
looks great , allows access for microphone placement .
great tool for the price .
not as clean as the hot can method but less chance to burn yourself .
overall though it got the job done .
4 starts for product being inexpensive and there for future uses .
i had the hardest time finding a christmas gift for my brother .
it 's perfect for anyone who needs to change a string on the go .
he said he was thinking of getting another to keep in his case .
there are a few areas of weakness , however .
otherwise , a good use of hard earned ducats .
it has worked wonders and come through in a pinch .
so this item has come in handy .
good for most things i need to do on a regular basis .
it was built with actual quality in mind instead of just quantity .
i purchased this for my son who is a guitarist and a budding luthier .
i like the combination of options on this one tool .
it saved me from buying at least four different tools .
this is a real handy tool every guitar player should have one .
string changes are easy with the assistance of this tool .
it was a great gift !
purchased as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend .
great tool for working musician
a bit overpriced for the overall quality .
this is a great thing to have in your case for any gigging guitarist .
excellent tool does exactly what it says .
best all in one tool on the market .
heavy duty good quality solid multi tool !
all my friends love it !
it has everything you could ever need for working on your bass or guitar .
it 's practical and has a great feel .
it also came with a cool carrying case .
all in all a great product .
even though the us allows up to 5 inches some countries do n't .
this is a great tool for traveling musicians .
the only complaints i have were the price and the design .
i think the price was kind of steep for what you get .
it 's a decent quality , but not $ 20 good .
the design can easily scratch your guitar .
i still think it deserves 5 stars though .
its nice to have an all-in-one guitar for gigs .
he was very happy to be able to fix the guitar by himself .
i purchased this violin about a month ago .
i received it about 5 days after i ordered it .
the violin looked really good .
but it did not come with a bridge attached .
i had to retune it all over again .
i started to get annoyed after doing this a few days in a row .
she said that the strings needed time to settle in .
she gave me some peg drops to keep the pegs from slipping .
i rubbed a little on the pegs and it seemed to work .
unfortunately , the violin does not play itself !
whatever sound i create on the violin is exactly what the violin produces .
even my teacher thinks it 's great .
a habit which is so often a trendy whim ! )
once i got enough rosin on the bow , sound came out !
i hope my super naive experience will help someone else !
i recieved the violin quickly .
it has a nice case , and the violin looked really nice .
there is a fine tuner for each string which is really helpful for beginners .
the rosin was included which was nice .
this was a great investment for a starting violin .
i use to work at one , and believe me they rip you off .
what shall i write ?
i have been trying to purchase one violin .
please tell me what type of violin i can order .
please let me know which violin i can order .
unfortunately i was not careful in tightening the strings and broke one right away .
but i doubt this is a fault of the product .
i have purchased new strings and hope to beginning playing again soon !
the resin that came with this package was not good quality though .
anyway , overall great product and great seller !
a dream purchase ! ..
definitely would buy it any other time too .
but i tell you what , i am very pleased with my purchase .
a small set of instructions would have been very helpful .
it is a beautiful violin .
it wo n't interfier with the sound quality .
oh well , like i said it does n't effect the sound quality .
i spent $ 4.00 and the new rosen worked like a champ .
before doing so i was worried that i had a defective violin !
the rosin included , is awful .
was very very easy once i figured out what to do .
and apparantly set tilted back ever so slightly towards the bottom of the violin .
apparantly if you keep it taught you can warp and eventually snap the bow .
( no one had mentioned that yet ) .
i thought that was how you store it.. no .
i felt really silly about that one .
but after you get all that straitened out it is very satisfying .
so all in all this was a great purchase and i am very pleased .
who knew i could buy a violin this cheaply ?
if you are like me , and not really sure .
first off , this is not a $ 50 violin .
otherwise , though , it 's a fine instrument .
the rosin is n't great , but it works .
the violin itself sounds fine .
but i do n't know that for a fact .
but this is fine for what it is .
my instructor was impressed with the price i paid for this violin .
he thought i paid at least $ 200 .
it is a great beginner 's violin , well worth its price .
i recommend this violin for any beginner , student or adult .
it is made well for its price .
great violin for its price !
i was a little hesitant about buying this instrument .
i was worried that the quality of the sound would not be good .
this made a difference in the quality of sound .
this violin is cheap .
both in construction and price .
it is , however , a decent instrument ... with a few caveats .
a rental , if available , however , might be a better option .
2 ) the chinese-made bridge is small , flimsy , and poorly designed .
bad quality control leaves these things somewhat random in their effectiveness .
4 ) the strings .
like most things on this violin , they skimped a lot on the strings .
they certainly assist in the tin-can sort of sound you 'll hear when playing .
-- all excellent quality for students ) or an anton breton or some such .
i received the violin , and this is more that i expect .
i recommend buy it .
this is the 1st violin i bought .
the case is a nice case also .
would reccommend purchasing from this supplier in the future .
this violin was an exceptionally good bargain .
everything was as promised and defect free .
my daughter loves it .
being a newbie , it was difficult to set up at first .
i got some better stuff from amazon and it works great .
it arrived right on time , nothing broken , nothing out of the ordinary .
now i can practice at home and leave the schools violin at school .
thank you , would buy from again .
i am very impressed with the company that sells this violin .
i rarely ever write reviews , but this company is worth the praise .
violin was as advertised .
good quality , good sound , nice finish .
arrived on time and was packed very well to insure against damage .
it looks like a toy .
it 's a bit oddly resonant but really not bad at all .
works adequately but dents very easily .
this is a beautiful beginners violin .
violin was well packaged , clean .
otherwise , we like it a lot .
update still very satisfied .
strings have reached the point adjustment holds , great fun , sounds good .
my family loved it .
great product for the money so i bought another one in a different color .
they sound like they cost a lot more .
next time trying the colored violin !
i ca n't complain at all .
for the price , this violin is usable and actually decent in appearance .
you 'll need to do a few things first : 1. buy rosin .
it 's great that they include one but it 's pretty terrible .
just go buy a different one .
i got a nice rosin for $ 2.50 nbd 2. buy new strings .
it was pretty easy to do and the violin sounds and feels phenomenally better .
3. customize your bridge .
it 's a cheap bridge but it does work .
it stays without issue once you do that .
i may have to sand the bottom or something .
i intend to work on a solution that today .
it 's good for the price .
for the price i was amazed .
but do plan on getting strings .
i spent about 200 % more for strings than i did for the violin .
and plays better than could have hoped for .
got it for my son to learn with and he 's doing well .
but do plan on getting good strings .
great violin for my daughter for school .
thought it was great .
daughter took it to school and brought it right back home .
i would definitely recommend this violin for a beginner , it looks very nice .
and i received the violin very quickly .
i bought this for my daughter , and so far she 's loving it .
the sound it projects out too is not bad for the price .
i will definitely recommend it .
the violin is beautiful and accoustic and well cut and sound ours great .
the quality is very impressive for a price so low .
i look forward to learning more .
delivered as promised and when promised .
it is well worth the money .
i love it and i recommend it .
a string broke when she tried to tighten where do i get more ?
the quality of this violin is great for the use of beginners .
are a bit sloppy , but they have n't caused any problems so far .
the quality of the rosin is definitely debatable .
however , it was definitely worth the money .
good product for the money
great violin , worked flawlessly , and would recommend
sup up ! ! !
it was better than paying 20 a month to rent a used one .
my daugter and her teacher think its comparible to rentals .
the only issues is the wood had a small chip .
the rosin was broke and the carrying case ripped at one of the seams
great communication from seller !
great item for price !
wish it came tuned .
but a great product for violinists !
the bows , nonetheless , could have been a bit more sturdier .
hence , you may need to consider buying a better quality bow .
this item exceeded my expectations .
the case on it 's own is worth the price .
it is a full sized violin .
we bought this for our daughter for christmas .
over all i would recommend this for a child or beginner .
this is a decent quality first violin .
it came with a case , bow , and rosin .
we have not used this violin yet ; but it is beautiful .
this is alright for newbies .
just right for beginners .
it is a very generic violen but it serves it purpose .
so heads up get an extra bow .
very fast shipping..excellent value.. could n't ask for a better experience .
it also fits within my gifting budget .
but as for the fiddle itself i am highly satisfied .
so if you are a beginner then this should be a good violin .
it 's a great instrument for learning
pretty good tone for a cheap violin .
this is a very good product and well worth the money spent .
i understood that i bought a cheap violin .
i understodd how to place the bridge .
here is what happened to me .
first off , my instrument did not arrive until the lates time possible .
aside from deliery problems , the thickest string snapped after i slackened the strings .
it was coming undone .
i also feel that the rosin is cheap ; cheap for a cheap instrument .
now , all of that aside , i love my new violin .
also , who cares about the pegs ?
all you have to do is push and twist .
the case is not nearly as 'flimsy ' as i thought it would be .
this violin is beautiful !
it has a wonderful sound and easy on the fingers .
i would highly recommend this to anyone .
this is an excellent violin for new students .
broke string setting it up , but had ordered extra .
plays well and is an enjoyable instrument for our sons and granddaughters .
i bought this violin as a gift for one of my neices .
i really liked the violin although i am not an expert .
this is a very good starter violin .
it was shipped pretty quickly .
i think i received it in less than a week .
my son loves it !
the case can be carried like a backpack which is very handy .
also , i was happy to see it came with a bow and rosin .
this was a great buy !
let alone a shoulder rest .
this violin has a beautiful tone to it looks gorgeous and is really neat .
just received my violin .
product is as expected , is as picture .
this was a pretty good deal for less than $ 50 .
did i mention the price is the best around !
here we would have paid $ 100 + for the set up .
with a little score reading foundations i started playing several tunes already !
rosin is not glued on the channel so it tends to break .
the violin , bow and case were beautiful and well worth the money ! !
but ... it is a beautiful violin and is worth the cost .
violin came in just a few days after ordering .
it was exactly as pictured .
it has a nice light satin finish to the wood .
the rosin worked fine .
the tuning pegs will need pushed in a bit to get them to hold .
i play a few other instruments though so i am a little familiar .
getting the strings in tune for any violin seems to be tricky .
so be careful ! !
because you can break a string easily .
probably not necessary for students .
i used a guitar tuner to tune the strings .
the strings on the violin were just fine though .
and overall , the violin is pretty much ready to go .
just needs tuned after you get it .
the bow seems to be fine and no problems so far .
overall very good deal .
it is high quality for the price .
it has a rich deep sound .
do n't be perturbed if at first it does n't sound perfect to you .
give it a little time .
every bow stroke sounds a little better until you get everything coated and stretched .
hope this review helps you out .
for the price , it is a very good violin .
it 's a wonderful violin and well worth the money i paid for it .
i look forward to enjoying playing it often .
i love this product !
will certainly recommend this product to others when given the chance !
sounds like a student violin .
i have lots of musician friends .
when i received it , it smelled like it had just been painted .
our drummer thinks it was spray paint .
but as a student product i think it is great ... ! ! !
at some point i may have it stripped and finished .
just what i was looking for great sound .
a great starter violin for anyone , and it plays and sound great .
this violin is awesome !
it was a great purchase for my student violinists .
i 'd recommend it .
it 's better quality than i expected for such a good price .
excited for my daughter to open it christmas morning .
this violin is beautiful and exactly what my son wanted .
i was very pleased with this violin and case .
it came in a very nice protective case with rosin .
its very shiny black and has the wow factor .
it will be muched used by the young lady in my family .
nice quality and beautiful instrument .
teacher says that it is because it is painted and the sound gets muffled .
she plays it at home all the time for practice and for fun .
it is a very loved instrument .
would still purchase from seller again in future .
i bought this for making music videos , i do n't play violin .
a member of our band in the video plays a short solo .
for just over $ 30 it works great .
i need lessons though !
i am absolutely in love with this violin .
the sound quality is great and it was very afforable !
i love this violin !
it is better than i expected .
i found the case to be nice and the violin is beautiful .
took me awhile to adjust strings and bow .
taking longer still for me to remember how to play remotely well .
it is so easy to use this violin is worth the price .
it may not stay into fray a long time but it works very well .
it is a great tool for beginners ( like myself ) .
this purchase is the best for a beginner .
nicely constructed , with a rich shiny coat of black paint .
the sound is very good .
it 's lightweight and easy to handle , so also good to arthritis hands .
i happen to see this buying other items .
i play the violin , first you will need to set the bridge .
its not hard , it will sit under the string between the f holes .
the curved side will face the finger board .
place it under the strings and stand it up .
it will sit between the little notches on each f hole .
center the feet with those notches .
do not glue it on .
place each string on the notches on the top of the bridge .
now it should look like a violin but the sound is everything .
it needs to be in a perfect spot for the violin to sound right .
that can weld the peg shut and you cant turn it .
push in with force as you turn the peg .
sorry about yelling at you , grace .
the instructions helped me .
thanks for your service and the nice case .
this violen has exellentsound quality .
i have no problems with it .
the violin arrived today , within a week of ordering it .
the case alone was worth the money .
i suggest going on youtube for set up instructions and tuning advice .
for this price , the violin is unbeatable .
an excellent starting instrument and a surprisingly high quality case .
this was a very good experience all around ( minus the wait ) .
i just have not had the time to do a review .
everyone loves the fact that her violin is black .
it came fast in its own case and is really nice .
we have not had any problems with this violin .
i will be ordering other things from here .
i received my package today and my wife loved it .
will most definately order from seller in the future .
he likes it and shows it off
so i took a chance on this painted violin .
bytheway , buy your own strings .
tuning is extravagantly hard because the pegs wo n't stay in place .
basically , you 're hamming it farther in .
luckily , the wood is malleable enough .
but as long as you keep playing , it stays in tune . )
i 'm not in debt , and i get to enjoy myself .
works well and all products were definitely included .
a little assembling to do but a good buy for sure .
this violin was great !
great starting violin for the price .
for the price this seems like a good little violin to start on .
the estimated recieving date was between the 27th and 5th .
it came early on the 26th .
the tuner is decent , however i suggest downloading a violin tuning app .
the rosin works if you read the directions .
the pinstriping is n't perfect and the wood does have some blemishes .
but with everything costing under $ 40 i ca n't complain .
the bow is very sturdy and works nicely .
over all i 'm very impressed .
also notice that the brand of this model is crescent .
i love the color it shipped fast and very easy to set up .
i do not know why others wrote about problem .
i would recoment it .
i like the violin and all the parts that came with it .
for the price , this is a decent violin .
she used a utility knife .
they also tuned it for her .
she needed peg dope , but since then , it 's been fine .
this violin is cheap but comes with all the necessary tools to play .
i bought a supplemental tuner and a shoulder rest .
the bow is pretty bad quality .
the frog is already falling off and many of the horse hairs have broken .
got the job done for my brother .
that 's enough to get you making noise .
i did n't order a fretboard sticker , but i think i should have .
all in all , this product is decent .
i expected something polished , but for the price it came out great .
i bought this for my wife ( she 's the talented one ) .
being a guitarist , i 'm spoiled with set bridges and locking tuners .
after a little fumbling i got it .
the tuner is handy and will work with other instruments as well .
overall i 'm pleased .
it is a realy good deal..my wife loved ... and mi baby girl too .
amazon is the best and the easy way..
this tool is really good .
great sound and quality .
i liked how quickly and was delivered .
color tool admire elegant .
the only thing not good rosin .
thank you , good job .
this has been my experience with the violin so far .
why 5 stars then ?
the strings on the violin are amazing .
the strings ring out nice and sound beautiful .
the digital tuner works just like any other chromatic digital tuner .
it 's as accurate as the snark tuners i own .
this will be more than enough to start you off !
i am looking forword to hearing my son play his new vilion .
perfect starter violin , good sound and good quality .
the violin was pretty good in size and weight .
the color was fantastic .
the only problen was that the bridge was not attached because of shipping purposes .
the sound quality is great , especially for how cheap the price was !
i was shocked , i would recommend this product to any starter !
the strings are low quality but good to start out on .
give it a couple months then upgrade them .
it 's great if you need a violin to start learning on !
my sister is picking this up while i am learning guitar .
was better than expected , came early and was overall pleased with this purchase .
it came with everything needed .
i would suggest picking up some better rosin .
it is a violin for 40 $ .
does it sound great ?
does it hold its tune ?
what i got was a cheap , functional and playable violin .
i ordered this product and it was not exactly what i expected .
i was contacted by the seller immediately and they remedied the problem expeditiously .
this is my first violin .
i am self taught and when i learn something i research a lot .
violins naturally are work to learn and play !
know what you are getting into !
it will not be professional quality , because well.. it is n't !
at least they were nice enough to include any , i guess ! ) .
but the one included does in fact work just fine .
then i had an issue with usps ( lucky me !
awesome worked well for my son !
the crescent is a clean , decent starter violin .
this particular finish was quite nice ; looks just as pretty in person .
i highly recommend this style violin !
i think this was a great price for what you get .
it is absolutely well worth every penny .
came quickly and can not wait for my daughter to open it christmas morning .
overall , i 'm happy with my purchase .
well packaged and a great bargain for the price .
i received it on time and was very pleased with the quality .
what a great find !
did n't expect the quality for the price - extremely impressed !
would recommend to everyone beginners - advanced
it was beautiful everything we wanted for our son and more .
and rhe price was just what we were looking for .
should be a great first learning item .
for this price , it 's more than worth it !
the violin is shiny with a nice wood color .
the sound is nice and loud .
the electronic tuner is great .
once we put rosin on the bow the violin was able to be tuned .
she was so happy when she opened it christmas morning .
i think it is a great starter instrument for anyone .
it 's a cheap entry level instrument .
it 's great for a beginner but that 's all .
great price for beginner .
very well made product at a very reasonable price .
we were very happy with the quality and sound .
perfect for a first timer !
this violin arrived in perfect condition and i absolutely love it !
i loved the instrument .
i just hope she learns to play like she promised .
i am very happy with my purchase .
set up was incredibly easy .
the violin comes with a relatively well detailed instruction manual .
the quality of the product is much better than expected .
the violin itself is also constructed rather well .
the construction is all wood and very light .
the bridge fits snugly without any modifications .
the pegs will slip during tuning , as with all violins .
simply apply light pressure while tuning , or purchase some peg drops .
the strings ( once in tune ) are adequate .
the bow and rosin work well with this outfit .
the frog glides well and setting the desired tautness is very easy .
my package came with the crescent mt-60 tuner .
luckily i was correct on the first try .
for the price , the quality can not be beat !
this is such an awesome item .
i 'm very pleased !
i would recommend this item for anyone that is learning the violin .
i 'm 31 , and i 'm just staring out !
the quality is quite nice .
other than that , great buy !
i like it a lot .
my neice just loves her violin ! ! ! !
she is teaching herself how to play and this is the perfect starter instrument !
excellent price for a full size violin with bow and hard case .
quality craftsmanship of the violin .
great price and quick delivery .
my teen liked that she could select the wood color
beautiful with a pretty fair tone .
awesome for those like me who just want one to learn on
this villain got to me before the date they gave me .
also with my daughter just learning its perfect for her
i love m violin .
still unsure how the tuner works instructions are sketchy at best .
i see a number of people commenting about plastic pegs .
the one i got has lacquered wooden pegs .
for the money you ca n't go wrong .
my toddler loves it , great product for the price .
definitely better quality than i expected .
it 's a great starter/student violin , but be warned .
there are youtube videos of how to remedy this problem .
this is a great full size violin for new learners and young students .
good price and comes with lots of extras .
the truth is that it is an excellent product .
i loved it and i plan to buy another one .
best violin that is under 50 dollars .
works great , comes with everything needed to sound great .
recommend that this is for a beginner
you always hear horror stories about cheaply made violins .
on that following birthday he presented this to me .
it was perfect for what i needed .
