i have never really used it .
i do n't really get these `` dummies '' books .
i love my books and this is a great annoyance to me .
if you purchase just be prepared it may arrived damaged .
this book is just okay .
crochet step-by-step by sally harding is much better for the beginner .
save yourself the oftalmologist 's visit and buy the paperback .
bad formatting and some things , plainly impossible to read .
not recommended at all .
i regret spending the money on it .
i was looking for basic beginner help and better diagrams .
it was n't as helpful as i was expecting since i am a beginner .
i purchased this book for my granddaughter who wanted to learn to crochet .
she lives out of town so i could not teach her .
skip this one if you want to become skilled at this craft .
the illustrations are too confusing for someone who 's never crocheted .
the book is not very easy to understand .
it is really complicated .
when it finally came out i was unfortunately disappointed .
the entire book reads in a very unorganized way .
you would do better to purchase a less expensive booklet to learn the basics .
why buy an instrument that does n't play in tune ?
i bought this as a gift for my husband 2 years ago .
he was never able to get it tuned .
professionals were unable to tune it .
the ukulele broke the first time i tuned it .
definitely got what i paid for .
this started to bteak almost immediately
the courses are okay and will get you up and running .
the problem is the ukulele is a pos .
it will not stay in tune for more than 5 minutes .
it is the worst piece of equipment i have ever purchased .
i should have headed the warnings .
do not buy this !
package was in great shape while being shipped .
the arm of the ukulele not glued together on the back .
very disappointed as i wanted to start learning to play .
a little disappointed , it wo n't play the correct notes .
when i do an am chord it is flat .
they are both soprano uke 's and tuned to the same key .
but one plays a completely different ( flat ) note than the other .
i 'm sending it back .
does n't ever stay tuned .
this ukelele goes out of tune every 5 minutes .
my friend also has this ukelele and has encountered the same problem .
ca n't stay in-tune for more than a minute .
i recommend spending a little more to get a better quality option .
does n't stay in tune .
very difficult to play due to improper fret spacing .
the positive : good price .
the negative : the ukulele is of the worst quality .
the intonation is off even when it 's tuned properly .
great for a toy , not for an instrument .
i had this for two days .
it did n't stay in tune for more than 5 mins .
and we were driving and it just broke .
the neck snaped , and a string poped .
i enjoyed the book , at the back was all the chord you need .
it would be nice if a quiet fabric one was included instead .
the plastic is extremely loud as it crinkles and is extremely wrinkled .
the book is what sold me on this kit in the first place .
it 's all plastic , it sounds awful .
i thought it would be half way decent , but it 's trash .
do n't buy this !
tried to return and purchase another but a week out of return policy .
should have spent a little more to get a better product .
i have n't found this to be true ... .must be retuned often .
ca n't play on it without needing to be tuned .
so it is n't good for trying to learn how to play guitar .
expensive for what i got .
came with a strap but there are no strap pegs to attach them to .
cd and instruction book is nice .
my 6 yr old boy is learning well .
we can not even tune it !
the reviews were bad but did not bother to read before buying .
this product is poorly manufactured .
you get what you pay for .
please pay attention better than i did to the reviews !
this a very poor quality product .
will not stay in tune !
if by chance you do order buy some better strings .
the lesson book is ok but that 's about it .
do you self a favor and spend a little more .
you will be glad you did !
the description match the product , but i was expecting something with more quality
the strings were bad quality and the ukulele was n't even real wood .
even after tuning it still sounded off and is very cheap and bad quality .
i bought this for my 6 year old daughter for christmas .
tried tuning it several times , sounded horrible .
i knew something was wrong , took it to a guitar repair place locally .
$ 50 more to attempt repair .
fortunately , with the refund , i can get a another brand .
terrible , a tin can sounds better than this piece of junk !
very , very disappointed !
the fret board is broken out of the box .
now i need to waste time shipping it back .
this is terrible buy one from a music store
it 's a toy .
this could be a perfect set to start with .
however , the fretted notes are out of tune .
probably , we got a lemon .
otherwise , we liked the set .
my daughter was constantly having to tune it .
one star is one too many .
just do n't buy it .
it wo n't hold a tune long enough to tune it .
it 's wood-colored plastic .
you get what you pay for !
i 've seen toys built better than this .
do n't waste your money !
i like the alfred book and the dvd .
however , the instrument itself turned out to be a disappointment .
the quality of the instrument is not good .
yes it creates a lot of sound , but the frets are crooked .
the only chord i could play in tune was the a minor 7 chord .
do not get this .
the only good thing about this package is the book .
the gig bag is n't even of good quality .
there is absolutely no padding .
uke will not even stay in tune .
i bought this for daughter who lives an hour from me .
she complained it did n't stay in tune .
it is a made in china product .
better get a makala for $ 30
this was an awful purchase .
the ukulele does not even tune !
this ukulele is worthless .
it can not even stay in tune through one song .
first uke arrived with neck separated from body .
ordered a replacement which arrived with exactly the same problem .
meanwhile my seven year old was waiting for her present .
overall package with book and extra strings seemed like a good idea .
the whole instrument made a buzzing sound when you played it .
i 'm a bit disappointed with this product .
i began to teach myself to play .
but it went downhill from there .
a few minutes ago , the neck just snapped clean off !
right in the middle of me playing .
and i have been gentle too .
just get some informational book and buy yourself a better ukulele separately .
i found this same guitar on a different site for $ 38 free shipping .
i was shocked when i took it out of the box .
it 's too small for my 2 year old to play .
its made with even cheaper strings then fishing line .
its a toy for maybe a 2 year old .
no way for a 5 year old or older .
the reviews are so good and i have no idea why .
so so so so small .
the string broke within a second of receiving this .
it 's very cheaply made .
i am definitely suffering from buyer 's remorse .
the strings are horrible and does n't play well .
beware the product photos make the instrument appear much larger than the book .
the book is actually bigger .
ukulele is much small than expected .
returning product to order different size ukulele ...
the strings on this ukulele are terrible and impossible to tune .
it is cheaply made .
does n't stay tuned .
had to buy new tuning keys .
does n't stay in tune ... useless really .
it would fall out of tune after only a few strums .
very disappoited with this product .
i tightened the strings and the wood split .
it is now not usable .
i gave this to my very experienced guitar playing husband .
he conditioned them , played it , and tightened screws , etc .
nothing worked and back it went .
if you want to really learn to play , invest in a better model .
the finger board and frets are damaged .
bought this to start self-teaching myself how to play the ukulele .
usually alfred is a great brand .
but i was disappointed with this ukulele .
you definitely get what you pay for .
the strings would never stay tuned .
the tuning pegs were too loose .
i can only play that way .
is there a way to string it that way ?
when i got it the guitar was broken .
i had to buy an electric tuner just for this .
well , not in my case i guess ... so disappointing
missing frets ca n't play half the notes with missing frets : (
the strings are terrible and the fret board from broke
ukelele arrived with the neck broken .
did n't even bother with the dvd , it 's going right back .
within 5 days of use , the neck came off the body .
there is no way for me to use it again .
will not stay tuned up
it broke first day .
the ukulele could not hold its tune .
i know own a real instrument ukulele , not a toy .
i 'll then check to re-tune and the strings are all still tuned properly .
this uke is a toy , nothing better .
a terrible instrument for beginners .
i had never played a uke before this one , and am addicted now .
and i keep trying to play the firebrand , only to be disappointed .
i ca n't get the ukelele tuned .
i 'm using an electric tuner and ca n't get the right notes .
so ca n't even begin to try to use it for lessons .
the strings do not work and it is just terrible , stay away
will not stay in tune ... at all .
the nylon strings on the instrument are absolutely insufficient for beginners .
it makes me feel like i am playing a child 's toy .
it was n't pleasant .
book was ripped dvd broken cheap ukulele .
it 's basically plastic .
and i 'd love for a refund
keeps going out of tune all the time .
so this is brand new and needs a repair already .
when i bought it the price seemed great and too good to be true .
well , it was n't .
on the bright side , the repair will only be $ 20 .
can not be tuned .
has to return it .
broke within the first 2 times of using it .
strings are too high off the frets .
it wo n't hold a tune even after working and retuning as suggested .
i wish i 'd just bought something better from the start .
great concept with great instructions and cds .
out of tune too easily .
you 'll need help tuning or a tuning application .
it would probably discourage beginners who are tone deaf .
more of a `` toy '' than an `` instrument ''
nothing can have 100 % positive feedback '' .
boy , was i wrong .
this `` starter pack '' is more of a toy then a musical instrument .
spend a little more and get a ukulele that has some actual quality .
why is it in this condition ?
it should n't be .
this should be a brand new decent looking ukulele ... but it 's not .
it 's a constant cycle of this .
i would not recommend buying this .
do not give it a chance like i did .
we decided to return it .
not suitable for an adult .
impossible to keep in tune .
further , ours arrived with a broken fret .
i was dissatisfied with this instruments quality .
i can not keep it in tune .
i have had the chance to handle and try this out .
fyi - this product is suited for young children - not for beginner adults !
this ukulele was of poor quality and i would not recommend to anyone .
very disappointed grand daughter on christmas !
we bought this as a christmas present for our daughter .
i will be sending it back .
i suspect it was returned or used .
i mistakenly thought it came with a tuner .
this is really low quality .
the strings will not stay in tune and the body feels too light .
the instrument broke one hour after it came out of the box christmas morning .
big disappointment for the boy on christmas morning .
i repaired it with wood glue and a large clamp .
seems to work now but confidence in this item is low now .
this ukulele is not worth the money !
even if you 're a beginner .
my daughter really wanted one so ordered it for christmas .
for an item over $ 30 , i except a better quality .
overall , i am very disappointed in this product .
cheap material and the strings are junk .
i would not spend more than $ 10 on this item .
the money i lost is more than what the ukulele is worth : (
could have been a better quality .
but you get what you pay for .
my daughter learned how to play in 2 days from the youtube channel
very hard to keep tuned , strings too hard , very small sound .
it was broken when i received it .
so cheap that it wo n't even hold a tune .
the strings are cheap plastic .
strings wo n't stay in tune .
by the end of a song you have to retune .
neck broke off within 10 seconds of playing .
re-glued it but the strings do n't fit the bottom grooves very well .
this is a kids toy .
i returned mine upon opening the box .
definitely not a quality product .
book is dumb and the ukelele is hard : (
the wood seems to be very low quality .
i was expecting something better .
the strings are horrible and very cheap .
i wan na return it honestly
it 's a toy .
it will not stay in tune .
it 's still nicely wrapped in the box .
the ukulele was poorly bilt .
i broke very easily .
it 's really bad ! ! ! !
can i have my , money back ?
will not tone very cheap waste of money .
ukelele could not be tuned and is of poor quality .
strings are cheap plastic .
this ukulele was more of a toy than a nice-full-sounding ukulele .
i hope i can return it .
it was broken and could no longer be played ...
and nowhere in the book does it tell you how to do that .
did n't know they were plastic !
had to return this item .
the instruction book is very good for beginners .
youtube tutorials are invaluable , and plentiful .
ordered this because it was a kit and on price point alone .
the bag is pretty useless .
it 's thin and crinkly with no protective qualities , really .
i suppose it would protect from sunlight and dust .
the instrument is obviously a `` starter '' uke .
the matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain .
i bought the hola !
electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on .
i would recommend this for anyone wanting to give ukulele a whirl .
it 's a fast learning curve , and super fun !
the ukulele was impossible to tune .
could not stay in tune .
when it arrived at my house it was broken
the neck was separated from the body and the guitar felt cheaply made .
barely produces sound , strings can not be tightened .
when i tightened the strings to tune , it would not stay in tune .
unfortunately , i had not discovered this until my window of return had closed .
could be better compiled .
it snapped in half within 35 minutes .
it was hard to tune .
this is awful terrible !
i got it and it was just so bad .
it snapped after a few days because i left a few papers on it .
i have never played a stringed instrument .
i bought this starter pack and was very excited to get started .
i tuned the strings as soon as it arrived using a mobile phone app .
i started the lessons right away .
i bought new ( higher grade ) strings .
it still wo n't hold its tuning .
i ca n't tell you the difference in quality .
i now practice daily .
the chords sound nothing like my new uke .
this has to be a toy- not a real instrument .
i opened the box and quickly noticed that the ukulele was broken .
that break was clearly not due to bad shipping .
the ukulele was terrible .
i 'm surprised you would sell such and awful instrument .
beware of amazon 's 30 day return policy !
the book and accessories make an excellent starter set and the uke is adorable !
looks like it would be a great set if the ukelele was n't defective .
lesson learned : check all items when received from amazon !
i purchased this instrument to teach my child to play .
the first time i tuned this ukulele , the neck snapped in two .
the manufacturer should really rethink its construction and lack of durability .
i did not tighten the strings too much .
i barely got started with the first string .
the instrument i received could n't hold the tuning at all .
i was only hoping for a playable instrument , nothing amazing .
but the one i got barely even qualified for an instrument .
i would not recommend anyone take a chance with this .
you 'd be better off buying a ukulele elsewhere .
preferably where you can try playing it beforehand .
i got this kit as a christmas present from my sister .
not that she would have known but the ukulele is simply unplayable .
this ukulele looks like something a 3 year old would play with .
could not get the instrument to stay in tune for longer than a minute .
ended up returning for a credit .
i purchased this for my kid that is taking a uke class .
right after taking it out , i noticed just how cheap the construction was .
within 10min of opening the box , i already resealed it for return .
it could have ended my child 's interest in the uke before even beginning .
well worth it in my opinion .
it 's practically the thickness of a trash bag and honestly embarrassing .
it worked but there 's an incredibly noticeable crack in it .
i 'd try to return it but it 's really not worth the effort .
this a great product for the price it lists .
i learned a song quickly and played it couple of times .
each time , the pitch sounded off within the first verse of the song .
i basically had to tune it over and over .
i could n't get through even a single song without it losing its tune .
you basically get what you pay for .
i would invest a little more money and get a nice ukulele .
does n't stay tuned for more than a few minutes .
have to buy my daughter a better one to use .
i was not very satisfied with this ukulele .
hard to tune it also .
not what we were expecting .
too much of a toy .
unable to tune the instrument as we would have liked to .
but if you are a 3rd-5th grader perhaps this is your best bet .
hope this helps , -c
my room mate made the claim `` i can play anything with strings . ''
we tuned the ukulele but it did n't hold the sounds ?
i doubt that it will be useful .
if it was n't a gift i would send it back
the product arrived and looked extremely cheap .
2 the strings it came with were horrible .
it could not be tuned and would not play .
then he tried to play and was very sad .
very sorry i bought this item .
the manual is fine , the ukelele is terrible .
also feels very light and flimsy .
he said it would n't keep in tune at all .
we are returning it .
he liked it with the exception he was unable to play it .
the sound is disappointing to begin with .
i check the tuning again , they are fine !
what it means is that the frets are not right !
but the main instrument is very disappointing .
used a few times and the bridge broke .
very poor quality , do n't buy .
when i received it , it looks like a toy .
the quality is cheap n its all plastic .
i want a real ukulele but this product is s & ^ # !
do n't buy it if u want to play ukulele .
..unless u want a toy .
i immediately return it when i recieved it ...
this uke is cute , but it does n't hold a tune .
this thing is so cheap , as in , it 's made crappy ! !
i would not recommend this to anyone !
very disappointed on this one !
i am really mad !
my husband deserved an awesome fathers day gift and instead , he got crap !
disappointed with the construction .
do n't know how this one got past quality control .
it was more like a chuckee cheese prize than an instrument !
the ukulele strings just would n't stay put .
delivery was prompt as usual , but the product itself is garbage .
actually it never tuned in the first place .
$ 35 is over priced for such a poorly made item .
product is inexpensive which is great , but is cheap which is not .
strings are extremely hard to tune because they keep going out of tune .
the stain patterns follow the exact arc the crack appeared on .
i find this highly suspect .
very disappointed right now .
the ukelele is made out of cheap wood and it feels awful .
the strings are low quality and everything about the package screams out horrible .
i am very happy amazon has a return policy .
the smallest string apparently was n't tied on correctly and came loose overnight .
the book and dvd are helpful and throughout .
but the ukulele is cheap and sounds terrible .
i guess i got what i payed for .
it sounded and played great !
i loved it and bought it .
the sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument .
it 's too close to christmas to waste time on this one .
hope this helps you out .
i just ordered the updated version .
when i opened the box , it had already appeared to be used .
it looks very worn .
nothing i would expect from amazon llc .
wo n't stay in tune and sounds like you are strumming a plastic toy .
it is going back .
out the gate , i 'm pretty underimpressed by the package .
it wo n't tune it 's just junk .
my little girls dora guitar is better .
very ordinary suctions , but strong .
can adjust the angle and height .
but : slides on the lap .
basically it has been impractical and unusable for me due to constant sliding .
difficult to stay on guitar
i have to adjust it every time i move one way or another .
it wo n't allow tilting towards your body .
if they would add that it would be a valuable addition to my arsenal .
i did this and it still will not keep its hold .
this product is useless and i feel like i wasted over $ 30 .
the amount of air it takes to play this whistle is totally insane .
a fife takes less !
i could n't be more disappointed in this tin whistle .
it just seems to make it more difficult to play a clear note .
any tips ... i 'll edit my review if more practice changes things .
i play a feadog d all the time and love it .
no it is n't tunable .
up the tin whistle ya 'll
didnt fit and had much worse quality than advertised .
returned it it did not fit my guitar
total waste of money .
i could never get it on the guita .
it did not fit the neck of our guitar .
does not work as i thought it would .
just a piece of expensive plastic .
gimmic ... .nice song books tho .
chordbuddy did not fit my guitar , and was hard to use .
better off using youcisian or getting lessons .
there are some great beginner lessons you youtube also .
does not fit guitar , dose not push all of the strings down .
received this earlier this month and i was eager to attach and start rocking .
first the good , great concept , books and dvd are clear and informative .
the chord buddy simply does n't work .
10 cents worth of plastic and it feels like it .
i also tried it on my semi-acoustic with the exact same results .
like i said , great concept ... ... ... but poorly executed .
difficult to register on neck .
i am really ticked off !
did n't work and it kept on slipping on strings .
played wrong strings or overlapped wrong stings .
good idea but poor design .
only reason got two stars is video good .
this product is an excellent idea .
i wish it actually worked .
the dvd was pretty great .
i think it just ca n't press the strings down hard enough .
the worst product i have ever purcased off amazon !
the plastic thumb screw broke right off the bat .
cheaply made and not worth $ 44.95 !
have returned it to amazon for a full refund .
wish they made it clear that you must measure guitar first .
too small and will cost almost $ 8 to return for refund !
got it on time .
supposed to be left handed but it 's not .
kind of a pain to get on .
doubt i would purchase this again
did n't fit so returned
i ordered it after seeing on shark tank and really hoped for the best .
sorry chordbuddy , this missed the mark .
missing the chord buddy device .
package only contained the tuner and books
does n't work on guitar
it was difficult to maneuver
horrible was broken when i received it .
would not stay in place when using the guitar .
very frustrating to say the least .
provably should have returned it .
i 'm really disappointed .
he had it installed on his fender accoustic .
adjustment of device unclear , also .
so i through it into the trash .
waste of money and time .
saw it on tv but it did n't work for me .
i could n't get the device on the guitar neck to work correctly .
very difficult to line up so you get a clear tone when using .
i finally gave up .
no matter how i put it on i get a buzzing from it .
really wanted this to work but bottom line is it dont .
i would never recommend this to anyone and am very disapointed .
i have returned the chord buddy twice now .
both times due to the tightening screw snapping .
certainly not what i was hoping for in terms of quality .
the chordbuddy is not produced as well as i had anticipated .
unfortunately , it did n't work for him .
he was not able to apply enough pressure .
that 's not the chordbuddy 's fault .
maybe it would work for others , i do n't know .
it just appeared to be cheaply made though .
not a good design , will not stay tight on guitar neck .
you 're paying nine cents apiece for those ?
i received an oscar schmidt guitar a couple years ago for christmas .
i have tinkered around but never learned to really play it .
i was excited to receive the chord buddy .
unfortunately , it did not fit my guitar .
it will be returned and the guitar will be returned to the closet .
fit the guitar good , my guitar was the right size .
i like the idea but not the actual operation .
tabs we 're different heights , rubbed together , not a quality product .
therefore can not be tightened securely .
did not like..sent back for refund
great idea poor quality .
the system will help one to get started to making music , yes !
and , a note : you do get a nice 100 song book .
guess it is worth the $ 50.00 give it a try .
hopefully your usa made will be a little better quality than what mine was .
cd does not play in either of my computers .
please do n't buy , it 's too frustrating to use
i had to return mine .
i have returned it because of a few different issues .
instead it leans and wo n't sit straight .
as i mentioned above , i purchased a 6 string guitar .
will only fit smaller guitars .
did not fit my daughters .
i was very disappointed with the quality of the product .
my husband received this as a gift through amazon .
the dvd does n't navigate right on any of our computers .
still no instructions as to navigate on a computer .
disappointed , that we were sucked in again by a bunch of tv hype .
dont waste $ 35 ! !
this product is a joke .
it is made out of a flimsy plastic .
in theory , it should work , but in reality it does not .
definitely not worth anywhere near the price they ask for it .
somebody on shark tank is making millions .
what a piece of crap-do n't waste your money ! !
iam dissatisfied with the cord buddy it dose not fit right .
i installed like the dvd said and the plastic screw .
tht holds it on .
hard to fasten to guitar and kept giving false readings
nice idea , but it really does n't work .
you really do n't feel like you are making anything that sounds like music .
it was a waste of money .
i spent more time adjusting the chordbuddy than actually playing .
mine started to crack on day three .
honestly was not what i expected at all .
plastic not very sturdy and cheap .
would n't by this product again .
directions were very confusing and were not clear .
it did n't bring the cd .
how am i supposed to use it ?
after i received it , i found it only works with 3 chords .
junk.. save your money .
does not fit on guitar and is confusing to learn
even adjusting it out ... .it was too small .
so ... this was only rated low because we could not use it .
does n't fit my guitar .
cord buddy did not work for me .
it was not a helpful product .
not very well constructed .
did not seat well at all on the guitar .
i immeadiately sent back and got a refund !
i was so disappointed !
flimsy and wo n't stay in place .
it took 4 ever to arrive .
my tuning snark arrived in two days ; tuned guitar with no chord contraption .
i should have known better .
i 've done better learning power chords and basic chords on youtube .
oh well , you live and learn .
any positive reviews have to be fake .
do n't waste your money .
mines heading back tomorrow .
this is not worth the money , flimsy construction .
difficult to attach to guitar properly .
make sure you measure your guitar neck .
can not be over 1 3/4 inches wide .
other wise it wo n't work .
product came on time that was plus .
fitted well on my guitar .
but that was when things went down hill .
tired taking off th rubber boots , tried adjusting it .
nothing seems to work .
waste of money i should have listened to th people in th other reviews .
be warner do n't buy this ! !
does n't fit my guitar ca n't use .
didnt work on her guitar .
just did n't work as it said it would
it might work on some guitars , but not mine .
i guess i 'll learn to play the harmonica .
sadly , it did not fit any of my four guitars .
it fits the base to one of them but does n't actually work .
definitely do n't recommend .
this product doesnt work .
its not worth buying .
i bought 2 of them and they both did the same thing .
did not fit on jr or regular guitar neck ... disappointment .
this product is still in need of further development .
string buzzing on my acoustic guitar .
did n't fit right .
great concept , not so good on the execution .
this thing is a piece of junk .
made very cheap , i guess that is part of the shark tank marketing .
when it moves it makes the strings buzz or sound off key .
would not spend money on it again .
i play guitar , but was buying it for my grandson .
in plain english it do n't work
wish i had of kept the invoice , i would have sent it back..
poor quality , constantly falls off .
not very durable at all .
it does not attached to the guitar chord well and expensive .
too much breakable plastic .
i bought this for my son to learn how to play the guitar .
also that it wanted you to read the music not the cords .
otherwise , it is not worth the plastic it is molded from .
tried to remove a rubber boot , ripped .
did not come with enough replacement boots .
i do not recommend .
did not work on guitar .
biggest piece of garbage there is .
cheap plastic that does n't work .
disappointed chordbuddy would not fit my wife 's hohner guitar .
it would not accommodate the wider string spacing .
it would have been better to by chordbuddy with the guitar as a package .
not what i expected would not recomend
rubber pieces were not level if that makes sense .
plastic pieces stuck together , felt it was cheaply made .
loved the concept , wish it would have worked .
no am returning the product .
also , the one i received was not what was pictured in the instructional dvd
very disappointed in product .
difficult to properly attach to guitar .
device sits on strings and muffles sounds .
not what i expected .
it 's now sitting in my drawer .
it allows you to play 5 different chords .
much better to take lessons .
installation instructions leave a lot to be desired .
not very well made .
really does n't clamp the neck well .
i was so psyched when i saw it on sharktank .
cheap and flimsy ... .
did not fit my guitar correctly even though my guitar neck was within limits .
needs to tighten to the neck better .
would absolutely not fit right and hit strings it should not or blocked others .
i followed all directions and really wanted to give this a shot .
not worth any amount of money .
promises great things but ca n't even start using it .
ummm do n't get it .
would not and could not get it to work properly on standard size guitar .
i hate this wasted of money .
it does not work and the company will not return my emails .
i wanted to return the waste of money and get my money back .
had to adjust everytime you pressed down on colored tabs .
was loose after each use for a young person it 's hard to use .
i am not real impressed with this product .
did not help me at all .
the instruction video is not don very well .
i have 2 acustic guitars and i couldnot make it work on either one .
i tried without the tabs and it still would not work .
a waste of money .
never got it to work properly .
very unhappy with it .
it was a waste of money .
i would not recommend this
the concept is good the application is poor
i 've tried this on at least four different guitars .
i wish i could get my money back .
if this is easy installation ; i 'm glad they did n't over complicate .
instructions on dvd are slim and on paper even worse .
i would not recommend this 5 cents worth of plastic for any one .
this thing is not recommended for people with high blood pressure or heart problems .
if you buy it get case of beer before trying to install .
the concept is great but unfortunately it 's made cheap .
for the price , i expected higher quality .
my suggestion is to hang on to your money .
the chord buddy did not fit either one !
apparently , it fits `` most '' guitars -- so be careful !
maybe a quick call to the manufacturer will help .
they would be smart to track the guitars it does not work on .
do n't waste your time getting this .
is made out of cheap stuff .
not happy with this product wish i could return it
hard to keep in place on the guitar .
would not recommend this product .
do n't waste your money .
it was cheap plastic and the chords sound terrible .
a waste of money i will keep practicing and learn the real way
very flimsy and hard to use .
i would not recommend it to anyone .
a total waste of money on my part
i ordered it for my wife for christmas .
it did not fit her guitar .
it was n't big enough to fit around the neck .
she was very disappointed .
the principle i get ... however , the little hammers slide off the strings .
do n't bother , it does n't fit well and is cumbersome to use .
just not adjustable enough.. probably works well on certain guitars..
great concept , cheaply made .
i had higher hopes from a product shown on shark tank !
it did n't fit correctly onto the guitar .
both kits showed up without the dvd 's in them .
without a complete kit , you ca n't complete the home study coarse .
ca n't get the cord buddy attached to guitar .
i do n't believe this product is workable .
how do i returnthe cord buddy ?
this is very hard to use .
it does not stay in place .
it is very expensive and does not help to play the guitar .
do n't be fooled .
this thing is crap .
do n't buy it .
does n't fit right at all .
do n't waste your $ $ .
the shark tank show made it look effortless , but it 's crap .
good concept but cheaply made product .
this product is definitely not worth the money .
i have not been able to get it to work .
it only comes with grey booties .
in my opinion do n't waste your money on this thing .
did not work on my guitar .
instruction video showed better item .
i returned the product .
otherwise seems to be an intereting product .
i have no problem with the product itself .
i paid for a new chord buddy and was sent a used one .
the package was opened and taped closed .
you should recieve what you paid for ... ... ... ...
bought this as a christmas gift for my son who is taking guitar lessons .
it did not fit properly on the guitar .
it was snug on two cords but not all .
wanted to return it , but could n't .
poorly made , i have six guitars does n't work on any of them .
complete waste of time and money.good idea that was poorly executed
sorely disappointed ... ..did n't return simply so no one else gets this bamboozled .
it is not a learning system or practice aid .
never mind that no account is taken in about rhythm and strumming .
the john rich video is so misleading about playing a song .
-- -as if those are the only chords in songs .
what about key signatures ?
sharps and flats in notes and chords ?
it 's a novelty .
you have to have a teacher to learn an instrument .
the student dumped the toy and stayed with me .
unfortunately i was wrong .
only one chord would play clearly .
the buddy would stay tight for a couple of chords then slip down again .
i like the idea but the execution is poor .
maybe they 'll come out with a more stable and less cheaply made product .
until then i would n't recommend .
i gave this every possible opportunity and just can not make it work .
i would love to see how those who are happy use theirs .
the cheapness of the plastic might be the culprit .
it 's probably a good idea that was ruined in poor quality offshore manufacturing .
maybe if it were just a little higher quality it might work .
it was broking when i got it .
and they never tryed to get it back to fix it .
they lied about it .
it has n't met our expectations at all .
the neck on my guitar is 2 inch wide .
chord buddy did n't fit .
i forced it on , but it wo n't touch the 6th string .
strings are 7/16 inch apart .
booty 's miss strings or hit stings not needed .
will try old school with cd .
bad to start with .
upon receiving chord buddy , it was faulty .
it cost way too much for a thing that does n't even function properly .
was not constructed to fit well on the guitar .
the unit kept slipping and would not hold adjustments after a minute of playing .
i sent an email to the support site but never recevied an answer .
not happy with the product .
i was hoping it would be easier to attach to my guitar .
additionally , the knob for tightening down on the neck was missing .
not worth the money .
would n't pay $ 5 for this .
cheaply made , difficult to install .
thought this would be a cool item .
constantly have to adjust the thing to get a clean strum .
i did n't receive all the parts indicated in the instructions .
i found this more trouble than it is worth .
bummer , really wanted it to work .
had truoble with chord buddy touching the strings .
tried different ways to mount it with no success .
does not work as advertised on my guitar .
not a very well made product .
more frustrating than it is worth !
it really is worth about 5 dollars !
i would not recommend purchasing it .
pay for real lessons !
guess i can use it to learn notes and ignore how it sounds .
i actually returned it and received a full refund .
please do not waste your money on this product .
not made of high quality .
should be made of metal so it does n't feel like it will break .
needs 2 sizes for selling .
one for larger neck and one for slender neck .
it does not fit correctly .
my elderly father is bored so he wanted this for christmas .
i thought w the sharks involved it would have been of much higher quality .
i love the sharks ! !
( tv program ) those people are awesome unlike the guitar buddy .
my hat is still off to the inventor though .
just needs more money put into it .
and the song books need to be more simple .
like g with a circle to press that button etc .
read the bad reviews .
back to the drawing board .
great concept and will probably work with some guitars .
neuropathy took away my ability to play chords .
i was hoping this product might allow me to ply a little .
my major gripe 9s with the chord selection available .
check that out before you buy .
may be fine for you .
it is made of very cheap plastic .
it works ok , but you have to be constantly readjusting it .
maybe its because its cracked .
it feels cheap and you have to constantly adjust it .
dvd is pretty basic too .
try to find something else with better quality .
i removed and reinstalled it several times before it would work at all .
fits guitar neck poorly .
moves laterlally at slightest touch .
impossible to adjust so all strings are clear .
good idea but poorly made .
i have yet to get this thing to work .
i ca n't even get it to stay on the guitar .
great consept , sorry construction .
i bought it for my grandson and i am so disappointed .
it is the biggest waste of money that i have every spent .
once i received this item and tried it out there was only extreme disappointment .
will never recommend this to anyone wanting to learn to play a guitar
chordbuddy was a waste of money .
i 'm so disappointed .
it does n't fit my guitar .
may i return it ?
please give me an address to return it to .
i was not able to attach it to my accoustic guitar .
i went to a guitar store and they could n't do it either .
i am so disappointed , as i looked forward to using it .
it was n't it made it almost harder
cheap plastic that did n't fit on my acoustic guitar !
not as it was shown on tv .
still continue to try and see how it goes .
would n't fit on 3 different guitars ?
what more can i say ?
lent it to a friend .
would n't fit his guitar ?
very unhappy , does not stay in place on guitar .
does not adjust properly .
therefore ... , does not play chords clean .
it seems like a good idea ... .but did not work well for me .
used it on a four different gutars .
it fit none of them well enough to stay attached .
when pressing the keys they did not match the strings and sounded really bad .
it looked promising but failed all the way round .
good idea but poor workmanship ruined it .
go back to the drawing board and try again .
i recently saw the chordbuddy on shark tank and really was intrigued .
the product i got seemed like it had already been used .
after i installed and began to play i was very disappointed .
i should have listened to previous buyers .
good luck and happy guitar playing !
could never get it to fit properly on my guitar and i really tried .
instructional video with travis is also lacking .
there are no shortcuts to playing guitar .
you just have to practice and take lessons from a good teacher .
my recommendation is to save your money and use it for real lessons instead .
as others have mentioned it is cheap / poorly made .
this caused some strings to not be depressed the same as others .
worked with it for about an hour and put it away .
first we could n't get it on the guitar to play the cords correctly .
nothing we did worked and yes , we did watch the dvd .
so how can it fit standard guitars if they 're all different ?
i returned it and am learning the old school way .
it was just not as easy as it was made out to be .
does not do what it says it will do .
he was on shark tank twice and the sharks thought he was great .
i am sure they lost their investment on this cheap piece of plastic .
i hope no one buys anymore , i am sooo disappointed ! !
great idea but poorly made .
the plastic hits the strings causing an annoying buzz .
it was not packaged as advertised and was missing parts .
when you held down the color tab it did n't touch all the chords .
this product sounds like a great beginners guide .
i say ditch the chord buddy and use some free online teaching tools .
there is nothing i can say about chordbuddy .
if they ever make one that fits my guitar i will buy it .
the concept is good but in reality it was a flop .
this chord buddy is not a good training tool .
no real guitarist would use this .
do n't waste your time or money .
do you want to learn how to play guitar or just memorize colored buttons ?
would not recommend this product to nobody .
string actions did not play chord properly .
really thin cheaply made chord buddy .
found it cheaply made and clumpsy to use .
did not fit my folk guitar very well .
am 68 years old .
had a similar unit for my ukelele when a youngster .
got the chordbuddy for my grandson .
i tried this on multiple guitars , both nylon and steel stringed .
the unit was not stable on any of the guitars ' neck .
in other words a total waste of money .
i would pay double if it was a quality device .
great idea - but c'mon.. sell me something that actually functions.. too bad..
but unfortunately from all 3 guitars they did not fit ! !
i 'm gon na keep trying until i get it right .
if i can not , hopefully i will be able to get a refund .
cheap plastic , pressure pads missing and broken .
a waste of $ 40 .
it sure looked goog on shark tank .
it did not do what i expected.its not worth what i paid for .
glad i only purchase one .
might as well just learn to play the guitar , it would be easier .
this is a fair warning the product sucks !
at least for me .
it never worked even after having a replacement .
tried contacting chord buddy itself but they are no help !
the customer service sounded like some lady just answering her home phone .
not a professional place .
i tried to get help through facebook on the chord buddy site .
it seemed like he helped people there but i got no reply from him .
it was so far a waste of money big time .
it sits under my bed in a box now collecting dust .
wish i never wasted the time .
thats what i get for watching shark tank .
amazon and shipping was great as expected .
the cord buddy did n't work as expected .
i admit it is a great idea but needs lots of improvement .
.i believe it would discourage any new beginner .
i had to make shims so it would fit tight on my guitar .
i would not purchase one of these again .
i did n't know how to rate this item .
we have not been able to get it connected properly on the guitar .
it just does not fit properly and does not make completed chords .
the sounds it does make are not pleasing .
it is nothing like what we saw on a local t.v .
i guess at 78 years of age he should try something easier .
i feel bad that this product is fooling so many .
do n't want sore fingers ?
spend two weeks and you 'll get your callus 's .
consider it a rite of passage .
do n't want callus 's ?
do n't play guitar .
this is just another gimmick .
that is the bottom line .
technically speaking , learning your chords is muscle recognition .
t hey might be ok except you cant keep them on the guitar .
you have to keep readjusting it all the time almost after every song .
i would not recommend this product to anyone .
i would not recommend this product .
it did not come close to fitting my guitar .
it was a waste of money !
i bought this for my wife for her birthday .
we had seen it on shark tank and really wanted to like it .
i 've been playing guitar for about 4 years .
i tried it on two different acoustics .
they both have decent set ups .
there was terrible buzzing when using the chord buddy .
the plastic felt cheap and the whole thing felt flimsy .
this is horrible period .
i have had several professional musicians try and help me out .
it will not firmly attach to any of my guitars .
it has a tendency to wobble on all the guitars that i own .
i would much appreciate my refund as this was not a cheap item !
why is it called chord buddy ? ?
but you know how to strum your guitar .
as with others had a hard time on two different guitars getting proper fit .
i have attempted to tighten the chord buddy , again without success .
again , i have attempted to tighten the chord buddy without success .
when i try to correct that , i.e .
i put this on a standard guitar with little hope .
the cd that comes with the book is only for older computers .
the company ( i called ) that does n't real care !
i wasted my money..save yours !
this item does not fit all guitars .
i tried it on two different guitars and it did not work .
i wish i had looked for those reviews before purchasing .
more than likley i would not recomed this product to a friend .
it simply does n't work .
last time i buy anything promoted on shark tank .
this item did not fit my guitar !
did not fit , did not fit
it did not sound good .
i had a proffesional guitar player try it and he had the same results .
i wish it would have sounded better becauce the idea is great .
i am having trouble getting the chords to play cleanly .
it seems a little cheap to me .
when i saw this on shark tank i thought this would be perfect .
if i ever figure out what the problem is i will update .
need someone or something to help you get started ?
good luck with that .
are there videos on youtube to give you an out line ?
who the heck knows .
nothing is mentioned about it at the web sight .
how about operating the `` preform a track '' software ?
i thought the `` preform a track '' i downloaded was defective .
so who is giving all those glowing recommendations about this product ?
makes you wonder though , how come those people did n't mention these issues ?
it does n't represent all the chords .
it did not fit any guitar well enough to work properly .
great concept , faulty design & extremely poor quality .
does not fit all guitars .
does not function properly .
best thing about this product was they gave me my money back .
because it did not work on my guitar as advertised , would not recommend .
needs better design and construction .
it does n't work would like to return but do n't know how .
it is impossible to hold the colored keys down to strum the chord .
i followed travis ' instructions via supplied dvd , but still was not successful .
in retrospect , i should have waited for a 4g version of this ...
tried it on two different guitars .
did n't work on either .
the dvd says there are two different size boots .
if there are different sizes they should be different colors to tell them apart .
i guess my guitar is considered a classical guitar .
the neck is to wide and `` chord buddy '' wo n't fit .
description should state supported neck width in measurements not guitar style .
most people buying this are new to guitars and might not know exact specifications .
good idea but i should have read more reviews .
again , good idea it just wo n't work .
measure your guitar and call them before ordering .
video states it comes with tabs that touch the strings .
mine came with only grey .
i do n't think the item works properly .
i happily purchased it but i 'm not satisfied with the unit .
the video and books provided are excellent .
it does not work as simply as advertized .
when hitting one cord it also hits another string and direction are confusing .
now why is that ?
made so cheaply and does not clamp on neck and stay .
it arrived in record time .
the plastic is inferior , and the construction overall is lack-luster .
but as is , do not buy ! ! !
i can n't even use this on my guitar .
the teaching dvd is of poor quality .
this was the worst transaction i have ever had with amazon .
i believe that he should say which button is next in his teaching .
my son ( 12 ) did not like this product at all .
he found the dvd boring and wanted to play more updated music .
overall i would not recommend this for young people .
found it very difficult to set up on guitar .
i had high hopes for this .
i have light guitar experience before i got it .
as soon as i used it i knew there were going to be problems .
it took me all of 15 minutes to figure out this was garbage .
1. it is made out of extremely cheap plastic which could easily break .
2. it needs to be secured to the guitar in a better fashion .
i would consider it a waste of money .
besides that , its way over priced for what it is .
i would demand that it be made correctly or not at all .
there seems to be a lot of good reviews , so good for them .
and it is a great premise , the books/dvd are very well done .
where it falls short for me is in the actual device .
but the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar .
one wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials ?
update : figured i 'd post this , maybe it will help others .
the biggest fix came in keeping the chord buddy from tilting down .
this gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down .
while it now works , i ca n't give a better grade .
for this much money , it should work well out of the box .
second update : i also picked up a copy of rocksmith .
if there was a money back guarantee i would want mine back .
pushing on 2 of the buttons deadens the strings next to it .
the rubber mounts came off right away and i had to reglue them .
i wasted my hard earned money on some one that wants to get rich .
shame on you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
saw this advertised on the show sharks .
i thought it was agood idea .
i still think its a great idea but i think it needs some more tweaking
unfortunately , i was a little disappointed in the product .
it is a little flimsey and not that easy to put on and off .
and , he really enjoyed the idea , but does not fit his guitar .
: ( i guess this is just for junky guitars and not good ones .
i hope i get my money back on a return .
do n't buy the chord buddy .
waste of money and time .
if you want to learn how to play guitar , just get lessons .
i bought this for my husband and it was an epic failure .
it did n't fit his guitar !
i totally wasted my money .
it is very cheaply made , especially considering its cost .
i spent hours of frustration trying to make it work on two different guitars .
i contacted the factory twice , neither time receiving any useful information .
there should be more rubber feet included in more sizes .
i had to shim the bracket out to correct this .
this causes some of the feet to be too close to the strings .
amazing how his sounds so good on the videos .
the one he uses does not look like the one i have though .
i 'm a music therapist and wanted an adaptive chord playing tool for clients .
i own a standard guitar and it does not fit .
it is a waste of money .
i wish i was informed specifically what guitars this actually will work on !
save yourself the hassle and do not get this product .
it did not fit my yamaha guitar - fyi .
it 's also pretty cheaply made .
i was excited to see this product when it was featured on shark tank .
i tried contacting the seller three times for return authorization and got no response .
not every successful transaction you see on shark tank is legit .
i think they 're going to lose money on this one !
i tried several different ways to remedy these problems with no luck .
i hope they put in more time to develop the product .
the engineering leaves a lot to be desired .
in principle , it is a very good idea .
if you purchased this product , and are not happy .
let the manufacturer know about it .
it can be corrected .
the knob on the turn screw is also missing .
bought this through amazon .
any suggestions to this problem .
i downloaded it on my windows 10 computer for free and works just fine .
last time i checked , it 's still free .
the fact that someone is charging anything for it is mind boggling .
audacity is a free program .
i do n't understand how anyone obtained the rights to profit from it .
if i am missing something here i will change my rating .
worst buying experience for musical instrument on the internet .
let me put it this way .
bad , bad , bad !
the holes are not aligned with the top part .
from f to high c sounds decent .
from f to low c ( especially the low c ) , awful !
it gave a scratchy sound , more similar to a whistle .
do not waste your money on this recorder .
it is pretty , but poorly made .
ca n't get a clean note out of it to save your life .
some of the notes do n't work at all ... nothing but air/no sound .
i threw mine in the trash 5 minutes after i bought it .
it was n't even worth the time and money to return it .
its going to cost me more to fix it then the item cost .
music slides around do you ca n't tell which string to pluck .
bought as a christmas present for my son .
lap harp is impossible to tune and essentially is unusable .
when i went to return it today , it was not eligible for return .
my son is very disappointed !
pretty annoyed i got this out 2 days before christmas to tune .
it 's supposed to be the present from santa for my daughter .
we have the pick and the extra wire .
not easy to follow - i returned .
i took years of music lessons and purchased this for music loving granddaughter .
came untuned and was impossible to tune .
it is a gift - so getting it like that is not acceptable .
not tuned right , and no instructions of how to tune it .
also , no instructions of how to play it .
do you pluck one string , or strum it like an auto harp ?
also the product says made in mexico right on it !
i sent it back .
the instrument i received is untunable .
the pegs slip as soon as i release the tuning peg .
i am a professional musician and very accustomed to tuning instruments like these .
i was not really surprised though , due to the inexpensive price tag .
and i am a guitar player ... .
this instrument is literally garbage .
it is not tuned well and very hard to pluck
it does n't tune right .
two of the tuners wo n't stay put and ca n't be tuned .
will be trying to return it .
tried to cancel when it came up on email that evening .
tolde it was to late .
arrived out of tune with no instructions .
beware , the harp comes out of tune .
even if you slowly try to tune it , the strings break .
looks like the harp was never tuned by the company .
i will use the harp as a spare , had to buy another one .
make sure you have a supply of wire strings , they break very easily .
missing all sheets of music , making it useless to teach music .
2. the song sheets do not fit well .
pro -- it is an interesting conversation piece on the shelf .
quality is not that great .
impossible to get into tune and stay in tune .
but his one is not .
i am not a professional musician , but i 'm not uneducated either .
i bought mine from a toy store but purchased hers on amazon .
fell out of tune .
could not get it back .
i 'm quite disappointed .
the music sheets are fun and he adores picking out tunes .
and by long , i mean more than a few songs .
i would love this harp if only it would stay in tune .
even staying in tune for a day or two would be better .
i returned it immediately .
you can not tune it and the sound of tinny .
do not buy this .
many strings are tarnished , too .
i thought it might be a fluke so i bought a second one .
he broke that one in about half an hour .
these headphones are great at first -- but they suffer from a design flaw .
both of mine broke .
bottom line -- look else ware for headphones .
i am on my second set of these headphones .
the speakers are second to none but the head band is pure junk .
i have no kids in the house so the headphones were never abused .
these things are discontinued .
when they were in production the srp was $ 149 .
you could find these all over the internet and dj shops for $ 90-100 .
they are good dj headphones but are made from cheap plastic .
i went through 4 pairs of these .
$ 129 for a used pair = ripoff !
whoever is selling these for $ 379 needs to go see a doctor .
the sad thing is someone will buy them .
a sucker is born everyday !
these headphones did not last 1 year .
i 'm a dj and i do alot of gigs .
after a few months the joints by the earpiece broke .
i taped them up , as the wire was still connected .
a few weeks later , during a party , the left side broke .
i love the sound , but the build quality sucked .
they are pretty heavy for over the ear headphones too .
now the padding is starting to crack and chip away .
i have to toss these out now .
do yourself a favor and buy another set of headphones .
plastic parts are made out of cheap , thin , bad quality plastic .
universal joint ( swivel ) broke after short use of headphones .
can not use headphones .
but the sound was good .
the sound from these headphones is great .
they have good bass without muddiness and good high range as well as volume .
the sound isolation is decent , but not great .
sony should redesign these headphones .
this product is garbage .
bought a pair and the left earcup t-bone snapped after 1 month of usage .
do n't waste your money on these .
purchase the technics rp-dh1200 - dj headphones .
the mdrv700 left ear piece stopped working entirely within 60 days .
here 's my review breakdown : general sound : is this a joke ?
the base overpowered everything and made my mids and highs sound muffled and lost .
to suggest that these headphones were made for dj 's is laughable .
they would never hold up to professional use .
i had mine only a few weeks before they began developing cracks .
what a shame sony paired first-rate electronics with a dollar store-quality plastic frame .
they looked so sturdy .
they sound pretty good .
i could hear something cracking but i could n't see where the crack was .
i 'm glad i only paid $ 40 us
the rating of two stars is probably just about right .
especially troublesome is the funky off/on switch .
it needs a light indicator .
i 'd search for other mikes .
do your research before you buy these .
never again will i buy sony headphones .
a much lesser secondary problem is it requires an aa battery .
bought this to use with my minidisc recorder from like 8 years ago .
just buy a shure sm57/sm58 and 1/4 to 1/8 adapter .
they 're really hit or miss depending on what you listen to .
but these are not worth $ 90 .
they literally crush your ears .
also , the swivel cup design on these is poorly executed .
it totally did n't look like it would last .
these have been my main headphones for years .
the sound quality is ok. the problem is they are _extremely_ uncomfortable .
you have to keep shifting them around to make them more comfortable .
the top band is heavy and hard .
the construction on these is n't amazing either .
they are pretty creaky .
and with all that , they are way overpriced .
i have n't tried any other dj headphones .
recently i decided that enough was enough and i needed something more comfortable .
and actually , they isolate sound better too .
the first few months of owning these headphones they were great !
but after that they decided to blow on me .
a few of my friends have had the same model and the same problem .
i wo n't buy these ever again .
iam a musician and i desperately wanted a good microphone .
the gain on this mic is horrible .
on the minuses , this thing is bulky and super heavy .
had these for a few years and sounded nice .
it 's a bit heavy .
then , the plastic cracked where the swivel is .
made of cheap plastic .
i agree with the previous review .
i would like to add a few things though .
the ear pads also cracked / flaked off shortly after the hinges gave way .
the hinge is delicate and virtually impossible to fix by hand .
or some other higher quality sennheisers .
por favor , necesito que se me tramite el credito .
mine broke in 4 different places !
they do n't even cancel noise very well !
why then do you see all the big djs with these headphones you ask ?
they sound great , look great , and do n't crack after three months .
there is no doubt that these look and sound good .
i treat my equipment w/ kid gloves .
the design is defective , and they will break on you !
stay clear of this garbage , and do n't be fooled by the looks .
i upgraded from the standard issue ipod earbuds .
the plastic on the hinge/swivel device is completely inadequate for its purpose .
mine lasted only about a month .
the sound still sounds fine , but the swivels are in shambles .
dont buy these if you want them for longer than a couple of months .
for the price , the longevity of these is a shame .
revised : 2/5 stars for me
this is typical of sony 's disregard for customers ' concerns .
they would n't honor their own parts-only warranty , either .
i 've been boycotting sony ever since - and you should , too !
who makes good headphones ?
their customer service is superb !
... on the right ear cup after the first week .
these headphones would be pretty good if the construction was n't so shoddy .
these are n't cheap either at $ 90 .
the bass is really heavy on these .
the build quality is not that great .
i think they look really cool .
these are designed for dj 's .
the sennheiser hd600 ( $ 260 ) are some of the best around .
sony headphones are notorious for the ear pads falling apart .
always listen before you buy , everyone has different preferences in sound .
i picked up an old stereo receiver for $ 30 .
i have had them for only one year , and the cable has broken .
the sound , while good , was not worth the extra cash .
the headphones you want are the $ 75 ones made by sennheiser .
amazon.com carries them , so get them instead !
there is an inherent flaw in the quality of the construction .
do yourself a favor and invest your money in a product that will last !
a year ago , i purchase this exact product that was made in japan .
right now , they are made in the philippines .
i only knew this after purchasing one unit days ago .
the current model sounded so inferior .
without comparison , everything stands acceptable .
zero complaints on that .
the comfort took some getting used to .
the problem is on the plastic joints .
the real problem here is that they have lots of tiny plastic joints .
i do not recommend these..
this is probably built into the design .
this happened to me after just over one year of light use
do the right thing , do n't buy these !
you 'll be happy you listened to my advice !
i just broke my second pair of these headphones .
i will never buy another pair of sony v700s again .
i also wear glasses and can only comfortably use them for 5-10 minutes .
neither set lasted longer than a year and a half .
i would recomend sennheiser 280 , technics 1200 , or the pioneers over these .
if you must go with sonys go with the 7506s .
not as loud but much more durable as well as comfortable .
this flute does n't have correct tones .
do n't waste your money
i believe so is off key
oh god my ears ...
hard to get all the notes to play .
i bought it for my grandchild and hoped it would be a better quality .
dont buy this if you value your safety .
use only if you have a good purpose for it , not for fun .
they are extremely powerful .
like magneto , they should be avoided .
sound is not what i expected
i found the recorder to be of low quality and poor tone .
i am returning it .
i am not that musical .
played clarinet many years ago but ca n't hit any notes on this .
my three year old grandson loves blowing on it though .
i bought this for my son who will use it at school .
this recorder does not have correct tones .
its fa and sol are completely off .
i have to purchase another one but it wo n't be a yamaha .
it seems to me everyone got exceptional instrument except me .
i do n't understand what 's so great about this guitar .
action is just horrible .
i mean , look at 12 fret its 10 millimeters .
of course , you can play on this guitar , i do .
but it 's hard .
i suppose , one should n't expect much from $ 100 dollars instrument .
but i repeat , it 's not great .
now about bass strings .
they sound bassy , as i suppose , they must .
but the thing is their bassines overpower trebles .
trebles sound unproportionally weak .
and yes , yes .
but action on this instrument still kills my fingers .
i will send it back , and buy myself inexpensive spanish brand .
the package was also not insulated well and the cover comes off .
i purchased this for my husbands birthday so this was hugely disappointing .
i bought this for my husband as a birthday present .
the neck of the guitar was completely broken off .
i 'm very upset that his gift was broken and has to be returned .
i first played the c40 last year .
it was a great guitar for the money .
i ordered one last month .
to my dismay , i noticed that the new c40 was manufactured much differently .
apparently , the quality has gone way down .
not much tonal quality .
perhaps this was a bad factory run , but i was disappointed .
this played like a different guitar .
cheap plastic strings ... two tuning pegs do n't work .
spend a lil cash and get something good .
yamaha is a good brand.. just not this line .
i own several yamaha musical instruments .
also , it could not be played in tune-i.e .
the fret/nut/bridge alignment was off .
i suppose this is typical for a $ 100 entry level guitar .
perhaps i got a bad one .
the classical guitar has to be made of wood .
well do not do it !
because i doubt you will learn it ever .
first of all buy the real spanish guitar .
spanish guitars , even the cheapest made toward sound , not toward look .
it is like a car that make only left turn .
listen to the actual instrument .
if you like the sound take it !
these little beat-box programs are only toys .
i was so excited about this for my little ones .
everyone in the room got sick and we had to take it outside immediately .
returning it and actually so upset about it i am writing reviews everywhere .
most seemed very favorable .
she also noticed that it won a dr. toy award .
each key had approximately 1 inch of movement in all directions .
the piano arrived broken .
one of the keys is completely inoperable .
the music rest had been broken off and is no longer functional .
do n't understand why it cuts out and comes back ?
good retailer - no issue there .
ah , but monster has a lifetime warranty , you say ?
then i requested an ra number for my address .
monster wo n't deliver to a box , only a real street address .
no , i 'd have to pay the postage .
last monster product i buy , and i told them that .
okay , but what about attracting and keeping paying customers ?
i found it while trying to find their contact and warranty info .
save some bucks and do n't pay for hype .
the magix customer support was not able to offer a solution .
the program only supports a few drives .
later plextors made in the last year are not supported .
hp drives are the only later model drives that are supported .
had to move many of the markers to the correct location .
buzz box ... .punted it .
as a professional keyboard player , i have used many sustain pedals .
many are unreliable , even the more expensive ones .
i have attempted online remedies to no effect .
it has unfortunately been too long since my original purchase to return the item .
the fc5 is not compatible with casio wk-210 .
sustained notes when not pressed .
i tried all suggestions in the reviews and nothing helped .
going to return it .
tried unplugging it and plugging it back in .
i tried literally anything but it did n't work .
does n't work with casio ctk-2400 .
the sustain does the opposite of what you want when connected .
ca n't adjust the polarity like other models out there .
it needs to be normally open .
this is not an electronic or programming issue with the keyboard .
it is simply a mechanical problem .
i 'm going to modify it by inverting the switch .
it is not worth the trouble to return it to amazon .
it is a chance i took when i purchased it .
yamaha is a good brand , but not the right pedal .
i can fix this .
wo n't work for guitar !
description does n't say that !
nicely made pedal but it is not compatible with our casio digital keyboard .
( sustains when just plugged in and stops when you press the pedal ) .
should say what brands this works with as it implies it works with all .
does n't work and seller wo n't accept a return .
i am using yamaha pedals for all my keyboards .
this one is a disappointment .
i tried all the tricks others suggested .
does n't seem to be what i needed .
read reviews which showed many , many others folks were having similar problems .
i should have read reviews first : ( very unhappy with the item
i 've just set it aside , worthless
i wish that i had known that before ordering that sustain foot pedal .
nice , solid pedal with the unfortunate lack of a physical polarity switch .
i can confirm that it functions opposite than it should ( i.e .
be advised : this sustain pedal does not have a polarity switch .
so the reverse of the sustain may happen , depending on your keyboard .
yes , i tried several online remedies , however , to now avail .
the pedal was in good shape and looked brand new .
however , the functions were reversed .
it would sustain without me pushing down on it .
was n't what i expected
i have to press the pedal down to stop .
not happy , would n't recommend it .
i wish i would have saved the box so i could 've returned it .
it holds notes a long time without it being pressed down on ,
do n't waste your time buying this .
it always was up = sustain , and down = off .
yamaha makes great stuff .
it worked great the first 2 days i had it .
but that only lasted about a week .
now the pedal does n't even work ! ! ! !
so i would just spend the extra money and buy the more exspencive pedal .
ridiculous that this is not mentioned in the product description .
sustain pedal sticks even with the screws loosened .
not compatible with my brand new korg krome !
i 'll stick with livewire pedals .
less money and compatible with all my keyboards .
would give it more stars but it quit working .
i only had it about a month or less and it stopped working .
anyone have any ideas how to fix it ?
plugged this into the yamaha ypg 235 and nothing happens .
it simply does n't work .
no sustain with pedal pressed or released .
absolutely no instructions or documentation came with the pedal .
did not work for my casio 3200
first time i ordered this sustain pedal , it did not function properly .
pressing the pedal ended the sound .
so i returned this one and got a replacement .
this really surprises me coming from yamaha .
had to return this one .
some pedals have a reverse polarity switch - this pedal does not .
just what i wanted -- works great
it 's also very bulky and does n't travel well for gigs .
works great , as good or better than the original and much less expensive
we followed instructions , but it did n't work .
had to return it back .
does not work with guitar gear , only keyboards .
this is an original yamaha product .
the foot pedal seemed to be reversed .
i 'm using this with mainstage 3 via an akai mpk249 .
the good : feels sturdy , mechanics are smooth .
i 'll have to return it and give the moog expression pedal a try .
or you may have better results with a better pedal .
positives : it 's well-made and durable .
it did n't work ! ! !
cheaply constructed- not worthy to be offered on amazon
the pedal is reversed .
did not fit keyboard .
can i still return it ?
did n't work at all
i have a casio ctk-601 and this did work in reverse .
i tried all the tricks people were saying the comments i.e .
and none of those worked .
so i ended up rewiring it by switching the two copper connections .
this ended up not working and required rotating the wiring towards the spring .
is the casio ctk-601 just not supported ?
aside from those issues the pedal itself seems of good build quality .
this pedal works the opposite of normal pedals .
it sustains when left alone , and is staccato when pressed .
it 's a very important and fairly rudimentary thing to get right .
i 'd give zero stars if it were possible .
i used it at one gig , worked fine .
it simply stopped working .
it also moves around in the floor .
i much rather prefer other kinds of pedals that feel like real piano pedals .
it may only work with a yamaha keyboard .
most foot switches have a `` normally open '' set of contact .
that is to say ; when you step on the switch the contacts close .
this foot switch is the opposite .
the sounds did n't trigger until the press was released .
so you 'd have to press , then release to get your sound .
definitely not good for that usage .
does not work - i need to return it .
not sure what is wrong with it but does not work .
i hooked this up to my novation remote sl as an expression pedal .
maybe this is how piano volume pedals are supposed to work ?
quick fade-in , and then refined motion to get the volume working ?
this is not a volume control pedal .
i bought this to use with my keyboard .
i was n't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals .
does n't have the same feel either .
i should have sent it back .
i prefer the expression volume pedal to increase volume going down not up .
i have not used it because of that reason
hands down , the m-audio is the pedal i would recommend .
it is in the box to be returned .
i bought a second one thinking that the first one was a defective fluke .
in frustration i threw them both away and bought a kurzweil .
now jump 20+ years forward .
so , i gave yamaha another chance and bought yet another fc7 .
same outcome , i.e. , it does n't work .
conclusion : do n't waste your time or your money .
spend $ 20 more and get a pedal from another manufacturer .
but that was n't the case .
this is very frustrating .
i now have to learn all my pieces using the pedal backwards .
do n't get me wrong , it sounds great .
keep that in mind if you do n't own a yamaha product .
this pedal works fine , it came standard with my yamaha dgx620 .
as i use it on carpet , it slides around way too much .
i do n't recommend this pedal for use with any casio keyboard .
it sustains every note unless the pedal is depressed .
if you buy it for a casio , expect to have to return it .
i guess i ordered the wrong one .
i have a sharper image keyboard and the pedal does not work .
thank you for the prompt service .
i ca n't rate the item because its does n't work .
i am pleased with all the other items i have purchased from you
the user 's manual is of no use and nothing seems to make sense .
there is seemingly nothing intuitive about this program at all .
perhaps once i have figured it out , i will feel differently .
but for now i am simply frustrated .
i think i was wrong .
i have downloaded trial versions of other cakewalk products and sonic foundry programs .
they seemed to work fine .
so why is this program so rotten ?
but i have tons of memory !
hopefully in time , this will change .
but i think you 're money would be better spent elsewhere .
maybe this is why cakewalk does n't have a demo version on the site .
i received my edition of home studio 2002 and it stinks ! !
the owner 's manual is terrible , it does n't explain anything .
the online help manual is n't any better .
( cakewalk will not return any merchandise once it 's open )
especially with the kodak zi8 .
this device does not work .
do not waste your money .
if a additional add-on microphone is not powered it will not work .
the genuine article can sometimes be purchased for as low as $ 35 .
despite being a fake , it does work and it is indeed stereo .
it does n't sound nearly as full as the genuine article though .
amazon should not allow the sale of this product .
does n't seem to work .
not sure what i am doing wrong .
our box also arrived taped up , with no external protective packaging .
the casio customer service number referred me to a parts replacement number .
the parts replacement number referred me to a local parts distributor .
this has been one big hassle .
it does n't work with digital piano .
however , it works fine if you touch the keys very gently .
so maybe it 's good for keyboard .
that is not true .
i got this stand with my casio wk-110 .
it was easy to assemble .
i even went so far as using an office chair to raise me up .
not all americans are 6 feet tall !
i 'm not a tall person , but neither am i a dwarf .
when set to its lowest setting , it was perfect for me .
they were missing in action as were the assembly instructions .
after assembly it was sturdy enough but assembly instructions would have been nice .
all in all a disappointing experience .
so amazon shipped this to me .
mine , thankfully , came with all the pieces .
but , in usage , it 's not too great for my keyboard .
1. the stand 's lowest height is too high for the casio px110 .
2. it 's a major pain to adjust the height .
( this annoys me the most . )
( as well as buying a bench . )
the original keyboard stand was missing a piece and had to be replaced .
the directions for assembly are visual , with very few written directions .
the good : it is cheap and it is ( fairly ) functional .
the ugly : the instructions are a joke and not at all clear .
it `` locks '' into place , and is not easily folded or adjustable .
i was not a happy camper when i discovered this .
this stand is worthless !
i finally wound up throwing the whole thing in the trash !
do n't waste your time and effort !
i would not recommend this item ... .not a very good track record .
save yourself the hassle and go by a decent stand at best buy .
this product is only approved for casio keyboards .
and only like three of those .
wish i would have known before hand !
the first one of these stands came without screws !
the second came without a leg !
yet months later it is still available here .
if you did order it , look for the screws in the screw holes .
that does n't mean they wo n't be missing half the time though .
do n't buy this stand !
i guess i should have read the reviews before purchasing .
the stand arrived via ups in very poor condition and the screws were missing .
i returned it and another was sent to me from amazon .
for the very first time , i am dissatisfied with amazon.com !
i had to repack it and return it to amazon .
what a waste of time .
no screws means it is not good .
i hope it will all be resolved by the manufacturer or amazon .
as with others the stand arrived ready to fall out of the box .
good luck if you purchase this .
we 've tried to contact casio and they do n't respond .
now i see that other people have had the same problem .
what 's up with casio ?
why did i think my order would be different ?
it was missing all the hardware except the allen wrench .
a complete waste of time and effort .
do not order this stand .
i had more faith in amazon than i should have !
after reading the bad reviews i still ordered the stand .
i got it today without any screws or plastic grippers .
i do n't even know what those are ! !
i would advise against this product .
this box came without the screws needed for assembly .
all they said was no , you are out of luck .
they do not stand behind their product .
although advertised as ad-1 i actually received ad-1ul .
the plug would not fit my casio keyboard .
i spliced in a different plug and it now works .
screen and it 's bigger without the camera and the stupid little speakers .
i should have listened to the advice from [ other customers ] .
you really ca n't hear your voice thru the speakers .
what 's the point of a karaoke if you ca n't hear your voice .
it 's just an expensive cd player .
this is going back ! !
what a ... disappointment .
have n't received it yet .
bought this cable from amazon and after two days it complitely stoped working .
verified with other cable and it was no problem at all .
thumbs down on this fender vintage volt tweed 10 ft cable .
i find it mostly disfunctional
missing pop filter and windscreen .
tried with a variety of midi devices that work with other quality cables .
this is garbage like most products on amazon , a waste of time .
cable stop working after a month , bogus cable .
seriously , stiff cables are the worst .
these things just do not last ...
it 's horible wo n't stay close with duct tape
does not work with iphone
the connector on the female end which connects to the microphone is very loose !
2 out of 2 units i bought are loose like this .
was not working correctly .
it does not fit my expectations
only the left side got recorded and was audible .
these cables are incredibly microphonic .
this item is terrible !
i hate it so much .
is n't a microphone soppose to make u louder ?
i could just hear myself talking , but not with a loud voice .
it did n't even work !
do n't buy one of these ever !
i use several microphones for recording audio training courses .
i usually use a usb connection to a laptop or desktop for recording .
two years ago , i bought this one because of it 's jack .
it now sits in a drawer in my office .
the mic had clearly been used before .
the signal cuts in and out for live and studio recording .
hardly picks up the sound through the mic input port on the laptop .
tried 2 laptops , this mic simply sucks
i 've checked my sound drivers , and not even asio4all could change anything .
mega cheap imported cables from china .
the connectors are flimsy nickle finish - will oxidize in time .
past return date : - ( so ill put it in the recycling bin .
will buy from another brand
what can i say .
just does n't work .
only 1 cable arrived .
item title says it is a pack of 10 , 3 feet cables ...
stop working after 2nd use
do n't waste you time or money , just move on ...
well you get what you pay for with this item .
i had a gift card so it was kindof a waste .
i have a computer mic that does much better .
definetly need to pay more than 18 bucks for a mic .
30 to 40 will be the better kinds .
okay , commence complete deflation of hope for this thing to work .
sometimes cheap really is just cheap .
anything is worth more than this .
there is a hum in all recordings .
not usable in my macbook pro
very good midi cable , for the price .
no lag with the data transmission .
but it took forever to be delivered .
although the cable functions , i am not happy with the quality .
i tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to .
bad quality and not what i expected
at first glance it was just what i needed .
a bit disappointed in the cable quality - it 's pretty thin .
but i figured it would work for what i needed .
seriously , wth ? ! ?
bottom line : yes , it works half-assed .
hosa makes some good products , just not this one ...
very bad xlr `` made in chaina ''
the 1-foot cable is not one foot .
they count the length of the xlr connector and strain relief .
the cable itself is only 9 '' .
trying to troubleshoot it .
not sure if its my camera or the cable .
did not work had a short was forced to purchase another .
it feels like a cheaply made product , and i really regret buying it .
condenser microphone is not compatible
i needed 12 '' of cable but only received 7 '' of cable .
its not up to 5ft ! !
apart from that it works perfectly ... . length is a real bummer tho
junk ... not shielded .
picks up every bit of interference .
do n't waste your money .
spend the money for a brand-name version .
it maight not reach the mic imput on the camera .
i mean it does on mine , but it amos do n't .
otherwise it does the work well .
added a terrible white noise due to it 's poor construction .
it 's okay but it loses connection sometimes .
couild n't get it to work at all
i 'm not getting any sound what so ever .
did n't work , sadly .
no sound came out .
tried multiple mics to no avail .
this cable will not work or do that .
will not work on sony frd-ax33 4k camera with the shotgun mic i have
its not the advertised product , its some other cable man this some bs
these short out at the end easily .
had to buy a second .
apparently this does not work .
the polarity is not the correct one for use with an dslr .
just kept anyways to see if i can use for another application .
it came in an open package not working .
it transmitted the sound adequately .
i bought this to connect my audio technica at2020 xlr to my pc .
i got it plugged it in and it is not working .
did n't work well at all .
i should 've read the reviews .
my cord was also bent and i have a lot of static .
cheap and useless never got it to worck
i purchased this cable because of the five-star rating it had .
i counted 14 places where the rubber had melted into a neighboring loop .
you get what you pay for on this product .
i connected it to my microphone when i got it to test it out .
the female end of the xlr wo n't unplug from my microphone .
it 's literally stuck .
the 1/4 jack plug is a bit narrow .
of course..i had already thrown away the packaging ... ... ... ..sigh
worked great until one channel went out after about half a dozen audio assignments .
i carry this in a backpack and it 's been treated gently .
terrible noise in wiring , sounded as if someone made this themselves .
can not use and did not send back because i threw away the package .
do not buy this cable .
there was a large amount of noise maybe from false wiring > ? ? ?
but i took apart the xlr connector and clipped the red wire .
it worked perfectly only on the left channel tho .
stay away from this product !
i am quite disappointed by this change .
making their products cheaper with harmful materials is not acceptable .
as of february 27 , 2015 , this is the picture of the package :
the product itself works .
but the item was previously opened .
the plastic casing was cut with a knife from both sides .
the other blue cable box is brand new .
i 'm certainly disappointed with this purchase .
so that 's a problem .
0/10 would not buy again .
i did n't even have to open it - it just slid out .
it was as if someone had opened it with a box cutter .
needless to saw the product did not work at all .
i went to a local guitar center and bought another .
this time it was closed and the back matched the product .
lo and behold , it worked .
save yourself the time and just go to a local guitar store .
it just does n't work .
i did n't even bother returning it .
what a waste of money .
ok , so i bought this without thinking .
a simple mic cord .
but ... it did n't work .
just flat out would n't work .
so , i sent it back for replacement and amazon delivered .
second one arrived ... and did n't work .
not only did it not work , but the package had been opened before .
think i 'll stop by radio shack or something .
can not recommend this product .
it worked reasonably well with dynamic mics , but at a much lower level .
a sennheiser wireless mic setup did not work ... just a lot of noise .
however , it is n't a universal fix .
it create too much interference with wireless connections close by .
i was disappointed in this product .
only when i used this connected did the audio turn out poor .
simply did n't work .
this was new and sealed in a plastic bubble package .
i tested it and there was n't any sound .
my mic works fine with a longer cable and 3.5mm adapter .
the only audio with this hosa cable was static .
it also seems poorly constructed with too much movement when it is connected .
i will be returning it for a refund
if you 're a pro musician , spend the money on quality cables .
i only use this maybe once a week for my home karaoke setup .
the only way this is 1 ft. is if you count the plug itself .
the cord is 9 inches , including the part wrapped in tape .
here you go have a broken wire ! ! !
i bought two of these .
not too hip on the angle either or the metal color .
they look kind of ugly .
it was n't what i was even looking for .
it sucked that the cord was only a foot long too .
one of the two cables was defective .
that 's good enough for one star .
wo n't work going from xlr mic to 1/4 inch amplifier .
the actual wire is under 8 '' long itself .
the item only works when plugged in a certain direction .
the build quality seems good but my cable was defective .
i swapped out a cable from a friend and the mic recorded just fine .
amazon processed my refund very quickly though which was great .
stopped working after one use
none of the recordings i attempted were salvageable .
i 've never had so much noise in a cable before !
my intention was to run a shotgun mic into my dslr .
the cable was the problem .
this cable was defective on arrival .
could not receive sound through this cable .
replaced this cable with another cable from another source which worked fine .
i use my canon vixia hfr20 to film a web series .
we shoot in hd and typically have good audio quality .
all i get is a hum .
so bad i may have to re-shoot and do adr putting us behind schedule .
if you touch it , it creates a hum .
do n't buy this if you are using it for any pro quality project .
i have a canon t3i and a rode nt1-a mic .
this product did not work for me .
i had to send it back .
i ordered two if these .
neither worked with my karaoke machine .
i bought a couple from a local store and they worked great .
only hear noise from the recorder .
who whould have thought a stereo mini plug to xlr adapter would have worked ?
xlr does not support stereo .
i wasted my mony on this one .
however shipping was extreamly fast ! ! ! !
went to guitar center to get an actual adapter that works fine .
this product was defective .
it looks good , but did not work .
i would n't buy them again .
stopped working after second time using .
i had minimal use on this cable and it lasted about two weeks .
initially , i was happy with this .
worked well , looked and sounded good .
i really liked the velcro wrap .
it worked time to time , so i have to return it .
ordered two of these because the price was great and the reviews were good .
one cable was d.o.a ... the other lasted a few hours .
both ended up with intermittent faults .
this sounds bit smaller than expected for this price
hope that guy ( or girl ) enjoyed their drinks .
bends easily and kinks easily
cable is good but did not last me very long .
arrived 2 days early with free shipping options ... very awesome .
no issues out of the box .
very staticky with the slightest movement .
cord seems to only intermittently conduct a signal .
received delivery november 13th .
on december 13th the cable failed becoming intermittent .
so i decided to `` take it apart '' .
it seemed to be intermittent at the right-angle connector .
i 'm kind of on the fence now about hosa cables .
purchased 4 , 1 still works .
broke after either 1 or two uses .
did not give it to my son until about 3 weeks after ordering .
it was a gift for him .
sad , sad , sad .
ddo n't waste your money on this cable brand .
i would consider other brands .
this one seemed like a good deal , so i ordered it .
i would not order this again .
quality wise , this cable is great .
heavy-duty , well made , no issues there .
it 's constantly twisting up and it 's incredibly annoying .
it looks awful when it 's all twisted all over my floor .
it 's wo n't roll up nicely at all .
if not , stick with the `` rubber '' style cables .
two stars = i do n't like it .
seriously terrible cable , but super inexpensive sooooo ... ..still bad cable .
it was really disappointing having a brand new cable work so poorly .
it was also much more lightweight than most decent cables and generally felt cheap .
the cable hisses , crackles and pops right out of the package .
save your money and buy a better cable .
i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else .
broke on the first day from normal use .
bought this years ago .
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved .
gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison .
i would recommend the gls product over the hosa product .
the cable appears well made , except for one of the ends .
disappointed by what i know should be a superb product .
i really like the look and feel of this cable .
it came in one day which was a big plus .
crack , pop , every time i moved potentially damaging my amp speaker .
both of my other goto cables seated perfectly .
i double checked to be sure .
not sure if it was a bad cable or bad design .
very sad this did n't work out .
beware of this cord .
just had to post my 2 cents worth .
shows a regular 1/4 in .
plug but is not .
they say it is 10 ft. long but was only 5 ft .
apparently harder than i thought .
it 's way too noisy on a low-level input .
`` hosa '' is a good name for it .
you get what you pay for .
i would n't waste my money on them .
also the metal sleeve around the jack keeps coming loose .
same price range as a monster cable without the monster warranty
it did not work so it is useless to me .
stopped working after light use within a month .
looks cool but lasted for only 6 months of moderate non gigging use .
i could n't tell any difference on sound .
not durable at all .
improperly grounded causing a horrible buzz unless touched .
i checked against another cable and sure enough this one is defective .
cord broke with a month of owning
worked for about a month .
plug ends unscrew easily and now any bend to the wire cuts the signal .
the cable hardly lasted a month before needing fixed .
we 've had two break .
knew i should 've gone with the fender one .
this cable lasted less then a week before it did n't work at all .
have n't even had a month and it 's already shorting out on me .
i play 3-5 hrs .
the right angle male end came completely apart .
checked warranty and it was 30 days .
utter and complete junk .
do n't make the same mistake i did .
this was in my music room , not gigging .
now it does n't make any sound at all : (
due to the failure of the product the show had to be canceled .
not only were we disappointed but all of her fans were as well .
returned it , very noisy cable .
cord was damaged upon arrival .
amp to guitar connection works perfectly with other input cables .
do not recommend this product .
i 've been very happy with hosa cables i 've purchased .
this is definitely a quality cable .
since most midi cables use english units of length , this is misleading .
so `` buyer beware '' applies here .
fulfillment was by j & r music world .
i need a pair of midi cables that are 1 foot or less . )
five stars to them for prompt no-hassle service .
i wish amazon would correct this product listing .
i ordered this cable , but it was out of stock .
i can not comment further on it since it never arrived .
once i bought it , it broke not even a month after owning it .
it worked well while it worked .
unfortunately , that was only for 6 months .
of course it 's too late to get a replacement or refund .
we 'll look for a different brand now .
suggest avoiding this one .
i works fine , but it also picks up radio signals !
you can play along with all your favorites while having this baby plugged in .
i could barely even tell my chords apart .
hardly picks up my guitar and is way too sensitive .
this broke very easily , within months .
i do not like it
did n't work out of the box .
the end connectors were loose and the cables are thin .
no sound from the guitar .
spend a few dollars and get a reputable brand .
glad i did n't bring these to a gig .
luckily i can return easily with amazon .
the sound cuts in and out while playing and occasionally has popping and hissing .
the jack fell apart and got stuck in the brand new guitar ! !
had to go buy one local.. not happy : (
time window closed to return it couple days ago .
used with teacher at our home , we do not transport it .
seller was good , product not so much .
have to constantly fiddle with cable to keep it working .
not very satisfied but it could be worse .
connections must not be very tight .
had to do surgery on both cables i bought the first day .
the sound keeps cutting off in the middle of me playing .
used a couple times and no longer sends signal
this item did not work .
the audio was very distorted and full of static
it 's not even half as good as you think it would be .
the sound output makes it seem like you 're playing from a blown speaker .
if you need to combine two signal sources , use a mixer .
within 10 min , both the mic connected to the splitter stopped working .
as soon as i plug it in it emits a loud buzzing noise .
gets louder and quieter as i move the cable around .
goes away with another cable .
do n't waste your money like i did .
sounds terrible , i could n't use em .
other cables i 've bought since sound fine with the use strat and amp .
junk fall apart in your hand
stopped working after less than 5 months of use .
you get what you pay for .
not a great cable .
what a waste of money .
wow , i 'm a bit embarrassed .
the button pushed through - was never a complete separation ( on/off ) .
a signal would still go through occasionally
it does n't work to stop hum .
ive bought 3 pcs , but it wo n't do any good for me .
it 's just a connector .
ik know that i wo n't be buying this again though
sucked right out of the box .
one side was dead .
amazon is replacing but i 'm not sure what to expect .
does n't fit any beats headset , due to oversized jack jacket .
this cable had a short upon delivery .
it was discovered by me 3 minutes into using it for the fist time .
a very thin and flimsy cable of poor quality .
i would recommend spending a few dollars more for something better .
doa - poor quality/ defective cable .
this hosa add-on item from kmc music inc is ineligible for return or refund .
it 's not worth the $ 6 .
i 've had great past success with dozens of add-on items purchased from amazon .
this hosa cable was my first dud .
this cable showed up on my doorstep and let me down right away .
these cables are poorly constructed and just not worth the money at all .
pay a little more for something that works and lasts .
plugged it in and worked once but had a horrible hissing sound .
tried it the next day and did n't work .
could not get it to work after that .
spend a few more bucks and get a better cable .
both times ive bought this item its been defective .
must be loose or faulty connections inside .
this product actually increased the amount of noise when connected to my amp .
this item is defective on arrival .
it has a short in it so only one channel works i.e .
usually this would n't be that big of a deal , right ?
kmc music inc says no returns allowed on this item .
very disappointed in this product ... not good sound .
when testing the left channel , audio played through both channels on the mixer .
when testing the right channel , i got the same result .
what does this mean ?
not an actual stereo cable .
the cable still sucks , though , so do n't buy it .
it worked fine for a few months then stopped .
i suspect the quality is poor .
i 'll have to return .
adapter did n't work at all , did n't even produce a humming noise .
very loose on my mic .
they even sent me a second one .
shabby , at least the one i got , loose connections , witch revieled
cord just stopped working !
introduce more noise : (
i bought two of these cables and both were defective .
amp hums when this cord is plugged in .
very poor quality knock-off of a real pomona banana plug .
i have less than a month with it and it is working really bad .
at the beggining it was nice , but now it 's making noise !
mine arrived yesterday and was defective .
does n't pass any sound or phantom power .
checked on 2 mics .
wanted to return but got message `` not eligible for return '' .
the cable i received had a terrible buzz from the beginning .
judging by other reviews this is the exception , rather than the rule .
i will return and replace with different cable .
very bad product only use few times
product did not work on my pc .
was not allowed to return item .
tested with multiple cables .
no audio whatsoever with this plugged-in .
do n't waste your money with this cable .
hooked up to any musical equipment it has terrible hissing .
not a good product but i guess you get what you pay for .
i will just go to the music store and purchase .
cable did n't work the very first time .
out of the box was already malfunctioning .
waste of money and time
did n't work as expected
purchased 4 of these cables and none of them work .
cable is supposed to be stereo and it 's not .
sound quality is crap .
causes audible background noise even when not playing music .
i guess you by cheap , you get cheap results .
i would not recommend this as a solution .
item did not work .
cheap cord that gave out quickly .
doesnt work for my application and is not eligible for return .
using inbetween a ipod and a amplified pa speaker .
appears to feed onlybone channel .
cable broke after two uses .
input is staticy and warped .
stay away from this cable .
noisy cable when used for musical instruments
constantly cuts in and out , making it near unusable
what can you possibly do with this other than what it is good for ?
i mean , i ca n't even use it as a paper weight !
cables do not connect effective enough to give a great sound .
this cord stopped working within a month of purchase .
given the good reviews , i expected more .
fairly flimsy , skinny gauge .
the connectors unscrew very easily so need to be checked before use every time .
do n't buy , no return policy .
did n't work still humming soind .
do n't waste your time/money .
yewim giving two stars not for bad product but for not being what i needed
the first cable i received would n't transmit vocals properly .
the next cable i received had the same issue .
time to try something else .
unfortunately this switch creates a large pop when switch on or off .
it would have only added a very small margin to have done this right .
i chose to return it .
did n't work when i received it .
only received 1 of the 2 i ordered
not very well made .
i had to buy another within a month .
waste of $ 10 .
the xlr connection does n't work properly .
lots of crackling sounds .
i 'm a pro-cheapo and i hated this thing .
they 're noisy , and the cables feel really cheap , gummy-like .
drop few more bucks and get something else !
it worked and then fell apart within a week .
and at this point it is not eligible for return .
a lot of static and overall shielding is not up to spec
did not work at all
does n't work properly .
do n't waste your money .
i am a little disappointed with this cable .
i do n't recommend using this cable for control voltage connections .
does n't seem to work..maybe a defect or poorly made ?
plugged it in and the hum was worse than without it .
two thumbs straight down !
it has lots of feedback in the sound .
port of a guitar amp .
i do n't know what cord to get .
i must have misread some of the reviews .
i understood that this would work .
the jack broke after less than a month of light home use .
this cable does not work .
however , this cable does not work .
another cable , purchased elsewhere , works fine for all configurations .
package was broken on arrival .
i am constantly having noise issues as this wire does not have enough shielding .
would not recommend this product to anyone .
within a month of having this cable ?
worked in the beginning though .
bummer to post a bad review but that 's what happened .
thats what you get for buying low priced cables
there is no sound that comes out .
in short , this cable is super shit .
i do not like it .
only outputs one channel .
this is not a true stereo cable .
it has all appearances to be one , however it is not .
it plugs into the stereo mini-jack port and a standard 1/4 '' plug .
( which is why i purchased it in the first place . )
what a waste of time and money !
how about the entire right channel going into my mixer .
i have other cables that split left and right and can tell the difference .
what a load of garbage .
this will be returned immediately .
not doing this again !
anybody out there that can tell me why these did n't work ?
and also , it was so tight and difficult to dislodge .
the product did not work .
no signal was not being sent .
both had at least one defective connection .
i wo n't be ordering more .
edit : i bought two more after the success of the first .
one did n't work at all .
i 'm done buying cheap cables .
works like it should .
it only lasted a week and i did n't move it around .
the sound kept cutting out and yet it was stationary .
this cable is pretty awful .
only works if you do n't ompletely inert into amp .
i tried 4 cords and the same problem .
if not you will not get any words .
i would not recommend this item .
the hosa cable i received broke after one use .
i did not stress or abuse it .
the wire broke just next to where it was soldered to the lug .
i would not expect this to happen so early in use .
you get for what you pay .
worked a short time .
this cord lasted exactly one use .
this cable lasted only 6 months .
it was never abused and only played at home .
buying a decent cable is tough
the cable was no good did not even work
ordered one , it did not work .
returned for replacement , it also does not work .
i know why it 's so cheap now .
threw it in the trash that moment !
do n't waste your money on this thing .
unfortunate this did n't work for me .
i bought one from radio shack and it works great .
no idea why this one did not work .
this is a poor quality product that is n't well constructed .
typically , i find cheaper cords ( usb , hdmi , etc . )
a cord should never break on its first use .
maybe i got a cord from a bad batch or something .
either way , you should be aware of this problem .
i 'm very disappointed .
i did n't expect this cable to be so thin .
it 's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable i 've used .
not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference .
still , it works and was inexpensive .
edit : 6 months later and it 's dead already .
wire frayed at the right angle jack .
you get what you pay for .
ordered one of these cables and it 's defective right out of the box .
probably not worth the trouble returning it .
if i had the means to rate this lower , i would .
some items actually produced no output at all !
can not caution people considering this item enough to reconsider their options .
awesome idea , broke within a week : (
very crackly and a lot of interference .
stopped using it and company wo n't accept the return .
hums too noisy ... ...
please spend an extra couple dollars and get it from somewhere else .
junk did n't do a thing
i 'll just go down to radio shack and get the item .
the one i have from them works .
it 's likely me fault because i do n't understand sound systems .
tried a different adapter and it worked fine .
i ' l ; use this one as a backup .
not worth returning for 7 bucks but i did pay 10 for overnight shipping .
throw it in the trash and forget about it .
so i ordered the right adapter for my purposes .
the rubber seems to be not connected too well to the 'metal ' part .
it might be good , but i do n't want to find out .
might be good for simple connecting , but i do n't know
somehow they seemed to create a hum .
maybe it was my system .
but it is fine without them .
bought this cable for my stereo .
highly recommend buying another product if you are looking for high quality .
this item was shipped to me as an open package .
there is no way of knowing if this is a hosa .
i thought this was being shipped by amazon , but was not .
i would never order from them again .
i tried it in other ports and the result was the same .
not a big investment , but definitely a waste of money .
thankfully it was only $ 5
broke it 's tip into the jack .
had to replace the whole port .
i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs .
none of them work .
perhaps i got the wrong thing ?
sad , i need cut the hum generate by the bass
would n't work for me at all
do n't buy this .
you get what you paid for .
unless you want to damaged your expensive equipment .
the contact pin broke before i could finish hooking it up .
i suggest spending the extra money to buy higher quality adapters .
this adapter did not work .
do not work as good or as clear as i expected .
after three months the switch pushed into the unit and no longer functioned .
i 'm going back to a cable with a switch .
they last much longer .
these cables are terrible .
they attenuate the signal .
it comes through much quieter and muddy sounding .
the same thing happens with the hosa cmp-303 cable .
the adapter inserts noise to the sounds , and also atenuates the signal .
i do not recommend this adapter .
i 'd recommend against this unless you have no other alternative .
does not send stereo signal through , only mono .
not a great product if you are professionally trying to split a signal
sent it back , it did n't suit my purposes .
its not useful for my guitar
..pc ; fl sounds like distant echo .
is not clear or loud thru that cable at all .
a waist of my $ $ $ .
final soulition was a device called hum-x .
everything needed to be pluged into it and cable tv needs a lift also .
i canot use it .
it brake the fist time i try to use it .
very bad quality indeed .
new amp , same issues with cables .
so went down and bought a 3rd cable and everything now works perfectly .
sorry for the low rating , but it is , what it is .
thanks for your timely delivery .
used this to connect my instrument mic to an lr baggs preamp .
the mono has one .
as with anything you should immediately test when received .
the two new ones were as well defective.. m bellas
also no worries about extending the mic or cable run with this long switch .
gave up the ghost after a few weeks .
ok for light use , probably not worth the buy .
do not buy it !
wish i had looked at negative reviews before purchase .
unfortunately i waited too long to use so too late to send back .
you hear it with nothing else plugged into the cable .
my audio friend tells me that this happens because the cable is n't balanced .
i do not recommend this cable to anyone .
this is an absolutely terrible wire !
i do n't understand these other reviews that were good ! ! !
please do not make this mistake ! !
distorts audio through headphone and mixer .
created static in the mics and could n't use these .
the cable only provides the instrumental and no vocals for me .
my guess is it is a faulty cord .
excellent splitter , 5 stars !
the cable i received was unusable .
it sounds very distorted when i plug it into my mixer .
i just tossed it .
did not work well at all .
the cable must be defective because it only produced sound on one channel .
used it to plug in my laptop to pa system .
sound quality was horrible .
it 's not stereo therefor it 's garbage
this cable is not good for applications that require shielding .
the noise on the cable is at an unacceptable level .
this happened to me twice .
i bought this to hook up a metronome to an amp .
after three short months it already stopped working .
i bought 12 , and about 4 of them worked at all .
i bought this able to go from my laptop to a headphone amp .
the tip of mine is gone .
i have no idea what happened to it .
i have never seen this kind of damage in an audio plug .
causes horrible noise and distortion .
not happy at all .
this makes the 5th and the last hosa i will ever buy
the result was unpleasant .
overly long but i should have known .
very weak cable it broke after a couple of uses with my silent violin ,
the wire did not work properly .
there was a lot of background noise , not good clean sound .
i do n't think it was due to my components
not a very good sound
useless mic that have no on/off switch .
dont waste your money on it .
the pick up way too much sound around them .
does not work , possibly defective .
tried with multiple speakers/sources .
i would not recommend buying this cord .
this is the third time i 've ordered this cable .
the third one was messed up from the beginning .
one of the xlr male connectors was bent inside the metal housing .
the packaging was fine .
always test you cables before you have to use them .
i did n't and it cost me .
these mic are not that great .
yes , but the noise makes the quality just bad simply .
do n't even bother .
i was very happy with the samson r21 they work great .
we 're is the chargers what do i need to turn them on .
no cords came with it .
if i ca n't get them i must return them .
do n't know what i need to get them to work .
a plug or a charger ?
i love the sound of these microphones .
the bases are good solid metal and connect well .
it is cheap two piece plastic that has been glued at the rib .
all three of mine have broken at the same location .
these mics get the job done .
but they do well enough .
i purchased this last year for a permanent install on a church soundboard .
it started getting really scratchy and finally quit a few weeks ago .
it 's a stereo cable so that should n't be .
maybe i just got a dud cable .
was product tested at factory before shipping ?
out of the pack half the cables were noisy and did not work .
save your money and by some metal end cables .
a waste of time and money .
seriously , do n't buy 'em .
two failed the first night .
i threw them all away .
not great shielding around the center core , i guess .
other patch cables i have reduce noise significantly more than this cable .
not sure why but this broke not even a month after i bought it
it crackled any time anything touched it or it moved at all .
however these things do n't last at all .
belive me when i say it does not pay to be cheep .
they come apart , leaving the tips inside my pedals ' jacks .
i am not rough with my gear and my pedals sit in one spot .
on some of them the tips will easily pull off by hand .
my son opened this toy on christmas morning .
but i gave it a shot anyway .
this guitar is made to be bought not played .
the problem is the height of the zero fret .
it looks nice , but no child can learn to play on this guitar .
save up and get one that can be tuned .
we also had a string break with what seemed not extraordinary tension .
the tuning fork screws are miniscule and will not hold long .
that , will quickly render the guitar playless .
i would definitely recommend chosing another guitar over this one .
you get what you pay for !
i purchased this for my 9 year old son for christmas .
luckily , i took it out and inspected it while he was n't home .
after twisting the middle string 2x it broke .
i am very disappointed and will be sending it back .
i 'm just glad i looked at it before christmas morning .
i think the midi and the audio part need to be separated more .
i ca n't get any sound to come through my speakers !
came without a lavalier mic .
so i purchased atr33501s but not wireless ,
this system is horrible .
do n't dare waste your time or money .
works okay some of the time .
bad background noise - tried everything to reduce with no luck .
the unit did not come with the small lapel mic .
jack for the mic has poor connection .
no audio goes through .
i had to jimmy it half way out of the jack to get audio .
this is my fault .
i am a little disappointed , but this is a lesson for me .
next time i will check to make sure everything is there .
previous reviews did not do the correct justice to the item sold .
i do not believe this mic is good .
i was n't expecting great either for the record .
there is a lot of background noise in all of my recordings .
it is like this mic amplifies the dead air and creates static .
does not work well if you use florescent studio lighting .
sometime buzzes if the wearer moves around which is also pretty poor .
i am considering returning it .
i am in the process of returning this item .
i tried different batteries and no luck .
this product is terrible , i would n't waste my money on it .
after reading lots of great reviews i thought i would give this a try .
we had lots of problems with noise when moving around inside our house .
and this did n't help much .
try both frequencies and had the same results either way .
which is too bad , as i generally like at equipment .
not what i was hoping for .
this is the first review i 've ever written on amazon .
i am filming a documentary .
i will return the device , and will simply use wired lavalier mikes instead .
if you absolutely must use a wireless system , do n't use this one .
i do n't recommend this microphone system .
amazon , as normal , was quick to get me replacement .
i received that today .
only static and buzzing !
the mic did n't work .
i tried the switch , read the manual .
spend the little extra cash and get something worth it .
still , amazon rocks for their fast replacement !
does n't matter if i use their mic or my stereo lapel mike .
there was immediate interference when testing the unit in the comfort of my home .
i mived to two ther rooms and the interference was just as bad .
you get what you pay for .
ouch , this wireless system caused all kinds of hiss .
the downside is that the nady has to be plugged into the wall .
i was using the atr-288w with a canon hv40 video camera ,
it did n't pick up the voice when placed on the lapel at all .
it also caused terrible feedback .
i sent it back .
( within projected time of arrival ) .
i contacted amazon and was able to return the unit hassle free .
there are a few problems that i 've encountered with this unit .
first off , the handheld mic is useless .
the windscreen on the clip-on mic comes off very easily .
it can be staticy at times , even in close proximity .
this is also an outdated produt .
if you have the money , spend it on a sennheiser setup instead .
it was if the needle was crooked and not making contact .
now will have to pay extra and take it to a repair shop .
i guess you get what you pay for .
i got this when i was a kid and did n't know any better .
it worked fine for two records but then started a scratching sound .
not what i expected , at least for my yamaha turntable .
broke on me after just about 3 months of use .
started weighing down heavily and then the plastic piece eventually touched the lps .
this `` universal '' replacement cartridge is not universal .
it does not work as a replacement for an audio-technica ls200 .
it 's too heavy , and it 's too tall/deep .
i had to replace it immediately because it was destroying my vinyl .
received at92ecd replacement in two days after i ordered it .
the replacement works like a charm .
i purchased this cartridge to replace the broken stock cartridge on my jensen jta-230 .
i have messed with everything and it simply does n't fit .
what 's the deal with that ?
this one just simply did not work for me .
the stylus rides up and the housing drags across my records
broke as i tried to install .
not recommended for half-inch standard mounts .
the adapter caused the cartridge to bottom out on my records .
it did not work for my p 31 yamaha turntable .
not at all universal .
music sounds flat with no improvement over the older original technics cartridge it replaced .
are p mount cartridges inferior to standard mount cartridges ?
this one is way inferior .
do n't like it much .
this cartridge sounded like garbage from the moment i installed it .
i kept hoping it would improve , but it did n't .
i 've never bought a cartridge before that produced so much static and noise .
but not for good live recorded audio quality music .
i returned it for a full refund .
does not work on the gopro 4 silver - do n't waste your money !
not what i expected .
does not work on most american devices , iphone , laptops ect ect
better of without it .
it is big and heavy .
my window of return is past date .
clip does not seem durable .
the cord is not long enough .
basically made the sound more quiet .
the needle was wobbling side to side , causing a thumping sound and static .
i got this as an external mic for my dslt a57 .
the camera has plug-in power so it should power the mic just fine .
its wobbly and will break sooner than later .
the sound is n't very good .
not for the money .
it picks up high mids and highs well , but no low end .
and it picks up way too much background noise .
just an fyi if you 're looking to capture people speaking .
i chose this rating because of quality reasons .
i do n't recommend this product to anyone under any circumstance .
spend a little more money and get a better mic !
this one does n't do what its supposed to do !
i bought this item to go with a z10 touch video .
i bought it new .
i got worse sound than if i used the camera without it .
now i 'm stuck with a defective product .
what a waste of resources ! !
this item is well reviewed , but my two separate mics were awful ? !
unusually , great buyer reviews can be trusted at amazom .
perhaps amazon has a bad batch , or a counterfeit batch of these mics ?
i do n't know ?
i would not pay a dollar for this item .
my other plug-in mic from a local store works just fine .
unfortunately , i had to eat the cost of this item .
there is a short window for returns .
i ordered three books for travel , with guaranteed arrival before my trip .
the books arrived after i left on my trip .
i was not home to return the books in the allotted return time .
does amazon suck ... yeh , sometimes they really suck .
can they deliver and get things done right , yes they usually do .
but amazon will never be a preferred purchase point for me .
i will go local if i have the time .
i use amazon for convenience ... and keep my fingers crossed .
it was all plastic and the assembly was so loose .
the neck can be bent 90 , but the whole structure was so weak .
i recorded someone talking with the zi8 as a test .
first with the sony mic and then without it .
first with mic sensitivity levels at normal and then again at max .
was really surprised to hear all the positive reviews with the zi8 .
the microphone picks up a tremendous amount of noise from touching the cord .
bought this to use with zi8 and it worked great for about 2 months .
reseller has a 30 return policy and sony 's is only 90 days .
very disappointed this did n't last .
the gnd is shorted the white wire on the right mic .
this ca n't be correct ?
wish i had a schematic of this board .
it 's not better than the original mic on micro boss br .
it 's broken after 3 months and warranty is only for 90 days .
especially with the kodak zi8 .
this device does not work .
do not waste your money .
if a additional add-on microphone is not powered it will not work .
i have received the fake item !
the quality just sucks !
i am very disappointed !
i purchased this microphone to go with a kodak zi8 hd camera i bought .
one channel of the stereo mic was dead .
i tried a different stereo mic on the camera and it worked fine .
i got no response .
i contacted the seller three times and there is still no response .
the one channel that works sounds great .
amazon has to watch out their partners .
there are many trying to fish in rough waters .
not at all what i expected .
it does but it will not stay in position to record properly .
the microphone will now remain stationary while in use and is still removable .
this item is not designed for the kodak zi8 .
second , it does n't capture much more audio than the stock kodak microphone .
not a big improvement .
it 's not worth the money !
was not a true stereo mic .
not the real sony ecm-ds70p electret condenser stereo microphone .
i bought two and both are going back immediately .
the record stuck , which had n't happened before .
amazon was gracious about returning my $ $ for this purchase .
worked for the first five records , then it wore out and got fuzzy .
and i was n't rough on it either .
it sounded okay for the first five records .
then it wore out and sounded fuzzy .
and no , i was n't being rough on it .
also the lower hertz ( lower pitches or bass ) are not very audible .
the playback does n't have a good sound in the lower ranges .
i have yet to find one .
in short , do n't buy this mic if you want to record music .
save your money i wish i had .
i plugged this into my computer and pressed record .
when i played back the audio i could barely hear anyone .
i have been continually dissapointed with omni-directional microphones .
i tried this microphone out and it really was n't worth the money .
it recorded with less clarity than uni-directional microphones .
i 'm sending mine back .
i was using tools such as camtasia and audacity .
the mics did not pick up enough of the conversation to be useful .
i purchased a more expensive sony ecm-f01 and it works as described - great !
so i am stuck with two mics that do n't perform .
this mic is surprisingly poor quality for a brand name like audio-technica .
i bought this mic with the intention to use it in an interview .
the microphone built into your mac is likely far superior .
i 'm returning this product .
tried these for about 2 minutes , then boxed them up .
not comfortable at all .
do n't waste your time ordering these .
flimsy you get what you pay for
these are not open-back headphones !
the earpads are smaller then usual , but they pretty well seal your ears .
nor are they sound-cancelling - they just make everything from the outside murkier .
and they have no top end at all - was my pair defective ?
at least they gave me a refund .
come on - even house music has some upper end !
the wire on the headphones got snagged on my shoe and the wire broke .
i got to use it for 3 hours .
did n't last longer than a few months .
this came in my school kit for film and media .
the sound was okay when it was working .
they were completely unusable after that .
i posted pictures so you know what i am talking about .
a quality product , but it has too little low end bass .
i use them to edit soundtracks on home videos and animations .
if you are a chart changer get it right with one of these .
i guess shure sold their name at some point .
disappointed for the price , that is for sure .
name brand price gouging , shame on you shure .
this contraption is inaccurate .
product arrived in a plastic bag with no packaging and no battery .
shameful , cheap and poorly made product .
broke within 15 minutes of use .
inexpensive , but very poor quality !
this does not work with the three different brand smart phones i tried .
put in new batteries , and there was no change in performance .
i looked it up on audio-technica .
this item was discontinued years ago .
you get what you pay for ... . it 's adequate for basic audio .
not pro quality for sure .
i specifically purchased this for use with iphone .
the jack is simply incompatible with aple devices .
it only has one ring where the apple jacks have four .
this was most disappointing .
i do n't normally leave negative review , but this one is necessary .
i purchased this microphone because of all of the glowing reviews .
however , this microphone is extremely poor quality .
my sound is much better without it .
we ordered this microphone for the pastor in our wedding .
the package was returned to them about 3 weeks ago and they lost it .
i rated a 1 star because 0 stars is not an option .
i would strongly suggest not ordering from this company
read the reviews - i am not the only person this has happened to !
this microphone will pick up voices fine .
you get what you pay for .
i did n't get the 35s .
ask if i 'd like a substitution next time !
bought it to plug into my zoom h2 and it barely picks up anything .
tried plugging it straight into my camera and yet again barely picks up anything .
low quality and waste of money .
this second one was actually model atr-3350 , *not* a model 35s .
so i 'm returning my 3350 for a refund .
anyway , 1 star for this go-around .
the sound playback comes out of one speaker in mono , not stereo .
looking for another mic now .
i bought this to improve the sound for recordings on a kodak zi8 .
first , the battery was dead when it was shipped - hassle .
so for my use , this microphone was a wasted purchase .
audible hum obscures subject 's voice .
disappointing offering from good company .
i tried this mic and it was terrible .
save your money , do n't buy this product .
i wish i could give it half of a star .
very disappointed with this mic after reading so many positive reviews .
very disappointed with performance of this product .
this could be an error on my part .
but i could n't figure out how to use this thing accurately .
or maybe it 's something i just did n't need .
i have a rega rp-1 that came shipped with the ortofon om 5e .
better instructions from shure would 've helped .
despite its cute appearance , this mic produces static and little else .
and more nothing ! ! !
did not work properly on my pc .
amazon 's customer service was excellent ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i plugged it into the microphone jack and nothing happened .
i returned it and got a griffin mic instead .
i do a fair amount of streaming video for marketing and training purposes .
i thought it was stainless ( non magnetic ) , but its not .
this contraption is highly specialized dj , turntable apparatus .
do not buy unless you have used this before .
this stylus gauge is made of plated steel which is magnetic .
it is attracted to the cartridge magnet and therefore useless .
i returned it immediately .
unfortunately , the only alternatives are much more expensive digital stylus gauges .
bla bla bla all talk .
there is absolutely no bass .
i 'll give it extremely clear , , but that 's all .
no bottom end no matter what you do to eq it .
even the shure 58 is better , but no prize either .
i bought this microphone to use with skype and a set of bose headphones .
some other reviews also mention the faint sound .
i just did not see them before purchasing the unit .
as you might guess , the quality does n't get any better .
i 'm in the midst of scrambling to find a new mic now .
thanks for nothing audio-technica .
i ordered a genuine shure stylus but received a generic shure stylus .
what else do you want ? '
it does what it claims to do , and it does it well .
this thing now has a buzz that totally obscures the voices .
this developed after only a month .
ca n't change the stars , unfortunately , hope you read this .
even for the price this mic may not be worth it .
the mic could barely pick up anything .
was used just once and then stopped working .
had to return it .
recording in imovie hd is nearly inaudible .
i purchased this mic to for video taping interviews .
if you need to get a decent recording look at the shure sm58 .
i bought this product for adding voice recordings to powerpoint presentations .
unfortunately the voice can barely be heard .
when they describe this product `` ideal aerobics/dance/sports-instructors '' they must really mean it .
all audio settings on my computer are all the way up .
i 've been doing sound for 10 years .
each has its own faults .
very muddy sounding , but will add more `` body '' to your sound .
shure : cold-sounding mic , highs better than senns , some mid-range muddiness .
akg : overall nice sounding mic .
problem when you `` push '' the mic , i.e .
mic feels like it has a delay in it .
audix : very nice sounding mic .
no major sonic problems .
nice , extended highs .
these are pretty good , if you can find one that is n't defective .
this is the second one i 've bought that arrived with a twisted cantilever .
does n't anyone inspect these before they leave the factory ?
when i lowered the volume on the amplifier , then nothing was being accomplished .
bought it on april 10th .
( one channel is not working ) .
unfortunately , the return period expired 2 weeks ago .
generic needle without branding not in accordance with the picture - sound just acceptable .
i hope that my vinyls will not be damaged !
not a cartridge , is only a generic needle .
pic contains a cartridge .
the description is about cartridge .
the comparison thing in the page is all cartridges .
but , is not a cartridge , is only a generic needle .
pic contains a cartridge .
the comparison thing in the page is all cartridges .
i feel intentionally mislead .
the one that i got sounded horrible .
it had a lot of distortion .
you get what you pay for .
i returned my set .
way more expensive but the audio quality was pristine .
this is a fairly cheap set so you 'll get fairly poor audio .
bite the bullet and save for the higher quality set .
i ordered this product because of the good reviews it got .
i am getting horrible hiss regardless of range .
i may just have to use a voice recorder and sync the sound .
yes , a voice recorder is giving me cleaner audio than this mic .
i should have gone straight for a uhf mic .
a waste of money .
bad purchased , not doing it again .
high pitch squeal on channel b. audio unusable .
poor quality , interference , noise , awful recording .
not very happy with it .
-it picks up noise easily .
changing channel did not really help .
-white noise all the time .
i would not recommend it .
tried using it in a studio in la and i had nothing but interference .
good sound costs money but then , good sound equipment can last a lifetime .
i will return and try something diffrent .
these would not work in any city i visited , there was constant static .
this 'thing ' is terrible !
it loses reception and statics like crazy .
however both cut out after 25 ' .
they work , but they also do n't work .
second - it 's awful .
plus , i need a wireless mic to film yoga videos .
the feedback on this thing is horrible .
maybe i just got sold a returned lemon .
either way do not waste your money !
it 's not worth the hassle .
if anyone has suggestions , please let me know .
total waste of money .
for the same cost i would recommend an h1 + low cost wired lav .
the sound quality was terrible .
i tried change channels , move around and the noise did n't disapear .
there were also some blind zones and cut offs .
so i returned the unit .
otherwise , think ten foot pole .
a very disappointing product .
and no , brand new batteries did n't fix it either .
i wish audio technica had the same ethics .
i 've paid good money for a bad product .
do n't do the same , dear reader .
we thought we must have broken it somehow and bought the exact one again .
after four months , the same problem occurred , no reason again .
these microphones are not reliable at all .
this system works but there is a constant static when its turned on .
for professionals this is definitely a bad choice and not worth the risk .
i read all the reviews before i bought and decided to try my luck .
even with short distance 3 feet , i got tons of noise .
not useful to record to a camcorder ,
this dual channel wireless device is contently picking up static and interference .
i have not been happy with this purchase .
unless your subject is very close , you 'll get static .
obviously the taiwanese children who assembled this did n't know that .
i would advise you to not buy this .
the price is too good to be true .
great return service from amazon though .
it sounds like being on cordless phone a little out of range .
for the price , i unfortunately do n't think there 's any better option .
this just is n't an option for me anymore .
i now have to rent an $ 800 lav system when i shoot
not thrilled w noise .
lots of static and absolutely unreliable .
if you are a serious video pro , avoid this system .
this microphone emits constant static no matter how it is configured .
engineering support could not help me .
i am sending the unit back .
to the buyer , i say 'beware ' .
the audio is full of noise at times for seemingly no reason .
at first the groom was at the other end of the big church .
this wireless mic system does n't provide that with any amount of reliability .
what 's this conspiracy suppressing high quality , wireless microphone technology .
why ca n't we get such achievements in wireless audio ?
or even wired audio for that matter .
it should n't cost an arm and a leg to buy goood audio equipment .
i can not recommend this product .
however , i do n't have a quality low cost alternative to recommend either .
i wish i had n't .
i began to pickup static that switching between the two channels did n't change .
and again , changing frequencies did n't help at all .
perhaps this is the nature of an fm system vs. a uhf system .
of course it does n't always do this .
and when it works , it is great .
but its range and susceptability to interference is a big drawback .
do n't be fooled by false advertising .
the picture shows a shure logo .
what you get is a copy fake replica with no bard on it .
do n't be fooled by false advertising .
the picture shows a shure .
what you get is a poor quality copy that sounds like s___ .
it seems this mic needs a preamp to work fine .
but i have none here to try it .
the sound that this mic picks up is terrible !
the mic in the camera could pick up sound louder and further away .
do not buy this !
then , the mic was stored for about a year and a half .
a fresh alcaline battery was used in each test .
basically , i 'm now stuck with an out-of-warranty piece of trash .
bye bye , $ 25 ( at least it was that cheap !
bought one 18 years ago for $ 50 & 7.25 % sales tax !
wide frequency response compared to most consumer microphones .
it is not omnidirectional .
it 's a figure 8 with slight attenuation in front & behind .
you would n't use it for clear sound straight ahead .
the included plastic clamp disintegrated long ago .
the bolt-on cable quickly wore out .
also , the battery contact is weak & glitches .
half of the microphone length is the battery & 1/8 '' minijack .
it may eventually be ground off in favor of home made phantom power .
i purchased this to be used on my sony trv-320 which is stereo capable .
barely a faint sound was recorded .
thought uploading to the pc to my video editor might enable volume change .
tried simply speaking directly into the mike - nothing .
either i had a bad unit , or there are compatibility issues .
i returned it today and will continue to look for another solution .
i have to be honest i went for the price and was disappointed .
the microphone has lots of features and accessories but did not work for me .
the microphone had a loud hum with the playback .
i found it unacceptable for my purposes .
my microphone produced more hiss than sound .
owners manual was missing and there was no plastic bags either .
it appears to be used .
i guess mine was a returned unit !
of course , i did a return ... beware , you may get it !
ordering and shipping was great through amazon .
when i received it , i tested it with my mp3 recorder .
the resulting level was enough to hear .
yesterday i tried it out recording the children 's christmas pagent at church .
however , there were two things that made me decide to return it .
it even picked up the motor noise that the internal mic does not .
the second is that it is highly susceptible to electrical interference .
this microphone did n't work , and i returned it .
all you could hear was static .
my $ 3 microphone works better .
ok , my disappointment partly has myself to blame .
i wanted to make the sound recording part of my videos more professional-sounding .
as you can imagine , this is not what i wanted at all .
-- overpowering the subject 's voice .
the mic 's construction is really cheap and flimsy .
it 's very crudely made .
used as a computer microphone , the audio is also very quiet .
kind of disappointing since i paid almost $ 30 for it .
also , for the record , this is not stereo .
unfortunately , i could n't get the device to work properly .
the normal mode did n't seem to work at all .
do n't waste your money ! ! ! !
i 'm sure your internal mic would be better than this mic .
it is painfully difficult to use .
the amplitude produced by the mike is very low .
i 've had this mic for almost two years .
in that time it has only left my home occasionally .
it 's never been abused in any way .
today i went to use it and it was simply dead .
i tried a fresh battery and nothing .
shame on audio technica for putting this piece of junk on the market .
my how times have changed .
it gets two stars simply because it sounded good when it did work .
a waste of [ ... ] bucks !
a non-condensor mic performs better than this thing .
on the good side , it looks pretty with the wind shield on it .
cons : -this microphone will pick up camera noise if mounted on the camera .
-not a professional level mic , by any means .
the mic built into your prosumer ( not consumer ) camera probably works better .
pros : -slightly more directional than my camera 's microphone .
you 'll need an extra long cable , of course .
buy a different , more reliable brand .
i used my atr 55 for about 8 weeks and it worked fine .
then it developed a hissing noise .
tried new batteries and it did n't work .
it is even worse on the `` tele '' setting !
it totally ruined one of my productions !
what is up with his mic ?
do they all go bad like this ?
does anyone know how it can be fixed ?
at first i loved this mic now i think it is garbage !
typically , they do n't state this in the tech specs .
and the single channel sound is not that great do n't buy it .
-a waste of money .
device was on , used 2 different new batteries ... nothing .
this is a good product for the price tag .
it does the job ... one thing !
other than that , it 's decent .
i purchased and quickly sold two atr-55 's .
i would not purchase these under any circumstance .
otherwise you would n't hear a thing .
also a lot of noise was present .
i contacted customer service , but never got any answer .
too bad that a company like audio technica allows for such a bad quality .
it 's now may , and all but two have failed .
azden makes a similar microphone for a few more dollars .
so far , so good .
i did identical tests with this mic , and with my camcorder 's mic .
i guess you get what you pay for .
well , i did considerable research for comparable low-budget microphones .
i performed a few mic .
tests to create a standard for evaluation .
i filmed six scenes .
i used imovie to import my recordings to evaluate the audio .
for this review i tested my on-board stock mic. , a radioshack lavaliere mic .
and the audio technica mic .
my results are as follows : i. out-of-the-box standard mic .
: performs with mediocre results , less than desired by current.tv standards .
is expected to perform and produces a somewhat muffled sound .
: disappointing sound quality .
for $ 53 i expected this mic .
to improve upon my equipment 's stock microphone ; it did not .
the regular setting was just as loud and clear as the stock mic .
but it also delivered a softer audio recording .
overall it was difficult to distinguish between this mic .
and the on-board mic .
; and certainly not worth the extra duckets .
radioshack lavaliere mic : the audio was significantly enhanced .
down-side : this mic .
do n't forget to switch the mic .
on ; this one also requires a stereo adapter .
i was hoping this audio technica mic .
would provide an increase in performance worth the additional cost .
the lesson i learned is that it is all or nothing .
shell out $ 200 for a pro/pro-sumer grade mic .
or get by with what you have .
you can improve your situation with a lav .
but so far i have not discovered a budget shotgun mic .
additionally my credit card was charged twice .
i need for your to correct that .
i have instructed my credit card company to collect the $ 21.98 extra charge .
will review performance when we 've had a chance to use it .
the azden wlx-pro system is not really very good .
you get basically two choices for channel , that 's it .
can you hear the voices with it ?
it does have a headphone output , which is good .
however , the belt clip is very cheap and can break pretty easily .
the antenna does n't appear to do anything either .
in addition , does not work well like other more expensive microphones .
beware , there is also no attachment included for the clip-on mic .
this needs to be purchased separately .
terrible advertising ... you want quality , look elsewhere .
the audio was very distorted and there is no way to adjust the gain .
i 've had this for 2 years now .
it makes no difference if i 'm right next to the receiver or now .
you 're basically playing audio russian roulette with your audio with this .
do not use this for professional recordings !
i 'm now trying to find a new wireless system .
i used this for pranks it was good when it was new but now s***ty
very low quality for the price .
additional parts needed to make this work .
for true beginners only .
the microphone itself is very subpar and sounds a bit muddy .
not suitable for recording professional audio .
i 'm very careful with my wires and how i keep everything stored .
i would n't order these again .
i would not recommend this product to anyone .
friends of mine have this and are ok with it .
i do not recommend this .
i purchased this item for use in filming instructional videos for work .
at times it has great difficulty overcoming interference .
but , sometimes even further away from these units it struggles .
no difference between the sound quality and the internal microphone .
i 'm disappointed that amazon would offer this product .
they work , but thats almost the only positive thing .
i do n't recommend this for any kind of production .
sound quality is s*** .
the earplug thing for monitoring is either very quiet or doesnt work at all .
i bought this unit to use for recording videos for my business .
other than sound quality i have no complaint .
there is way too much hiss , i expected no hiss for this price .
i would recommend one with an xlr conector .
i purchased two of these `` pro '' wireless lav mic systems .
i turned on both transmitter and receiver and chose f1 as the channel .
i moved it to f2 frequency , and it seemed to clear up .
i then turned on the 2nd transmitter and receiver and chose f1 frequency .
i had someone walk around with that one .
same thing , hissing and drop outs .
to my surprise it was still hissy and dropping out .
i was going to get overall broad shots and get audio of the ceremony .
omg , how embarrassing .
i am a musician and performer .
i am not thrilled with the construction .
do yourself a favor .
i will update this as soon as i get results of testing .
this mic should be more like $ 50 max .
the range is terrible .
i ca n't count how many times this product has failed me .
i have a pair of azden shotgun microphones which work well .
this mic however is barely adequate for amateurs just having fun .
when you open the box , you are greeted with wm-pros not wlx-pros .
it 's printed right on the modules !
transmitter range is awful !
mic is tinny and cheap sounding .
high pitched buzzing noise , regardless of channel 1 or 2 !
i feel cheated and scammed .
i truly hate this product !
yeah , it 's not that much , but i expected better performance .
i bought this for interviews to create a documentary video .
the plastic transmitter and receiver was so light that i questioned its durability .
it just seems like an empty plastic box though .
seems a bit cheesy .
not sure if i 'm going to order from them a replacement .
that restocking fee kinda bites .
after 4 months of use , the cable cuts in and out .
i finally replaced it with a name brand cable .
good for scratchy pots ... a disaster for faders .
both pieces were never toured and kept covered .
the arp was bought new .
and you ca n't return it .
so , just do n't buy it .
this is my first experience with this product .
i used this on 3 out of 8 faders on my korg nanokontrol2 .
but if that 's the case , why does this product exist ?
it 's supposed to clean + lube faders .
that 's it 's raison d'tre , the whole point of this product .
( sorry for the whisper-level audio . )
the straw does not fit the nozzle .
this has happened to me once before .
it makes my purchase basically useless , and a waste of money
i am sure i will love the product if it ever delivers .
this sound is not what i heard at boy scout camp .
it sounds like a recorder instead of a whistle sound .
you get what you pay for .
the book did help with the fingering .
i just wish the quality of the whistle was better .
got the irish tin whistle in good condition as was the book .
cd and book did n't have as much helpful information as advertised .
this item is somewhat pointless .
the book , cd and whistle are all ok , but not the package .
if you play by ear you do not need the book .
this does not teach proper methods for learning the whistle .
the songs in the book are not traditional .
the whistle is only ok for someone beginning .
the coating peels off in a messy way .
i spent more and bought at proper book and a better flute .
it 's worth it in the end .
much possibility - how much practice is enough to deliver it consistently ?
both tones are the same , and there is little to recommend this chime .
the mallet is plastic and so it does n't resonate well .
two rod chime has same tone on both chimes .
note the same girth and length of the rods .
a `` woodstock '' chime .
fooled again in trying to buy an american made product .
it does make a chiming sound so i gave it 1 star .
i purchased this tone set to use in my kindergarten classroom .
what is the point of having two tones when they are the same ?
arrived with scratches and paint ( ? )
stains on the chime , scratches and chips in the wood .
beautiful sound but sad it was n't in good shape .
please do n't buy this chime - save your money and buy something else .
i would have returned it - but the company has a no return policy .
cut the thread holding the hammer and broke it !
should let your customers know how to unpackage it correctly .
thank you for listening .
this chime made too much of a high pitched , tinny sound for me .
very disappointed that i can not return the item .
item not as pictured , it did not come with black mallot .
although it is pictured with it .
and you can not return it .
i guess i got a dud .
i am going to return it .
i do not like when they show one thing and deliver something else .
the metal is opaque and not as shown .
not happy with the level of dishonesty .
was n't able to return .
disappointed i was n't able to return item .
nicely made but very weak tone .
very tin- like sound .
probably something that should not be bought online without hearing it firsthand .
i ca n't even use the chime effectively since mine arrived without the mallet .
you had one job -- to put 2 pieces in a box .
poor quality control from china that reflects poorly on an american company .
a sure return and potential replace .
will be calling the company .
poor quality tone , does not resonate much and is quite flat .
also , apparently no return is possible .
the chime is fine , but mine did n't come with the mallet ! !
not what i expected .
the tone did n't last for a very long time .
plastic handle , wood , the whole thing felt cheap too .
and then buy it when you find the right one .
i guess , you get what you pay for !
expected a better sound from a woodstock chime .
the pitch and tone are awful as it painfully hurts your ears .
it is not soothing or peaceful at all .
this was a total waste of money !
i 'm not sure how to explain it .
i bought it as a gift and was upset with the sound .
it was nice quality though
package arrived with string around broken ... does n't work ...
will need to return .
do not like the tone .
less resonation than a child 's toy .
for the price it 's well made .
win some ; lose some .
not at all what i expected .
beautiful sound and resonance !
the sound is rather muted .
the quality of the chime is just so-so , a little cheaply made .
the hitter is made of plastic and feels cheap , too .
it is certainly overpriced , but i do n't bother to return it .
it does the job to get attention , just not in a musical way .
this was much lower quality that i expected and i have never used it .
it had a very clear tone that reverbed forever .
so i ordered another .
oh , the sound !
it 's just a high pitch that hurts my ears .
i ended up giving it away to my coworker .
made in communist china .
write woodstock & complain .
products were originally made in us .
between the group of us , we probably own 20 of this chime .
recently , i lost my chime , and ordered a replacement on amazon .
the sound quality is nothing like the recording sample that you hear .
it sound so bad , that i returned it .
i consider it defective .
i would gladly paid twice a much to order the old design .
the product is as advertised .
it is visibly cheaply made .
the wood and metal detail is sloppy .
the metal rod was not in good geometric alignment with the wood .
you get what you pay for .
the chime is tied off-center in the wooden cradle .
does n't look good , does n't sound good .
the sound dies down very quickly .
this solo one is not a good purchase..
having to send back because the mallet was missing .
hopefully the replacement will include the mallet .
the sounds by themselves are too high pitched and equally unpleasant .
i bought it to get students ' attention during my training class .
the sound is very shrill .
this is not the relaxing , soothing sound i was expecting .
i decided to send it back because i dislike the sound so much .
be careful if you order this .
it is not the beautiful sound some reviewers say it is .
very annoying , sharp sound .
i returned it and ordered a replacement which had the same problem .
this must be an example of mass production with no quality oversight .
the right side is canted up with a half inch space .
the left side , less than a quarter inch .
it looks plain awful because of it .
they just did n't care enough .
you pay premium prices for woodstock chimes and products .
i expect premium quality control .
it 's too late for me to send this back .
if you want a photo , just ask .
i just received mine and it was missing the mallet .
not melodic as i had hoped .
i use it for the classroom the get students ' attention .
the three sounds ... just bah .
i ordered this to help quiet down and calm students in my classroom .
both chimes were not in a major chord with the last chime being dissonant .
i bought this for my classroom but do n't like the tones it uses .
it needs a nicer chord .
going to try to return .
do n't be fooled by false advertising .
the picture shows a shure logo .
what you get is a copy fake replica with no bard on it .
do n't be fooled by false advertising .
the picture shows a shure .
what you get is a poor quality copy that sounds like s___ .
their media player used to apply this info to a list of 1..n tracks .
it is a real half hearted attempt .
maybe i expect too much from the largest s/w company in the world .
i expected to turn my cassette tape collection into mp3s but could not .
includes an audio converter .
if you do n't know what a codec is , get lost !
that is the most misleading statement i have ever seen on a microsoft product .
that 's not what this program does .
microsoft is getting worse at what it includes in its plus !
if you 're looking to waste money , well by all means buy this .
while the intentions behind plus !
for example , we have plus dancer .
after about 5 minutes my amusement with this feature was gone .
the only feature that i have ended up using was the alarm clock .
otherwise , just hit the net and look for some decent share.ware
i 've gotten free downloads from microsoft with more value .
alarm clock ? ! ?
who sleeps by their computer ... ( okay , some of us do ) .
need i say more ? ! ?
ok , my major complaint with the last version of plus !
was that it gave you little to nothing ; mostly demo and watered-down programs .
is now only available for xp ) .
other than picture story , there is really very little of value here .
the dancers and alarm clock lose their novelty after the first 5 minutes .
i own a pocket pc , so the synchronization tools are welcome .
all in all , it 's `` ok '' .
it 's nowhere near a `` must-have '' item .
i would only suggest it if you catch it on sale .
just thought that was important enough to add .
no fix planned , according to their customer support .
i 've asked about this , but get no answer .
this is a pain as you try to recreate your label inserts .
i bought the top-of-the-line dell to handle all the system requirements .
and now , the video portion has finally stopped working .
a waste of good money .
( system instabilities , etc ) you have been warned .
crashed a lot and is n't compatible with newer hardware or operating systems .
i ended up buying nero and giving this away .
it turned out to be a nightmare .
cds were not able to be finalized .
i 've been exchanging emails with roxio technical support ever since .
i can not copy a cd using the disc copier function .
what is wrong with companies these days ?
they grab the money and run .
never mind whether the customer gets the functionality they are paying for .
amazon.com , on the other hand , is one customer-oriented company !
yes everytime you need an software update/patch , you need to login with password .
registration needs an valid email address and your roxio software key .
and pray that you do n't loose your cd key .
somehow this is one evil way roxio try to get your business .
i purchased this product and when i record it gives me an error message .
i have lost many cds trying to get this rip off to work !
i award one star , 'cause the system will not allow a lower rating .
roxio `` support '' has been no help .
i 'd love to hear from other 's who have had this problem ! !
i foolishly bought the upgrade for roxio .
i finally switched to nero .
it is the only way to go .
being an engineer , i can only believe that software engineers must run roxio .
if you have patience and a masters in i.t .
you probably will enjoy being roxio 's beta site and using the product .
if not you will be totally frustrated .
trying to get assistance is virtually impossible .
for my money its easier to use nero .
i expect that version 7 is n't much different .
i have been using easy cd creator 5 platinum successfully for quite some time .
i tend to go for updates of a product when i 'm happy it .
only thenafter is the disc ready to use ( i.e .
saving files on it ) just as a floppy disc ( i.e .
( note : i have not used it with dvd discs ) .
then the problems started .
1. blank new cds can not be formated any more .
so my cd/dvd burner now is turned into a cd/dvd rom drive .
so i have to reboot my pc .
those problems left me with crappy software and cd/dvd burner .
if you are willing to take a riks buy it .
i followed instructions and lost everything .
this product is a failure .
at last i had kick this software and i am so happy .
now i am using nero which is is world class software .
do n't buy this software ever at any cost .
and if it is coming with your 's computer do n't use it .
i do n't even know where to start .
i have never seen a more blantant disregard for customer satisfaction .
uninstalling it was one of the highlights of my life .
technical support is a joke to say the least .
i will never buy anything from roxio or any successors .
i tried calling the tech .
support number and the area code had changed .
there is no mailing address , save their legal department .
the web site support is very lacking in assistance .
caveat emptor is the best expression for roxio products .
find an alternate product that does the same job .
however , i can only use 60 % of the space on the cd .
that was the first wierd thing .
as i was archiving cds , i have some problems .
some cds could not be copied .
some cds that i created using easy cd creator were invalid or corrupted .
i created iso images on my hard drive and created cds .
you do n't want to gamble with this .
i 've been using cd creating software since 1997 , mostly from adaptec .
this particular version ( 6 ) only works when it wants to .
that must be why i 'm not in marketing or economics .
i ordered nero 6 ultra instead .
winxp has a better burning package for free .
i bought this solely based on the `` roxio '' reputation .
the dvd crashed still ! ! !
so i stepped outside then threw this entire package into the trash .
i checked roxio.com but all they answered me was no help for me !
let me give you an advice , do not waste your money on this !
i now have a fat partitioned f : drive containing some system files .
i have a 7 month old dell machine running windows xp .
after uninstalling and reinstalling i still had the same problem .
some even had to restore their pc .
sent emails to their tech support and received one answer so far .
i will never buy another roxio product again .
i treated the negative reviews here with skepticism .
but they appear to be bang on target .
i 'll go back to the earlier version .
until roxio makes clear -- in .
i can not believe anyone selling this kind of horrible software .
this software will cause a lot of damamge than a good .
roxio should recall this junk immediately .
it 's like hiv .
it screws up your system and you ca n't get rid of it .
i wish we had the option of awarding zero stars !
a bunch of bucks later , and i still ca n't burn cd 's .
now i 'll probably have to re-format my c : drive and re-install everything .
why , oh why do we keep falling for this idiocy ?
this is the first time i have ever written a review .
roxio needs to fix their bugs before making their real profits .
after rebooting i got an inaccessible_boot_device error .
again roxio easy cd creator caused the problem .
i found it using google .
they have one for compaq ( [ ... ]
all the bad reviews are true ! !
i 've been working with computers long enough to fix minor/major bugs .
but this software qualifies as a virus !
i , too , would have given it zero stars , if possible .
their discussion groups are largely the blind leading the blind .
i am looking for a new software .
i purchased the product because of dvd builder .
i would not recommend this product to anyone .
it simply does n't work .
not so with costco .
i recommend buying software through them if possible so as to avoid this problem .
to summarize : this software is crap and you should demand a refund .
i 'm returning it and you should too if it 's not too late .
run from this software as fast as you can .
a definite do n't buy !
btw , i mean *constantly* , it was really ridiculous .
i will never buy a roxio product in my life .
hidden partitions also showed up as newly assigned drives .
now my computer works fine .
after getting unhung i went to the roxio web site and downloaded a patch .
the patch did about as much good as hitting my computer with a shovel .
my advice - if roxio has stock , do n't buy it .
these guys ca n't possibly stay in business much longer .
trying to contact techical support was a joke .
if i could , i 'd give it a minus 1 star rating .
every version has problems .
1. slide show is a joke .
first attempt at dvd burning .
the advertising is misleading saying you can burn slide show dvds .
i do n't think so .
that is simply laughable .
2. sound editor is a joke .
the advertising says , `` powerful editor . ''
the fact is it has only basic features .
i recommed you immediately download voyetra 's audio surgeon like i did .
it worked first time an was extremely easy to use .
it still crashes routinely .
4. one good thing to say .
in this mode , it makes windows media player look very bad .
this product needs some work .
it also needs humans answering the phone .
hours of work wasted !
i contacted their so-called `` technical support '' ( ha ! )
by phone and email , but still have n't heard from them .
i did n't pay for this .
most of the copies out there now do include the newer engine .
if you upgrade to 6.x via the web you can kiss dvd burning goodbye .
however , look at their own site forums and on the web .
it 's a wide spread issue .
the fix is supposed to be out in late november .
i would wait until it is out and tested first .
the end result is a 4.7 gig burn that renders to about 2 gigs .
it 's almost unrecognizable when you play it .
pixilation so bad that is resembles a mosaic pattern .
another problem is the software keeps attempting to finalize cd-r disks .
throw that one away too .
finally , i burned a 1-hour dvd .
your call on buying this !
one thing i liked ... the nice box it came in ...
i had easycd `` cremator '' basic that came with a micro-advantage dvd burner .
i made a total of 7 coasters ( dvd recordables ) and several cd-rs .
it would occasionaly work with my previoulsy installed cd burner .
anyway i took the drive back thinking it was bad .
i bought a new pioneer drive , same problem .
do n't the hardware manufacurers test their drives with the software before packaging it .
oh , the drag to disk worked occasionally with the cd burner .
i guess that is worth about 1 star .
i had the platinum 5 version which i upgraded .
using windows me , this worked fairly well .
i called dell , they tried very hard but could not correct the problem .
i then re-enstalled version 6 , the same problem , i then called roxio .
i then erased the program , and returned it .
i purchased nero 5.5 which works fine .
the people at dell and roxio did not know what caused the problem .
in truth i can not recomend a product which seems so variable .
pinnacle 's instant cd+dvd might be more suitable for you .
i got easy cd & dvd creator 6 bundled with a dvd+/-rw drive .
needless to say , i was eager to get burning .
but , that 's neither here nor there .
i 'll cut to the chase .
i then performed a fresh install of windows xp .
i then installed service pack 1 and all critical updates .
clearly there is some serious problem with this software .
a bug this serious should 've been caught before beta testing .
many knowledgeable people advising to steer clear of this product .
i echo that sentiment .
it main problmes are 1 ) poor user interface ( i.e .
* it will not allow you to use your own mp3 naming format .
* standard features like normalization are simply left out .
want to find out how to burn an iso ?
no table of contents to just search iso .
you must wait on pages & pages of worthless timeconsuming manuals via pdf .
this is really the unforgivable part .
* things like dvd builder are amazingly enept .
both do the same thing .
ok saved just like the option for save .
thanks for nothing roxio .
that version was impossible to get working on a windows 98 machine .
every iteration of this software is wracked with problems .
windows xp has been around for plenty long enough .
the drivers for xp and 2000 should be just about the same .
ati has finally gotten their xp drivers up to par .
creative has done the same .
i recommend people switch to nero and do not buy this .
i will not buy another roxio product .
i will go back to nero .
never had a problem with it .
i bought this so that i could burn digital video onto a vcd .
roxio 's tech support is useless .
product does not remove previous edition , and does not load .
and then the problem is still not resolved .
undoubtedly , this company does not care about customer support or service .
i was very eager to put these all on dvd for my family .
the series of problems i had with this process was simply amazing .
the software did n't have fast forward or rewind buttons .
the software crashed numerous times .
i tried to simply write an image to disk .
the roxio message boards are full of complaints from people with the same problem .
i sent an email to their tech support .
this software should never have been released in the buggy state it is in .
do n't expect any kind of tech support from roxio .
both audio and visual playback quality of captured video clips was horrible .
i was unable to burn , as it repeatedly froze up after encoding .
what a waste of money !
this thing is buggy too .
shows do not run the entire length of songs and transitions are buggy .
who beta-tested this software - someone from microsoft .
it frankly does not work let alone work as advertised .
it consistently stops burning and displays error messages .
there is no way to correct them .
i have tried burning at speeds from 40x down to 8x .
i 've tried different media and roxio 's `` smart burn . ''
the same applies to disc copying .
i was able to burn 1 cd .
it took almost 7 hours and left off the last 2.5 tracks .
save your money and do n't bother with this program .
it is a total waste .
roxios ' support people told me to remove everything from my start up list .
stay far away from this bomb ...
the concept is fantastic !
however , the product will not preform as advertised .
the music ( sound ) will always be too long or two short .
when using random transitions you will never know how long each one will take .
once-in-a-while the random transitions will disappear half way through the project .
forget about technical support .
once you start the fast forward it goes all the way to the end .
eventually it comes back but in the meanwhile it 's a pain .
was a total waste of $ ...
had basic 5 version , which gave me problems .
tried to upgrade , blew the hard drive .
norton said 1038 registy errors .
talked with computer shop , found that the errors `` not unusual '' .
ecd has a great label maker , but for everything else i use nero .
when i installed it , it asked to be rebooted .
when it rebooted it knocked out my computer would not reboot .
technical support for my video card could not find a solution .
reinstalling windows did not solve the proproblem .
easy creator has always given me some problems .
it is a tempermental program to begin with .
i bought this against the advice of several reviews on this site .
you can only do that in windows explorer .
it 's ok , but not worth the $ i paid for it .
system freezes , error messages , etc .
plus the upgrade is so expensive , do n't be mad to buy this .
i have used roxio 's toast program in my college classes .
this product is pitiful in compairson .
it rewrote something in the bios and is causing problems with the whole system .
and this may not even fix the problem ...
the main problem : this horrible product corrupts at the drop of a hat .
run as fast as can from this product .
there are too many kinks in this program to work out .
the layout is great , but execution is poorly done .
as soon as this was installed on my computer , it crashed .
we had to wipe the entire drive because of this .
too bad i did n't think of doing that before i bought the software .
unfortunately this product is still very buggy .
version 5 works just fine .
i would stick with v5 if you have it .
wait until they release a service pack .
i am a heavy user of older easy cd creators .
talk about a nightmare !
my problem is with the sound editor function .
there is absolutely no help in the user 's manual .
no help with the moving cursors .
the email support is meaningless .
i would return the package if i could .
wayne is my name .
creating a wav file at 10mb/min is n't worth the upgrade .
i just want my mp3 .
i 'm going back to 5 .
do n't buy this product if you 're expecting a rebate from roxio .
a reboot would fix it , yet sometimes it would persist .
( not very promising ) .
i 'm not sure how they let this product out the door .
it 's too bad becuase their earlier versions did its job relatively seemlessly .
my first version was 4.0 and it performed excellent .
never had a problem and everything worked perfectly well .
but worst , it made my pc even slower ! ! !
i have been very happy with roxio products until this upgrade .
this product should never have been released .
and my mp3 files all disappeared .
all they had was `` i 'm sorry . ''
that 's not good enough .
the icing on the cake is that the program does n't even work well .
i hate to think about the data cd 's i 've made .
roxio released this version before it was ready !
the package is rich in advertised features , and supposedly xp compatable .
my experience was less than good , to be polite .
the roxio discussion boards are full of howling customers with serious problems .
i urge potential buyers to check them out before you buy .
the software now costs another $ + in toll charges .
problems : the photosuite function made my system crash .
the cd copier made my system crash .
the drag-to-disk was inoperable .
the cd labeler prints a hideous roxio label in an overwhelmingly big font .
i removed the program and got the final insult .
all in all , a very expensive lesson .
for what it is worth , this is my experience .
roxio does it again with poor xp support .
buggy , constant lock ups .
hey roxio : xp has been out for well over a year .
make your software work with it or fade into obscurity .
this software is technically complicated .
after about a year , they announced ( very discretely ! )
there was no offer to compensate those that paid for this software .
even after that debacle , the tech support has not improved .
try nero 5.5 , pictureit , and realone player .
a much better combination .
it took me three days to recover the system .
... just my 2 cents worth , but i thought you should be aware .
if you get this program , plan on the extra expense for other software .
does n't work with my pro-ject debut carbon .
the answer is : it cant .
try another barbie game like barbie horse adventure .
she always chooses her barbie as rapunzel game instead .
this stylus worked great for about a month .
i have no idea why or how .
anyway , it worked great right up until it broke for no apparent reason ...
1 of these came bent bought as replacements , messed up ! !
they do track better but bass response is lower as well as output .
they were kinda a let down .
i guess i 'll be looking for some new groove master 2 's .
i was pretty upset when i received these and realized they were knock-offs .
make sure your needles say shure on them !
stay away ! ! ! !
be wary of buying this product .
i also had problems getting technical support help .
i was very disappointed .
headphones are very low .
the material looks and feels very cheap .
would not recommend this product to anyone that has a studio .
you get what you pay for .
they feel like they are going to break .
and when music is played with them it sounds like pure s*** .
its a crackling sound so loud you cant hear what your listening to .
a baby monitor , monitors sounds too .
a weird things happens when you place these in your ears .
a wind tunnel feeling traps the sounds and splits them apart in weird places .
i 'm moving from 2 to 1 star .
the sound is good and it 's very comfortable .
these headphones are not very good .
the problem with these headphones is a very unbalanced frequency response .
guitar , organ , drums , and vocals ) would be back stage .
it is those back-stage instruments that are playing the main musical content .
so for the folks who read this ... buy a battery too ! ! !
i 'm a tenor who use pc to record my vocal .
this mic is just so-so , slightly better than a chat-mic .
i purchased this microphone & i am returning it the same day .
ca n't complain too much , it was less than $ 10 .
i have not tried this product with other devices .
i use my pc for all of my recording .
mic is solid , no complaints about the microphone unit itself .
it does this constantly .
factor a new cable into the price before you finish shopping .
arrived on time , and operational .
okay for karaoke use , though not great .
used it only for a few hours .
now the brand new microphone does n't work .
i bought it despite the warnings that the gain was very low .
i planned on using it in my computer .
well , that was n't good enough either .
this mic needs a microphone pre-amp .
that being the case you could buy a better microphone with that money .
do n't by this mike .
its a piece , it cuts out , and crackles .
save your money and buy elsewhere
do n't buy this .
there are deaf toddlers who can record my voice better than this microphone .
it works - badly , so i give it one star .
could not return as i had the receipt drycleaned !
why on earth would sony design and sell this product ?
this time i have the receipt and surely will return it !
we just purchased this from a different vendor .
thank goodness we do n't have to deal with return shipping ! !
it also does n't have an on/off switch .
with the boombox volume at a decent level , nothing came through the microphone .
did not work with anything .
but for the price i ca n't complain .
but i mean the price says it all !
horrible , flimsy , and broke quick .
you get what you pay for .
you can barely hear it .
when its plugged in and on .
one works sometimes ... the other one is worse .
these are crappy excuses for microphones .
do not but these .
i tried un 2 places and it does n't work
quality is very poor .
garbage , arrived not working ... thank god it was only 8 bucks wasted
did n't work for my daughter radio
i purchased a different brand and it works great .
broke the first day !
this was not at all what i was expecting .
it was extremely light weight and felt fakr
does n't work tried it on everything with a mic.input.no sound.sony+chinese crap as usual .
it broke the same day we got it .
do n't buy for any reason .
i paid $ 3.99 and got ripped off .
the sound is low and of poor quality .
does n't work with a computer ? ? ?
very cheap and not very loud .
needs a mixer button .
very disappointed with this microphone .
do not buy this microphone .
i do like their directional mike the pdmic58 which is very good .
this microphone is going in the trash .
my mistake i did not read the reviews .
we were on a budget and well i should have saved my money .
very disappointed in this particular sony product ...
very little sound comes from this microphone .
this microphone barely picks up sound .
i purchased singing machine smm205 which works fine and threw this one away .
also omnidirectional is not good for voice .
the mic dose not work at all i am not happy at all ! !
it is not sensitive enough for satisfactory sound production .
unidirectional mike has a little better reception because it is made for speaking .
this mic is ok. i would n't recommend it .
it 's the old saying - you get what you pay for .
i was suspicious with the cheap price and for good reason .
( ? ? ? )
i will not be buying another sony mic regardless of the cost !
it is also really lightweight .
you just get what you pay for .
the procuct said it would work for any machine , it did not .
you can only hear sound from it when there is no music playing .
then the music starts and nothing .
i would suggest buying a mic that matches the brand of the machine purchased .
good thing it was only 10 bucks .
i was really upset .
santa brought this for christmas .
it did not last two days !
the mic feels nice and heavy and looks great .
the problem is in the wiring .
and i thought sony could n't go wrong , lol .
well the mic is a piece of junk and worthless to me .
do n't buy it .
spend a little more money and get something that works .
mic itself is very cheap and flimsy feeling .
it makes me so upset .
do n't buy it .
do n't use it .
it is made in china .
please help me solve it .
mic is very bad quality .
very light compared to others i have .
it feels like a toy mic that belongs to a cheap toy keyboard .
this microphone does not work well .
the worst singer gets the bad microphone .
i will buy another kind soon because this will not last .
this may be the cheapest piece of junk you can buy on amazon .
it feels like a kids toy .
boy was i wrong .
do n't buy it for any reason .
this microphone looks ok but it works terrible .
i would not recommend anyone buy this .
i was not impressed by this product at all .
i thought since it was sony it would be good but clearly not .
this never worked for me on an amp or my computer .
do n't waste your money .
it also supposedly has more wattage than some of the others .
thank god i tried it before xmas after my daughters were in bed .
also you can barely hear anything through the microphone .
basically this is a not so cheap , poor quality cd player .
i am returning it asap .
much to my dismay , my daughter returned it tome in february .
we purchased this for our 10 year old daughter .
this guitar is good for a 5-9 year old .
it 's a beautiful guitar but a small 3/4 size guitar .
that makes a difference if you are looking to fit a 9-12 year old .
other than the scale length , i would say this is a good guitar .
the guitar is good , but it is cracked .
guitar had a strong , toxic smell from glues or wood conditioners .
i even checked to see if i was sent the wrong guitar .
the picture attached - is 3 guitars .
the yard stick is 36 '' long .
it was broke had cracks
does not hold a tune and sounds awful .
only marginally better than a toy guitar .
returned was not the quality i was expecting .
also a lot smaller than indicated
honestly i did n't check when it arrived .
i could n't find a way to contact the seller either .
do n't know what to do .
the sound is good though .
hope the seller can help .
the guitar is nice but it 's a 1/4 not a 3/4 .
looks like my regular size guitar had a baby .
giving it 2 stars because it sounds nice .
it was also very orange in color .
i ended up returning it .
does n't even deserve one star .
did n't try argued time .
i could n't use it , because it had steel strings .
do not buy this if you want a normal full guitar .
wish i could exchange this to an adult size ; (
this guitar is not the actual size .
its much smaller than 3/4 .
if you are buying for a toddler its good .
this product cracked in 6 weeks .
do not buy this from them .
i borrowed my friends guitar in order to get my nephew to play .
with new strings , it still sounds lousy .
i have had several guitars .
this was purchased as a first guitar gift for my kids .
otherwise the guitar sounds good for the price .
this item is not the complete cartridge , but instead just the replacement needle .
so be careful when you order .
i 've played many records with it , mostly rock/soul/funk and electronic .
the seller send me new model at440mla , but it 's worse than at440ml .
the seller ( electronics expo ) do n't answer to e-mail .
this at440ml cartridge has been discontinued and is no longer available .
the replacement is at440mla .
please add this type of warning so people do n't waste money .
does not fit frigidaire cook top .
did n't work on an old range .
even with all the adapters these did not fit my range top .
they are not long enough !
did not fit my range as indicated in the description .
the universal adapter did not work at all for me .
they were way too short , even with multiple modifications .
maybe they will work for you ?
if so it can save you money .
the inserts will not stay in position when pushing down to turn on .
some of the washers did not fit properly and the knobs were mush smaller .
could not get them to fit , so just tossed them .
should have returned them for a credit .
i just think its a poor design .
did n't fit my on my stove
did not fit my stove
did n't fit my stove : (
we even tried to shave them down .
we have a kenmore stove top range
i installed one of the knobs .
it looks like it fits but it wo n't turn at all .
they are useless to me .
my fumbling attempts to adapt the knobs have been unsuccessful .
i bought these for my ancient ge electric range .
product description said it would fit lots of stoves .
mine is a regular whirlpool stove and none of the dials fit .
no fault of the seller , but this product is awful .
poorly constructed , cheap looking .
the interchangable rings provided with the knobs are also cheap looking .
sorry , but do not buy this product .
i bought these thinking it would fit my stove , i have a kenmore .
i thought since it had different sizes one was bound to fit .
all were shaped odd and only one would slide on .
i tried putting the knob on sizer and it seemed to fit .
once i tried to turn the knob on it would just turn and turn .
it was so loose !
then to take that small piece out of the knob was a nightmare .
i fond my replacement knobs on ebay !
very cheaply made and did n't work .
i tried many different ones and found the same .
sent some back and ordered other one ... and threw them away .
really cheap ends but what can you expect for the price .
i did n't check reviews before buying so got stuck
i bought two of these and i had problems immediately with one of them .
i determined that the xlr connectors just were n't satisfactory .
fortunately , i 'm decent with electronics , so i got out my multimeter .
i was getting connectivity issues with serveral pins .
so i unscrewed the ends and pulled back the covers to reveal the wiring .
i re-soldered that and tried again .
back to the workbench , pulled apart both ends .
the wrong wires were going to the wrong contacts .
once i de-soldered these , fixed them , and re-soldered them ?
but i do n't suppose one should have to do that .
i 've learned my lesson and will spend the extra money on better cables .
have n't bought nady cables ever since .
i purchased this thinking that i would have it at least a year .
i would have expected better .
ordered two , took them to a show only one of them works .
purchased 1/31/12 and already is crapping out on me .
going to purchase monster - you get what you pay for !
i purchased two of these cables five months ago when i expanded my set-up .
i wonder when the other will fail ... proceed with caution .
very high noise floor .
be warned it adds a horrible hum to you mixer when mics are on .
not that great to be honest highly disappointed would not recommend .
tried ground loop isolator checked everything to no avail .
hums when connected to the system
i wound up returning it and using a behringer xenyx 802 which works great .
i have barely used these cables for mics in a garage band set up .
i would not recommend these at all .
we purchased this as 2nd mic to my kids karaoke machine .
it lasted about a year before it broke .
my kids are n't hard on their things .
it seems to be a wiring issue .
lasted a few uses .
then it started to cut out
this worked great for about 6 weeks then shorted out .
used 2 time and now not working anymore
i would not recommend this product .
it 's too late for a return to amazon .
not worth tje money .
poor connection loss of signal..
stopped working after a day , waste of money .
it is broken after i used for two months .
this microphone had good reviews at the time of my purchase .
i trusted them believing this was a reliable product .
i received it in a timely fashion and it did not appear damaged .
it worked for my first use thank goodness .
but it began to have problems .
i would not recommend this microphone .
returned also with key board
mic does not las long ... do n't buy .
i used it maybe on 3 occasions and it does not work anymore .
i was really disappointed that the mic failed .
it seems like a good quality , but it is not
stopped working after about 3 months
sorry but the cord broke on the 2nd day we had this .
needs a stronger cord .
bought this few years ago but did n't to use .
finally , i used it this christmas .
after using this microphone for few songs it stopped working .
i am not sure if it is the cable or the microphone itself .
switch in the microphone was incorrectly wired so it would no switch on .
poor quality control at manufacturing .
sound quality was not that great for singing .
i 'm going to return it .
this thing broke within a month and i could n't even re-wire it .
do n't buy it .
ordered this to go along with a kid karaoke machine .
started cutting out the first time we used it .
cord did n't work !
i had to go to guitar center for a new cord..
the power button broke on the 2nd use .
stopped working in just over a year and only used a few times .
had to return it .
sound quality is very poor ...
the microphone felt durable enough , i suppose .
it was the cord itself that started to fall apart just after several uses .
the wires within the cord started to disconnect at the plug .
mics stopped working after a couple weeks .
switch on item broke after very little use .
it did n't even last two weeks .
following limited use , the cable pulled out .
recommend others buy a different microphone .
i bought this for my nieces for christmas .
they used it twice and it 's already broken .
it broke after using it for one month .
on/off button broke in three days ( used maybe three or four times ) .
my daughter received this for christmas and it broke within 2 days .
one twin was not happy .
i bought this in addition to the hkaraoke machine .
the nady mic worked fine for a couple months but now nothing .
no sound at all .
looks like i 'll have to find a better brand and pay twice .
bought this in may .
gave it to our daughter in october for her birthday .
quit working last night .
then there is this humming noise when i use the microphone .
the noise becomes louder and louder and i have to stop using it .
i guess you get what you pay for .
save your money for a better quality microphone .
broke first day ... not good quality
as delivered , it would not work .
it 's an ok microphone
bought it , used it the same day .
the mic gave out .
the cable seems to be what i bought !
because the mic ended up in the trash !
-.- ' could be a one time incident but still !
had to go spend more money on another mic since that was so dissapointing !
if you get a functional model , you 're in for a treat .
but hey its your gamble .
have another that we will see how long that lasts .
2 weeks after i received the product , the cord or the microphone broke .
even when it did `` work '' , it was still shorting out .
item broke 30 days after i bought it .
would like a replacement .
ok i guess for the price
stopped working after a few weeks
bought 4 of them .
either wire , microphone head , or bottom blug-ins .
this did not work properly out of the box .
the one that came with the $ 50 child 's karoke machine works better .
i 'm returning it .
i bought 2 of these microphones for my daughters for christmas .
the both cords broke instantly !
we used it for a couple of times and found it was not working .
i wanted to return it but found that it just passed the return deadline .
since then i left it in the garage .
it wastes the money .
i rather have something better
cheep not buy this mic
chord broke within the first month of use .
thank goodness for duct tape !
good news , its a $ 10 mic .
bad news , they do not hold up to the rigors of the road .
they are not built for heavy use .
i spin 2-4 nights a week and they simply do not hold up .
all three have went bad at the xlr connection in the mic .
save your money and buy better .
this is cheaply engineered and most likely manufactured in china .
you get what you pay for .
the mic works fine but the cable is garbage .
my mouth has to be on the frame just to pick up clear sound .
this is a good mic for messing around , nothing else .
i do not recommend this mic for any pro audio work .
you get what you pay for here , buyer beware .
buyer beware , you definitely get what you paid for in this item .
after two uses , the unit no longer works .
i tried plugging into different speaker box & mixers w/ the same result .
it messed up a week after using it
do n't waste your time !
these are not worth the time .
very disappointed in all aspects of this purchase !
would not recommend it .
i purchased this mic thinking it was going to be durable .
with adult use , and only approx .
3-5 days after receiving the item , it 's broken .
oh well i guess .
the microphone itself is pretty heavy duty , however the cord is junk .
i returned it and will try a more expensive one .
mics are of good quality but the cords were of low quality .
one of them was shorting and the other does not work at all .
my 8 year old daughter was crushed .
it was broken when i got it i hated it .
i am never buying that product again i hated it
microphone has already fallen apart and volume is less than desirable .
while i love to sing i thought the quality of machine would be better
microphone is ok i guess but the cord that came with it is worthless .
it 's good but not that good their are some electric problems with it .
i rated it because i liked it !
( made in china ) !
this product does not meet out expectations .
it requires manipulation of the cord and the connection during use .
i would not recommend this product .
neither of the two microphones i ordered for my granddaughters for christmas worked .
why do people sell things that they must know does n't work .
as many people as reviewed said the cable was messed up .
they have to know they are screwed up .
the cable is horrible and cheap .
it lasted only about 3 months and then broke .
i wo n't be buying this brand again .
we did n't even get to use it all that much .
my son got this for christmas .
it sounded good for the first couple of weeks he had it .
unfortunately , it now appears to be unusable .
audio cut in and out the first time we tried it .
seems like a cheap cable .
every time i move it with my fingers it cuts out .
she used them maybe 10 times for short periods and they stopped working .
i guess pretty bad build quality .
pretty much only static and noise after 5 days of normal use .
this is one of the worst microphones i have ever used .
i only used it once and had to duck tape it together .
my daughter got this mic for christmas .
shortly after new year 's , it stopped working .
before that , it seemed to work well .
this low-budget mic really was n't worth the money .
i mean , even for a kid it tries their patience .
i give it two stars instead of one because it did sort of work .
that was more than the cost of the item itself !
it never worked from the first time we tried it .
i think i should have been reimbursed for this thing entirely .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
this thing broke after two uses .
this microphone broke after only a couple of uses .
cord went out during a special show .
only lasted 5 shows .
the mic still works fine .
that 's the 3rd nady product to go bad on us .
i purchased this item to use with a small amplifier .
after only 45 seconds of use the microphone malfunctioned and stopped working altogether .
if you want to actually use the microphone do n't buy this one .
also the hassle of returning the product to amazon is a pain and inconvenient .
maybe somethings still need to be purchased at a brick and mortar store .
i bought this microphone for my singing machine .
i waited a month , and they never sent me a replacement .
i eventually got it , unfortunately they sent me a refurbished replacement .
i used it once or twice , and then it stopped working .
my other microphone still worked great with my karaoke machine .
nady 's quality of their products is terrible .
the cheap one that came with my karaoke machine worked better than nady 's .
finally , when i bought this microphone on amazon , it was $ 25 .
do n't waste your money or time on this .
the microphone appeared `` open or used '' and clearly was not working .
very dissatisfied with this product .
i originally bought this as a second mic for my daughter 's karaoke machine .
( i will try to include a picture ) .
it took maybe two months , but it happened again .
this product should n't even be sold .
i would give it no stars if that were an option .
i purchased this as a second microphone for my daughter 's karaoke machine .
i bought it prior to her sleepover birthday party .
the microphone quit working after an hour usage .
the girls were disappointed .
so , i ordered a replacement .
the replacement worked for a few hours , then it quit .
i regret to report the non - dynamic aspect worked briefly , now failed .
this microphone is cheaply made .
the cables short out .
all of them are cracked by the screw in the base .
time to start searching for a better quality one !
seemed fine while it lasted , but beware .
this not a good product .
i bought two of these microphones for my karaoke system at home .
at first , they were wonderful .
the quality was great for the price .
but in less than 2 months , both are not working at all .
both have bad wire connection issues .
i wish i knew who to report this too , assuming anyone even cares .
xlr jack only connects to the microphone .
either way ill be sending it back , for both reasons .
i just received this product and it came without the adapter for pc usage .
needless to say , i 'm quite upset.i
good device , good cable .
we purchased this microphone as a christmas present .
it lasted 1 day before the cable had a short in it .
like always , amazon replaced with no hassles .
do yourself a favor and do not buy this microphone .
the sound alone is worth the price .
i believe the entire setup with behringer mic and xlr cable was approx .
bought 4 of these about 6 weeks ago , using them for classroom .
connection ( 3 xlr pins ) become loose , female cord does n't connect .
would n't buy again .
you can barely hear it and the cord broke in about 2 weeks .
need i say more ?
save your money and buy another mic for 30-40 bucks .
this is the best microphone i 've ever used .
this new nady microphone was so much better than the sony .
technology has really improved since 10 years ago .
the sony mic was no comparison to this new nady mic .
feels heavy in hand ( in a good way ) .
cable is high quality and much thicker than my sony mic .
so i ca n't recommend a product that stops working after only 2 years .
this is a remarkably heavy duty , metal microphone with good sound .
this was a gift for my grandson .
he has taped the cable to the connector .
at this price , it is probably not worth returning .
the wire broke away from the microphone after only 3 weeks of use .
i would not recommend this produt .
my daughter purchased this microphone for her karaoke machine .
it broke after only a few uses .
we never received a replacement and they claim to have no record of anything .
unfortunately i lost the return number so my daughter is out of luck .
bad product and bad customer service .
in less than a week it no longer worked .
i wouldnt reccommend because u really get what u paid for .
mine died too after using it just a few times .
this mic was used six weeks before it failed to operate .
there was no abuse and was only used with the mic stand .
i will opt for a better mic the next time around .
this is useless if you are looking at out of the box product .
the cable that plugs into the mic is looses .
the cable seems well made .
it will sound fine on stereo speakers , but not mono .
i replaced this with a hosa and everything is fine now .
this cable worked for me for one day .
when i plugged in on day two , nothing .
would have returned , but i needed a new cable immediately .
this cable broke within a month for me .
it seems to be well constructed ... do n't be fooled !
lousy warranty would n't you say .
people , the cable merely worked .
i bought it new and during shipping it must have broken !
mine broke after the fourth time i used it !
the sound was too quiet also !
and they `` were '' my best friends !
i spent all the money i had on it !
range is extremely short for this microphone , like 7 feet .
this microphone in theory , is a good deal .
on the first day , the cord broke right at the base .
if you want something cheap , this is okay .
not bad for the price though .
if you need something cheap just for fun , this would be okay .
that 's right , they cut you off .
and most of the `` songs '' are really lessons .
pass on this one .
if you 're an intermediate player approach with caution .
i am very disappointed in this product considering the other options .
you can also download the guitar tab and tone settings .
the bad thing is that the tab playback software is pretty bad .
it 's just displaying a pdf on screen and scrolling as the track plays .
also the number of songs available is a problem .
they are n't really updating their catalog .
overall i would give this a grade c- as a learning tool .
it has potential for intermediate players , but that 's about it .
as a tool for bass guitarist , guitarport is useless .
only two stars for lack of coherence for the education/training this thing provides .
overall a decent product ideally that has been very very poorly executed .
i also bought some of these a few years ago .
i initially gave these a good review .
this is my last alesis purchase .
this is not a matter of people blowing them through playing loudly .
mine blew just sitting idle .
the psu in these monitors was designed badly and will eventually fail .
the resistor gets too warm and is mounted close to the cap .
not at all ) .
these monitors have excellent sound .
i doubt you 'll ever hear a complaint about them on that score .
there are none even close to as good for the money .
they are , however , one of the most unreliable monitors on the market .
capacitors burn out and power supplies stop working .
this unit was in my possession for only 3 days .
the battery cover constantly comes off and the battery will fall out .
the interface and screen is pretty nice , as well as the button placement .
sound quality was also excellent .
its cheap construction can not be overlooked .
my unit 's battery cover did n't even lineup correctly with the case .
pass on this one .
i have had nothing but trouble with it .
it will not support playlist for songs stored on a sd card .
the songs display the wrong artist when switching tracks .
sometimes it will not turn off or the menu will not come up .
i have been a musician for 30+ years .
well , the microphone is phenomenal but the on/off switch is an utter joke .
cant believe how bad the switch is ... .
i got a defective item .
the on off switch is broken .
this feedback is for more for amazon rather than for the product .
i know shure sm58 is an excellent product .
unfortunately amazon sent me a defective one .
but it certainly is disappointing to get a defective product .
i should have gone for the one without the switch .
kept being cords thinking maybe it was the cord .
contacted the seller and no response .
1st of it was a fake !
oh ya when the box says made in china gotcha .
do n't pay 99 or 105 $ for a nock off .
this is counterfeit version of shure product , according to shure inc .
did i get a knock-off that i was assured of not getting ? ?
i get both shure sm58s and sennheiser e 835s from amazon .
however , e835s made the vocal part stand out of the music .
hence i returned sm58s .
hope this review helps for someone with similar circumstances .
i purchased five of these microphones .
i am very angry and disappointed amazon .
looked like a real one but was either defective or fake .
crap , bad sound , poor quality
i 've had a couple pg58 's for 10 years ( same model ) .
i purchased several of these to find they stop working after approximately 10-20 uses .
i have the same complain for this mike as well .
they are two small than expected .
i got this from dual photo deals seller and is a fake product .
no acoustic isolation : every single handling movement was broadcasted .
shure customer service and my local shure representative confirmed the counterfait product .
returned product and in refund process with amazon .
this hunk of junk was counterfeit .
i sent in for repair and shure returned it to me as counterfeit .
i got my money back and bought a blue !
i only had it 6 months .
weerata.wongkraiwhat a piece or garbage .
i ca n't find any information on the seller either !
perhaps these newer mic 's are cheap-o imports ?
it just does n't compare to the sm58 at all .
i 'm by no means an audiophile or advanced critic .
i donated the pg .
there 's just no comparison in quality , volume and performance .
always sounded tinny , no matter what .
this is not original product .
i 'm not satisfied .
too late to return : (
i bought this mic for use doing interviews .
this is not true .
dont need it sending it back
bootleg , terrible , did n't work at all !
i returned this mic due to it 's poor audio quality .
i did not feel that the audio frequency response met my modest expectations .
the sound produced was very `` tinny '' .
i purchased 2 of these mics and one did n't work at all .
sure enough after two uses it does n't work at all either .
and now it 's too late to return it !
do n't buy it !
looks durable but the sound quality is not as powerful as i thought .
i tried to replace the microphone of my karaoke machine with this .
i ordered two shure sm58s .
yet i received 2 sm58 this morning .
could you tell me something is wrong ?
somee how is defects .
i bought female to male adaptor to connect withmy karoke .
no sound at all .
i havw to send all back..
i had to buy these because i had misplaced my sennheisers !
someone had told me to never by the shures with a switch .
i 'm currently requesting a return through amazon .
i 'm hoping to hear back soon from the seller .
whether i kept the mic close to my lips or away .
the on off switch on shure 58 mic did not work .
i ended up returning this product .
may be it was just my luck .
took the 20 % restocking hit as well .
this was my first time when i was trying out home recording equipment .
for those interested in home recordings , this video might be helpful [ ... ]
there are counterfeits out there ... be careful ! ! !
i normally rate genuine shure 57 microphones as 5-stars .
weak signal on my 2i2 , defective batch .
you 're buying a brand , not a quality microphone .
this is n't the shure of the olden days .
this is poorly manufacturer , dull sounding , and un-durable junk .
go with seinheiser or ev , save yourself the headache .
sad but true , shure is n't what it used to be .
that makes it useless for pretty much every other purpose , e.g .
there are much better options .
not worth $ 100 .
returned for full refund , i live amazon returns .
quit working after 6 months .
the shure service department confirmed this is an imitation .
a well disguised counterfeit .
they sold me a copy , and it does n't work .
it has some details that the original do n't have .
i 'm going to take legal actions against the seller for cheating me .
they sold it to me as an original shure sm57
do not buy this mic .
it is a knock off .
not a genuine shure mic .
bought 2. they have the same serial number .
did further research to confirm they are not genuine shure sm57 micd .
this microphone is not original ! !
i returned this immediately .
the top plastic piece with the mesh was wobbly .
not the quality i expected from a $ 100 shure product .
one thing to watch out for is at the xlr connector .
i would not recommend the x2u to anyone .
the design of these mics goes back about 40 years .
but a lot has happened with microphone technology during that time .
virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better .
and all of which have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback .
there are much better choices for your money .
on the plus side , both the sm57 and sm58 are nearly bullet-proof .
i used to have the version 7.x of this program .
worked just fine , did its job .
version 8 then came out , worked fine , not a problem .
wo n't even rip cd 's anymore , what the $ % ! # ?
not a single problem again .
10. great jukebox , lots of cool features , much better than winamp .
capable of burning songs , but never used this feature .
very annoying , not to mention time consuming .
i tried several times , and it still did n't work .
gave the product 2 stars because of the cool features it has .
your best bet is to go with real player .
i have a dell xps with a cdrw and dvd+ram .
tech support did not respond to my help request from their online website .
i could only guess , why it got 5 stars on a other review .
musicmatch jukebox deluxe 8 did not deliver as promised .
update : worked with musicmatch customer service to try to correct my issues .
there is nothing family size about this wash board .
purely decorative not functional .
went apart after couple of uses .
metal part is too lean .
this is not what i wanted .
if you 're just looking for decor , this is nice .
it 's quite flimsy .
this `` replica '' has a giant dot.com address plastered across it .
horrible marketing to put a e-mail website across the product .
it ruins the whole vibe .
i think its supposed to be a toy .
the panel is not wide enough .
do not buy if you plan on using it for washing clothes .
poorly constructed and not sturdy .
galvanized steel is also poorly constructed .
as mentioned , the wood is poorly constructed .
although it said it is made in the us but i am disappointed .
how can rubbing a dirty sock on a smooth wave get your clothes clean ?
it is real wood yes , but super light weight wood .
it reminds me of something decorative and not something that you can use practically .
i am going to return it .
got this program with my new dell computer .
i spent hours putting together a great dvd with photo slides and videos .
when i went to burn it to dvd it kept coming up with errors .
lots of time wasted here .
absolute waste of time and money .
already that 's a lot of time wasted .
# 4 : tech support is a joke .
nearly useless knowledgebase , unresponsive tech support staff .
it is definitely not for total beginners .
the games require that you already know how to read music to some extent .
pay more , get a better kit from say `` elderly instruments '' .
this was an ok kit .
once i was done i let the grand kids use it for a toy .
i thought that my teenagers would like these kits for a unique christmas gift .
they did not like them , however .
when i tried to return them , i ran into some issues .
first i called the company and was told that they were not returnable items .
so my $ 56.00 purchase was returned and i was credited approximately $ 39.00 .
i would not purchase anything from grizzly again in the future !
the hardware was junk as well as the strings .
pass on this one unless you want to use it for decoration .
we tried to connect the inport to a dell dimension running windows millenium .
two 3-hour telephone calls to dell ascertained that the computer was functioning correctly .
be aware of the limits of this software .
file 95/98/nt ( no ) 2000 or xp update .
i am serious , it is that bad .
so , i do n't rate the product very high .
the hardware is good , but the software is terrible .
i had to reformat my harddrive and reinstall windows to sort the drivers out .
avoid this if you do n't have an older computer .
they also had problems with the drivers and ended up downloading them from m-audio .
needless to say , i returned it for a refund .
no supported by windows xp media center .
i finally found this on the manufacturer web page .
bought one of these a while back .
since then i 've changed to vista 64 bit operating system .
big mistake m-audio has no support what so ever .
that was nearly over half a year ago .
stay clear of this company !
too bad , looked like a good product .
did n't work on any of my vista machines .
in system preferences i changed all the proper input settings for the mobilepre .
it was so soft .
i registered so i could sign on and contact tech support .
perhaps this product works with windows machines .
i could n't get it to work on an intel macpro running os 10.5.2
i shopped real stores and bought a beautiful stratocaster .
my musician friends are back in town and say line 6 is better .
no matter i 'm very happy to be playing again .
the m-audio was a refurbish ... no bargain
great price for a portable usb mic pre .
but you definitely get what you pay for .
the audio quality is extremely poor , and it quite often crashed the system .
feature : feature set is also pretty good .
has a pad and twin headphone jacks as well .
i played with this for a while and just gave up and returned it .
value : feature set is great but the firewire side is just not reliable .
instead i wasted a lot of time failing to diagnose what was wrong .
desirability : nice looking product .
they just gave up on me .
overall : feature set is good .
anything plugged into your firewire ports other than the 410 will cause driver errors .
save yourself the money and headaches and invest in another unit .
crackles and a high level of whitenoise in the background .
so i have to shutdown .
i have read reports of people having problems with this unit .
it only seemed like a fraction .
i hoped i would n't be one .
and i use it for writing , photos , video , games and music .
there are other options out there that do n't have the same problems .
all in all this is a hellish little device .
it 's a nice idea but it does n't really work .
hi , i 've been a long time mac and pc user .
i was careful - at all times .
i had the device working one minute .
it was connected the whole time to my fw400 port .
the fw400 was the only device connected other than a keyboard and mouse .
of course , this is just after my warranty ran out .
repair requires new logic board .
this was my last straw with m-audio .
i 've been writing and producing electronic music for 20 years .
i know what i am doing .
the user experience with this device in getting it going is unacceptable .
it wo n't work right at all on a new imac .
not cool , at all .
would not recommend to anyone , will not be buying more m-audio products .
when we first got the 410 , it worked fine .
( little late for that ) .
i 'm sure there are a lot better things out there .
the sound is very stuffy .
i have problems with snaps and crackles constantly .
i have to reinstall the drivers every month or two .
i would never buy this product or any other product from m-audio again .
i just ca n't figure out how they got a deal with digidesign .
this is by far the worst firewire interface i 've had .
i would not recommend this product to anyone .
i 've had mine for several years .
dead as a doornail , even the mac os would n't recognize it .
all it does is blink , showing that it is getting power .
numerous live shows have almost been canceled due this temperamental little beast .
i would not wish this thing on my worst enemy !
i 'm changing my review from 1 star to 3 stars .
all i get is a blue blinking light .
i 've read all the online advice .
nothing works , including my 410. stay away from this product . ''
i do n't understand why , but it 's true .
a real step backwards .
once you understand all that , the thing works great .
the product worked decently for about 3 months .
the mic inputs never sounded great .
suddenly , for no reason , it stopped initializing on startup .
now the extremely bright led light just blinks .
buy something more reliable .
sound is clean , and i love all the inputs and outputs .
notice i said the software is good , not the drivers .
if you plan to dual-boot between mac and windows , forget this unit .
then , you have about an 80/20 chance of it working .
when you boot into windows again later , it probably wo n't get recognized .
then you have to reboot .
are you starting to get the picture ?
now , with most units , this would n't be a big problem .
sounds like a winning combination , does n't it ?
stay far away from this unit .
do n't be lured in by the extra outputs .
i blew out mine while trying to initially install it .
i would definately recomend staying away from this product .
unfortunately i regret it every time i use it .
first off , the device has no os pre-loaded .
it 's loaded when you start up windows/osx and this in itself causes problems .
this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever .
when it 's off it should n't be screaming at you i think .
the drivers are also pretty horrible .
anyway the whole things saddens me .
i can attest to this .
you 're probably wondering why i had two of these units .
i always thought the problems were just my setup until i did more research .
after further research , i 'm probably going to buy a presonus firebox .
it works for a little while , then al the sound goes dead .
wish i would have done more homework before spending my money .
no response from customer service or the retailer ( electronica direct ) .
i like m-audio but stating this box has 4in is misleading .
you can only use 2 inputs at a time .
that should be clearly stated - really lame .
i could not understand what the problem was .
i got this interface to play live shows with my synthpop group .
the audio skips and crackles .
sometimes the unit will stop working in the middle of a performance .
i have to restart the computer to fix it .
needle is not very strong at all !
this product is cheaply , ade
these are ok if you do n't backspin or scratch .
additionally , i found the sound to be disappointing .
stick with m-447s , they are the best .
stylus we 're broken when i got them .
they skip really bad .
one of the two i ordered showed up broken .
have you ever cued a record and heard a little crackle ?
that is the first sign of impending doom for your tone arm .
i say use them if you want to take that chance .
i would dare to say they are the worst of the concord style carts .
cheaper safer alternatives out there .
they sound great , but they break so easily !
i have two of these mounted on sl1200s .
the production of the ones i received was just not good enough .
disappointing since i always thought that shure was kind of a serious brand .
this was just cheap and wasted .
but the shipping and handling of the order through amazon was flawless as always .
had this product for about two months and it worked great .
not for chill music ! ! !
the keys are also incredibly hard to press .
also unable to record music onto computer .
i hate it and im returning mine asap .
do not reccommend no mater how much you want it !
take it from me !
feels cheap ... like laughably cheap .
looks cheap in person too .
sorry the keys feel weird
old technology but not old enough to be interesting .
it broke on me .
no spills or drops on it .
definitely do n't recommend this if you want something long term .
this unit is too small for my axe-fx - a 2u unit .
accordingly , i 'm not able to affix the back end on this case .
this leaves my axe-fx exposed .
do n't buy this case .
this amp blew out in 2 weeks of purchase with light use .
clean channel is fine .
not going to complain about that .
i have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about .
reverb would have been nice , too .
i bought this based on stellar reviews .
i am actually returning this .
i never return stuff on amazon .
this is a first of a lifetime thing here for me .
i own two other vox amps , and they are both great .
this thing is junk .
hard to believe that vox would produce something of this low quality .
it got sent back .
this is my first amp .
the clean volume is surprisingly low !
that upset me a lot when i have to check how some pedals sound .
broke after 2 months - spend money on a good set
good sound for the price .
sound quality is n't that great
i never use them .
i could be using them wrong i guess .
these are pretty cheap .
do yourself a favor and buy something a little more durable .
you get less than what you paid for
could n't it to work on my sony televisions .
not at all comfortable on ears
the sound of these cheap headphones are great !
wish the were bigger .
i ordered 60 of these for our k-5 graders to use in their ipads .
they are not all that durable !
i would n't recommend this item for school age children .
he could n't use them at all .
my son was disappointed !
these headphones were sold at a reduced price , and now i know why .
one of the channels went out within 6 weeks .
it was a total waste of money .
i bought it and i am not a satisfied customer .
i now have to be trying to acquire another headphone .
sometimes it 's ok and at other times it 's just distorted .
they did a great job while they lasted .
4 months later i only have sound out of my right ear .
never yanked on the or mistreated them at all .
just one day stopped working .
sound is also decent .
would not recommend these even for the cheap price .
i must say i am disappointed .
the right ear went out after about a week of use .
the headphones where handled carefully so i can only assume they were defective .
these look good , but they are n't of great quality .
the right ear faded in like 20 minutes .
the ear holes are also really small and it feels really uncomfortable .
i switched songs and noticed the right ear piece was not playing .
i do not recommended the hf125
this bench is only for keyboards that have at least 71 keys or more .
bought this for my wife for xmas and am returning it .
she did n't like the cheap look of the keyboard stand or the bench .
i 'm going to build her a stand and we 'll find a bench .
good for a kid 's room but not an item for an adult .
several months ago i purchased the stanton st-150 to replace my aged benjamin miracord .
i bought it 1 because i thought that stanton was a reputable company .
i 've used their cartridges for years .
and 2 because of the reviews i read .
nothing i do can get rid of the hum until i unplug the cables .
i think ... maybe it 's not compatible with an older receiver .
the left channel is dead .
the email either comes back as undeliverable or goes un-answered .
i 'm so unhappy with my purchase i 've put it up for sale .
i have resorted to turning up my t.v .
sound is poor , needs an amp for most applications
i would no longer recommend these headphones .
while these sound okay , the strength go the headset diminishes factor than expected .
this is very messy .
quit in less than a month of use .
you will get what you pay for .
i bought these to do some basic monitoring for dslr video .
after one trial , i immediately sent them back .
i swithched to these to try something new and they looked comfortable .
i 'd buy the 202s if i could do it over .
these were some of the best headphones i 've ever owned .
so i would not recommend .
not circumaural but more on-the -ear and very uncomfortable .
no sound isolation , very inefficient drivers and hideous sounding overall !
first of all these are incredibly quiet .
i was shocked at how quiet they are .
second of all , they do n't fit right .
they also feel extremely heavy .
i was waiting this item so ansiuous , but my expectation got disapointed .
the cable is really small , cause is curly .
not very practical if you are planning to use from a distance .
ps : sound is so-so , too .
i only got sound out of both earphones for a couple of days .
sound quality sounds cheap , bass is barely noticeable and everything sounds way off .
it sounded like the music was playing in the other room .
even at full volume the sound quality was very poor - below average .
i do not recommend this product .
they do not come close to sealing over the ear for a snug fit .
but poor ergonomics are forgivable if the sound quality is there .
they are not clear .
i purchased these headphones for my father in law .
i was duped by the rather positive reviews of this product .
the headset prong is a weak part .
what a piece of junk .
the headphones reproduced almost no bass .
the high range had a slight hiss , which was also distracting .
tl ; dr : no low range and high range hiss .
i just opened the box and used the product for the first time .
the left channel is really faint , and the right channel is completely dead .
other than that , they are great !
they are comfortable , the cord length is good , and they look nice .
my ear buds purchased from a local dollar store are a far superior product .
imho , they never sounded more than just okay .
on a friend 's recommendation i bought a set of sennheiser hd280 pros .
it 's very comfortable and feels very nice , but its function is lacking .
it delivers an ok sound .
overall great for listening to certain genres .
i bought them from a store about 2-3 years ago for about $ 80 .
they sound fine , except the level is very low .
also , the pair i bought hardly fit me .
no overly accentuated bass , highs sound pretty good .
i was just displeased about the level and fit .
of course , i 'm stuck with them now .
would not buy again .
my doughters love to play with their dolls with it .
not for professional use .
but , the sound quality and price are a-ok .
not happy with this purchase at all .
nope , i was wrong .
it worked like crap .
the light indicating it was on would flicker and it would only work sometimes .
i am so disappointed and i do not recommend this to anyone !
received the nady condenser microphone but it does not work .
we bought a public address system and it came with a shure sm58 mic .
i am guessing the problem is in the switch - within the mic .
they are not as durable as they should be .
we treated ours nice , but that was n't enough .
no on/off switch , this mic is great but not too separate from others .
i forget about the switch untill i got it .
always a noise when using .
try to change the cable but it does n't help .
another reviewer said it made his voice sound dull , and i would agree .
i replaced it with the blue microphone encore 200 studio grade phantom .
not `` bright '' enough !
fake product , this is not a shure sm58 .
poor , realy bad quality .
turned out to be fake..money down the drain
after web search found that this is indeed a fake.. very disapointed..
this turned out to be one , oddball purchase .
i was sold a counterfeit !
it arrived to me 2nd hand , from a pawn shop in the midwest .
that part 's fine .
i generally like pawns .
turns out , this is what i was dealt .
how i discovered crime was when i experienced malfunction of the unit .
next , i sent it to shure for repair .
was i ever surprised by their response .
`` this is not our microphone ! ''
i got back to the pawn shop ( who sold me it ) .
they were quite co-operative and reasonable .
i rejected that offer .
i insisted on my money back .
then , they promptly refunded to me the entire purchase price .
incidentally , they were not interested in receiving the counterfeit item returned .
apparently , was as useless to them , as to me .
i 've received my microphone .
but it is n't original !
i have one original .
and i compare them .
lettering is different , holder is different .
i was asked to return , but i couldn't .
, - shure amazon ' .
poor intelligibility , nondescript , muddy , slow , sludgy sound .
it just sounds like i have cotton in my ears .
even at $ 100 it 's a rip-off .
i never use these for anything anymore .
you can get a sennheiser e609 for less , and it sounds way better .
if you buy this expecting anything but durability , you 're a goofus !
as time goes by , these become less and less the industry standard .
the design of these mics goes back about 40 years .
a lot has happened with microphone technology during that time .
virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better .
there are much better choices for your money .
on the plus side , both the sm57 and sm58 are nearly bullet-proof .
i know singers rave about the shure sm 58 but this product really blows .
i mean this thing sucks the big one folks .
well , i had bad experience buying this microfone ! ! !
i ` m in a bad situation now ! !
good for the price , which is cheap .
the description promises switchable frequencies .
that is not so .
you take your chances with what you get .
loose after using couple times , has to throw away
the cables was good until the wires disconnected .
easy to fix with a soldering iron but a pain i had to .
cables developed shorts in the ends very soon after minimal use .
used brand new at a gig and failed .
sound engineer told me to throw in the trash .
i was very disappointed with this product .
seriously , this a very cheaply made cable and both ends came loose .
not worth my time or money .
amazon really should do something about products that are substandard .
need to manual fix , luckily i have solder station .
spend the extra money and get something good .
you wo n't regret it like you will if you get this .
stopped working in the middle of filming
i bought 4 of these horrible cables all broke within 1 day
i ca n't recommend this cable .
it 's cheap but , well , it 's not good .
this lasted a few weeks and shorted out .
lasted less than 5 months of once-weekly use before middle pin failed .
le cable ne fonctionne pas
defective and does not work .
maybe you 'll get lucky and get a decent cable for this price .
very poor quality control .
it would potentially ruin a great moment .
do not buy this cable at all .
the cable was broke when i got it .
then when i received a working cable , i still had problems .
it had a shortage in the cable .
save your $ $ and buy something else .
these things are terrible .
they just do n't last .
some have been bad right out of the package .
it stopped working after one week !
i am so disappointed .
very thin , cheap cable .
i ended having to pay my friend for his good cord .
definitely not a good buy .
the soidering in the inside of the terminal broke after 1 month .
when it was working , however it had great sound quality .
i 've learned not to buy pyle as it always sucks
spend the money and get a better one .
i had to throw them all away .
they all shorted after 6-8 months of use .
cable crapped out on a shoot after less than 6 months .
should have spent the extra $ for a better cord .
it simply does n't work .
it is simply unfit for its intended purpose .
amazon offers superior cables for a few bucks more .
this product is so useless .
i bought this 15-20 days back .
sound output gets interupted quite frequently and is so annoying too .
please do n't buy this product .
this mic cable was doa .
i will avoid purchasing pyle products in the future .
now they are useless .
btw , what is the average lifespan of an xlr cable ?
the little snap-in mechanism on the female end of this cable fell apart .
the metal casing and contraption just came out .
i found that strange but i still purchased the product .
it came in a box .
the connectors are not molded ones , they are soldered and screw ones .
hence does not last , and not at all durable .
so i recommend you do n't buy this from deals mania .
the amp was very noisy was not what i was looking for .
the information on this unit is misleading .
needed to have more basic info .
but pyle is a good brand and i have bought other things from them .
good for the money ... ...
i had the pyle unit professionally installed in a ventilated rack system .
upon power-up , the sound was distorted , the unit immediately overheated and failed .
returned to amazon for refund .
a powered mixer is required for balanced inputs .
it has xlr connectors but they are not powered .
after 2 years an agc circuit inside has begun causing trouble .
documentation for this equipment is minimal and difficult to understand .
i am not familiar with bare wire speaker connection in a good amplifier .
this would happen several times a day for a period of a few days .
then the system would work fine for a few days .
still the same problem , but not as often .
at pyle 's suggestion , we ran 12 new gauge wire to the speakers .
so ... ca n't blame the input .
ca n't blame the wiring .
ca n't blame the speakers .
we replaced with a bogen amplifier and had no problems since .
you 'd expect me to give this review a `` zero stars '' rating .
these things are always overly cheap and unplayable .
there are other examples .
would actually give it 0 stars if i could .
spend a little more and get a epiphone sg used or something .
his guitar would n't even tune for me .
frustrated and sent it back .
the guitar did n't work ! !
the amp worked but the darn guitar did not work .
now i have to go to a nearby store to get it fixed .
what the heck is up with that ?
i got this guitar for christmas two years ago .
when i played it , it did n't work .
the jack was broken and the whammy bar did n't fit .
the shoulder strap pieces came completely off .
to top it all off , it sounds horrible .
the pick ups buzz awfully and the whammy bar broke off too .
do n't buy this , it 's not worth your money .
its sad but guitar hero is more fun than this .
we ordered this for christmas for my son .
the guitar itself - if you do n't play it , is beautiful .
oh , by the way , made in china .
as in weighs a lot .
but they 're pretty , if thats all you 're going by .
we 've only used the amplifier at home about 10 times practicing only .
i feel sorry for my daughter who needs this to practice .
i was disappointed to find the neck warped on arrival .
the box was collapsed a little , but the interior packaging was pretty good .
the guitar was not damaged .
we could not adjust the strings up enough to keep them from buzzing .
love amazon 's return policy .
this bass is really cheap .
do yourself a favor and do not buy this bass .
i 'm terribly disappointed !
not to mention my daughter 's dismay !
do n't buy this , especially not through amazon !
junk , right out of the box .
the neck was warped , among other things .
spend a few extra dollars and but a reputable brand .
item arrived pretty quick which was a good thing .
relieved the item is was so excited to play it !
only i could n't play the damn thing .
to me it 's just not excusable !
i consider poor customer service .
why ship a product out to someone with this soo obvious defect ? ? ?
horrible ! ! ! ! !
save a little extra for a quality bass- neck was warped , item returned
bought 2 for gifts .
the first one came with a broken string separator on the neck .
too bad they were bought so far before xmas and could n't be returned .
so 2/2 were very poorly made and/or quality control failed .
do not buy this .
i never write reviews , but this one could n't be avoided .
received one that has very bad use and a loose string .
not at all satisfied .
i paid for a new ... very disappointed .
we bought this package recently .
so we returned it back immediately .
do n't buy it .
it came with a busted pickup and i had to send it back .
i was not happy with this purchase .
upon unpacking everything , i noticed that the instructional dvd was n't included .
could i really learn to play bass at 30 ?
i was excited to try .
two days later , when the new tuner arrived ( got ta love prime !
the nagging thought i had of having received a repackaged dud was confirmed .
i bought this music package for my daughter school .
very upset with this product .
got this for my brother for christmas as a beginners guitar .
the amp is n't bad for a beginner though .
the frets are also too sharp to play comfortably according to my brother
bass guitar neck broke in half first day received .
did not play strings were rusted and the amp made a loud huming noise .
my daughter was very excited to recieve her new bass kit .
we realized the neck of the bass was warped and bent .
so we sent it back for a replacement .
we received the new bass kit in a day .
the amp did not work at all .
needless to say , we returned everything for a refund .
was not happy with this product .
we will be looking elsewhere for a new one .
i received this bass on christmas eve .
then , when i was tuning it for the first time .
the top g string snapped when it hit f # .
it got out of tine few day after i got the order .
this is my first review and feel bad its a negative one .
after shopping around for months i finally found the bass i wanted .
the look of gold on dark blue sold me .
pretty hard to play for beginner bass .
it 's too expensive for the quality it provides .
i suggest that you look up craigslist for used bass and amp sale .
yamaha and fender squire make better beginner bass than silvertone package .
everything was included in the picture , easy transaction .
the tuner does not work period .
i bought this for my son for christmas .
obviously the quality control from this manufacturer is poor .
amazon 's return proces on the other hand is 1st rate .
hopefully the next one arrives in good condition .
thanks silvertone , thanks allot .
update ... the new arrived in different packaging this time .
perhaps it was repackaged ?
the new one works and looks fine .
worst buy i have ever made .
my advice to to never even glance towards the picture .
lol it was warped and unplayable .
had to send back .
please , its not worth it !
i got this bass for my son and this is what he wrote .
the bass wo n't go in and out of the bag easily .
the tuner broke in a week and the video does n't really help .
the strap wore out in couple of months and snapped while i was playing .
i bought this with an interest to play bass .
sadly this bass is n't even good for beginners .
the amp and accessories included are n't bad .
i did n't find the instructional video to be that helpful at all .
the bass bag has no padding at all .
now for the bass itself .
the issue is that the frets were not properlly aligned .
the bass was unplayable at this point .
but look at it this way .
you know you will spend more money down the road .
think of it as a long term investment .
basically , this is all a word of caution .
talk to the pros about this first and get their help .
but $ 300 needs to be your minimum .
i 'm am extremely happy with my decisions and regret absolutely nothing .
i could n't be happier .
the guitar was new and looks expensive .
but the amp was smaller than i expected but worked fine .
after that i noticed the guitar buzzing a lot .
i try loosening the truss rod but it did n't change a thing .
i took it to a guitar shop and they said the damage was irreversible .
i was angry to say the least .
however amazon did a great job taking care of returning the product .
only 20 19 are delivered during purchase .
please repay me one for 1. bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
absolute piece of junk .
do not buy under any circumstances .
had to take it to be repaired 2 days after getting it .
and the neck also has to be adjusted .
the amp is the only thing that worked properlly .
this is a misleading advertisement ... sure , there 's 37 keys .
but they forget to tell you the keys are miniature .
my son ordered this to add to his music program .
i was disappointed that this keyboard does not register key velocity .
other than that , it is fine for what it is .
this is a perfectly functional midi controller .
it 's not velocity sensitive , but for many applications this does n't matter .
the problem with this keyboard is that it 's just too small .
yes , the description describes them as `` mini keys . ''
i knew when i saw the box that i had made a horrible mistake .
this item is obviously intended almost solely for children .
definitely not for adults due to its toddler size .
the keyboard does a nice job as a usb unit .
we typically can not launch iphoto without crashing unless we trash three catalog files .
crashing and losing user data is never acceptable .
apple , more than anyone , is supposed to know this .
you 've read the other glowing reviews .
you 've seen the 4 and 5 star ratings .
okay boys and girls , now do you really want the truth ?
not what i ordered .
the picture provided by the seller is not what i got .
amazon should look at this particular sale site .
i have already returned the wrong items you sent me .
just return my money please .
the stem of the mic is not properly connected to the body .
be weary of that before you order these
no bass very cheap plastic terrible audio quality
sound worse then headphones that came with the smartphones .
these are for giant heads
left ear stopped working after three months .
sound quality was nice while it lasted but not worth the money .
not meant for long-term or heavy use , i guess .
these are not the same k240s i used to use .
sound quality is only mediocre .
had to return the volume is too low on these
either one of these would be a better value .
not satisfied the product did not work .
the sound keeps cracking .
not muffled around the ears .
this is not worth the purchase .
it 's a giant box on your head .
i 've only used the headphones a few times .
i wish now i had n't .
the problem has quickly progressed .
money wasted ... do n't waste yours .
very light and convenient .
however , bass sound is very weak .
happy with the sound but they broke after 11 months of moderate use .
the sound quality is less than i expected from akg .
i grew up in the 80 's with older pair that kicked butt .
these are not the same drivers and it is reflected in the sound dynamics .
low end is not there .
fuller sound is not there .
it has been crunched and degraded with these earphones .
i feel i wasted my money .
be careful and look for the bigger drivers in the akg headphones !
straight from the box i liked this headset .
my ears were warmer than i like but not enough to limit use .
cable length was ample for my needs .
for comfort and convenience this is a well above average headset .
it was all downhill from there .
in all the music i tried , definition was lacking .
koss sportapro bought from amazon recently for $ 21 did better .
i was rather disappointed .
as a bass head , i was disappointed .
they have no bass !
the difference is clearly audible , especially when you flip the headphones on backwards .
these head phones are not very loud .
they 're simply ok not great .
purchased i a reatail store .
outatanding for the price i paid .
definitely something worth the money .
they are a great and affordable choice .
they are not bad at all .
they are comfortable , and are easy on the head too .
good thing i have long hair , would n't want people seeing this .
you get what you pay for .
i gave them to my son for his personal music .
would not purchase item .
just out of warranty .
this review will be short but powerful and accurate unlike these headphones .
the akg k 240 maybe the worst headphones ive ever heard .
they are pure garbage .
not loud at all !
ca n't hear the details of your mix very well .
i would go with a different par of headphones .
the sound is good but they get uncomfortable pretty quick .
not studio quality at all .
quite disappointed , there is no base to it .
if you 're looking for sound you wo n't find it here .
these headphones are not studio quality .
honestly these are not worth 60 bucks .
they 're not bad headphones , but they are nowhere near worth $ 60 .
after only about a week of use the right headphone suddenly stopped working !
pros : comfortable and good sound .
cons : none in the short term .
after just a couple months the right ear went out completely .
gave it a one star because sound came out of the speakers .
the bass is horrible at all volume levels .
ear phones did n't last 3 months in the studio before jack was cracking
i am so disappointed !
very cheap build quality and muddy sound .
it has not enough bottom or lows and the right side breaks easy .
these headphones had a lot of good reviews , but they 're just mediocre .
that means that the music tracs are n't downgraded .
for me , these headphones are just not ambient enough .
i like it for the price , but i do n't love it .
they look cool , but they 're quiet .
sound awful , poor build quality , cheap materials .
people , i do n't understand you .
the quality of sound coming out of this headset , is simply horribe .
are you kidding me ?
sounds like an empty can .
i got them from guitar center based on recommendation .
i 've took them back within 2 days .
i could n't believe anyone would write a good review for this .
your standards must be super low .
the rest are just toys .
ended up repairing them myself .
mine broke after 1 week - lost the center part of the stereo image .
sounded great until then tho !
ask to return money , one channel is broken ! ! ! !
i ca n't really agree with any of those statements .
not to my liking at all .
the sound is not as nice as my friends older original k240 's .
in fact i am not happy at all with these .
the highs are slightly reed like and the lows are just not there .
well they are there but lacking the tone and depth of my other headphones .
i 'll break them in a little and see if that helps .
item was rated highly for its bass sound and its range .
for all of the engineers ... theses are not your old akg cans .
if i could give these new cheap akg cans a negative star i would .
dont use with your cell phone , the volume is n't very high .
these things do not amplify the sound like i thought .
i returned them and bought a pair of sony mdr-v6 's .
a bit higher in price but worth it in my opinion .
i own a pair of sennheiser hd 280 's that are also spectacular headphones .
inside it 's cheap plastic that fractures easily .
the headset when twisted as the wiring right on it inside the ear piece !
i had to boost my normal volume by 25 % and still had problems .
i had to return them .
these headphones are the cheapest things i have ever bought .
not worth any of the money they charge for them .
do n't bother spending a dime on these .
i 've had these for a while now and i still love them .
warranty lasts for two years , so i guess i 'm out of luck .
i think i might go with the sony mdr7506 or mdrv6 next .
i wish these guys had worked out .
very quiet , loose fit ... and i have a big head .
bought this in 2011. sound quality is excellent , neutral and detailed .
however , build quality and design is questionable .
not sure if this will stand up to heavy use .
in the end , this just did n't meet my criteria .
and they are much larger and heavier than i had imagined them .
they appeared well designed and made .
they simply were n't my cup of tea .
i used these headphones in my small guitar studio for a very short time .
headphones are a useful tool for guitarists when trying to learn solos by ear .
these headphones are useless for this particular application .
right out the bat : professional ?
lol this is not even close to a professional earphone .
not by a mile .
you can hear everyone around you .
there is no bass , no deep sound , nada .
i particularly do n't like it .
save yourself trouble ( and pony up some money ) and buy another model .
so the overall quality is inconsistent
weak.. sound is so low not worth buying .
i wish i never got these .
i 'm just being honest .
i wear headphones every day to listen to on-line radio .
i bought a pair of headphones that got good reviews in several audio forums .
the sound quality & fit was great .
but i thought that they broke too easily .
i shopped around , & these akg 's had a lot of greats reviews .
they came today & they are awful ! !
they problem is they are n't sound deadening .
and the background noise was overwhelming ! !
i paid $ 57.99 last year .
but they 've went up to $ 99.99 ! !
so i found them on ebay for $ 49.99 w/ free shipping .
i find that the cord on hp is always the 1st thing to go .
i 've had to replace the cord on my other set a few times .
so the cord being $ 1.99 to replace is important .
which in my experience is never cheap .
but i was disappointed .
the headphones i received really do n't seem much to brag about .
i do n't think these necessarily hold up to the akg reputation .
on the positive , the quick-release cord is a cool idea .
disappointing in both sound and material .
fell apart a week after purchasing them , waste of money
the sound is high fidelity but way too muted
i do not think that is reliable material .
these do n't come close to living up to the name .
flashy design , but over all just a cheap product and disappointing .
felt cheap , not up to akg standards .
do not think they will last long .
after only 2 months of use the cables are almost completely worn out .
sound is interrupted often and frequently cuts out .
these headphones are ok if you are not looking for anything fancy .
on the plus side , they are comfortable to wear .
this is a personal rating .
headphones are extremely subjective .
did n't like the sound and needs a big amp to drive it .
your mileage may vary .
decent while they last .
i used them on one 20-30 hr .
they only come on now if i turn the volume all the way up .
i will , but it wo n't be akg .
note : i did n't buy them from this current seller .
it 's true that this headphone sounds good .
so.. there is clearly a quality problem here .
now what upsets me more is that the support is not very cooperative .
i got ta tell you , it 's disappointing .
very disappointed with bass .
i 'm no `` basshead '' .
i love all kinds of music from popular to acoustic to classical .
any attempt to boost the bass will result in fluttering sounds of driver excursion .
flat should mean the frequency response is flat throughout the music frequency spectrum .
wanted a good pair of studio mixing headphones .
kind of useless headphones .
however , i know these are very good
disappointed with build quality and long burn in time .
perfect for professionals but not casual listening .
dont buy it.chinese junkbroke after one month.no service from the company .
my second biggest complaint is the amount of bleed .
those headphones are a disappointment in delivering that .
sadly i gave these away to a friend .
apparently , muddy is the new sound of headphones these days .
these sound like they are covered in a down pillow .
so here is the deal .
i got these headphones to use mostly from my home/dorm room .
it appealed to me in a couple of ways .
first off they are semi-open which is usually my favorite design .
the finely feature is they have a wide array of replaceable parts .
sadly these `` great value headphones '' are actually a waste of money .
it is so wide that it just falls off my head .
it would not even create a seal on my head !
( still small but not abnormally ! )
my girlfriends exact words were `` these are crap ... .send them back . ''
that is exactly what i plan to do !
i will never buy these again .
the headphones that arrived do not have a detachable mini xlr cord .
it is not the same as in the box .
this is quite a shame because otherwise the headphones sound great .
as far as sound goes they 're fantastic , especially for their price .
paid a decent amount for these headphones about 2 years ago .
within a month , the left speaker stopped working .
three weeks later , the other one stopped working .
i just purchased these akg k 240 headphones through amazon .
the ones i got did n't say made in austria .
the box it came in said made in china .
even my cheap $ 15 sony earbuds gives me this information .
unfortunately this product was surprisingly disappointing .
some distortions in the bass frequencies .
with everything turned up `` to 11 '' , they were n't loud enough .
amazon was great about the return , even though both sets had been opened .
i am sending them back .
not what i expected .
seller good , product bad .
i have worked in radio and occasional music mixing throughout the years .
evidently , those models were made in austria .
nothing could be further from the truth .
but poor dynamic range .
they are just no fun for work or play .
that 's when something changed .
all will beat these handily and get your feet tapping .
use these maybe for shortwave radio ?
so- my best deduction- something happened on the way to china ... ..
the m50s blow both out of the water .
i was so underwhelmed when i first wore these it was shocking .
these headphones lack clarity , they have no bass , and are extremely overpriced .
some akgs have some bass , but these have very little .
they are just uninspiring , and it really degrades the music listening experience .
get the m50s , you will thank me later .
i found the mediums and highs to be very washed out and unclear .
additionally , these headphones will not get loud at all .
headphones fell apart after about 3 months of use .
the product was n't thrown about or abused , but got regular daily use .
as far as sound quality , it was very good for open-air headphones .
just wish the quality had been a bit better .
i paid 93.08 cents after taxes for these .
the quality of the product has fallen considerably since manufacturing moved to china .
i wo n't be buying akg headphones again in the near future .
i would have rated these as a 4 or 5 until they broke .
they 're still under warranty , but what a disappointment .
update : attempting to get service with akg/harmon under warranty .
no response to email for one week .
i bought myself a pair of these and loved them .
i wound up buying my wife and sone a set as well .
very tinny sounding and this is on quality tracks ... not mp3 's .
if you like bass/bass accentuation do n't bother .
the only music i can really stand hearing with these is classical .
also , they are surprisingly quiet .
i am surprised at how many positive reviews there are of these headphones .
they just do n't do it for me .
i 'm sending them back .
i had been anxious to try these from positive reviews around the internet .
right out of the box , i was sorely disappointed .
they do not sound either bright or rich .
but in a/b comparisons , these k240s cans do not measure up .
they sound like a sore throat feels -- scratchy , not smooth and clear .
definitely not worth the money to me .
it is a real two-star disappointment for me .
it doesnt work with the other equipment we purchased
stopped working within 30 days of use .
tried to return it but the company wo n't take it back .
i ordered the full size xlr and soldered on a mini 3 pin .
it simply did not have an acceptable level of signal output .
`` added gain = added noise '' ... always !
i did an a-b comparison to my sm-58 and there really was no comparison .
not for sound quality , nor for output .
this thing looks like it will take some serious physical abuse and not break .
it 's not going to go flying off if you jump around a lot .
and it looks to me like it will fit just about any size head .
it 's pretty adjustable .
maybe it is not designed for that .
and if that is the case , i regret rating it so low .
maybe i got a faulty one ?
other reviewers seemed to like the unit .
but i will go with a condenser mic next time .
for what it 's worth , shure is a good company .
and amazon has a liberal return policy .
lots of cord noise , very little voice .
have to turn gain almost to max to hear at all .
not happy at all with it .
boom is n't long enough and there was n't enough gain .
i 'm returning and purchasing something else .
received it , tried it , and sent it back within ten minutes .
whoever designed it must be from some other planet .
i could n't stand the thing clawing my head like a giant crab .
there is no way i could ever wear this thing .
my advice is to adjust it back into its box and return it .
i much prefer my sm58 .
i really liked this microphone when it first arrived .
we were doing sound for a reoccurring theater-style production with more singing than talking .
neither talking nor singing into this microphone sounded `` good '' .
i ended up returning this .
head set mini connector wh20 & the 2ft.wa302 [ ta4f ] both are female .
not good , unless you do n't need decent voice quality .
this microphone is not for the professional or the serious amateur .
i tried it out , was seriously disappointed , and sent it right back .
there are good products out there at affordable prices .
this is not one of them .
after exchanging the chip for another one , i had the exact same problems .
this time i 'm returning everything .
it 's not worth the hassle .
i bought the bundled package from costco.com .
the bundle includes 2 mics and the 2221 song cartridge .
very happy i purchased from costco because of their return policy !
the first one i received did not even work .
received the second one .
the wireless submic would work intermittently .
it would work only after i take the batteries in and out .
minor inconveince because the kids loved playing with it .
i even purchased 3 additional chips for the unit .
it is now 54 days after i have received the unit .
the sound has suddenly stopped .
just video , no sound .
it also decided to turn on or off when it feels like it .
sometimes it turns on , sometimes it does n't .
costco , here i come again .
i am really hoping that my two units were the exception .
the website is also very unclear about how to order more karaoke mp3s .
this `` karaoke in a microphone '' system is small and extremely portable .
you can carry it from party to party .
therefore , you must be familiar with the songs in order to sing them .
even in this singing mode , you will not get back-up singer 's vocal .
pitch adjustment is a great feature of karaoke .
alternative rock vol 2 due to manufacturing defect with some units .
many of the songs can not play .
it looks like it 's made out of aluminum .
a plastic housing box of decent quality is included .
not of the quality i was hoping for .
make sure you try it in real-life before you but it .
so , i sent it in for repair per their instructions .
but , casio repair service is the worst i 've ever seen .
they 're even worse than best buy & that 's pretty bad .
they rec 'd my item for warranty work on 11/23/04 .
at first i was told the turnaround for the repair was 5-10 business days .
then i was told that starts from the log date .
they did n't even get around to logging it in until 12/7/04 ! ! !
i may never see my product again .
got two and neither of them did the sound activation work .
strobe light seemed fragile and not very solid .
when i started using it , it was very nice , bright and responsive .
this light failed the third time we used it .
i am very disappointed in the quality .
i would not recommend this product .
please learn from my mistake and find another competitor 's product .
i 'm not surprised .
this is my first and my last chauvet product .
it 's very frustrating ! !
i was excited to get this strobe light based on reviews .
it worked right away , strobes fine , but a little off beat .
the fuse is fine .
it would be a good strobe light if it worked .
this strobe is poorly made .
arrived damaged and with ?
made of light and fragile plastic .
knobs on back do not have hard stops so feel cheap too .
i contacted the chauvet tech support and they could n't get it to work .
so it goes sometimes , right ?
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me .
i 'm still in the market for a quality , controllable strobe ... .
this strobe is awesome while it works .
it is extremely bright the and great to have as a dj .
i have come into ownership of three of the lights brandnew .
one i bought off amazon , the other two were given .
after just 3 dances , only one light works now .
light # 1 does n't do anything .
however , it does work when plugged into a strobe controller .
light # 3 still works .
this item was bought for a christmas gift .
item was opened on christmas day .
yes , i believe that 's exactly what they should do .
it worked out of the box perfectly , once .
i did , however , expect it to work more than 5 minutes .
the next day at the party , the steady strobe failed completely .
i 'm pretty disappointed .
this is a neat gadget in that it can produce sounds of various instruments .
but if you want to learn guitar just buy a real one .
we received this player as a family gift for christmas .
i would not recommend you spending the money on this product .
i bought this kareoke for x-mas with my 11 year old sister in mind .
i was very dissapointed because the sound quality is horrible .
the volume is very low and you can barely here yourself through the microphone .
the monitor is even worst , you can barely see the lyrics .
i rebought it thinking it had just been defected but nope !
it 's just no good .
i received two of these speaker , but one did n't work .
its ok but wo n't really take alot of power .
i had to return them ...
however , this one does not quite fit the bill .
i was held in place by a small layer of glue .
also , the handles are made of plastic which rattle during bass sounds .
the leg completely broke off when i was loading in to a venue .
the vinyl covering was peeling off as well .
the speakon connector broke .
the speaker is mounted using basic screws , and not hurricane nuts .
had a thin piece of insulation for damping material .
the wooden brace inside was broken off .
i know that pyle can do better than this .
i hope they fix these problems in an updated version .
there are other enclosures for 40 bucks more that are not so bad .
great sounding sub for the price .
i bought this subwoofer to share the load with another powered subwoofer .
i wanted something economical and functional for small dance hall settings .
the product description said it had a built in crossover .
therefore , i expected it to play nothing but bass .
however , these pyle subs do n't .
to my disappointment , i heard vocals !
no subwoofer with a built-in crossover should pump mid-range frequencies .
final grade : f .
it sounds like the woofer has `` popped '' and will need replaced .
i bought a pair of pyle pro speakers a few years ago .
when arrived one of the speakers were was just hanging in the hole .
i sent it back and received a new one and everything was great .
since then i had to sell them .
got them the next day through amazons one day service .
but the good news stops there .
so now i have sent all the speakers back .
ordered this as recently as 9/14/2011 and did not get headphones .
this was the model number i came up with after some research .
the wiring on the jacks are a joke and wired backwards .
2 out of six had different woofers in them .
i am going to try and make these sound better and will report back !
i returned this mic for a full refund .
i purchased and had to return .
it wo n't work .
btw , i am a slow learner .
there is no battery pack in the blisterpack .
( i wonder whether this is because it is a plug-in-power mic ) .
the frequency response is unacceptable .
i also do n't like the clip .
step # 1 of instructions stated to remove stylus prior to mounting to headshell .
i will have to purchase a new stylus to complete review .
i have a shure m97xe cartridge and the stylus removes with minimal effort .
something was wrong with the m78s .
after reading all the reports on this cartridge i decided to try it anyway .
so , i do n't understand why this mic wo n't work .
i 'm not happy with this mic .
i bought another lav mic from giant squid lab and it was better .
did n't work with my video cam , i had to return it .
the microphone does not change the quality of the recording in the least .
i purchased 3 lavaliers and the sony ecm-cs10 tie-clip-style omnidirectional lavalier was the worst .
i keeped the other two and sent this one back .
do not buy this .
pretty misleading if you ask me ! ! ! !
another sucky sony product .
this is a sub-quality mic .
it is much worse than the ones built into the recorder .
it sounds tinny with a very narrow voice range .
i expected a sony product to be better than this .
this one records audio that is thin and tinny .
too bad , sony .
s , not work for me .
if you ever lose the microphone clip , you are out of luck ! !
i have had zero success replacing the lavalier clip .
this is a great microphone .
i can not use it as intended because i lost the clip .
not worth anything to me now ! ! !
this mic is serviceable , but not great .
it has a very limited pick-up pattern and picks up each channel separately .
i would suggest going with a better quality mic for most recording purposes .
for my setup i need lavs that run on their own battery power .
i bought this to use with my laptop for voip ( i.e .
oovoo , skype , etc .
) , because the microphones built into my laptop stopped working .
also i am currently eying the sound blaster x-fi go !
the required battery box is not included .
it is plug-in power only .
i tried this wireless lapel mic with the portable pa systems .
this product did not work and i would not recommend it .
you pay for what you get .
i bought this to use it for classroom lecture .
the receiver is good but the microphone is just a waste .
you have to really put it close to your mouth to be heard .
forget about clipping it to lapel .
however the transmitter and receiver are good if you can find a compatible microphone .
this is an unreliable unit .
sound is not good at all .
maybe i should change the battery .
saying i hate it might be strong .
maybe i got a bad one .
i do n't really care for the 3/4 plug .
just not for me .
i had this wireless lapel clip on for a while .
it does n't catch vocals as expected .
therefore why should it work as a microphone & camcorder set ?
i am not very convinced .
getting this is a waste of money .
did n't really work at all .
preface : we should have contacted the seller and asked for an exchange/refund .
however , we were in a time crunch and did n't have that option .
there were some reviews that stated that these at least worked .
however , i found that to not be true .
my recommendation ... buy an azden mic instead !
the inner brackets were broken off and bouncing around inside .
i 'm good with my hands so i decided to repair it .
while doing the work i realized i baught a pyle of crap .
the woofers are so cheap and light .
the particle board is thin and weak .
i reglued them to their inner walls .
they could have done a better job .
the wires are so thin i hope they do n't melt and catch fire .
i have a single 15 '' 3 way speaker that has more bass .
damn it the two twelves in my car have more bass .
when i received the guitar and unzipped the bag i was in shock .
they were brown with dirt .
i 'll never buy used on amazon again .
people must be really desperate for money !
it will not create any data base
this data base software is not easy to use .
i should have researched better .
i did n't try to enter any information .
win 10 users - better to use something more up to date .
where is the `` get started quickly '' section they speak of .
i threw it in the garbage .
needs to be updated .
otherwise it would be a handy little program .
did not work on my lap $ 10.00 .
dose a wonderful job for those who do not need relational databases .
easy to understand and use .
this is old program ! ! ! !
there is no network capability .
practically useless when u want to use it for ur business .
the next day i entered more .
so now i only have 20 entries instead of 120 ! !
that 's just my guess .
it 's nearly worthless .
if you like simple stuff this database wo n't disappoint you .
i found it to restrictive and do n't use it .
could be my last amazon perchase .
this was n't what i thought , it knocked my keyboard out .
because it was not the right wattage .
does n't work for casio
it did not fit the casio privia 320 as it was supposed .
it was too small .
the cord does not work at all for the px-110 !
it also does n't match the picture .
wow it dropped to half the price i bought it for .
now i have the hassle of returning it and finding a new one .
item sent is not what is described or pictured .
it is not casio brand and looks completely different .
i will be disputing this purchase & charge for a full refund
it did not come as pictured .
the product i received did n't have the wall pluggin .
was really confused , not at all what i thought i was ordering .
then connection did n't fit the piano at all .
do you have in stock the adapter that actually fits a casio cdp 120 ?
the adapter is light as a feather and way too `` plastiky '' feeling .
it inspires nothing close to the idea of quality as the oem version .
worse yet , the polarity was reversed .
it would have fried my keyboard if i did n't check .
c-mon amazon ! ! !
you guys are really starting to disappoint me now .
i bought two for my casio privia 555-r which is almost obsolete .
they did not fit .
probably for another model .
the adapter i received was not at all what is pictured on this page .
all you will receive in the mail is disappointment and frustration .
the adapter that i got was not the one pictured .
it did not say `` casio '' anywhere on it .
however , it did work with my keyboard so i kept it .
i bought one of these to control my roland mc-303 sequencer .
it generates a `` err 02 '' after pressing a few keys .
will not make music for more then a few seconds .
i they tried a radium 49 and it worked like a charm .
i will never buy an m-audio product again .
you are actually advised to *wash your hands* after handling .
will you find the warning displayed on the box ?
nope , it is at the bottom of the last page of the manual .
who knows what they do support .
do n't buy it .
i returned the keystation 49e and replaced it with an edirol pcr-50 .
clearly this microphone is for highly specialized purposes .
this is not for non-esoteric uses .
the cables are pretty basic , but they work fine .
you get a nice padded case to keep everything in .
my favorite part of this kit is the inclusion of two pg81 condenser mics .
these are not only great for cymbals , but instruments and vocals too .
i can do that on my own .
terrible sounding mics i simply could not get a decent recording from these mics .
for my use this a horrible mic .
i guess if you were just recording then maybe it is fine .
sound reinforcement , forget about it .
this thing chews through records while back-cueing .
the best stylus i have used is the jico n44-7 .
i bought this as a choir mic .
it does not pick up the low tones .
amazon 's size is for the shipping box not the mic .
very bad on amazon 's part .
these are interesting items .
we have n't really used them to their fullest capability .
when we do we 'll write more review
mixer works by combining audio from different sources .
item might of been defective , item returned .
did not like the way my guitar rested on the leg pegs .
just went with the amazon basic stand for $ 13 .
it will work for what i needed .
i really do n't understand how these stands have such stellar reviews on here .
it makes me really skeptical about the trustworthiness of the reviews for these stands .
luckily , it was n't damaged but the stand was clearly failing .
they 're guitar stands , for crying out loud .
attachments : i 've added a pic of the 2 broken leg locks .
the absolute worst stand i have ever owned .
after very light usage it collapses .
upon opening one of the legs a piece of plastic broke off .
not worth hanging an instrument on .
had to send it back .
it might have been amazon warehouse 's fault , but this was a dud .
not going to risk that kind of behavior with my $ 2000 martin .
looks like a hercules is on the shopping list for me .
the locking mechanism failed and the guitar fell .
lifetime warranty my booty .
it 's only meant to be used temporarily like on stage .
folds up nice and the locking system works well .
the hercules hanging stands are much better in my opinion .
ultimate is the worst company i have ever had the to deal with .
ultimate is the worst company i have ever had the to deal with .
sent it back as it was not sturdy enough for my acoustic .
it looks cool , and works ok for electric guitars .
i do not recommend this product .
this guitar stand was great .
it almost fit in my gig bags and was fun to open .
it 's much easier to show .
in any case , it no longer works now .
i 've owned some hercules gear for a couple years now .
i bought two of these about 7 years ago .
they seemed really good .
they were light weight and the plastic does n't scratch the guitar .
the neck broke one time .
i think these stands get wobbly with age .
the under-guitar support arms stick out too far for a solid-body instrument .
the cord tends to get tangled on them .
i have many of these , they are great .
called ultimate again and they are now sending me a complete new stand .
this really just is too unstable to be very useful .
it is compact , but i have used much better stands of comparable size .
while you 're trying to screw something in ?
all in all very poorly assembled .
never will buy this brand again .
the price they charged this is not worth it .
not very happy with this box .
a latch broke on the second use .
returning and getting the skb instead .
seemed sturdy otherwise , just needs better latches .
so , my search continues for a better-quality stand than this one .
thanks for that , at least .
the clasps are now on the rack , not the lids .
this product is not worthy .
the platic and carbon parts are easiliy crack .
do not buy this item .
this is just a piece of junk .
will be seeking warranty service but will sell immediately afterwards .
will buy another pair of on-stage stands ( and for much less too ) .
already holes and small nicks throughout .
i have owned these stands for over 8 years .
i have to accept that the ultimate quality is just not there anymore .
i 've had these stands for years .
their durability is the best feature about them .
in fact the telelock mechanism is a great innovation too .
first & foremost is that these stands rattle , and not softly .
i have 4 of them , and they all rattle .
the frequency range in which they rattle is roughly 69-98hz .
the sound clearly comes from the telelock mechanism .
therefore you always buy more than what you need . )
here 's the other huge problem with these stands - ultimate support 's support .
this is seriously unprofessional to drop the ball this badly .
i have not even received a notice that a new stand was shipped .
i 'm hoping she will resolve this situation to satisfaction .
i will update my review after the outcome .
the music was muted and gargled .
would not recommend to anyone with a decent system .
noisier than my consumer turntable 's built-in preamp .
returned it immediately ... the noise floor was something like -45db .
my search for a decent cheap phono preamp continues ...
makes a loud buzzing sound when the cue lever is up on my turntable .
pretty sure there are other reliable options for the same price .
at least it looks cool and is made in the usa .
obviously based on the other reviews , many people do n't have any issues .
i learned even a neighbors electronic dog fence can cause interference .
it 's better than a $ 10 preamp , but not by much .
this item is certainly not for audio enthusiasts .
as the volume increased the hum became a screech unbearble to hear .
i am returning this piece of junk .
it still had a buzz even after grounding the table .
it 's not worth the asking price over a pyle .
stopped working after 2 weeks of use .
this is not a professional product .
the design is poor .
you start out with the case as in the picture which is sideways .
all in all a poorly built case .
after using it for a short while the unit started to get intermittent .
so i opened the box .
what did i find ?
i guess rolls want their customers to do the qa .
well that is the last rolls product i shall own .
it looks like they do not really do any qa .
there has to be a no-star option for this product .
the first mic i received was awful .
the company exchanged the first mic with a non-working mic .
i am not able to get my refund from anywhere ! ! ! ! !
$ 250 wasted ! ! !
this was a counterfeit .
only cable for what ?
apparently it was a fake
inside the microphone was broken when i got it
most of them are beat to hell but they work .
the biggest difference though is the feedback from stage monitors .
that was my first clue it was fake .
buyer beware of beta 58 's posted for lower than retail price .
the one i received was a fake knock off made in china .
you ca n't beat a beta 58 if it 's the real thing .
i went and bought one in a store after this and it is awesome .
that was the good news .
the bad is that it is a fake .
a chinese knock off .
how can i tell ?
1. the weight - first thing i noticed was that it felt very light .
real beta 's are well fixed in place .
5. yellow band around cable at bottom of capsule .
this is just a few things i was able to spot .
weight as i said was the first indicator .
box packaging velcro strip and bag all ok along with guarantee .
i would get a full refund .
at time of writing waiting on that .
otherwise these do the job ok at a fair price .
i expect better from at though .
update : they definitely do n't make these like they used to .
this one lasted 3 short rehearsals .
there 's no point in buying the audio technica ones anymore .
they make so much noise and do n't last .
get the aftermarket or custom ones if you can find them .
the quality has totally disappeared compared to sennheiser and shure .
but again for the price you can not go wrong
good enough for a 'house party ' as someone mentioned before me .
in other words , it 'kinda ' works but not really .
the lamp housing itself is solid though .
would not buy again .
i 'd advise against not buying this .
i would not recommend these lights to anyone .
i think they are junk .
price not consistent with product .
low beam , heavy .
i do not think it was worth the price that we paid .
i bought these lights as a pair for use as fixed spotlights .
the led units last far longer and project a higher quality light beam .
not anywhere near what a 12 '' disco ball needs for proper reflection .
this thing is worthless .
a flashlight puts out more light .
i 'm returning it .
this was part of a special gift for my wife .
they should not promise something that they can not provide .
i do not recommend these lights .
honestly , i purchased a case like this from skb years ago .
i bought mine from ebay at some cheaper price than here .
also a cheap strap is not included for d-rings .
earlier reviewer mentioned one of two locking clips can have a padlock .
the one i got is rather snug fit clip .
none is for padlock .
the inside has two shapes - one for sax and another for neck .
i thought i would get the green ones plus the rest .
i would send it back if it did n't take so much work .
well that was a waste of money .
gave me the worst blisters i 've ever had ! !
be careful to buy from music123 .
amazon suggested me to contact music123 first .
i did two phone calls .
i bought two sets of these and i am disappointed .
beware these strings the 10 ga are weak !
broke before i could even set them up .
broke before i could even put all of them on .
that goes for these as well .
it was just black wrap , not black splatter .
a little disappointed but i used it anyway .
the `` splatter '' is non-existent !
the grips are solid black .
i should have listened to the other reviewers .
this was not the only one with a color issue .
red & black checker were really pink & black .
the entire order is being returned !
since when is pink red ?
someone needs to rewrite the product description .
i 'm not giving a 13 year old boy pink drum stick grips .
i should have listened to previous reviewers with regards to color discrepancies .
i was very disappointed .
audible hum at seemingly any gain .
tested this with multiple sources and outputs .
felt nice and solid , and the balance controls had center detents .
that 's the good news .
within months the case is falling apart !
i 'm done with this company ...
i purchased a protec tenor sax case 4 or 5 years ago .
i 've been pleased with it - until yesterday .
it was a soft landing , so i did n't think twice about it .
but , the small drop bent the top post on my selmer mark vi .
it 's in the shop now .
i previously perchased the protec alto saxophone backpack .
it works great and is well balanced .
the tenor sax case is a disaster !
1. backpack strap sold separately .
2. the case is heavy and off balance .
my case is 2 months old .
the tension is some acceptable and so is the playability .
i expected much more for the price i paid .
i ordered this case for my five year old yamaha yts62 tenor sax .
i was using an old protec case in which the sax fit fine .
but , this case did not have a slot for the neck .
i did not like having to tuck the neck inside the bell .
there were no other problems with this case .
i liked the green color of this case and ordered it .
i was very disappointed that my saxophone would not fit into it .
also the main pad under the belt was coming unglued .
so , i returned it to amazon .
so i ordered this one .
it came in today and my yamaha tenor fits in it .
in additon , protech should also offer the xl case in other colors .
had this case for approximately 2 months and the right case latch broke off .
not impressed with this product .
still waiting on the gator warranty dept to get back in touch with me .
when i first bought this case i thought it would work just fine .
definitely not very durable .
unable to zipper close as it did not fit our 3/4 standard bass .
it looked well constructed but in the end useless .
clips get weak and break off .
the foam fitting was defective , and i had to return it .
i normally like gator products a lot .
the tremolo effect can barely be heard !
it 's sturdier , smaller , and actually can be heard .
esta cuerdas de bajo no ofrecen calidad ni en su sonoridad ni su resistencia .
did not fit well for my jupiter sax .
i 'm sorry i bought it .
i have already sent it back .
it is no good.. too large and does n't for horn solidly .
it 's not safe .
feels like a wood frame and little material .
i 'll have to buy a new case asap .
i bought these for my wonderful yamaha fg700s .
they even come with ball ends ! ) .
complete frustration and complete waste of money !
back to my reliable steel strings .
please do not waste your money and time .
e string broke while tuning .
do n't waste your money .
the amp , however , sounded great for the 15 minutes it worked .
this is a profile 88 mouthpiece , not a traditional vandoren 5rv lyre .
the facing is completely different .
these strings feel terrible when you are used do dada ej46 .
tone is not bad , but it 's not playable at all .
they were extremely bright and sounded awesome when slapping .
the strings sound even more awesome on a jazz bass with both pickups on .
i like the v12 reeds better .
i love v-12 reeds , and use them exclusively now .
i tried the 56 rue lepic , but can honestly say i hate them .
i recently took up clarinet playing after a very , very long absence .
my degree is in clarinet performance/music education .
if my opinion changes in the future , i will update this review .
both sets were defective had to contact martin to complain about defects in strings .
got them delivered from amazon ok
this time not so much .
today after about a week of use the selector switch broke .
even though it was only $ 109 i still feel ripped off .
i got this a few weeks ago .
i do n't like it 's distortion feature at all .
more than i expected .
did not maintain intonation as expected and definitely a weak string .
mostly disappointed with intonation .
prefer d'addario hands down .
broke way too easily .
going back to paying double for elixers- they last 5x as long .
noticed that they are not us made .
thank goodness for amazon return policy .
the reason this guitar is so popular is it gets pushed really hard .
but when you actually look into the guitar its a real pos .
this guitar just is n't playable .
the tuners simply do n't work and they 're not easy to replace .
the neck feels like it was made from scrape wood .
please check out peavey or monoprice guitars .
came with a broken string disappointed
do n't buy these .
having read the other reviews , i agree these strings are almost average .
the tone is not right .
therefore , fellow reviewers i agree with some and disagree with others .
no need for comments in the box !
let 's get practising .
a gbmaj13 # 11 is a great way to begin a song .
[ easy lover by phil collins et al ] .
i highly recommend this guitar but buy it elsewhere .
but i have to say , i am really not happy with the e.sg .
a guitar should never be like that , but this thing is .
someone suggested to download different audio software and attempt that .
ca n't believe i spent all this money for something that does n't work !
i just got around to opening the box and looking at this guitar .
but that is about it .
ca n't play it .
so i will never know .
i guess it is not returnable if it has been over 30 days .
not happy with this broken junk i received .
very disappointed in that .
hard to tune , much buzz at low action performance
very frustrating that the guitar will not stay in tune .
after two weeks of messing with it i give up .
the string above it was off too .
i violated my own personal rule in this case , and got bit .
this guitar was a rip off and a big waste of my time .
good looking guitar , but was totally not setup .
the neck had to be raised and a whole setup had to be done .
please do n't ship guitars without the very obvious setup .
very disappointed you guys .
this guitar does n't hold its tune due to neck/body issues .
it 's also not capable of making a decent sound .
yeah i totally agree with the other reviewer saying that this guitar felt cheap .
i got mine today and yeah it looks and feels really cheap .
right out of the box the switch was broken , just fell off .
went to local place to check out hands-on .
i was not impressed at all .
the thing just felt cheap .
i could not imagine playing it for long .
it was not fun to hold and parts looked cheesy .
i am surprised the les paul name was allowed to be used on this .
fine and beautiful in all ways down to the packing .
had little problem with playability .
the frets were like sand paper .
it was not finished , it missed qc , whatever .
i 'm disappointed as i ' v owned epiphones before and own epiphones now .
what are they using for fret wire ?
seller took it back and all is fine .
i love the guitar .
i play it everyday .
cost for the fret dressing would have exceeded the price of the guitar .
it is used ! ! !
these picks are fragile to say the least .
they break quickly and without much effort .
and i was teaching them simple strum patterns on acoustic guitars .
but i guess it is cheap plastic .
the price point was perfect , and the reviews were glowing .
buy it from someone else ! ! !
i order two time and they are the same .
infact the second one even worse .
the 3rd string from the 5th fret to the 22dn it kind of mute .
the qc should have not pass this guitar but they did .
the sound of goose bump !
these things snap , break and crack like it was their job .
in one song alone i broke three picks .
both sets were defective had to contact martin to complain about defects in strings .
got them delivered from amazon ok
this time not so much .
did not maintain intonation as expected and definitely a weak string .
mostly disappointed with intonation .
prefer d'addario hands down .
broke way too easily .
going back to paying double for elixers- they last 5x as long .
noticed that they are not us made .
thank goodness for amazon return policy .
does n't fit snugly on a les paul at all .
falls out all the time .
forget about using a wall hanger .
they do n't work with this either .
wasted money since it 's more hassle and money to send it back .
do n't buy these .
having read the other reviews , i agree these strings are almost average .
the tone is not right .
therefore , fellow reviewers i agree with some and disagree with others .
no need for comments in the box !
let 's get practising .
a gbmaj13 # 11 is a great way to begin a song .
[ easy lover by phil collins et al ] .
was not pleased with the wedgie pick holder .
it was not made well and did not fit my guitar well either .
keeps falling off my guitar .
this is for grandpa 's .
i only used this a couple of times before it stopped working .
stopped working within a month : (
input from the guitar to the pedal became jittery .
i switched cables out and determined that the input jack had malfunctioned .
i was forced to dump it just before a performance .
straight out of the box a piece of junk !
bought this new , worked for one hour before the pot fried .
used to play these in the 80 's and loved them .
they have great customer sevice and sent me another set .
however , after 2 weeks i still ca n't keep it tune .
tried some ernie balls and what a difference !
stayed in tune and no string buzz .
now i get to clean that out .
the wedgie picks i use regularly but they do not fit into the holder .
this thing is small .
it will work , but not in the middle .
i would not buy this again .
bought this pedal ( not from amazon ) brand new .
the pot needs to be replaced 2 months of light playing !
what a p.o.c. ! !
was very disappointed with this pedal overall .
expected so much more from such an `` iconic '' wah pedal .
i just opened this package & discovered it is defective .
it is missing all the 0.13 '' strings .
i 'd like for it to be replaced .
apparently my window to return this item closed at the end of january .
still , i think this item should be replaced .
i used this item once .
the next time i went to play my guitar , it was gone !
the perfect location for the transducer of my instrument yields low volume .
i do n't know .
but at best it gives a slightly noticeable increase in volume .
this is not a strong amplifier .
it is merely a 2-band eq with a slight loudness increase .
not what we were looking for .
the package came empty never will order this again
would n't buy this ever again .
i like the v12 reeds better .
i love v-12 reeds , and use them exclusively now .
i tried the 56 rue lepic , but can honestly say i hate them .
i recently took up clarinet playing after a very , very long absence .
my degree is in clarinet performance/music education .
if my opinion changes in the future , i will update this review .
going back to my other strings .
their quality control must be slipping .
they do not scrape off easily , either .
i have never seen this on guitar strings before .
they are an unnecessary distraction from the playing experience as well as uncomfortable .
received this thing in the mail & it was defective .
i felt sooo deceived & dejected after finding out it did n't work .
i was ready to jam with some friends upon receiving it in the mail .
i 'm in the process of returning it as this post is being written .
what a disappointment ! !
i suggest you keep your reciept/get a warranty .
stopped working after about a week in a half
it 's not working correctly after use of about 10 times .
it makes all these creaking sounds .
it clicks very audibly every time you depress the pedal all the way down .
the sound of the effect itself is , of course , classic .
the guitar i ordered was not the guitar that showed up .
the one that i was sent arrived broken .
what i got was a big mess .
that was a fabrication since the guitar was not playable .
you could not play it had the pick-up worked .
this guitar was a bad disappointment .
i believe you should get what you order and not a bate and switch .
i would suggest looking at the michael kelly guitars .
do your self a favor and check out amazon.com for the michael kelly guitars .
you will save time and money .
watch out for the bate and switch .
if it is too good to be true chances are it is .
that seems to be where it gets tricky .
i ca n't get this on my strings .
i really think i 'd like it if i could get it to work .
never seen a string unravel from the ball end .
i 've been generally pleased with ghs strings over the last 30 years .
mabey it was just a bad batch .
way too heavy for hickory sticks .
strings are over rated .
had to immediately replace them .
for some reason they did not work well on my fender guitar
they work so easily , and never cause issues .
i fully expected the banjo/mandolin model to offer the same satisfaction .
for steel-string banjos and mandolins , it probably does .
however , it 's not a great choice for ukulele .
i can make it work , but it 's a bit of a hassle .
it also seems to get in the way when playing .
the same problem occurs on both instruments .
the kyser , however , just does n't cut it for ukulele .
i 'm guessing it works great for banjo and mandolin .
this pedal is not that great .
the overall clamp is huge , clunky and stinks .
it does n't sit well with the newer microphone stand .
i use it but i 'd look else where for another product .
it did n't really fit my needs
i will probably just go back to using a regular guitar capo
unfortunately the popper does not stay put .
it keeps on falling from its position .
it is challenging to adjust .
arrived with 2 chips in the the body .
not due to packaging , it was obviously packed this way .
i still get quite a bit of pop .
as a result , the pop filter keeps slipping from the stand .
overall , i do n't recommend using this filter .
i ordered two pair .
one stick broke the first song i played .
it literally split in half .
they both broke ! !
this is seriously disappointing as i have been using promark for years .
terrible quality , gooseneck will not support the weight of the filter .
sending back and hoping the refund comes through .
difficult to control do not know where to put
break out of the box
it doesnt stand up .
very weak and i expected better
a few weeks later , it splintered and i ca n't really use them .
they are also pretty heavy .
it 's too heavy .
i have to use a bungee cord on my mic arm to support it .
a waste of money .
i 'm ordering something different .
i will keep looking arouund for one that really fits .
for the construction and price , i would have given it a 5 star .
he would spend up to 10 minutes of a 40 minute set tuning .
it still could not be properly intonated after hours of adjustment .
he ended up using my guitar for the rest of the session .
it was a happy day for us when it was stolen .
filter worked and sounded fine .
but f you have the boom arm , get something else .
i expected a filter to actually be able to stand up on its own .
first of all , there 's no way it can attach as shown .
packed up for return a half hour after receipt .
kinda of small but can complain about price- hard to adjust because its loose
the flexible arm wo n't stay in position , making it virtually useless .
i guess i should n't have expected much for $ 12.00 .
this thing is flimsy .
you get what you pay for .
build quality is cheap .
goose neck is flimsy and is n't strong enough to support the pop filter .
does n't stay in place .
and last but not least it damaged the chrome finish on y blue yeti .
you get what you pay for .
get an ibanez weeping demon if you want a real wah pedal .
type it in the search box and check it out .
the packaging was not good .
the pedal arrived a little banged up .
the battery cover was broken .
all of the srews were loose ?
unfortunety i was on a honeymoon so i could n't respond earlier .
the pedal appears to work fine .
disappointed with the packaging and the condition .
not that durable , im a sad pumpkin .
perhaps mine is defective .
and that is a definite possibility .
mount has a rubber grommet that falls off ... .
what a poorly designed product .
boss should be ashamed to let such a item be offered in its name .
the design flaws run deep .
you can only fit a few pedals in the available space .
but wait , there 's more .
if you look at the picture given , it is a hoax .
what a waste of money and time !
how disappointing for a company that ought to have more exact quality control .
it eventually flops down and hits the microphone .
when i got first , the sticks were bent .
the bendy part does n't stay put .
it 's too weak and droops down constantly .
it 's difficult to place on microphone .
i have to constantly readjust .
meh , it was cheap to purchase and it shows .
not very good a keeping its place .
i have to constantly re rig it , annoying .
we bought this probably more than a year ago for our son .
this worked much better for him but ended up a lot heavier .
the boss case is nice in that it is lighter .
the case broke the first time i opened it .
for the price they should use a stronger grade of plastic .
the goose neck did not support the weight of the pop filter .
a bit bulky and heavy
at first it works just fine , but over time it is terrible .
attachments are nice as is the adjustment control .
material of filter itself seems just too thin to be of any real value .
it was inexpense though so i guess you get what you pay for .
my review should be taken with a grain of salt .
i bought these , since i 'm building an acoustic `` water-bottle '' bass .
the scale on the strings is pretty short .
i 'd like some longer scale strings for my purposes .
i think i may just settle on regular electric/acoustic bass strings .
i might get some flatwounds .
the bass is technically fretless ...
the d string i received had a kink in it , rendering it unusable .
had to buy another set .
probably wo n't buy again .
stay in position oh you wo n't dam fck u
the grip tends to slide a lot .
here is why : first off these strings are thinner than the oems .
so that one went back to oem .
today i noticed that the e string was drastically out of tune .
the earthwoods would pull through where the oem would lock under .
with that all said , i did like how the earthwoods sounded and played .
i do have a few photos if anyone is interested .
contacting amazon if this product has any warranty .
the mouthpiece did n't come with warranty info .
there is no info on the manufacturer 's site nor at amazon .
clamp for this is really awkward and only clamps on stands that are circular .
it was one of the recommended pop filters with the blue snowball microphone .
with my set up , it was n't really necessary to have that piece .
it made adjusting the pop filter a lot harder than it needed to be .
it almost feels like the filter is too heavy for the goose neck .
i 'm returning this one as i got the dragonpad pop filter instead .
crappy ... . bad e string right our of the package .
they are made in america and had good reviews .
i will not be buying these again .
arrived just as described and timely .
this mouthpiece worsened my tone
contacting amazon if this product has any warranty .
the mouthpiece did n't come with warranty info .
there is no info on the manufacturer 's site nor at amazon .
it did not fit the banjo .
was very heavy , makes my mic stand droop .
from what i see the pop filter is a circle , not an oval .
i got an oval .
how can a pop filter get a negative review ?
# 1 the clamp assembly is about 4 times too heavy .
it keeps drooping and moving always needs adjusted .
the pop filter itself is pretty good .
light weight and nice looking .
arrived just as described and timely .
this mouthpiece worsened my tone
the filter 's arm is weak , and wo n't hold the filter up .
it will slowly fall and you 'll find yourself constantly readjusting it .
i spent more time hassling with this thing than i did recording .
seller should alter their design .
the weight of the pop filter is too much for the wire .
the wire needs to be thicker and stronger .
too big and has a long metal plate sticking out of it .
the fret board came apart from the base .
how do i get this replaced ?
did not attach to our microphone .
you need a microphone stand , but that was not made clear .
also , we did not notice it helping with the sound quality .
pretty thin and jangly .
works fine but why does it have to be so big ?
unit would serve same purpose at half the size .
this is a decent guitar for the price .
the placement of the jack plug is annoying .
the clamp just does n't hold this item in place as it should .
i end up jimmy rigging it to work .
the flexible are is almost a joke , it constantly falls .
purchased and defective within 3 hours of play time .
warranty response was to take it to certified technician to fix .
beautiful and fun to play for $ 300 , but looking to return .
goose neck ca n't even support weight of the pop filter .
should n't even be allowed to be sold on amazon .
way too tiny for anyone 's finger , and the shape is stupid .
go for a regular design .
was to small for finger
the goose neck can barely hold up the filter .
after a few minutes it begins to droop below the microphone .
as others here have said , this thing is way too big .
go in a store and try them on is my advice .
i have others that fit fine .
i do n't like the slide it 's too wide , hard to control .
i wo n't ever use it ... waste of money ; in my opinion .
gooseneck is too weak to hold the weight of the pop screen .
it wo n't stay in place at certain angles .
i 'm going to return it .
i definitely do not recommend .
invest in something a little better .
vater sticks are computer matched by pitch and weight at the factory .
there was a difference of 6 grams between the sticks .
i 've uploaded photos of the initial shipment .
these would have been perfect had they been a properly matched set .
i 'll never buy sticks on line again !
it provides good sound quality and major pop reduction .
the bendable arm you have does not stay in place .
it is not worth buying .
not the best capo .
buy one that is slightly expensive or just a different one .
i constantly have to reposition it to make it work .
it needs stiffer tubing and tighter positioning screws to be effective .
i ended up with tenor instead of soprano strings .
came with a broken string .
the capo is to tight and causes strings to sound sharp .
the metal spring broke after three months .
stays out of tune and i want to return it
i found them too short and difficult to string the 2nd & 3rd strings .
i thought i ordered a kyser brand 6 string capo .
its nice their clear nylon strings and sounds nice .
good quality especially for the price .
so imagine how many runs this has .
you get what you pay for .
i would n't buy this product again .
i did not except it sent it back do n't like rosewood finger boards .
do n't waste your money .
the spring breaks in a short time .
i 've gone through two of this capos !
same thing every time .
product is cheaply made .
i will never buy another kyser product .
the thing is that they do n't seem to stay !
and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality .
pro : does the job adequately .
a pop filter is not a complex device .
the mounting arm for this thing is as floppy as a wet noodle .
this guitar had the worst tuning pegs i have ever seen .
guitar would not stay in tune even for 1 song .
i tried a heavier gauge string but they were no better .
i really do n't like this guitar .
i bought it from the epiphone name recognition and it sucked ...
the 2 smallest strings got rusted in less than 2 months .
i had them on 1 week and 2 broke .
ive always likes ernie ball but this time im pretty disapointed
they sound great but they only lasted a month with straight finger picking .
poor tonality and the solid mono strings were easily bent .
can.u do.smthng on the weight of.the les.pauls ?
is there a way ?
even then , the tension was not equal across all strings .
i took them off immediately , a waste of time and money
not even close to be soft ... they 're harder than elixer
these stick out too far from my bass body .
i 'm still looking for a great strap lock ...
i bought this for a home studio setup .
the ukulele strings are to short to fit the classic ukulele with 18 frets .
all other reviews claim the strings work .
g string popped while doing a half tone bend
pops off all of the time , way too big .
too much tension , really hard to put on and take off .
imagine my surprise when opening the package and finding only four empty envelopes .
these strings have very little resonance .
could n't wait to change them .
i wo n't be ordering them again .
your hands and pick will smell bad if you play on it .
save your money and get the esp ltd ec-10 !
it has two high output pickups and a satan finish .
its also way more comfortable to play .
( not new to putting on strings )
these strings are easy to push down but mine seemed pretty squeeky .
i tried some string lube but they were still pretty squeeky .
not worth the money .
seriously - it has a hard time holding it 's own weight / shape .
i thought it 'd be a lot stronger .
definitely not one of my proudest amazon purchases .
too much effort to return it however .
it 's extreme and can mar the back of the neck or even fingerboard .
finctionally it can also throw off the tuning because of the tightness .
it 's also huge .
high e string snapped before i was even finished tuning .
not the quality i expect from ernie ball at all .
package was opened and missing an integral washer that makes it almost useless .
this is a simple product and fairly easy to setup/use .
they are cheap for a reason
the filter worked , but the goose-neck was too loose .
returned this item due to the flexible neck part being to flexible .
would not stay in the position i set it at all .
i would rate it as 0 stars if that option is available .
large is to small to fit on my ring finger .
looks like it 's made nice , but unusable for me .
i had to return it because it would n't go completely over my finger .
i could n't even get it to sit on my first knuckle .
will have to order a custom size .
it felt like stoneware too , which gave me the heebie jeebies .
they no longer make them in small so i ordered a medium .
i also seem to recollect a nice meaty material with super porous lining .
if you have a 4 inch pinky about 3/4 in diameter , go nuts !
the screws get stripped everytime ! ! !
the strings delivered were not silk and steel as the package indicated .
the strings were regular acoustic strings .
this was a nice tuner and worked great for a couple of months .
then it just plain died .
not a battery issue .
it was n't abused or dropped that i know of either .
wish i would have returned this .
it is very difficult to set straps up .
additionally , the release of the system varies .
i am not impressed with the set up and the quality standards .
get the schallers - the design is better .
guitar was made in china .
i just got this in and tested it out .
do yourself the favor and look elsewhere .
it 's a total piece of s*** when it comes for placing it !
i had these on my $ 3k dollar us made bc rich mockingbird supreme .
strap locks are a great idea but this is a poor design .
the ball bearings are tiny and will eventually wear and fail .
this does work , but its not a real keyser capo .
when it arrived i compared it to my other keyser of the same shape .
1. this label is rights reserved , like on the real one .
2. there are no grooves or textured handle like on the real keyser .
i dislike when being charged for something of a brand u rely on .
only to discover its a fake .
it dishonest and uses the reputation that took the keyser co. time to build .
i 'll buy mine at the guitar store now .
ive added a photo , the top is legit .
disappointed by this capo .
the bar that runs across the strings has become bent for no apparent reason .
poorly constructed product , waste of money .
you get what you paid for .
does n't get power from outlet , unable to get help from company .
now i have to buy another
i love the feeling of the strings at my fingers .
i can play longer now
the guitar came with one of the sound pick-ups not working .
had to buy a new pop filter one week in .
the filter is much much too heavy for the flimsy gooseneck .
i do not recommend this at all .
there are plenty of others to consider .
i wasted my money , do n't waste yours .
the strings sounds okay .
but , they are not stainless .
after two days , two of them became rusty .
these strings are pretty bad .
you get what you pay for i suppose .
they are n't slick at all and wear out quickly .
shellout a few more dollars and get the elixer strings .
you wo n't regret it .
the variant that i play has had numerous issues .
pros : price , style cons : workmanship , defective components
no tone at all !
recieved a very dirty cover , ca n't believe it is new !
maybe it 's just me , but very bad experience !
it was the marine band sound and 2 bad reeds .
poor quality strings , sound not bright like d'addario .
break easily with little more tension .
mine was made in mexico .
looks like cheap china made strings .
i bought d'addaria and gibson .
someone apparently had installed the buttons on their guitars then sent back the locks .
i returned it and requested the replacement .
i 'm returning this guitar immediately and this time no replacement but refund .
i have tried to return this item .
i only used this guitar twice , finding its quality lacking .
this caused a delay in finding that the guitar was also mis-produced .
also , i have n't been able to blow-bend the 10 hole for years .
used to be able to .
i was very disappointed with the sound of this unit .
when the item arrived to me , it was in poor condition .
i do not abuse the guitar by any means of the word .
i set it down , i pick it up , wire problems .
in terms of sound , these string are nice .
sounded great on my alvarez regent .
but , in terms of durability , not so great .
i do n't break strings regularly , so this is pretty annoying .
these strings sound okay , so far .
they should , being brand new .
but they were an enormous hassle to put on the guitar .
they are not packaged separately !
this made changing the strings a super pain in the ass .
i wo n't buy these again .
does not fit a roland rd-300sx 88 key keyboard .
i should have returned it .
this is total crap .
it 's valuable like 50 cents .
did not fit 88-key midi controller .
this honor looks nice but sounds almost exactly like my cheaper plastic soprano .
i 'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this .
it does n't do fast charging on lg v10 very slow charging very disappointed
this kyser does n't open as wide as the earlier models .
would not fit my yamaha fs830 .
the capo i received has a shallow and short gripping ability .
additionally , i found it to be difficult to grasp and open .
i threw it in the trash .
does not fit roland rd-800 or casio privia 88-key stage pianos .
broke out of the box .
it came out of the factory box , no visual damage .
the rhythm switch was broke .
based on the reviews , purchased this guitar for my grandson to start learning .
arrived quickly , which was nice and unexpected .
there was also a bunch of loose wood debris inside the body .
it 's being returned and replaced with another brand , yet to be determined .
this is a great student guitar and great value .
i would never recomend it. '
it shows dust really badly as well .
too slippery hard to cover piano
terrible tone for a recorder .
i 've used others that are much more warm and playable .
needed to go up one size for a little extra room .
does not play well above the staff and they would not return .
when getting a product like this id recommend getting a known higher quality filter .
there is no way we can comfortably use this .
this is a scam .
used and barely on last legs .
severely out of tune .
box looked like it came from a dumpster
this harmonica went out of tune quickly after being purchased .
i definitely would not recommend this brand .
this recorder looks good but the f is off the pitch .
you can only find the recorder sounds off the key is kid 's toy .
if you buy this as toy , then it is good toy .
but as an instrument of music , do n't recommend .
any instrument that is off the key , no way .
these kysers are ok but not really for acoustic so much .
it 's not the best science .
i am a professional entertainer of stage so this a needed .
for basic capo needs ... ... .. it 's great .
i returned this product right after i opened the package .
this was n't mentioned on the description on amazon website .
returning the item to the seller ( music123 ) has proved difficult .
i was extremely disappointed .
i 'm sending these back to the seller .
i will be returning this .
pretty disappointed in the product .
maybe this is just a fluke but i 'm not chancing it again .
do n't get me wrong , i love these harmonicas .
i guess it was never tested before leaving the factory .
i just hate the hassle of having to return it .
too slippery and ca n't hook to my yamaha sp90 .
now i am back to find better ones .
do n't be like me .
go get the schaller strap locks instead .
installation is easy , just a couple of screws like any other locking system .
why would you want to do that ?
aesthetics aside the straps seemed to work great .
after a few months they started to creak a bit .
do you oil these things ?
i would recommend you check yours !
the cost of return will supper pass the value of the item : - (
not all that great .
10x better pedals for the money ( see boss ds-2 or pro-co rat ) .
do n't listen to good reviews .
for the third time it was the wrong size .
i have a yamaha 88 keyboard .
i 've spent a fair amount on your products , especially the 88 keyboard .
why is a keyboard cover such a problem .
i know i sound grumpy .
so , no more inferior gator keyboard covers .
instead , i ordered a wall tapestry as a cover .
this took 2 weeks to ship and when it arrived it was defective .
i would not buy again .
meh ... sent it back , had better .
sounds very canned and thin .
get a ds-1 for half the price .
i love most boss pedals , but not this one
if you have a skinny neck guitar it probably works better .
see my other capo reviews .
this thing is trash .
it doesnt seem like a good value .
i have other harps that feel and sound better for similar to slightly more expensive
do yourself a favor and get some more durable sticks .
product is not as pictured .
product still works fine .
need to update your photos with the correct colors !
i should have done more research first .
one came damaged the button
package clearly broken , but shipped that way anyway .
should come with extra washer for a tighter fit .
worked for 15 minutes then died .
i wanted it for holloween but never worked again .
i went to walmart and bought 3 battery operated strobes for $ 5 each .
working on getting my money back .
this product did not work first time we plugged it in .
further , instructions state that it has a max duty-cycle of about 50 % .
completely went dead after 5 minutes of use .
such a waste of money .
do not buy this , it wo n't last long .
dont waste your time .
if anyone has suggestions , please let me know .
you have to pay border tax for europe 100 euro
it 's been a while since i bought this .
it worked great but 2 years after it decided not to work
the strap is fine .
extremely disappointed that i paid close to $ 16 each for a inferior product .
my return window has passed so therefor i 'm stuck with these .
read the other reviews and steer clear !
this item surprisingly lights up a room pretty well .
however , it 's lifespan is terrible !
after the first hour it just died and never turned on again .
needless to say is i am not very happy with this product .
i had this plugged in for about 15 minutes before it stopped working .
save your money , do n't buy it .
the biggest problem is that it is very hard to mount .
if you 're not looking for much it 's worth it .
i wish i would have bought a little bit better one .
it 's not fit new 2015 korg kronos 88 keys..
i plugged it in and it wouldnt work horrible product do n't buy .
one of the worst products ive gotten .
i saw the good reviews so i bought it but i was dissapointed
i 'm very disappointed at the quality of this product .
this is the first strobe i 've ever bought .
however , it 's useless in a lighted environment .
also , there is no on/off switch .
the spec for this item indicates 110/220 v for power input .
the actuial item is dc4.5v only .
contacted seller many time and still not resolved .
this pedal works ok for practicing .
but i strongly advise against recording using this pedal .
have tried to run it to an amp and mic it .
it is not good for metal , or any other genre for that matter .
boss makes some great products , but this is definitely not one of them .
the flash produced by this device was pretty dim .
could barely be seen in a lighted room .
though , it is a `` mini '' strobe light .
perhaps it was n't really meant for very bright flashes .
additionally , after only 4 days of use , it ceased to function correctly .
it would only blink a couple times a minute .
i bought one it lasted less then a month .
i just wo n't consider getting another one .
out of box this little strobe light did n't work for me .
its strobe was not constant and missed counts frequently .
the strap locks are great .
the packaging left much to be desired .
item was of poor quality .
i did return it .
unless you use it in a closet , it did n't work well .
took forever to arrive .
then too difficult for my 13 year old son to use .
this shock mount is nicely made with quality parts , very sturdy indeed .
i have a roland fp-4 keyboards and it does not cover it well .
no more dunlop products ever again ! ! ! !
dimarzio cliplock strap pisses all over craploks !
these guys make questionable stuff .
so yeah i 'm pretty upset about that .
this is not a dust cover that you can quickly use to protect daily .
it 's cheap , but save yourself the money .
i cant get this to clamp on to my hi hat stand tube
shattered the first time i tried to attach it to a snare drum rim .
on stage , in a big hurry , disappointed .
noisy , takes 2 hands , i rather my cheap pawn shop cable
worst cable i 've ever purchased .
great concept , but poor quality .
it 's thin , extremely rigid , and kinks very easily .
do n't waste your money !
i hate that they destroyed a great cable design .
why did they change this ?
i want the original planet waves circuit breaker cables back .
: - ( i 'm looking for an alternate solution .
they changed the way this kill switch works- it 's totally annoying now .
this is a great feature .
i changed the product once because the power button was very sensitive .
unfortunately there is no way to give it back .
unfortunately the on/off switch seems to be very sensitive .
excellent company , fast service .
does n't work but any try .
it 's circuit breaker may have functioned properly for a week or two .
kinkier than any lady i 've ever dated .
i bought two of these , and one stopped working after only 1 gig !
not expecting the second one ( the 'back-up ' ) to last much longer .
does not play well with pearl mastercast hoops .
broke the first time trying to fit it on the drum .
heavy , bulky and wo n't stay where it is clamped .
do n't waste your money and all !
i bought this for a korg kronos-x .
the condition of this item was not listed accurately .
instructions were ripped in half and hard to read .
this could be remedied with additional washers .
cable shorted out within a week of using it .
not happy at all .
the clips in my 100.00 pyle pro back up drum mic kit are better .
will not be buying any more .
had to return it .
did n't fit my 88 note keyboard .
it was adjustable , but another inch around would have done it .
the switch end makes noise , and it did straight out of the package .
in addition , it has progressively gotten worse with time .
if i could give no stars i would .
i ordered a 20 ft and a 10 ft version of this cable .
the 20 ft worked ok. the 10 ft cable caused noise on the signal .
i traced it back to an intermittent ground located at the right angle connector .
i bought two of these cables delivered to me january 9th .
planet waves 15-foot circuit breaker 1/4-inch instrument cable .
i bought it for the circuit breaker .
hard tuning and hold the button .
great company but this is a lousy product ! ! ! ! ! !
take them off the market
i wish i would have read the reviews on this before purchasing .
same issues as the other reviewers .
now stuck with a noisy cable .
on off button does n't work .
ill start with the fact that i love the idea of this cable .
in fact i love this cable .
it is such a tight fit that i am sure something will break .
probably the jack will break if i continue to use it on these guitars .
it works wonderfully on both my jazz basses .
it is such a basic component , how could they have gotten this wrong .
noisy ... i returned one due to my operational misunderstanding .
the screen is very thin compared to other products .
over priced , low quality - find an alternative .
if i could do it again , i would n't purchase this filter .
however , make double sure your cable 's on/off switch properly latches .
i ordered two of these .
you have to physically hold the switch button down to mute the cable .
these are a total waste of money .
arrived as expected on time , however the cord was a bit noisy .
i ordered two of these and both had the same problem .
i switched it out between 4 ukuleles and the problem did not change .
the model with the on/off switch would be a better choice .
i would have given it 5 stars if it worked properly .
cable switch does n't work at all .
appears to have a short straight out of the package .
getting loud static that cuts in and out every few seconds .
this is a deal breaker !
i have a few strait end cables that i love .
i ordered one from a local music store and same problem .
they are clearly having production problems .
this is not supposed to be a mute switch you have to hold in .
it should lock into the off position and then be able to be released .
just got these in the mail .
bad move on my part .
i think they made it out of the slipperiest material on planet earth .
if only i had extremely long arms , then maybe ?
quite simply i have ordered two and neither has worked .
most decent leads have that kind of snap in , that feels secure .
1st one came and it did n't work , so i ordered another .
that did n't work either .
a very poor product , i certainly wo n't be buying from them again .
plugged it in and needed to crank the amp to get any volume .
maybe this one is defective .
either way , i would test the cable upon receipt .
this product is poorly engineered .
used these strings on a gibson jumbo .
you push it in and over time it gradually slides out and disconnects .
i have a friend with the same cable - does the self same thing .
sorry d'addario but wo n't be buying any more cables from you .
tried installing these on a gibson sg .
therefore , i did not want to force the dunlop screws into the guitar .
the sg screws do not work with these because the heads are too big .
in essence , these did not work for me .
this cable has been redesigned .
i am very disappointed in the new design .
i love and have used my previous planetwaves circuit breaker cable for many years .
this change makes this cable much less useful than the old design .
i have the straight angle version that is an okay cable .
we 're done here .
great concept , but failed immediately ( no connection whatsoever ) .
complete waste of money .
i had to return because the circuit break button did not function correctly .
i 'm probably going to stick to standard instrument cables .
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg .
i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out .
i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out .
schallers click in and you know they are ready to go .
they just feel cheap .
for a few bucks more i 'll stick with schaller 's .
i have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail .
lot of static with brand new marcus miller bass .
was good while it lasted but went kaput waaaayyy too fast .
the key is out of tune in 3 months
it simply does not clamp the strings .
their `` adjustable '' setting only makes it looser .
i would not buy another kyser capo .
i am extremely disappointed .
i bought this 6 weeks ago .
i play in a praise band and also occasionally at local gigs .
now i uderstand what stretchy means in the product name .
however i was wrong .
i will return it .
closing the case may pinch the reed tips .
this leaves 8 usable slots .
bent # 4 reed after 3 days of playing
i relayed this information to amazon.com , and got no reply .
i complained again and still got no reply .
i need a replacement , and no one will respond .
i am a very dissatisfied customer !
without access inside deep cleaning is n't possible and holes start plugging .
do n't waste your money !
you are better off throwing in the extra dollars fro something better .
gooseneck is basically useless .
could n't get the thing to stand up if my life depended on it .
i am sure in the pisture the goosneck is resting on a countertop ... .
generally speaking pw products are reliable .
no connection to tip .
they were way too big .
they fit fine , they 're just ugly .
installation is also more of a pain than it should be .
i 've got tenax on my other guitar and i like them much better .
color is not as bright as it appears .
i have to say that this reed is not what it seems .
it holds tons of reeds but you have to fit them in really tight .
it might just be mine because everyone else seems to be fine .
this product has damaged my reeds and i 've only just now noticed .
fully inserting a reed will damage the reeds integrity and bend/break the reed .
bought this not through amazon but at a local music store .
all in all , i 'd not buy this brand again .
a bent hangar with a nylon would work better .
excellent mold breeding ground .
i do not recommend this case for an 88 keys keyboard .
2nd note does n't work .
definetly getting a special 20 next time .
heed this warning and save yourself some heartache .
this product should be removed and redesigned .
there is a slight edge around the bottom where the reeds slide out .
just enough to make it annoying .
dissatisfaction is guaranteed if you 're a serious clarinet player .
it damages your reeds and the reeds still become warped .
this is the prime example of you get what you pay for .
just could not get a secure plug in connection .
i also tried several instruments , it still would n't stay in .
very easy to change just loosen the screw and swap .
now it 's a great cable .
the neck wont hold it , only when it 's hanging .
but vertical/side/horizontal ... forget about it !
the plastic clamp i hope it will stay !
not worth for the price .
i should have gotten from other site for a better brand !
returned because of an ever so slight buzz
lot of unnecessary parts involved .
pain in the behind to put together .
my guitar is an evh wolfgang special .
would n't recommend it if you do n't have any mechanical experience
i am very glad i did that first .
amazon lists the *inside* dimensions of the cover as 48 '' by 16 '' .
again , i measured only the white keys , nothing outside that .
surely the company must have made sure it fit something .
i could really use a cover like this .
i loved this harmonica .
i 'm a beginner and was learning from an online resource on blues harmonica .
the instructor highly recommended this harmonica to learn on .
i was able to blow and draw on every note .
i learned out to get a single note , etc .
covering up all the holes and blowing on # 2 , i get sound .
drawing on # 2 , just air .
my usage of the harmonica was not much .
it was normal playing of simple songs .
i did try and clean it .
i suppose the reed has some damage and needs a replacement .
not sure what happened .
i 'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use .
i recommend stearing clear from these entirely .
i bought this for my fantom g8 .
it does n't even come close to fitting .
as a matter of fact i can not see what 88-key keyboard it would .
if you are lucky to received a good , yes , keep it .
i had bad experience with them .
wo n't buy anything from them any more .
but read all the fine letters , before place order from antonline .
amazon wo n't back you up either .
still , i am very disappointed with this cable .
i got it for use at home .
unfortunately , this feature does not work at all .
gravity alone is enough for this cable to fall out of the plug .
i have never seen a cable do this in my 34 years of playing .
i would not recommend these cables .
incidentally , do n't buy monster cables either .
you know , where you ca n't fix them .
buy a cheaper , well-made cable instead .
many pro players use them because of endorsement deals with hohner .
i have spoken to famous professional player that endorses them .
buy suzuki promaster for best performance for the money out of the box .
the metal arm that extends from it is so heavy .
it could have been a bit shorter or even made from a solid plastic .
its sitting in my closet now .
hoping ill find the mic for it one day .
so i boutht one ; same problem !
the concept is great but not worth the problems !
cheap but does not work well .
orange , not red as depicted .
i think schallers are a bit better .
the plastic washer will keep the strap from slipping off .
i bought some dunlop strap locks many years ago for one my bass 's .
i would recommend ernie ball strap locks .
they are few more bucks , but they actually work .
you can take them on and off .
i have ernie ball on all of my other instruments .
the end is way to heavy .
do n't let that happen during a show !
i 've found the clamp capos much more effective , manageable and durable .
problems i 've had with it over the years .
there are better options today .
does not completely bar the chords leaving a rattle type sound .
it is also inconvenient to place onto the guitar .
the product came in broken .
it just flops around and you ca n't position the screen .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
do not do what a pop filter is supposed to .
please do not waste your money .
i really wished i would have listened to the other reviews .
this capo is garbage .
it does not sufficiently press the strings and therefore does n't work at all .
it really stunk and i returned it .
do not buy this ! !
this capo coming in the mail really bright also its not tight enough .
it leaves you with a buzzing sound on your guitar .
plus it seems to damage guitars after awhile of uses .
this is a very very very bad capo ! !
i never received this gadget .
i often wonder whether i would have liked it or not .
some kind of mix-up , i suppose .
glad this did n't happen while playing .
also , the on/off button is awkward .
replaced this with auto-switched cable from audiopile.net .
i bought 4 of these and 3 crapped out in less than 2 months .
lucky planet waves replaced them cause amazon doesnt accept returns after 30days .
some reeds stopped working within weeks .
another reed stopped working a month later .
unfortunately have to throw it in the trash and get another one .
i just received the product .
product sealed in the plastic box .
the product fits well to the microphone stand .
the screw-holder holds the body well .
however , part of the the screen is ripped out of the box .
not something i would buy again .
it appears that he is sticking with what works .
the screws that came with it did n't fit on any guitar i have .
sound was very good .
hard to hold for someone with big hands .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
it is flimsy and does not do the job .
it is totally frustrating to try to use .
i was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product .
a work-around for the main issue follows the review .
the strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch .
therefore any lateral stress ( i.e .
it does n't need much .
i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each .
sorry , i do n't like these as they 're just too big .
they stand out too much .
they do work and they 're effective but they are too pronounced .
again , they work , but they 're not aesthetic nor elegant .
but theory does not match practice .
i have a long-neck electric ( not bass ) and a fender strat .
my back is not great , sometimes shoulder , so thought this would help .
unfortunately , after trying it several times , i never use it .
all in all , a brilliant idea ( and great folks !
) , but not for the guitar , in my view .
but this product was completely unusable for me .
super uncomfortable and held bass in a really bad position for playing .
the straplok itself works well .
the installation hardware , mainly the screws , are terrible in design .
they need to come up with a better design for installation .
they feel like cheap pressed metal and are very clanky .
recommend getting more substantial strap locks from another manufacturer if you need them .
there is a loud pop when i press the mute button on this cable .
it does n't work as advertised .
baggs para di direct box .
i received this hoping it would in fact look tie-died .
i was wanting a fun , bright capo , but this let me down .
i expected more for less but got less for more .
it does what it 's suppose to , but not nessary to have .
second time using the harmonica and the second hole produces no sound when drawing .
we bought two sets of strings .
did n't even get either on tunes , every string but one broke .
these mallets are too hard and i am dissatisfied with them .
do n't know if i can return them if i already use them ...
worst capo i 've ever used
there are many competitors to this product with similar functionality .
ordered 2 pack , only received 1 set .
figured i would be bent over on these and i was right .
very very slow delivery .
i love ernie ball and i 've been a regular user over the years .
this is simply not acceptable .
i 'll take my chances with d'addario
also the bolt that holds together the filter does n't stay tight ever
i returned this days after receiving it .
the filter is too heavy for the bendable lever , so it droops .
the tension on this capo is way too strong .
i bought this out of the box harmonica and it 's terrible .
i 've had it about three months and it 's been very gently used .
i have other c harps that i prefer .
this one however is already not usable .
considering it 's $ 45.00 price tag i 'm very disappointed .
in the future i will stick with the special 20 's and crossovers .
protects the guitar good .
looks like a second due to delaminations on the top .
after one flight it got opened
1 clasp does n't work at all and another is faulty .
is this the right case for the wildkat guitar ?
i would like to return it for another .
this has happened on not just one , but two different dl4s i had .
so kind of a bummer .
just wish that the pedal lasted longer .
so sad , i expected better from line6 .
died after like 5 months .
i 've been pursuing voiceover for three years .
unfortunately , errant pops sneak into my recordings fairly often .
it just does n't support the weight of the pop filter .
no matter how i positioned this thing , the filter would always sag .
i 've used a lot of capos over the years , including kyser capos .
generally , i consider kyser an industry standard .
there will be no quick capo changes with this bad lad !
i 'd recommend an adjustable g7 capo over this one any day .
3. it does not take wear and tear very well .
learn from my mistake , do n't buy this case !
gator 's `` lifetime warranty '' seems all marketing .
beware of the side handle as it easily rips .
the case came with stains/discoloration to the exterior in a few places .
the bottom of two latches scraped my fingers , they seem flimsy and cheap .
the interior lining was decent
loved this pedal but it inexplicably died on me after about a year .
i tried to turn it on one day and it no longer worked .
bought it on sam ash btw .
zipper jammed on both zippers .
the zipper broke very soon after using .
i should have filed a claim with gator .
but , the product i received each time does not have wheels .
perhaps leaving a 1-star comment will help ?
first the handle ripped and then today the bottom wheel housing assembly fell off .
light gigging , really disappointed .
anyone know of a better replacement ?
wasted my money on this one .
unfortunately , not all the notes ( holes ) work .
the other notes work just fine and sound good .
not recommended ( at least for beginners ) .
way to big for ni s61 keyboard .
after only 2 months of moderate use , the handle has begun to rip .
went to local place to check out hands-on .
i was not impressed at all .
the thing just felt cheap .
i could not imagine playing it for long .
it was not fun to hold and parts looked cheesy .
item was not new and not in working order and in fact was damaged .
have to use tape to get it to work how it should be working .
it was advertised as a 61-key keyboard case but it is way larger .
there are 18-24 '' excess length space for the keyboard to slide around in .
case did not fit keyboard it claimed to .
i can not express my disappointment .
it broke on it 's first airtrip .
overall this product does what it is designed to do .
stops the `` pop '' .
mesh is flexible and seems durable .
biggest pro is that it is inexpensive !
i do n't want it to flop around .
a simple winged bolt will remedy this if it ever does .
broke at the metal pin after 5 months of use .
this guitar is absolute junk .
while it may look beautiful , it is built with absolutely no care .
i bought one at christmas , and i played it very rarely with rocksmith .
this thing is unplayable .
spend $ 100 more on something a little nicer .
this capo is inadequate for my needs .
it has trouble producing enough tension and is fiddly regarding intonation .
do not buy this product .
the output jack on mine fell of .
poor quality and very disappointing .
there was no rough usage involved .
i opened the box and i noticed that its been opened before .
i see this because there were staples holding it together .
not happy at all .
its been carefully moved locations a handful of times but still managed to break .
i do n't recommend this .
does n't work very well on my electric 12 string , frowny face : (
excellent am very happy .
the vinyl is thin and poorly glued/stitched .
it is n't worth $ 100 .
it 's thin and cheap .
latches look ok. going back tomorrow .
i 'd return it but husband threw out the packaging .
this means that product needs constant re-adjusting .
i got this case with an off-brand les paul copy .
$ 99 is ridiculously priced for this thing .
the thing seems to function as intended , but it was n't shrink-wrapped ?
there were just two staples along the top of the plastic packaging .
how unprofessional is that ?
wow , next time , i 'm going to a retail location .
thats how poorly made this product is .
the les paul fits perfectly and the interior is plush and fits securely .
also has a lock and key .
if it was n't so difficult to return it , we would have .
we ordered a different 6 string capo which fit my son 's guitar fine .
we were extremely disappointed .
would have given it 5 stars if it had lasted .
the choral folder did not suit my needs .
the originaldescription said it had light wear from use and was missing some strings .
i own a '84 martin d-12-28 and a '03 martin j12-16gt guitars .
you can not have that performing live .
i would not recommend this to anyone especially martin owners to not buy this .
spring for the g7 guitar capo instead .
but well worth the money spent .
case looks and feels great , but it 's very cheaply made .
this a music folder that is a horrible choir folder .
octavo size music is dwarfed inside it .
i have tried to iron the flaps down , but they still stick out .
i am very disappointed .
i would not recommend this music folder to anyone .
perfect fit for my guitar .
i wanted a folder to use for orchestra music .
but some of the orchestra parts that i use are a very tight fit .
the pockets are not the typical pockets you see with sheet music folders .
it seems like this is designed for 8.5x11 but not much larger than that .
cheap filter with cheap results .
the filter does work when its in position .
good luck getting it there though .
i use this with my rogue herringbone 12-string .
will not be buying kyser again .
shipping in a timely fashion for this product does n't exist .
my son used this for 3 days and it was already falling apart .
this was a waste of our money !
the bending shaft does not stay in place once bent .
i am now wishing that i had ordered from a different seller .
too big for a choir .
i think its fine for orchestra
looking at the product , it seems `` ok '' .
but the thing is , at $ 16+ and made in china ? ?
that 's way too much !
the reason why 1 start is because it came to me broken !
the connection between the goose neck and the clamp is loose !
these companies should know that and should do strict quality control on their items .
it 's just a microphone pop filter !
make it right people ! ! ! !
do n't inconvenience your customers ! ! !
to the possible buyers : consider what i wrote here .
returning it and waiting for a long time is just not worth it !
its not worth it .
very poorly made ... would not recommend .
looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless .
the arm just plain does n't work .
overall i 'm displeased with its appearance .
as for the product it self would n't know as of right now .
this product is a waste of money .
does n't open as wide as earlier models .
design has changed ... not a fan .
the pencil holder has no bottom piece so the pencil slips out .
the pockets holding the music are too small for full size scores .
do n't like it .
ordered this and was received with a big tear on the side .
case construction is ok , but the lock broke on me almost immediately .
this did n't work well for my 12 string acoustic .
it was n't tight enough to hold down the low e strings .
got buzzes and muted string sounds throughout the fret board .
check out the planet waves ns capo pro 6 and 12 string .
i really like that one .
see my recommendation for that .
what good is a capo that only presses down half of my strings ?
the 6 larger strings sound great and the other half just sound dead .
the tension on this thing really needs to be adjustable or something .
really terrible capo and i 'm definitely returning mine .
do n't buy this thing .
the closer you get to the headstock the worse it is .
so i 'm off to find a new better capo for my 12 string .
case is great but it came scratched .
not what i expected .
is to large for the way i planed to use it .
this was exactly what i was looking for .
definitely 5 stars.highly recommend these for any instrumental group .
when i order something new , i expect it to be new .
based on this product alone , i would not recommend buying from this seller .
the screen fell out as soon as i pulled it free from the packaging .
i have had to rig the thing to keep it together .
i probably should 've just made my own with a wire hanger and stockings .
everything else kinda works .
the clamp clamps and the adjustable arm allows for just that .
looks good out of the box .
i had to reinforce it with aquarium tubing to make it be usable .
terminally flexible would be the diagnosis , technically speaking , i believe .
how does that work in performance ? ! !
and it was too heavy to hold in concert .
i guess `` musician '' to this maker does not include vocal musicians
the smell is quite overwhelming and room-filling !
i 'm hoping over time it will diminish .
the vinyl skin covering the case seems rather thin and delicate .
the fit is quite tight .
it 's small , many of my scores would n't be able to fit .
no pencil holder either .
this folder is very good-looking but not as useful as i would like .
the pockets are not flat but have elastic .
two separate pockets instead of a single wide pocket .
did n't fit the guitar that it was suggested for
it works perfectly for its intended use of preventing plosives .
gives me much better mic sound .
the adjustment arm is almost useless as it does n't hold its position .
i do n't recomend this item .
it was an off brand , not the actual kyser capo .
these are heavily padded , thick music folders .
i would have preferred a lighter folder , although at least they are protective .
this is rather impossible , as the pockets are under 10 '' wide .
the folder is well made but poorly designed .
on the plus side , the customer service from musician 's friend was outstanding .
the package was shipped securely and arrived quickly .
i would definitely buy other products from this company .
it is a chinese knockoff .
again , do not buy .
i have four roland dp-2 's and three are broken .
they stop working and get stuck 'on ' for no reason .
i do n't think i 'll buy another .
very disappointed in the shipper .
that particular string is constantly out of tune once the capo goes on .
have n't had that issue with other capo 's .
the picture tricked me !
not even a full week of owning this and the sustain sticks .
would have been better off just buying a generic brand to be honest .
do n't bother wasting your money guys ,
no doubt , this pedal produces distortion sounds .
yes , i know it 's a classic- it 's just not for me .
i purchased the boss ds-1x instead- we 'll see how that sounds .
pedal was dead out of the box .
never worked , bought the recommended power supply ( which works )
defective - i had to return
this case seemed to get favorable reviews , so i ordered one from amazon .
upon unboxing the case i noticed immediately a few blemishes .
the thing that really bugs me is the flap of outer material hanging loosely .
my epiphone lp standard fits with some gentle persuasion .
maybe i got a dud .
i was n't aware that black paint costs 10 dollars .
just does n't work for me .
i 'll need to buy something else .
it will protect your guitar around the house and going to practice .
the quality is exceptionally poor .
the cover is soft and tears really easy even with a gentle bump .
i was sent a banjo case and not a les paul guitar case .
i returned the case thru ups .
i have not recieved my refunded monies yet .
lots of comments when other musicians see it .
had to change this rating .
zipper is a weak point .
it came apart causing the case to be unable to open .
the capo is a really nice piece and does its job well .
led light failed after one hour .
i miss the days when boss made good products .
buy yourself a blues box and do n't waste your time and money .
out of three guitar pedals ordered here , all have been returned .
review might be updated when i actually get to try it out .
it has started working again but the distortion sounds horrible now .
even with made in japan , there are different types .
i have that review on guitar fan site .
for new players , i recommend keeley mod .
fender , gibson , yamaha ... coach bag company is a perfect example .
he is pretty sure it happened getting it on ornoff the school bus .
2nd defective product item in a row .
i will never buy from this seller ever again .
this is one of those pedals everybody has had but has moved on .
have n't even gotten to use it .
had replace the battery and one of the 9 volt connector pieces snapped off .
produces little to no noticeable effect on my guitar .
i 've tried everything that one would think would solve the problem .
i 'd have given no stars if that was an option .
the capo i ordered does not match the picture , which is pretty frustrating .
through , `` never been more happier . ''
my own experience was that i was disappointed .
when the instrument arrived , there were no instructions for setting it up .
one important step was to do an initial tightening of the drum skin tension .
a third was barely hanging by its staple .
the fourth was solid .
this was not the case for this instrument .
if there are people happy with their 6-string banjos , good for them .
but something happened to the quality control between then and now .
do n't even bother w this pedal , it sounds like balls..
power connector is cheap and intermittently disconnects since new .
i was surprised because i was not doing anything to the drum key .
if only evans knew who i was ... . shame shame evans .
stopped working after about a week in a half .
be advised when buying instruments : you never know who is shipping or how .
returned the 'jo and got one locally that i could see .
sad ; not offputting from amazon 's sake , but a lesson nevertheless .
here 's the deal with this pedal .
this was a replacement for the first case i received that was defective .
the first case had an indentation right near the latch .
worried that when carrying in bad weather , the case may not be waterproof .
lets see what happens with the third .
not expecting much and have a feeling i will be returning that also .
always though that skb cases were well built quality merchandise .
obviously i was wrong .
at least amazon 's return policy is easy enough .
third case was what i expected .
too bad it took three to get it right .
this bass was a serious disappointment .
the sound was lousy .
the fret board sounds like a buzz saw .
fret buzz on every string at almost every position .
i would never use it in a real gig .
this looks nothing like the photograph .
at first it was pretty solid .
the hiss is irritating ... ... resembling the technology of the 1970s hardware .
i believe that boss can correct the poor design creating the unbearable hiss .
there are a few things one would expect when buying a guitar case .
spend a little more cash and get a good case .
this one is just too cheap .
went to radio shack they had none that fits .
suppoused to always send an electric equipment with its power outlet ... wtf
this pedal is just terrible .
its thin and weak sounding and just muddles everything up .
basic distortion / nothing fantastic .
its a good pedal for someone just starting out .
constructed well looks good sounds less than average .
tried to drive it and it just gets worse .
great pedal for a kid to play with but on stage do n't bother .
selling mine off for some new strings .
this is your deal . ''
i 've played guitar for over 10 years .
like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the ds-1 .
so i snapped one up just like everyone else .
so i plugged it in and did n't really care for it .
the distortion was harsh , thin , artificial sounding and always noisy .
a very worthy pedal , unfortunately overlooked by many .
probably my personal favorite .
its a rich , full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy .
i 've never heard a bad tone out of mine .
a truly excellent pedal .
very big , saturated and warm .
basically , its a pre-amp that sits on the floor .
its an unbelievably versatile pedal , and its even true bypass .
a true hidden gem that 's actually cheaper than a ds-1 .
hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for .
find something you truly love and buy that .
then you need to push the up/down buttons to change it .
why all this hassle when all i want is a simple click per beat ?
and indeed , the tuner has a hard time when there 's background noise .
i find it useless for acoustic guitars if there is any background noise .
not a good idea .
metronomes should click.. click click click click ... .
works great in a quiet room .
after years of playing acoustic guitar i purchased a fender strat and a ds-1 .
famous musicians did not record with a stock , present day ds-1 .
the boss od-3 can create the sounds you are accustomed to in popular music .
the od-3 allows the tone of your guitar to come through the distortion .
but the ds-1 sound is unacceptable .
i was n't impressed with this pedal at all .
i 'd shell out the extra $ 20 and get a big muff .
this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use .
boutique and distortion are an oxymoron .
metronome is not loud enough for any serious practicing with any instrument .
the tuner does not track pitch very well .
i gave it a 2 over a 1 star review because the tuner works .
remember this from the boss write up ?
no more looking down at the tuner . ''
what really makes this a bad deal is the so called metronome .
again you simply ca n't hear it .
i bought this thinking i was buying a tuner and a metronome .
it 's a shame cause as a general rule boss makes good stuff .
but i would advise you to pass on this product .
this is at best a tuner .
not me , thank you .
honestly i think its hardly worth the space it occupies in my case .
i would recommend this for my rivals , my rivals students , and hitler .
i can not recommend this device because the metronome is uselessly inaudible .
there is no headphone jack and no volume control .
( the store had the same price as did amazon . )
) , then press another button to complete the operation .
omigosh -- who do they think they 're kidding ? !
and yes , `` there 's an app for that . ''
the iphone/ipod touch have great free apps both for tuning and for the metronome .
it will turn off randomly ( sometimes before a minute is up ) .
i thought i could plug in my headphones and use the metronome but nope .
the tuner works like any other tuner .
it 's kind of hard to hear over live drums .
this tuner is alright .
it works best in quiet environment .
i used this tuner to help when tuning my acoustic guitar .
i exchanged it for another tuner .
now i regret it .
i was confused with how to use the metronome .
it had things like 0/4 1/4 etc .
i did n't get that .
the metronome was strange because it did not display time signatures .
also the beep sound was unusual for a metronome .
this thing is way too quiet and there 's no way to fix it .
the tuner part of this is okay .
as another user mentioned , it works best in a quiet room .
also works well if you plug directly into the guitar output .
the metronome is junk .
even on new batteries after prolonged use it shuts off .
the only plus side is that you can set it easily .
i took it back and got something better .
i 'm usually a big fan of the boss company and their products .
the metronome is useless .
because there is no volume control whatsoever .
it 's so soft that it 's embarrassing that they even incorporated it .
the tuner function seems decent although i have n't used it extensively .
i was very disappointed in this tuner .
works well , but heavy and cumbersome .
changed it for a honey tone -- much better .
this amp gets high marks for form and low marks for function .
it is portable and light .
roland should have put a bigger speaker in it .
i 'm returning it .
i ordered this item directly from my daughter 's amazon wish list .
unfortunately my brother did the same thing and my daughter got 2 of these .
she only needs one .
i spend aa lot of money on amazon and am very upset about this .
i just do n't get why so many people use this capo .
in my experience , it is useless .
if you enjoy re-tuning continually , then you will probably like this capo .
it will save you time and grief .
and yes , you can park it on the head when not in use .
forget this capo , and invest in the planet waves tri-action cap .
the sound is cheap .
like a little kids toy purchased at a family dollar store .
the rings are piercing .
i would not recommend this for any age or event .
it 's cheap and easy to use .
it 'll do the job , but i do n't like it .
i have several kyser capos .
different color for each guitar .
no one seems to care except me .
i hope you have better luck than i did .
a complete waste of money .
the 1.0 mm dunlop ultex feel much thinner than 1.0. very flimsy and small .
stay with your old dunlops , these ultex dunlops are terrible .
this is definitely a gig bag .
i suggest paying an extra $ 10 for the protec max case .
the weight of the 2 cases is comparable .
they last individually about a week .
they also wear smooth quickly on the grip .
i would recommend stearing clear of these .
month inn and plastic cover already ripped
i was expecting a better quality this strap looks used
extremely disappointed i will be requesting a refund .
i would probably not purchase a again .
overall looks are great but quality and duribility are not there ! !
not bad for the price !
i keep hoping i 'll find something it does work well with ...
the spring is too strong for a six string capo .
this capo is really small .
it bareley fit my guitar and it said six string for acoustic basicly .
but it did n't have the straight top .
but it was wavy not like the picture .
wrong product not ordering it again ...
it came all scratched .
one star for the seller not the product .
plus the quantity says 4 .
beware of this seller , i do n't think they are on the level .
if your play style utilizes a heavy attack these are the way to go .
i have to take back my favorable review from before .
what did n't this company turn out a precision instrument to begin with ?
returned this -- it musically did n't sound right .
please do n't waste your money .
this product is broken ! ! !
i have n't time for return this product .
i am very hungry .
having recently joined a recorder ensemble , i bought this recorder .
it was similar to one i played in a teacher-prep course in college .
while the sound was nice , it did n't last long .
i had to buy another recorder , a plastic one .
the tone is just as good .
i am an adult woman with smaller hands .
i was unable to do that with the hohner .
the pearwood also scratches easily .
sweet sounding as this price better then plastic one even better then aulos 307b
that was my first time using it and it broke .
i bought the wrong gauge .
i bought the .90 gauge at guitar center and love them .
these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound .
dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new .
buy em ! ! !
the recorder is okay .
a nicecase but size wrong returned at my cost wish the sizes were better explained
i really liked this recorder when i received it a half year ago .
i do n't think that this should be happening .
i use it only approximately an hour a week .
for many years the hohner pearwood recorders were my favorite wooden recorder .
they played well and had a nice tone .
they were easy to maintain .
i bought this case for a guild d25 12 string .
the case is too short for this guitar .
i would see this as frustrating to beginners and unacceptable for those more advanced .
my case came with one broken latch .
i will never buy these again .
this is a great guitar case -- exactly what i was looking for .
so , nothing wrong with the case -- but you should provide internal measurements .
will not stay in tune .
i have an expensive vintage gibson baritone ukulele .
everytime i retune , i 'm flat within 5 minutes .
cf would not be happy to hear this .
i am terribly irritated by this .
these strings are barely able to stay strung and keep coming loose .
end result is that i bought a new set of strings .
you guessed it they are aquila .
my 1st string wo n't even stay on my uke .
good luck maybe you 'll b more fortunate .
i need to speak to someone in amazon about this ... any one please ...
i expected better from martin .
i will never buy martin strings again because of this .
is there any decent baritone uke strings out there ? ?
thought i would upgrade and get martins .
i have a half a dozen ukes of varying sizes and styles .
the two sets lasted a total of 17 days .
total waste of money .
went down to the local store and got some cheap plastic crap .
will stick to those .
some 30 pound monofilament fishing line would be a better choice .
i returned the bag .
i returned the gig bag for exchange .
but the case is way too big for my classical guitar !
it fits my acoustic dreadnought body perfectly .
i 'm sending mine back for a refund
molded hard foam interior ( harder than styro ) .
a shallower dreadnought guitar would probably be ok in this case .
overall not anything to rave about .
the vendor sent the wrong item .
not satisfied at all .
in the right box , then sell to a customer .
this thing was not good at all .
i really do n't understand all the positive reviews .
this bag is flimsy and the straps are unusable .
even the cheapest gator bag is much better than this bag .
i love my epiphone les paul standard but hate this bag .
i 'm returning it at a loss .
i purchased these sticks because my son wanted the snakes and arrows .
that is not what i received .
i received the plain pro mark sticks with neal peart 's name .
for the money it works but not really impressed .
i expected a bit more from epiphone .
the picture shows a straight finish ( appearance ) .
they gave me the wavy appearance of the capo .
definitely , i 'll return this product .
this picture should be changed so that no other people are fooled .
bag did not have very much padding .
husband barely used it for two weeks when one of the backpack straps broke .
the stitching that holds the strap looped to the buckle suddenly came undone .
i can not recommend this bag .
for anything other than light storage to keep dust off .
sticks received were not neil peart autographed , signature sticks .
recieved product but the tightening bolt plastic was broken .
the clamp was still useable .
very large mounting bolt and may not work for smaller lights
the cable broke and doesnt work
this may be the last kyser i will buy .
also , they mess the tuning up on my guitars .
i am moving to g7 's for acoustic and planet waves for electric .
i 'm really sorry to say that it was very disappointing .
believe it or not , very difficult to install .
the sound was adequate .
is not a good product .
you can find something better .
its hard to make that work fine .
its always with problems .
i was not happy with the challenges to mounting the pads on the bridge .
this system is not working for me .
the idea that someone thought that was a good idea is really quite interesting/hilarious .
do n't waste your money on this .
not good for heavy lights
nice bag , but does not fit epiphone dot as mentioned .
this pickup did n't work out too well .
it 's a very odd and unworkable design .
i may as well put a bench vise on my guitar neck .
they are worth the extra money .
actual size is about 2 sizes too small !
have to return and needed them for work !
i used to love these sticks .
the weight , feel , look , but most importantly , the durability .
i do n't know what happened but these started breaking at a ridiculous rate .
sometimes after one use !
it really is too bad because these were it for me .
oh well ... guess i 'll go back to vic .
remove the metal hooks and its a good bag .
this thing produces an awful representation of what a bass should actually sound like .
i suggest the realist .
the sensitivity on this thing is ridiculous as well .
i ca n't turn the volume up without the it picking up constant feedback .
it sounds very natural and clear but lacks any driving low end .
i thought buying it directly to fishman would guarantee a good deal .
but it did n't .
first of all , it did n't come in a box .
it came wrapped in a paper .
it 's a shame .
i had trouble using this product as the correct tension was between too settings .
i am going to try a spring capo instead .
cheap but good for now
cheap , and you get exactly you what you paid for .
no way this can protect your guitar from anything else other than dust
pony up a little extra cash and get the realist from david gage .
their products are amazing and their customer service is second-to-none .
and please , do n't buy this worthless piece of garbage .
i bought this with the pre amp .
i love the pre amp , which i still use .
no trauma , no stress , no tension on the pickup itself .
it just stopped working .
one of the worst pickups i 've owned .
but unfortunately that is it 's best quality .
this is outdated technology , and i so wish i could sell mine .
who would i sell it to ?
i would have to tell them that it does not work very well .
equalizers fail to remove the sound of your fingers plucking the strings .
the finger sound is the prevalent sound .
save your money for something better .
i tried different locations of the bridge without any acceptable result .
in my opinion , distortion an noise are much too high .
it sounded terrible with the clips but better with the glue .
the sound is still pretty high end with weak bass .
if you like the high end sound , ok. but i wanted more depth .
too snug for my guitar .
not sure which one to guess with next .
i would not order again .
these sticks are some of the best sticks on the market .
2 star for late delivery .
didnt fit the guitar very well
one installed i 'm not going to uninstall and return .
i found a way around the all issues so there you have it .
just buy a new one .
it is sheer luck if the pressure is just right .
keep it , let it remind you to bring your good capo next time .
i used it one time .
i have not used it since .
money done flush down the toilet .
my guitar is 41 inches long .
this case did not fit .
too bad as you ca n't beat the price .
would not purchase again .
spend a little more and get something that will actually protect your guitar .
i do like how this works .
anyone listening ? ? ?
so , i contacted bbe .
the contact information on the website is totally useless .
it went out the next day and was received by kenny on 11/9/2016 .
i was told normal turn around was 9 business days .
the message promised a response within a few days .
it has been a week with no response from anyone at the company .
i even doubt it 's actual shira kashi oak .
just be careful ordering from this specific offer .
used it twice and it died .
it does do what it is intended to do .
one tube perfectly suites two 2x4ft panels .
i was forced to temporarily shut my studio down .
i might recommend gluing these to cardboard or pegboard etc .
to then hang them like poster frames .
takes up to much time .
i would n't recommend it to no one .
quicker , much much quicker .
i really do n't have a single good thing to say about this stuff .
- it works poorly as an adhesive .
the spray stuff seems to work better .
( user error is not impossible , but that 's my experience . )
- it 's pricey .
so , yeah , definitely not the right stuff for me .
these sticks are nothing like promark before they were purchased by d'addario .
they do n't look as cool , there 's no sumo wrestler .
also , the paint rubs off very easy .
overall , very disappointed .
i did n't receive the sticks shown .
they did n't have rush written on them like the pictures .
i was creating some sound control panels using auralex studiofoam .
the tubtak was too thick , it broke one of my caulk guns .
bbe sonic maximizer 882i demo and review https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=losl-gdhlpk & index=258
for the price i thought it would out perform a graphic eq .
i do not recommend this product
very unsatisfied with the morley .
minimal volume change and all within the first centimetre or two .
i have since purchased another brand .
this thing is a joke .
trust me , you do n't want this thing .
they break to easily i broke em within a day .
i really do n't recommend these to hard hitting drummers - j
not even close to fitting my guitar .
sorry : ( maybe my ukelele ?
said they would replace this , not recieved in over a month .
fine capo , except one huge flaw .
the spring used in the capo is insanely strong .
if you 're toating between practice with an instructor , it 's okay .
this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage .
i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag .
not a very great product .
spend the extra money and get something hand wired .
further search pointed to ground loop .
returning it and look for other alternative .
i purchased the product about 3 days ago .
i give it a star for being the fastest shipment i 've ever had .
i only recieved three !
i need six to play music !
i 'm very unsatisfied with the product .
the lower strings create a rattling sound as you strike them .
i 've never experienced this before with other strings .
a musician friend of mine confirmed the same impression .
i have to conclude it 's the strings that are rattling .
edit : 3/14/2013 all good things must come to an end .
also , kyser capos are made in the usa by americans .
; - ) charity starts at home !
these are not viola string , they are violin strings .
skb hustled out a pair of replacements -- but the wrong type .
it is larger than i needed , but the extra storage is welcome .
the handles and locks are good , and the padding adequate .
i say upgrade the housing and it 's a 3 star plus case .
waaaaaaaayyyyyyy to big unless you have a frekin massive board .
thinish plastic , not enough padding .
do yourself a favor and get a different one .
the minimum dimesions on this thing are wayyyyyy off .
on the other hand , i 've tested it with two inputs one output .
the pedal is almost transparent .
so it really depends on what you wan na do with this pedal .
my mmv supposedly came with these on it .
i guess i bought a bad batch because these sound awful
if someone knows how to use it they might like it .
the wingnuts are also very cheap and none of mine were drilled straight .
returning for a refund .
all scenarios produced the same result as mentioned above .
i tried these to restring a classroom set of guitars .
i 've had 6 b and e strings completely slip out .
i 'm a bit surprised with all the positive reviews here .
the inside is very nice , and the fit was perfect .
too bad the quality just is n't there .
how come a chauvet mount wo n't work with a chauvet light ?
the only cure is a reaming tool to relieve the holes provided .
it does n't work .
do n't buy them , go for the adj o-clamps instead .
those things are great !
this item was cheap and a complete waste of money .
it did not do the job and was cheaply made .
these clamps are what they are ... cheap .
fine for small venue installs and for extremely light duty work .
par 38 's or lighter only .
maybe willie nelson can use this case for his battered guitar ?
received the wrong strings .
the 1.0 mm dunlop ultex feel much thinner than 1.0. very flimsy and small .
stay with your old dunlops , these ultex dunlops are terrible .
fit great until using them to drum .
then the ripped across the palm the first night i used them .
the added wrist support does n't allow the wrist to move freely .
e string broke when i tried to tune .
they last individually about a week .
they also wear smooth quickly on the grip .
i would recommend stearing clear of these .
one of the poorer buys from amazon .
i do not like it ! ! !
would not recommend purchase of this case .
the case is very heavy and that is a drawback .
it has protected my hummingbird however .
musician 's friend is not my friend .
needed to call and call to have it removed from my bill .
i am one unhappy camper and they need to get their act together .
they lose tone rather quickly .
i really do n't like them much .
try ernie ball or d ' addario 's
the case is very nice .
the biggest problem for us was the weight of the case .
we tried it once and it was impossible to be considered practical .
looks cheap , but does the job .
it is just beyond the return date .
on my ibanez acoustic , it only properly frets 5 of the 6 strings .
i returned it for a dunlop , which works beautifully .
this thing was beat to h*** by the time i got it and non-functional .
i have been using martin marquis , which sound great on the d28 .
i bought 5 sets , tried 1 , threw the other four away .
i have a schubb now , which kicks the clamp-on capo 's behind .
i bought a new drumsticks and , the seller sent me a used pair
i have a tiny harmonica ! ''
and nothing more than that .
however , to be quite honest , this thing is utterly unplayable .
they are much easier to play and sound a whole lot better .
i got the capo in for my 12 string .
so right now i am completely unhappy with my purchase .
so i am going to leave this complaint here .
the capo itself is great - but not what i wanted .
it has now been a couple of months and the link is still incorrect .
strings arrived with rust on the plain strings .
bought this item through musician 's friend .
i took it out of the box and plugged it in .
evidently this unit had never been tested before it was shipped from the factory !
i did n't even bother to send it back .
it was n't worth the trouble .
maybe i can use the bulbs .
at least they worked .
i 'll probably never buy another chauvet product again .
this did the job , so i was satisfied .
but i would not recommend this for a jobbing dj/party organiser .
this is a joke barely playable
string busted when first installed
one star for the seller not the product .
plus the quantity says 4 .
beware of this seller , i do n't think they are on the level .
if your play style utilizes a heavy attack these are the way to go .
reed action is too stiff .
requires concerted effort to get reed to vibrate .
such is the case on all the notes .
you will not be able to play this at all .
what on earth do they mean by perfectly playable ?
i hope my one star review will help someone else avoid making this mistake .
and shame on them , for saying these are perfectly playable .
this one is nothing like mine .
this one requires a lot of breath .
i bought 4 as gifts .
so bad i tested all four .
into the garbage they went .
it 's what you want .
six full sized , rich sounding holes in a wonderfully machined pocket sized harp .
soooo much better than any other mini-harp out there .
would not buy again .
thought it would be okay , but it is not really playable .
extra star since it 's $ 2 .
i thought this thing would play , not well , but play .
it is so out of tune that it is painful to hear .
it is strictly a piece of jewelry or a fob for your keys .
maybe good for a laugh .
i wo n't try to buy a mini-harmonica cheaply again .
unfortunately , this box of reeds was not up to my liking .
three out of the five reeds were not usable .
they sound good ... however , these strings break almost immediately .
very limited set of patterns .
it would have been ok for the 90s but very limited for these days .
rip-off and waste of time .
do n't trust music buys .
i ca n't recall this item
i bought the wrong gauge .
i bought the .90 gauge at guitar center and love them .
these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound .
dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new .
buy em ! ! !
sent it back because no back light on screen ,
the g and d strings break almost daily as well .
if you are a serious guitar player , get something else
ca n't expect to much though , it was a cheap bow .
i am confused a bit by this product .
just did n't really like the sound they produced .
it was in the right tuning just had a funny sound
a bit too short , even for 6 string lap steel .
get the long dawg instead .
do not order these reeds .
they arrive in an open box and none of the reeds are sealed .
package showed owing postage , but was supposed to be included .
put strings on guitar and one broke immediately .
ordered a box , it came used .
making up a drum set .
of these , i can easily change the tempo for live performances .
but this is where easy ends .
this has been a frustrating experience , to say it respectfully .
ive been spoiled by fruity loops ... this thing is a dinasour .
that being said , it is fairly simple to create your own patterns .
oh , well , its all part of the journey ...
nothing at all like the original i owned in the mid 80s .
its more complicated and doesnt have as many options .
i found a older version on ebay .
but i chose to but new for the same price .
now the ebay unit has been sold .
these strings have a very metallic and unpleasant sound .
i do not recommend them to anyone with a cello
this drum machine does n't have any beats i could use .
it sits in a drawer collecting dust .
whoever said this is a good machine probably never had another to compare .
not putting it down , it 's just not for me .
one or two beats does not a drum machine make .
the sr 18 is fantastic .
this 0ne , not so much .
terrible synthetic sounding drums .
very weak on jazz and blues rhythms , not particularly intuitive either .
i never use it .
they broke as they were being installed
long winded but i needed to vent ! !
i got a box of tenor sax reeds .
extremely disappointed at the waste of money .
arrived defective ... had to send it back
my daughter has been using these reeds for several years .
does the inventory not turn over quickly ?
we will not order reeds again .
quite shrill initial sound and then completely dead within a couple of days .
i also found them very stiff given the gauge .
i went back to my john pearse 200l 80/20 's .
does not stick to the instrument at all .
not worth the money or for any amount if it does n't stick .
i checked the primary circuit and there seems to be a short circuit .
had to send back it was a defect .
i started reading the manual , then started falling asleep .
i just want to jam with a beat , not write beats .
and i personally thought it sounded very mechanical and fake .
that 's why they say 'drum machines have no soul ' .
what adapter do i need for my fender mini twin ?
i connected to fender mini tone master and strummed my guitar a few times .
then it was broken within 10 seconds .
i also heard there was some noise while no nose with 9v battery .
maybe the voltage in australia is 240v and it was not suitable .
i would not recommend to the users in the country with high voltage .
the price was reasonable and it may work for most of people .
but it was just a waste for me .
i got this because it was specifically recommended for the honeytone miniamp .
the buzz drowns out the guitar entirely at reasonable volumes .
there is no buzz at all with a 9 volt battery in the amp .
it only has a couple of beats i like .
's run down in less than an hours use .
if i had it to do over , i would not buy it .
no original package and no original label .
they were used strings , not new ones as it was published .
it looks nice but have n't used it
the sounds are so , so .
i sold it within a month with 50 % loss and got boss dr-880 .
that what i should do in first place..
can not get drum machine working .
out of 10 - 2 are broken and 6 are chipped .
ordered these in may and so far only one was used..
your advertisement for this product was a complete farce !
they did n't last near as long as others ones we have purchased elsewhere
seriously , save your money for the real deal .
the strings that did not break sound okay .
the dod chorus beautiful pans back and forth equally with a bright shimmery brilliance .
this one is not for me..
its impossible to blow through and the response is horrible !
i bought one of these several years ago .
however , upon connecting the cables to an amp , no sound was produced .
these things will stop working .
i took it to radio shack only to find out that it doesnt work .
i want my money back because my son worked hard for that money .
if you want a good pedal try mxr or electroharmonix .
for a good chorus pedal try the mxr analog chorus .
i would not buy it again .
this is at the bottom of the pile , let me tell you !
the joke is on whomever thinks this is a cool mic .
my 11 year old said do n't buy again .
i just got the sr-16 .
i unpacked it and turned it on .
it worked for a couple of hours and then it simply stopped working .
now , i have to box it up and send it back .
this is very uncool .
the qa on this product did not work !
crap ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i 've had an sr-16 for years .
loved it ; used it regularly .
i bought the sr-18 the day it came out .
now i 'm going to ebay it .
i need a drum machine for practice .
stop , start , decent fills that are completely logical and predictable .
but the sr-18 is just about worthless in that role .
here are some of the weird things : genres not grouped together .
different tempos for each pattern .
what 's with that ? ?
different track lengths for each pattern .
on the old sr-16 , all patterns were 2 bars ; eight beats .
boring , maybe , but useful and predictable .
it was easy to insert a fill because you knew what was coming .
.and it starts the fill 8 beats too late .
.at least , not without years of study .
stick with your old sr-16 .
that 's what i 'm doing .
alesis , you broke my heart !
these snapped when doing an initial tuning on our daughter 's guitar .
waste of money - should have bought a different brand of guitar strings .
ok to practice with but not for the studio .
so i 'm back to using the old model .
there was also no invoice included with the product when it arrived .
it is too rigid or something .
it is all down hill , disappointment and frustration from there .
this cable caused my amp to pickup am radio stations .
i swapped it out with my vox cable and the problem went away .
connected it back up and the am radio station came back .
back to the d'addario string .
many people might like it , but for me , absolutely noooooooo !
so when my strings wear out , i got this .
if you have guitars like seagulls or so , definitely avoid this string .
electric and acoustic and a bass .
i mean , what would an acoustic bass sound like ?
so , i tried this out .
i had to fish out chips of glue that came off .
they will look like beads at first .
do we wind the strap at the bottom of the neck ? ! ? !
the key was a mixture of convenience and feasible function .
i do n't feel that either were met .
well , what can i say ?
based on the customer reviews , this purchase seemed like a no-brainer .
and before you ask , `` is it perhaps your output jack ?
`` , all of my other cables work with my gee-tar .
i got one free with a hohner 64x harmonica ears ago as a promotion .
about all it is good for is live blues at a club .
bought rico and had no oroblem4
the first string buzzes on the first fret when played open .
it still plays ok though .
bass was damaged when it arrived .
that being said i still would have sent it back .
but this bass is awful worth maybe $ 50.00 top .
come on ... .70 dollars for some packing foam ?
most other acoustic foam i 've seen is much thicker and heavier .
this product was a total rip off .
especially since the description said 12-4'x2'x2 '' panels .
if i had received 12 pieces then maybe that would have been worth it .
this stuff literally costs like a dollar to make .
now i see the same product listed at over $ 400 ! ? ! ?
$ 400 dollars for a 2x4 piece of packing foam ?
who are you kidding ?
poor sounding quality from my guitar which was a gibson les paul .
i was so excited about this bass .
i was so disappointed by this bass .
it has good sound both unplugged and plugged in .
unfortunately , from the very beginning , there was fret buzz .
at first it was only if played loudly .
then it was all the time if played all but the most quietly .
then it was unplayable .
this all happened in a span of about 5-6 months .
i tried adjusting the truss rod ... it did not help .
it did reduce the sound of the buzz , but it was still there .
i hope this review is helpful .
i 'm pretty bummed out to say the least .
i have restrung my guitar many times .
never had this happen .
will not be buying them again .
i bought this after looking at the great reviews it received .
this was not worth the price .
bought this guitar for my teenage grandson .
the fretwork on the guitar was terrible .
the guitar seems good for the price .
nonetheless , the packaging was damaged ( torn box flap ) .
i may return the product back .
the action on this instrument is terrible .
the last several frets were actually touching the stings .
dean obviously has no quality control with this product .
buyer beware ! ! !
i am very disappointed with this guitar and i will be returning it immediately .
i have no plans to purchases a dean guitar again .
i was hoping to learn how to play so we could jam together .
well , its a rainy weekend .
figured we would get it out , and it doesnt work .
we plugged it into two different amps and nothing !
thanks a bunch : (
the first string i tuned snapped immediately .
it was also the wrong color .
i intend to return it immediately for full refund .
i returned mine for a refund rather than a replacement .
i could not use one .
a waste of money .
guitar looked great , sounded great , but was extremely awkward to play .
i played for my wife who said that they sounded really bad .
i just have learned to like better and little more expensive strings .
switched to red ... love the red !
very satisfied with this article everything was as stated thanks , leo
g string broke on first tune up did n't even get up to e .
d string broke when i was putting it on my violin .
it was still fairly loose when it broke .
strings do n't hold tuning and are easily prone to breaking .
a few weeks later i received a package from rapco .
i opened it up , it was a brand new cable .
that clearly should never have passed a quality control inspection .
they sent me a defective cable as a replacement .
they do n't even quality check their products .
when i called them again , the lady did n't believe me .
never , never , ever again will i ever buy a rapco product .
with or without a receipt .
spend the extra money and go with a better brand .
imagine supplying your studio with rapco cables .
they should pay for my shipping the second time .
i have been stringing instruments for 40 years .
incredibly bad strings ! ! !
two of the four broke before they were even to tune .
hate these strings broke off 1st day of use
strings were great , except something was wrong with the d string .
please contact me to get this resolved .
i had to put the rest of the strings on my students violin .
supposed to get 300 hours out of the batteries will have wait and see .
i purchased the 4/4 size strings ( or so i thought ) on 09/24/16 .
her `` a '' string needs to be replaced tonight .
i opened the package and guess what..they are 1/2 scale .
do n't use on mesh drum heads , unless you use them backwards .
i waited with baited breath for this to arrive based on fishmans description .
silly me ! ! !
got it today -- -- going back today .
bridge snapped after attempting to tune it properly .
got a new bridge .
attempted to tune it properly again .
this is a complete scam .
i ordered tenor saxophone reeds but received baritone saxophone reeds instead .
otherwise , great product .
not a good decision .
go with the v16 's .
i mean holy crap .
just tuning it up was a nightmare .
steel strings , man .
they do not belong on the violin .
it 's just awful .
night and day difference .
these strings fight me on every instrument i try them on .
good response and feel ; nice , quieter sound .
i recommend using vic firth 's bamboo tala wands instead .
bluf : not recommended .
i just do n't like these .
maybe ok for beginners .
unfortunately , the strings are very weak and broke with 3 weeks of use .
buy this if you want to develop scoliosis .
strings broke immediately , all but one .
stopped working after a month .
do n't buy this item .
not the best capo .
buy one that is slightly expensive or just a different one .
i constantly have to reposition it to make it work .
i 've had to go back to my cheapo lee oskar holder .
the other strings are also in poor shape .
strings broken after first time use .
she also showed me the uneven parts on the string .
the capo is to tight and causes strings to sound sharp .
the metal spring broke after three months .
it was ok needed something stronger
the violin is now an eye sore and needs some serious work .
when you attempt to play louder , the pitch bends .
i 'll keep looking and hope i find something better for my students .
these strings start to peel away after only a few weeks use .
sound quality typical of steel strings .
not for the budget-minded as the strings wear out too quickly .
not the right one .
it does hold any harmonica well but i would look at the other types
whether you like a pickup or not is extremely subjective .
in short , choosing a pickup is basically a crap shoot .
well , i purchased a 59 neck for my two humbucker strat .
it and i just never got along .
i found it muddy , unclear , and inarticulate .
this was a bit of surprise since my guitar leans toward bright and percussive .
the anderson h1 is fabulous and just what the doctor ordered .
again , when it comes to pickups , your mileage may vary .
pieces flying off from the first strike .
threw them away 1/4 into the song .
i thought i ordered a kyser brand 6 string capo .
i had two a-strings unravel under my fingertips with this set .
i have to go to a music store for a single string .
there are at least two ways you can remedy this .
but , you are right , we have been assembling them incorrectly for decades ''
it seems to be well built but the ergonomics are n't quite right .
it 's getting a lot less use than i expected .
i would recommend looking for alternatives .
do n't waste your money .
the spring breaks in a short time .
i 've gone through two of this capos !
same thing every time .
product is cheaply made .
i will never buy another kyser product .
not allowed ups to ship because of its size
did not come close to surviving baggage claim .
ruined from one journey .
the lid does n't quite close precisely .
the strings were bent when i received them .
i am highly disappointed .
i could barely get any phrase out and i normally have no trouble .
alternated between new strings i just got and the old ones .
all except the e string were normal .
so replaced them and started tuning again .
i 'm a private violin teacher .
my students got these strings recently to replace some dead strings .
i recommended dominants to them , but they purchased these strings instead .
even then , the tension was not equal across all strings .
these amazon prices are less than what real dealers pay !
now you know why .
not sure what is wrong in the box i got .
my question is why so many reeds in this box is bad ?
should i just buy reeds from local store instead of amazon ?
the inside straps are nice .
sandwiched between foam , and tightly strapped inside .
too much tension , really hard to put on and take off .
any reed that sounds like an airplane should be approached with caution .
they were not what i was looking for .
i need a stick that the band will move on .
so guess i ordered the wrong one .
i did not see that you have any that the band moves on .
thank you for understanding and letting me return them .
these reeds seem dead .
i ca n't play them .
i 've had much better luck with the java red .
i play sax and these reeds i do n't like it .
very dark and without good sound .
not recommendable reeds to buy .
have bought this several times , but this time the quality is really bad .
g string broke on the 1st day when tuning .
all strings have visible defects .
we tried 5 reeds from this box and none of them worked well .
it 's extreme and can mar the back of the neck or even fingerboard .
finctionally it can also throw off the tuning because of the tightness .
it 's also huge .
for a child or beginner , maybe ok , otherwise not .
sound terrible and the rods get bent and frayed super easily .
strings came kinked , but straightened out when i strung them up .
: ( however , they shipped quickly and i appreciated that .
when i attempted it for the seccond try the string snapped .
now i have to wait to get a new d string .
this does work , but its not a real keyser capo .
when it arrived i compared it to my other keyser of the same shape .
1. this label is rights reserved , like on the real one .
2. there are no grooves or textured handle like on the real keyser .
i dislike when being charged for something of a brand u rely on .
only to discover its a fake .
it dishonest and uses the reputation that took the keyser co. time to build .
i 'll buy mine at the guitar store now .
ive added a photo , the top is legit .
the sound is ok , but one of the strings broke just tunning .
broke the e string without much force .
decent strings but the g string has a nick/defect about 2/3 down the string .
metal came bent just like negative reviews said !
what a huge let down !
it came damaged , like out of the box broken .
the case did n't even shut .
the metal seal does n't line up .
what an incredible disappointment skb turned out to be , they ship broken products .
do yourself a favor and purchase at the store after inspecting it .
i have returned mine and am moving on .
weak , skb , weak .
i returned it and had it replaced .
poorly built , and even worse quality control .
i would not recommend and will never purchase another skb case .
will try a gator case instead .
disappointed by this capo .
the bar that runs across the strings has become bent for no apparent reason .
poorly constructed product , waste of money .
-some velvet from inside staying outside .
is that appropriate quality of $ 160 case for $ 500 guitar ?
guys , where is your quality control department ?
i thought when you ordered these you get all four strings bot just one ?
a great idea but these sticks are very delicate and break very easily .
the bamboo styles are much more durable .
i read online that some not so good quality strings do this .
in my case , it was torn in several places .
instead of amazon sending it back to skb , they sent it to me .
it is very cheap !
i have a carvin case and it is far superior to this skb .
if you buy it , you 'll be sorry .
i purchased one of these cases a few years back and it was/is great .
this one i purchased expecting to recieve the same durable and well made case .
it arrived in damaged packaging and in damaged condition .
back to amazon it went .
it might be the same bad unit they keep trying to sell to others .
the plywood cases are heavy , no doubt , but safety first !
the plywood cases will actually protect your beloved guitar .
sure enough , i received my case with the gap on the bottom .
this case got a 4-star rating so they could n't all be bad .
i 'm exchanging this one for a replacement .
if the next one is bad , i 'll exchange it again .
if that one is bad , i 'll try one more time .
if the third one is bad , i 'll try something else .
fortunately , i do n't need to use it for traveling until mid march .
just in case , any suggestions in the same price range ?
shoddy quality control on these cases .
now searching for a higher-quality replacement .
the packaging is not adequate to protect the high performance travel case ! ? !
returned the case and ordered a second time .
the case once again came ups and it was damaged again .
the case wass bent and did not properly seal when in the closed position .
the packaging material is not adequate to protect this heavy duty travel case .
how could it survive being checked on a plane , as advertised ?
i will look elsewhere for a top quality case to protect my expensive guitars .
the bottom on the case does not meet when the case is closed .
there was about a half an inch gap .
it is some type of molded plastic .
i do not know if it was damaged in transit .
its as if the plastic or cheap aluminum metal at the edges got warped .
the opening it left was about 4mm apart at the widest place .
it feels like its definitely going to break off .
ignore this warning at your own risk : )
there is no such thing as good cheap violin strings .
gave it a shot .
the handle to this case broke off in a very minor situation .
there is no replacement available for this case either .
so , you might thinks about buying something else .
maybe its an updated version or something but i definitely did n't like it .
it was way to big for me and it was bulky .
my case did not close properly .
this defect is unfortunate , as i really wanted to like this case .
because of this issue , i am returning it .
it 's been less than 4 months and the case is useless now .
problems : 1. the case never closed perfectly .
the bottom of the case always had some gap .
2. after few airplane trips , the handle broke off .
the case itself seems durable enough .
wayyyy thicker than the standard hot rods .
as loud as 5b sticks .
i would prefer the lighter version
totally different items ! ! !
the lightning rod drumsticks are useless for my purposes .
on the positive side , the delivery was amazing ! ! ! ! ..
5 days from date of order to delivery in australia .
broke after one use , 2 draws of the bow .
for the price we were shocked .
will not buy from again .
this case is not a good value for the money .
this kyser does n't open as wide as the earlier models .
would not fit my yamaha fs830 .
the capo i received has a shallow and short gripping ability .
additionally , i found it to be difficult to grasp and open .
i threw it in the trash .
whether this was oversight or purposeful is beyond me .
they sounded okay at first .
not my favorite , but not as squeaky as i thought they would be .
one of the strings though was very messed up on the ball end .
it was frayed and kind of bent .
i hated the tone .
i ended up purchasing the pirastro tonica 's .
i just brought these and my g string broke .
i do n't know what to do .
i 'm so mad at myself for buying these strings .
there is no way we can comfortably use this .
these are glorified egg crate foam pieces cut .
i imagine production cost for these is around $ 10 .
and they charge $ 100 .
you do the math .
no color coordination at all .
i have five outbox 6 functional strings .
no i have to purchase another set .
these kysers are ok but not really for acoustic so much .
it 's not the best science .
i am a professional entertainer of stage so this a needed .
for basic capo needs ... ... .. it 's great .
it says either through-out and does not make it very clear .
i just received half what i thought i was going to .
auralex just wants to overcharge people for the same equipment .
not working at all !
i still can hear the noise from next door
not buying those again .
because of the other ratings about these d'addarios , i purchased them .
we were very disappointed .
i will pay the price and stick with dominants .
i did n't notice any change in my sound quality from using this product .
i highly would n't recommend this product .
did not meet the expectation of usage .
if you have a skinny neck guitar it probably works better .
see my other capo reviews .
does not absorb sound good ...
product is not as pictured .
product still works fine .
need to update your photos with the correct colors !
purchased it for reducing the noise of my office .
attached the foams on a wall where the sound came in .
it simply did n't work .
not working as expected .
i 've been playing blues harp for over 30 years .
hohner 's customer service is despicable .
only an idiot would not realize this in designing this highly touted ms system .
forget about special 20 's too , they go bad after just weeks .
i 'm switching to lee oscars .
do n't even try to contact hohner it is impossible .
they continue on their steady decline in quality and service .
but their marketing is clever .
take my advice , stay away from this company 's third rate products .
took forever to arrive .
then too difficult for my 13 year old son to use .
i am a semi-pro musician .
i play a hybrid finger-style using a flat-pick and steel finger picks .
dull sounding with a very stiff and unresponsive feel .
so much so that it raised the action noticeably .
strings were `` dead '' the second i put them on .
maybe old ... who knows .
went to guitar center , bought the exact same strings and they were fine .
i have a gibson b-25-12 .
did not have this problem with the previous set of dean markley strings .
i assumed there is some sort of standard length for these types of strings .
what gives ? ? ?
emailed martin -- no response .
so yeah i 'm pretty upset about that .
do not buy this brand of reed .
too much money for them to be wasted so soon !
this is not a very good harmonica .
these are really thin .
we are new to guitar , so maybe that 's obvious to others .
too easily bendable , but its works okay
i really did n't enjoy them they are to flimsy .
i 've actually owed 2 blues harps .
i was n't happy with either one .
of the available options , this is one of the poorest quality .
bottom line : it has a wooden comb and it will warp with use .
it has no effect on the sound leaving the instrument into the room .
your audience will never hear a wooden comb vs. a plastic comb .
the idea that they can is pure mythology -- period .
so save your mouth some pain and fatigue and get a special 20 .
these are so thin that the pics click a lot .
the price you pay for ordering on line .
super thin and flimsy .
cheapest pieces of crap i ever held .
not sure what they made them from but do not buy these .
many time with reeds , only about half the box is usable .
they worked for what was needed .
probably will only by from music stores in future .
these are so flimsy and cheap .
i guess sometimes you really do get what you pay for .
picks were too large .
bigger than they appear in photo ... .
poor shipping speed , picks are fine
consequently i can not recommend this harp .
not to crazy i tried them out the guitar sounded twangy
starting falling apart the day i got it .
not even close to big enough for a 76-note keyboard in width or length .
zipper pulls are also very cheaply fastened and come off way too easily .
my $ 3000 keyboard would 've been severely damaged if i had dropped it .
i am very disappointed .
not durable at all .
there must be something going on .
the boxes were clearly resealed with the same factory sticker as the first one .
maybe there 's a conspiracy to keep musicians away from minor key instruments .
i 've no idea .
the blues harp ms is a solid performer from the middle set .
there are just too many better alternatives .
- ( ****_ ) sound : excellent .
this is the strength of the blues harp .
sounds as good as any great harmonica in this price range .
- ( ***__ aesthetics ) : perfectly average .
looks similar to a marine band .
does not have the appeal of a suzuki .
the plastic comb protrudes , making it extremely comfortable and smooth to use .
the sound is great .
the case is more durable than the lee oskar one .
all of these are better than the mid-priced harmonicas reviewed above .
off the shelf ca n't compare .
d is also common .
g is often used when playing along with guitar .

i bought a 3 pack of hohner blues harps .
the unit is not dirty , nor was it abused .
i disassembled it and checked the reeds and they were clean .
it simply does not clamp the strings .
their `` adjustable '' setting only makes it looser .
i would not buy another kyser capo .
nice full mellow sound but break easily .
the padding is nice , but that 's about .
beyond ridiculous , do not buy this strap or this brand .
material very scrarchy and irritating .
you need to wear a thick shirt or sweater when wearing this .
i did not like the quality of this item .
the edging is rough to the touch .
anyway i decided to restring my guitar with these strings and what a disappointment .
i hope they will mellow into the tone i love .
color is not as bright as it appears .
seems to be a manufacturing defect so i returned the unit .
i do n't have comments on play ability .
i was really excited to get such a nice looking guitar strap .
it was a russet/orange color .
i was very disappointed .
very very disappointed and unhappy with this .
edges are rough/jagged an uneven .
have bought dunlop for years and was sorely disappointed with this product .
these picks were too soft , and sometimes made more noise than the strings .
not sure what happened .
i 'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use .
i recommend stearing clear from these entirely .
thinner than i realized .
not great for ukulele ...
orange , not red as depicted .
these were recommended by an online video instructor by they 're too thin .
makes strumming the cords a task .
get the orange ones instead .
they do n't wear out .
i received this hoping it would in fact look tie-died .
i was wanting a fun , bright capo , but this let me down .
they were too small .
makes a clicking sound on strings .
might be good for bass.. horrible for guitar .
would not buy again .
delivery was fast and got product right away .
sorry i bought it tho .
worst capo i 've ever used
had the first one replaced because of broken key holder !
other than that its ok not real happy
do n't plan on adjusting the tightness of the springs .
after replacing them with real nuts ( mine xd ) they work fine .
do n't buy this one .
when i use it , it always slide and shake .
you need to add more pressure to make it hit the bass drum .
do n't waste your time or your money .
you ca n't adjust them and the heads will hit your shins ... .
pedal board broke at the drive hinge after 4 months .
true story : you get what you pay for .
too thin for any guitar .
not the pick for me , too small for me .
i bought these after a friend told me about them .
he told me they help your speed picking but they are not for me .
the shape is odd .
completely unusable if you are serious about playing double bass .
trust me when i say , it 's not a good pedal at all .
do n't let the five star rating say otherwise because they are plain wrong .
the pedals are to far back and are non-adjustable .
do n't get it , save up and get a mapex .
you can not adjust the beaters ' angles ! ! !
do not buy this unless you are not a drummer and will never notice .
i bought mine at sam ash but it 's the same model .
save up a little more , especially if you are new to bass pedals .
two strings broke from the same package .
sorry , but i ca n't endorse this product .
the tension on this capo is way too strong .
picks do n't come in multiple gray shades , only one color gray .
i was disappointed especially because there are even separate pictures of the different shades .
i will not be using them ... waste of money .
too small for guitar players .
nowhere was i told that they are miniature picks .
they looked ok , i just did n't like them being that flexible .
unfortunately the last two orders of .38mm pics were all trash .
the pics just dissolve away while being used .
the black ink on the picks rubs off on your fingers .
different in feel , how did that happen !
how can you call it a dunlop ?
i guess since they both start with d 's ..lol
bend to easily make an odd sound
i bought these for $ 110 , and i hate them !
i am a beginner to double bass playing , and these were cheap .
you get what you pay for !
no adjustment options other than the springs , which they do a poor job .
a little heavier than i wanted but hey there are ok
played one of these pedals last night .
just too stiff no matter how i adjust it .
i have a standard yamaha single which is much smoother than this .
you can imagine i was n't overly excited for this
did not last one song !
this is either fake or they are selling the wrong item ! !
our youth pastor/drummer was extremely disappointed as was i !
tried them but too flexible for my tastes .
if you like a soft pick then you 'll probably like them .
i 've used a lot of capos over the years , including kyser capos .
generally , i consider kyser an industry standard .
there will be no quick capo changes with this bad lad !
i 'd recommend an adjustable g7 capo over this one any day .
the base strings do n't have enough of base when played .
( 80/20 brass ) .
this double pedal for bass drum is good as far as feel and quality .
these picks are very light .
easy to slip and bend very easy .
would not recommend for beginners .
way to thin to be useful .
all i can hear is the clacking of the picks against the strings .
not what i expected , ca n't use them
i currently use an iron cobra power glide and i love it .
very smooth , adjustable , fast , and has a great feel .
get the cobra if you have the money .
i 'm astounded that this pedal is n't getting horrible reviews .
the pedal is barely adjustable .
this is extremely obnoxious and it gets painful .
this fact alone makes this pedal something that i would never recommend to anyone .
not my style for what i play ( rock ) .
very frustrating and unprofessional .
i always shop around , and read reviews .
better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast
these .46 mm picks are just way too thin , like paper thin .
i do n't know how anybody can play with these .
i orders 2 packs and only got one of them .
i had to send this back .
its a great concept but not well thought out .
when you put your mic system in it fits snug with the foam pads .
unfortunately it did n't work for me .
i 'm a huge fan of gator products too .
really do n't like the sound of these strings .
how many come in a pack ?
very rigid and hard to break in .
i like thin picks .
it is too stiff and hard .
it needs to be a bit softer .
broke at the metal pin after 5 months of use .
very unhappy with this product and will be sending it back for a refund .
happy with the experience of the purchase , just not the product itself .
unless your microphones are incredibly short , this will not work .
but it was not tall enough for me to use with my band .
these cases are the most annoying things ever .
i am considering returning them .
this is a very good cleaner for 'satin finish ' acoustic guitars .
this is not a microphone stand .
its not even 7 feet or 7 inches it is more like 3-4 inches
as a beginning guitarist , i love these picks .
when i lost the pick i looked to amazon to buy the same ones .
warning : packaging is terrible .
the cardboard box that it arrived in was way too big .
padding was not needed for something that is barely 2 inches by 4 inches .
the plastic bag supposedly containing the picks was cut open on the side .
i paid for 12 picks and got 2 .
the strings are great when they actually make it to your mailbox .
i wrote that they did n't arrive to both amazon and usps .
uninsured means out of luck .
i should have just thrown it away .
i received a broken string in my package .
it was so strange .
poor to pick or strum with .
at a music store they range from 25 to 40 cents each .
the description for this item does not show a quantity .
not happy at all ...
( i do n't know if that 's the best way to describe them .
but these strings went dead and muddy sounding really fast .
more than i can handle .
they 're gross right now .
going back to d'addario .
both are fantastic , but the difference goes well beyond the color .
this is not the first time this has happened .
the whole package of picks was bent .
all picks curve the same way .
i never paid attention to it until now .
fender thin picks in red are completely flat .
as a result , if you flip these picks , the feel changes completely .
i take care of my set
`` textured '' would have been much better .
if it was n't so difficult to return it , we would have .
we ordered a different 6 string capo which fit my son 's guitar fine .
we were extremely disappointed .
i still ca n't play my guitar and will look for another brand .
it was too small for my shure microphones !
but c'mon gator - do something with the front and rear covers .
the hard plastic cases where almost have the price of the eva case .
was not what was advertised did not hold a receiver .
after waiting two months for delivery i received wooden checkers
the issue i have been having is with the g-string .
be cautious of these strings !
picks are a personal thing , and no one pick suits every situation .
( i 'm talking about acoustic picking .
maybe it 's fine for electric . )
good for a pretty look and thats about it .
then repeatedly say how beautiful they look .
i 'm very thankful for amazon 's return policy and process .
returned as soon as i discovered that they do n't fit wireless microphones .
too good to be true .
my review does not speak to the stubby picks themselves but to the vendor .
i had hoped the stubbier width would make it easier to hold .
however , they are made of a more rigid plastic .
i was unable to produce the rich tones my thirty-five-year-old acoustic guitar can give .
alternating up and down strokes was uncomfortable for me too .
oh well , my mistake .
i am back to using my tama drum key .
this is obviously made in china as the quality reflects it .
not deep enough for wireless mikes
i do n't know why everyone thinks thinks that these are so good .
thicker pick = worser playing do not buy
does n't open as wide as earlier models .
design has changed ... not a fan .
this will only fit a standard wired microphone ( sm-58 or others ) .
and i 'm not talking cheap lugs .
evans , please redesign this to precision .
i will buy one if you do ...
not much better than cutting up a credit card to make a pick .
stick with fender or planet waves .
to small to accommodate the cords tot he mics .
you will have to carry another bag just for that .
i found another case that carry 's everything in one bag .
still do n't have one to fit my mikes !
they 're not bad picks , just not for me .
too soft and `` round '' sounding and feeling .
i play mostly hard rock and metal , your mileage may vary .
i bought 2 packs of these guitar strings .
i have never had such fragile flimsy strings .
going to send gibson a message aobut this .
high e string broke while replacing and tuning
i fell for the same thing .
i thought that it was a multi colored pack .
way too expensive for what it is .
i can get them much cheaper at our local upscale music shop .
and it is just one colour not several as shown .
they need to change the picture .
the case is too small and i will be returning it .
the mics can not fit in the bag .
we have wireless mics , maybe that 's the problem .
wireless mics are much longer .
it was an off brand , not the actual kyser capo .
it is a chinese knockoff .
again , do not buy .
i usually get ernie ball and i 'm sticking with ernie ball .
got these once , they broke the second time i played .
( during a gig )
that particular string is constantly out of tune once the capo goes on .
have n't had that issue with other capo 's .
the picture tricked me !
not a fan of this size , quality is good tho
had one of them crack in half , but stay intact .
it was old and my backup one that i keep in my wallet .
are they supposed to be able to break like this ?
are n't they nylon ?
what should i do now ?
thanks dunlop 44p.60 nylon standard , light gray , .60mm , 12/player 's pack
and the special had rusty strings .
i 've been using these picks in this weight picks for years .
wore out entirely my felt beater that i had just bought .
buy the clear one from evans .
the worst quality ive ever seen .
ive bought other ones before for the same price and they lasted me years .
these are so flimsy its upsetting
just does n't work for me .
i 'll need to buy something else .
i threw them in the trash .
i do not think that this is a `` new '' guitar .
but i got it at a good price .
so it makes everything kinda okay .
wore out after 20 gigs .
replaced with remo falam .
the capo is a really nice piece and does its job well .
this had never happened before or again with any other kind of picks .
kept unsticking from my drum kick it did n't have much adhesive
what did show up was a 6 pack of small stiff jazz picks .
i ordered this as advertised 8.8 x 4 x 0.6 '' .
i am now using the hard side of the beater until i replace them .
these strings were of horrible quality flat out !
! i would not reccomend these strings for sure !
i expect some thing bigger .
very flimsy but if thats what you 're looking for this is great .
i prefer a stiff guitar pic
hands down the worst bass drum patch i 've ever owned .
now i 'm out 30 bucks for new beaters .
get aquarian or remo instead .
i actually really dislike these picks .
the tone is light night and day compared to these tortex picks .
this feels like a dead stick straight out of the box .
it 's not like i 'm playing speed metal 7 days a week .
not much of a guitar pic .
went will cool cat tongue pics and they are much better .
the quality of this batch of picks is terrible .
it 's like the plastic is thinner and of a different sort .
the picks look like they were n't trimmed and finished with care .
the sound is compromised .
i hope this is a fluke .
these are ok , but i prefer snarling dog
the capo i ordered does not match the picture , which is pretty frustrating .
decent , basic strap .
broke in two months .
i 'm giving this two stars for good reasons .
jim dunlop makes ultex picks which are immensely better than these .
i go through one of these per sitting , at times two .
not liking these picks .
basically my all time favorite picks are the black dunlop nylon 1mm picks .
i can use them for playing any style of picking , including bass .
i ca n't pick notes worth a s*** on a guitar w/ these .
i do n't like them , and i wouldnt recommend these .
even my brother who prefers ultra thin picks did n't like them .
wish there was a negative 4. this is a beginning kids guitar .
if not a beginner spend more get something else
that has been frustrating .
just wishing i could get the quality of that first one i owned .
they still say `` dunlop .60mm '' , but they feel thicker .
the ends are vinyl ( pleather ) and will easily tear .
not at all what was described .
other than that - this pick does sound great .
i bought this as my first guitar because of the affordable price .
not a good guitar at all .
hard to hold , hard to play , lost tone in no time .
it 's only saving grace is that it looks nice .
i gave it away after very little use .
i went and bought an ovation acoustic-electric guitar which is much , much better .
these are a good size but do n't have that same flex and feel .
ca n't get used to them , just me , maybe others .
better than picking with folded paper .
this looks nothing like the photograph .
this strap broke in less than a month with regular use .
ripped with regular use in under 1 month
had it for less than a week .
unless you hold your guitar up high like the beatles .
otherwise it 's an ok strap .
i think these are fakes .
they do not feel or sound the same as 'same brand ' from store .
all i wanted was ... some strings .
i would like some new strings .
the high e began buzzing a week after i bought it .
slowly all the high strings began buzzing .
i guess the neck warped .
i got pissed off one day and smashed it over my computer desk .
it splinter wonderfully and made a heck of a sound .
highly recommended if you plan on smashing something .
not so much for making music .
they are very cheap ang flimzy .
they wear down very easy .
i know they are not exspencive .
do n't buy this guitar , it sucks so badly , trust me
no ernie ball logo and likely a chinese counterfeit .
this guitar is perfect for starters or someone on a budget .
i tried to stick it back down , but it would n't stay put .
i will update my review when they contact me .
i hope this helps you out in choosing a guitar .
does n't last at all .
dead spots develop from warping .
do not buy unless you want a junker for a camping trip .
otherwise it sounds and plays fine for a short while .
it does n't have value , just money burned .
guitar looks great ! !
but it sounds awful .
it 's great except the 13th fret on the first string does n't work .
so i guess i 'll have to send it back .
the leather ends peeled apart the first time i put it on my guitar .
i will be returning .
the leather is so light i 'm worried it might tear .
these do not work with strap locks .
holes are too small .
this is not the same ernie ball strap i purchased from guitar center .
there is no ernie ball logo , as pictured .
this is a cheap , made in china , thin , crappy quality strap .
the ad also claims the ends are real leather .
lastly , the strap itself is prone to twisting .
short length , not ernie ball brand , knock off product
i used to swear by these guitar straps .
the new ones are about a foot shorter at 60 '' max .
it even came in an `` cose '' package
i will update the review when i receive new strings .
this is not an ernie ball polypro guitar strap .
it 's a chincy unbranded knock off .
very thin material and very short length compared to the genuine ernie ball straps .
then you move the pad up against , or away from the drum head .
at least it was only twenty bucks .
absolutely the first time i 've been dissapointed in anything shipped by amazon .
the look of the guitar is good .
the arm was bowed and the string were laying on the arm .
i had no problems returning this item - in fact , very easy .
i did not re-order .
i tried to change it but the peg is too tight .
i got the tools to remove but its very tight .
its been 6 months now and many people tried to help me out .
now i do n't know what to do .
guitar arrived in perfect condition .
however , within a week , the guitar sounded awful .
i have ordered several of these in the past .
the newest one is junk .
thanks amazon for the cheap substitute .
i think that the one i receive was not good .
it seems to have fully dry by the time i received it .
did n't do anything .
i 'm going back to finger ease .
the leather is cheap , thin , and weak .
the webbing on the strap is nice - its comfortable to use .
can came open in the box .
no cap for the applicator stick and no cloth .
super cheap feeling material .
very , very light weight .
this thing is useless for me because it does not dampen nearly enough .
more like extremely little to no dampening .
this product is worth about $ 0.20 ( 20 cents ) .
evans marketing will backfire with me because i will not buy anything evans again .
they really should be embarrassed to sell this eq-pad .
the lubricant on the pad was dry on arrival and not usable .
had this in a stage custom bass drum .
when i pulled it out it took part of the bass drum with it .
the pad works but i would n't recommend the adhesive .
the piece pulled out was one layer about as long as a pencil .
amazon sent me a fake knock off ernie ball strap .
not good enough , do n't trust it .
do n't buy this .
the strap part is ok , but the ends stink .
did not work well for us !
i got the strap and it looks very nice .
but the strap does not fit on my guitar .
buying a leather one now and getting some strap locks too .
cant be too careful with your investment .
hope this helps someone else from having the same experience .
will never buy a guitar from this dealer again .
the people were not reasonable at all .
i like the product but this time it showed up just an empty can .
not sure how someone missed that .
i received an open , empty can , rather disappointing
dried out after a week .
kept inside of tin with lid on .
maybe i got a dud .
likely will not buy again .
the applicator was completely dry when it arrived .
i returned and ordered a second time .
this time it shipped in a bubble-wrap lined yellow mailer .
the metal canister 's cap was entirely missing ( ? ! )
and the applicator 's tip was broken off of the handle .
at least the applicator tip still felt a little wet .
i uploaded a photo of what came out of the mailer the second time .
i must have the worst luck because there are so many great reviews here .
i ordered this item directly from my daughter 's amazon wish list .
unfortunately my brother did the same thing and my daughter got 2 of these .
she only needs one .
i spend aa lot of money on amazon and am very upset about this .
a pillow does a better job than this junk ! !
does very little.and i could have bought two pillows for the same price .
very unsatisfed ! ! ! !
evens should have made a better product ! !
not a good value .
buy a small pillow and some velcro instead .
musicians friend will not let me return it .
so just remember that .
did n't really do much to dampen my sound .
i just stuck a pillow over it .
i just do n't get why so many people use this capo .
in my experience , it is useless .
if you enjoy re-tuning continually , then you will probably like this capo .
it will save you time and grief .
and yes , you can park it on the head when not in use .
forget this capo , and invest in the planet waves tri-action cap .
did n't fit the guitar .
did n't want to risk ripping it
this one was a bit short in length .
be sure to look up its fit dimension before ordering .
not much of a dampening device .
it barely fits my 16 '' bass drum .
i wanted it to lightly touch both heads , but it does n't reach .
pad should be a a little denser/ heavier and 2 '' longer .
it 's worth $ 4 in my opinion .
evans needs to step it up on this product !
it you 're looking for an empty metal canister , this is for you .
to replace the fender you have to buy the set worth $ 78 .
better not to try it..
dry as a bone and not usable .
i 'm sticking to dunlop .
this is my first bad amazon experience and first bad review .
however when i purchased this on amazon the item arrived without a factory seal .
fast fret simply does not impress .
it actually has a kind of `` sticky '' feel .
not like tape , but like a dryness .
sounds weird but the product does the opposite of it 's namesake for me .
very thin not at all what i expected
the nylon feels very uncomfortable .
it 's scratchy and unpleasant .
do n't use it topless .
it 's cheap and easy to use .
it 'll do the job , but i do n't like it .
uncomfortable and slips from the strap nut .
junk fits poorly , feels hard .
i practically threw it out after a fee uncomfortable uses
put it on once , felt like it was digging into my shoulder .
i recently bought a few packs of jazz iiis and i was shocked .
they do n't play at all like what i was expecting .
what 's up with that ?
let 's hope this is just a short-term fluke .
you will be better off using a regular pillow to dampen your base drum .
picture was very misleading .
this thing came in a box full of air wrap .
it could have been sent in an envelope .
ordered another type of inexpensive strap and was satisfied .
i do n't know why i ordered this twice !
the 2nd one was dried out when i opened it .
i have several kyser capos .
different color for each guitar .
no one seems to care except me .
i hope you have better luck than i did .
they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise .
dunlop ultex picks sound much better .
product was fine , but it took a whole month to have it delivered .
the problem with this strap is the holes -- they 're too small .
this was a standard size fastener -- nothing gigantic .
a complete waste of money .
cheap price not very comfortable , was pretty secure thought
drops volume too much for passive use .
only useful on amplified sources .
without ac or dc power , ir is pretty much useless .
it is partly my fault in not realizing it did not require any power .
even with high gain mics connected to it , the volume/sound is pathetic .
i ca n't believe rolls even puts their name on it .
i will definitely read the specs much more carefully next time .
this is a real piece of crap .
do not buy this .
so i 've now trashed this .
what a waste of 50+ $ ! ! !
note its passive not any amplification but the passive actually takes away signal .
this product showed up completely dry with no lubricant .
the replacement was exactly the same - completely dry .
i had to buy a different manufacturers similar product .
sounded awful on my guitar .
cheep starp end pleather poor craftsmanship
there 's barely any juice in these things .
buy rock slide for the best or imperial valley ... . i 'm disgusted
as others have mentioned , the db loss on this is insane .
unfortunately , this was not sufficient enough to accomplish that task .
i originally thought the product was broken .
check all input/output scenarios and all ended out with power output volume .
the build quality is nice but at this point its just a paper weight .
do n't bother with it .
way too expensive and has many disadvantages over a powered mixer .
i was hoping i could get away with one less power cord .
however , the signal loss is very significant .
it was practically impossible to find a good setting on it .
it is a heavy tube .
does n't feel comfortable .
the spring is too strong for a six string capo .
but it is a very useful device .
my biggest complaint is that it failed after only 4 months of use .
they all plugged in fine and mix well .
the individual volume controls are nice too .
this made the mixer almost useless for most types of every day use .
this mixer just does not handle audio well .
this capo is really small .
it bareley fit my guitar and it said six string for acoustic basicly .
but it did n't have the straight top .
but it was wavy not like the picture .
wrong product not ordering it again ...
this is just another overpriced product meant to rip off the unknowing .
this product is simply mineral oil , plain and simple .
save your money ! !
worst set of strings i can remember .
bought these precisely to prevent this .
my wooden sticks are still immaculate .
from my point of view , this is unacceptable .
please advise ! ! !
these tor up my hands badly , and are heavy .
they also do n't have the feel and response of wood sticks .
i would not recommend these to anybody !
slipped off the stud at the base of the neck during a performance !
i had these about 6 months .
granted they did last longer than wood , i had one snap this morning .
these will kill your cymbals if you are an intense drummer .
so great product but be aware who you purchase from .
the product gets 5 stars but brook mays gets 0 out of 5 stars .
produced constant feedback with mics .
played with these for about 6-9 months , and one broke in half .
no offer to replace , nor admitted that there could be a manufacturer defect .
btw , still playing with my wood sticks and still playing well !
do n't waste your money here ; cheap feel
i should 've known better than to purchase something endorsed by lars ulrich .
what was i thinking ?
these sticks are terribly balanced .
not so with these .
save your money , buy regular ones .
to be clear the threaded portion of the stick broke leaving the stick useless .
i was expecting these to last much longer .
disappointing to say the least .
this stick broke in two pieces with normal usage even with a kid !
and they also advice that this stick can not stand rubber pad .
its a stick for infant with drum toys !
strap was too short my acoustic guitar !
this stuff will kill your strings very quickly .
i personally do n't prefer dead strings but i know some people do .
just not my thing .
the leather tore before i even had it on the guitar .
i got an ernie ball strap in red for my epiphone sg .
seems like a great deal for the price .
the ends are real leather , which is the reason i bought it .
the slits in the leather fit tautly over the guitar 's strap buttons .
remember , if you get a strap , get strap locks !
i like the guitar savers rubber locks .
-- -- -- - update about a year later .
downgraded my rating to 2 stars .
for a few more dollars you can get full leather straps .
not major , but good suede or leather would n't have done that .
strings broke easily after first tune .
i ca n't fathom how this is supposed to clean anything .
i only got 5 strings ? ? ?
i did n't have a problem work the strings .
but they showed up a day late .
horrible- fell out of strap on floor first day
i got the burgundy red .
the color is not as pictured , but sort of a dull brown-purple .
when i received it , it was almost dried out .
the slide ease effect is minimal with d'addario pro-arte ej46 strings .
it does n't improve or keep the bright sound of new strings .
ca n't recommend these strings at all .
okay , this is a wrench for me .
i 've been playing and retuning less often than normal , too .
great-sounding product , but the least durable violin strings i have ever used .
the search for great strings continues .
sorry martin , but i cant recommend these to anyone
first of all , these picks are way too noisy for a thin pick .
these picks are very noisy and slippery for strumming .
additionally the tortex logo is a cheap ink print that smear off .
the logo can actually be rubbed off completely w/ the thumbs .
at least that pick has an embossed logo and knurled texture for added grip .
the edges also get sharpened the more they wear out .
if you play bass and guitar , i recommend these .
i did buy the blue 1mm tortex but they were only aight .
the glossy finish glides smother and quieter w/ a nice tone .
its a stupid floppy pick w/ a loud flipping sound .
i received the bag wrapped w/ a rubber band .
some one actually tampered w a sealed product and stole 2 worthless picks .
this made me angry , even though they are n't worth that much .
idk what happened there , but that 's pretty desperate of them .
they offered me half refund , but they never came through .
two g strings and one d string .
i had the medium tension strings before this with no problems for a year .
at 1mm these picks feel too thick and stiff .
i 'll say though that the sound they generate is very crisp and bright .
they are also very durable .
but they 're just no fun to use .
celluloid picks are still my favorite .
but i have purchased a tortex pick from a band at a concert .
so the issue is n't the tortex material itself .
i purchased these by mistake !
they are too stiff .
gave them away to another guitar player in the neighborhood .
i know that he likes them
played strings one time and the d string came unwound .
might have been a factory defect .
i 've used these before in the medium gauge and had no problems .
i changed the whole set and again the d string broke in half .
i never come the product to my hands .
i would not expect it to last very long .
prolonged use would undoubtedly leave the guitarist with an aching shoulder .
overall this is another very disappointing product from ernie ball .
ernie ball strings are poorly made and break regularly .
the ernie ball wah effect pedal is also mediocre .
i will never buy these strings again .
these strings were absolutely terrible .
these picks tend to break easily and look very dull when first bought .
i purchased a set of these strings .
i spoke with someone at the shop .
i explained my plight and he put me on hold for a few minutes .
i am really disappointed .
i am disappointed with the stitching done on this case .
the 1st string break right after tuning .
learning the guitar is expensive and this is one lesson .
the odor is bad .
so bad i can not take it .
change the strings , do n't mess with this junk .
its not just the odor .
i do not want anything this string close to my eyes .
i was hunting for a solution to sweat and sticky .
it helped the sticky thing some but created more problems that it helped .
no grip to them at all .
spend a little more for a better strap .
the picture shows a straight finish ( appearance ) .
they gave me the wavy appearance of the capo .
definitely , i 'll return this product .
this picture should be changed so that no other people are fooled .
my dunlop picks are much easier to keep gripped .
this product is not what it seems .
it has a cool name , but that 's about it .
it 's a tool oil that stinks .
not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty .
too small , like stuffing a turkey .
the bigger ones are much better by a long shot .
these are too light to produce a good sound .
save your money and by the big ones they 're great !
basically , i received a dry cleaning stick .
still trying to figure out why this case has so many positive reviews .
it seems flimsy and that it would not protect my child 's trumpet .
the e string broke the very first turn of the peg !
i got these pics about a month after i ordered them .
this may be the last kyser i will buy .
also , they mess the tuning up on my guitars .
i am moving to g7 's for acoustic and planet waves for electric .
it did not protect the trumpet .
i may as well put a bench vise on my guitar neck .
they are worth the extra money .
very cheap and hard material .
you get what you pay for .
ink comes off with just a couple minutes of use .
but probably wo n't buy any picks with ink on them in the future .
perhaps the ink can be removed with alcohol or mineral spirits ?
just not for me .
way to bright with a tinnier sound i 'm not liking .
i have had two sets shipped to me .
both are missing three strings .
the strap is not that great for a heavier guitar like a les paul .
-sweeping never felt so right ... . !
billy expected gloom and what he got was inspiration and a product that worked !
-hey guys whats your problem ! ? ?
update : just up and died .
i have no idea why .
nothing bad happened to it .
it made it through several gigs and then one day , nothing .
it was great while it lasted .
this is an essential part of my gig bag now .
( correction , see update ) it is solid .
well worth the money .
this is a no brainer .
every gigging musician should have one in their kit .
only five in box .
said it came with 10
one of the strings broke while stringing it .
i 'm not a rookie when it comes to stringing banjoes either .
so i did not do it incorrectly , yet it still snapped : (
the edges of the strap are not smooth and start cutting into the skin .
i was a little disappointed b/c the product image was misleading .
it appears to be a dozen multi-colored picks , but i received all yellow .
two weeks later they still have n't mellowed or broken in .
i look forward to trying them .
i was very disappointed .
the photo advertises a more tealish color with less blue in it .
i feel lied to as a customer
i first want to say i agree with the good reviews for these picks .
quality wise , they are very good .
the grip on them is superb and the sound is great .
beware the misleading picture !
very easy to play , and made the guitar sound fantastic .
they sound ok i guess , but i wo n't be using these again .
hope that helps someone .
these are the worst ! !
the ride especially ! !
just not comfortable with my heavy epiphone les paul .
worst experience ever ! ! ! !
i was super stoked with it until one day it just stopped working entirely .
i bought this bag a year ago and have used it very little .
i still have the tags on it .
there are no signs of stress .
maybe a weak point in manufacturing ; check yours when you get it .
velcrow for handle falls apart after about 3 uses .
would n't buy again .
wo n't at that point go on the ligature .
i need some help .
this just is n't right .
i 've played alto sax for years and i do n't understand this .
ordered this for a new salt water tank installed today .
hopefully , the other one i ordered works .
this one is being returned .
amperage is extremely important !
deliver clean power unabated on demand !
electricity is like water in a pipe !
amperage is how big is the pipe for non restrictive flow !
buy a conditioner offering cord replacement !
pangea makes a ac 9 cord !
this cord provides unrestricted flow !
the ligature is the wrong size and does n't fit soprano sized mouthpieces .
fine capo , except one huge flaw .
the spring used in the capo is insanely strong .
i 'm having a hard time to keep ligature shining .
metal always turn black .
i wonder if there is something wrong with it .
i do not recomended to anyone .
this could be the worst buying choice i 've ever made !
when it finally arrived i was thrilled to get recording .
i could no longer record anything on the card .
i need to return this product asap .
! warning do not buy ! ! ! ! !
avoid at all cost .
very dissappointed with these strings and will never buy them again .
went to rehearsal last night and found the 6th e string was a dud .
can not use with more than three ac adapters ( e.g .
9 volt `` wall warts '' for effects pedals ) .
it is apparent comparing them that vandoren has lowered the quality significantly .
the metal is very thin and bends far too easily .
it is no better than the yamaha which is a fraction of the cost .
i heartily recommend *against* purchasing these strings .
immediately after putting these on my guitar , i was _unimpressed_ .
to both hands , the strings felt slightly tacky .
that was just the first day !
i hoped they would improve , but they did not .
but still : these lasted less than 2 weeks .
for now it 's back to d'addarios ; they are excellent sounding and value .
sounded nice , but quite a few snapped on me .
do n't last as long as some other brands i have used .
it does not come with silver plated cap ... only the silver plated ligature .
edit : 3/14/2013 all good things must come to an end .
also , kyser capos are made in the usa by americans .
; - ) charity starts at home !
the string broke at `` bead-end '' , close to the bead .
i 'm probably not buying these strings again .
i keep my guitar in a nice hard case when its not in use .
they sounded good , for the week that they functioned .
just a fair warning , if you purchase from shoreline beware !
my strings arrived contained in their martin box and within a sealed envelope .
when i opened the envelope and removed the box , it was already open .
i have ordered strings from amazon before but never again .
also cost me more in airfreight to return it than it cost .
complete waste of money .
made me drop my guitar .
became loose after only a couple months .
one of the sockets broke the second time i used it .
very light weight , not very satisfying feel on the guitar .
but it is easy to adjust if that matters to you .
does not work right shuts off by itself
so i think the description is n't quite accurate .
this is not tape .
it 's very comfortable material .
however , there is no adhesive .
it does n't work for me .
first , my thumbs started slipping in between the folds .
so i flipped the tape around .
then it would slip up and down the stick .
i 'd have to re-adjust in between every song .
so i reinforced it with some electrical tape .
still did n't work .
i wish it worked but it 's just too risky .
i was reading the reviews before i bought this .
people are really happy with them .
1 ) the process of putting them on .
the tape has 2 sides .
the paper side kept on sliding off while i was wrapping the stick .
it was frustrating and i did not finish putting them on .
i flipped the tape over and tried the rubber side down .
3 ) materials the rubber side of the tape does not feel that great .
if you disregard everything i said , listen to this .
i bought my 2nd pair of ahead aluminum sticks .
one of the best investments i 've made in my drumming career .
on my first pair i used the vater grip tape .
maybe i was spoiled by getting a better prodict to begin with .
but the fact remains , there is a better product out there .
ahead sticks are great !
ahead grip tape is not .
this had a horrible sound even after being tuned .
i usually buy van doren rue lepic 3.5s .
i consider that reasonable given the price vs the variability of reed stock .
today i received a box of v12 3.5+ reeds to compare .
the product is n't expensive per piece but i feel like i got cheated ...
would n't stay between strings , returned .
it also does n't kill a 60hz hum , if one is present .
worst screen protector i have ever seen .
would not recommend this product .
plus , the sponge dries out very quickly .
i just switched to an oasis in case humidifier .
very awkward to use , not even sure is does any humidifying .
it does not stay in place , slides out or sideways .
you should fork over an extra 10 dollars and get a high quality strap .
you 'll be glad that you did .
a lighter instrument with more neutral balance might like it better .
do not buy this .
its reallly overpriced for what it is .
i have the micro cube also , and it totally blows he pignose away .
not evben in the same ball park .
ok , that will be their little secret .
cheap , but works !
i agree with most of the previous comments .
it is basically a spring clamp with 2 cylinders .
vandoren must be having a lot of trouble with their cane .
not one reed in this box was worthy of playing !
develops black mold very easily .
not healthy for your guitar .
get the humidipak two-way system instead .
nothing but problems with this one .
i swear i 'm not making this up .
fell over once and broke completely .
up until then it worked great for about 2 months .
the ad said it gave a nice clean sound without distortion , also .
amp not operable , arrived with what is apparently a wiring short .
i owned a pig nose in the1970s.loved it .
i bought a pig nose 9volt adapter cord and still cutting out .
i waited too long .warranty is only 6 months .
i would recommend other amps with a better warranty .
this item is poor quality and does n't stay in place .
really disappointing coming from promark .
if i had the box i would return it .
this thing is like a glorified chip clip .
it slips off my hi-hat stand pretty easily just from the vibration .
get something that clamps .
does n't stay clamped very well .
it would be better with a screw clamp .
this humidifier is not a good design .
i have one for my uke , an it works much better .
i 'm surprised that d'addario would not sell a better product .
worst amazon experience ever .
it took three tries before i got one that held up after one use .
just as cheap was the customer service from amazon .
resolving the issue took six contacts .
piece of junk ! ! ! ! !
used it for approx .
it only says `` contact seller '' which is amazon in this case .
would not recommend this product to anyone .
of course `` made in china '' ... .figures
out of the box does n't work .
does n't fit on the stand .
you ca n't angle the holders .
i do n't even use it anymore .
i 'd rather leave my sticks on the ground .
this drumstick holder is just ok ... ..not great but not bad .
it 's really not strong enough to clamp on and stay on .
i plugged it in but none of the power cords plugged into it responded .
it looks like it shorted out inside the unit .
somebody had a bad day at furman and the proof is on my bench .
when i received these reeds , they were n't even v-12 .
they were vandoren paris or something .
they certainly did not have they same quality .
i can not say the same for the distributor of these reeds .
whatever kind of reeds these were made my tone quality squeaky and cheap .
one more odd doodad to complicate my setup and teardown .
my right sock is more convenient !
the tubes swivel unless you tighten them with a screwdriver .
it goes in and out .
god i hate made in china crap .
this thing is the epitome of garbage .
i guess it was my fault for buying this piece of crap .
do yourself a huuuuuge favor and get a practice amp from a different manufacturer .
sure am glad i am a prime member .
thats $ 100 i will never get back .
thanks for nothing amazon , now i got the hassle of a return .
well , hey superstar , start with selling a few things that g.d. work !
the amplifier arrived well packaged and ahead of the estimated arrival date .
i wanted to use the amplifier as a busking amp for my ukulele .
will not be buying an ernie ball strap again .
check out fender 's $ 10 strap on amazon .
that is a good low end strap .
durable and i love the fender logo on it .
total waste of money .
oasis humidifiers are the way to go .
this is false advertising .
i 've had one of these stick holders for 20 years .
part of the clip finally broke off , so i ordered a new one .
it is n't worth the price .
plus , worst of all , it didnt work ! !
at least not on the meter .
one of the tabs broke soon after purchase .
did n't like to have to loosen strings just to get in in place .
there are better products out there .
i 'm better off just humidifing the room
i 'd send it back but the postage might make it futile .
i am going to be tapping this to my hi hat stand .
wtf : the cord is like 50 ft. long !
does nothing but dries up quickly
i realize this is apparently a very popular head .
not much better on my drumcraft .
but i wo n't buy another of these .
these have declined tremendously in the last 10 years .
did n't even work .
had to send back .
i would recommend getting the blackstar amp .
bought new broke after few month .
the quality is incredibly bad .
even the plate that labeled them was upside down .
the holes in the plate were actually through the words on the plate .
even the box it came in was crap !
the box has in big bold letters .
`` worlds coolest portadle amp '' .
that 's the way it 's spelled on the box not my spelling .
i have never been so disappointed in a product .
i am going to post photos to the user photos section .
i 'm also sending an email to the company .
unfortunately , it does n't work and the build quality stinks .
i put in 6 brand new aa batteries and nothing .
wiggled them around , still nothing .
plugged in a new cord .
fiddled with the input jack and volume knob .
it appeared the serial number had also been replaced with a new sticker .
in 1972 these were kick ass little amps ... those were the days .
the unit that i received had fatal flaw !
it would not work on battteries alone ( as a portable ) .
the company did not have an option for a replacement .
so i wasted a week time .
for me that is too much work .
the product itself seems well made .
i recommend not wasting time on this unit .
photo shows whole drum , did n't realize it 's just the top
i was charged state tax and i am in kuwait .
have a nice day guys !
simply did not work .
tried several different sets of batteries .
made sure that it was not my guitar cord .
but no sound from the amp at all .
serious quality control problems , obviously .
very disappointed by the whole thing .
received two of these that refused to power up at all .
reseated the brand new batteries multiple times , tried different chords , etc .
i got a pignose for christmas , but it would n't make no sound .
so it returned to amazon , so easy !
and had another one sent around .
the second one , it was a joner .
tried other cables and guitars .
the second one was a joner .
tried other cables and guitars .
but it would n't play no tune , so it only gets one star .
and , it dries out way too quickly .
i have resumed using the `` stone '' type of humidifier .
i bought one of these for my grandson for christmas .
changed batteries and cords ... and guitars.. just did n't work .
so much for timeliness and quality .
thank you amazon the less than stellar experience .
dries out too quickly .
i bought this to use on my epiphone les paul studio .
i have never really done modifications to guitars except string changing .
i should have known to go for epiphone parts , not gibson .
it does not fit on the screw post .
kept falling off my bass
the sponge is very thin and does n't hold much water .
dries out in 1-2 days
does n't screw onto the switch on my les paul !
it is cream in color , not white .
as others have stated , it does n't fit epiphone les paul .
do n't waste your money .
it just arrived , and it does n't fit .
threw it in the garbage .
does not screw on to my gibson les paul .
do not buy this item .
i thought it would screw right on , but it is too big .
not sure what 's wrong .
it 's also a little smaller in length than the original piece .
they will dry out within 24-hours requiring you to re-wet them everyday .
trust me , it 's worth the effort .
poor build quality on the one i ordered .
not a good design .
i contacted furman via their website and never heard anything back .
it 's very disappointing that they never wrote back .
did not fit my epiphone les paul .
not really crazy about this thing .
do n't see how this tiny little sponge can humidify a guitar .
this is a beginners video the very begining .
video is graint and audio is barely above mute .
bought one , then found out how small the sponge is .
imo it 's not worth buying unless you need minimal addition of humidity
does n't fit my son 's guitar .
not worth the hassle of returning or exchanging .
does n't fit my son 's guitar .
was bought as a gift .
do n't buy in advance !
everthing else ordered was a perfect fit on my les paul .
second , i am surprised by how fast this thing will dry out .
the drum 's sound was terrible , with nasty overtones .
i 've had these for years and would have sworn by them .
now i swear at them .
it 's nice to see that they have come down in price .
i 'm going to a $ .30 sponge .
invest in another product .
worked well for a month .
i used it everyday .
first time this happened , the guitar slammed into a wall .
not too happy about that .
last time i 'll buy a cheap strap .
this is a hard lesson to learn .
all 5 reeds sounded horrible .
i had to shave every one .
do n't know what happened but tried another brand and had good luck .
they 've reduced everything 40 % .
this would be a great humidifier ... ..for a doll house guitar .
chincy with a capital chince .
this new humidifier is a useless toy ! ! ! ! ! ! !
! do not buy , if you value your guitar ! ! ! ! !
by a plastic travel case made for a bath sized bar of soap .
punch or poke a hole/holes in the top .
cut to size if nesc , but should fit perfectly .
place in case pocket .
useless in phoenix , arizona .
dries out after a day or two !
might work great if you live in a humid climate : )
is my house that dry ! ?
and i ordered three of them ! !
i have to say these suck !
in more ways than one .
the old ones were better .
i have two and they work fine .
the new one i bought is cheaply made .
it does n't hold as much water and dries out quickly .
planet waves should go back to the old model .
i bought several of these for my guitars .
the sponges are tiny and all of them dried out within a day .
planet waves does not have a great reputation for quality humidifier systems .
this goes between your 3 and 4 strings , spreading them both way out .
this is a really awful design .
i mean , really awful .
i did n't get anything .
having said that , this product does n't work .
i was told it is incredibly easy to use .
the underlying problem is that it does n't give off much humidity .
i re-fill every night , and my guitar began to crack .
the same thing happened to my friend with the same product .
he kindly pointed me to a functioning one .
too hard to play a waste of my money .
i am not happy with my purchase , i am dissapointed in quality
first time use and this happened not recommended please check photos
this rosin is an inferior rosin .
we switched to jade rosin , and the difference is dramatic !
my daughter has been playing for about a year and a half .
we will never switch back !
i dropped it and it shattered into pieces low quality
this style of tuning key is a lame gimmick that does not work well .
it 's cheap but also ineffective .
buy a drumdial or a tunebot .
this is the second rosin i ordered .
the first one arrived cracked , and so did this one .
this product arrived dried out and hard as a rock , totally unusable .
beware to other buyers !
the fit-all designation is not that accurate .
overall build is good - i 'm just bitter about the fit .
this product is a great product .
and his ltd does not fit either .
i ended up returning this item for my money back .
however , almost does not cover several guitar types , including most gibsons .
these costs were not mentioned prior to the purchase .
i am really dissatisfied by the treatment of the company .
anyone have a picture or video to show me ?
my guitar have only a knob at the end of the body
it 's not worth it to return it .
it was all cracked !
do not buy this product !
just a paper weight now .
wax came and was bad , teacher said to throw it out .
way too deep , way too long , way too everything .
extremely disappointed with this product .
the exterior plastic itself may seem tough but was cracked upon arrival .
i would strongly urge anyone considering this guitar case to go to another manufacturer .
chips easily into flakes all over the place
the rosin was very hard to use .
and i got it cracked in some places .
but got here i time and does what it needs
it contains horrendously awful polystyrene as the support material .
those of you who own classic gibson guitars sound off here .
what 's the weakest , most broken part of a vintage gibson ?
not pleased at all .
it came in little tiny pieces .
we could n't even use it .
had to order something else .
it came hard as a rock .
as far as i could tell it was unusable .
i just got bit by this .
guess i should have known by the .55 cent price .
there must be a database mixup btw amazon and music123 .
same with the .011 `` 6-pack '' .
i gave them info and hopefully they 'll get the product description corrected .
i bought this drum key and it has n't worked since i bought it .
does n't fit my gretsch drums .
unfortunately , it just slips around the lug and wo n't grab to tighten .
not sure if it 's sn evans thing or a gretsch thing .
not a true pass-through .
so noisy when turned off its not usable in my chain .
i special orderd a boss bf-3 flanger from guitar center .
i kept it 2 weeks & took it back .
this pedal sucked : extremely metallic sounding & the flanging was not pronounced enough .
i then tried a hartman flanger .
great effect , just a huge volume bump when tuned on .
i dumped the hartman & went for the `` absolute kabala '' of flangers .
i went out & bought a real flanger : the ada flanger .
it arrived all crumbly .
we have not used it yet .
had to spend $ 20 and waste time to send it back .
anything is better than this .
.. yes , it 's cheap but it 's not very good at all .
not really the case .
but first off , the leather on the straps squeaks on the bolts .
lightweight but feels cheap .
i wo n't be putting any guitar valued over $ 150 in this thing .
the strings did not last more than 2 days each they became unraveled fast .
not recommended most of them did not last 30 minutes !
other than that the whole `` tension-tuning '' is super gimmicky and inconsistent .
it 's absolutely amazing !
so does everyone i play for !
strings are 2 '' too short .
telecaster moves around inside case also the case is way too thick .
skb make a much better fit guitar case .
was dried out and crumbled .
it is all cracked !
do not buy this product ! ! ! !
it has happened to me over and over again .
it is the way they are finished at the ends .
they start slipping and detuning and eventually pull out or break .
they also break easily if they do n't have the unravelling problem .
this will happen one or two times a six-pack .
it also happens on regular sets .
i wo n't buy ernie balls anymore .
i let music123 know and they said that i only bought 1 string .
my question to them is what does `` 6 pack '' mean .
i guess it 's just buyer beware .
do n't waste your time and money .
the case is flimsy and poorly made .
1. i can almost poke my finger through the `` hard '' outer shell .
i do not get that reassurance when i put it in this cheap case .
i should have spent the money on the actual gibson hard shell case .
would not fit the tuning lugs on my north toms .
however the keys are really awful .
sticks your bow to the violin and creates a screechy sound .
also creates powder , no matter how much was used .
i ended up returning this and purchasing the evah pirazzi rosin .
no powder and a much cleaner sound .
this light rosin is full of cracks .
still , i 'm sure they did n't get cracked because of this .
someone else that ordered rosin mentioned how it was packed the same way .
how long will these hold up before falling completely apart ?
also , keep in mind that i have n't used them yet , either .
i got them but they were just as badly cracked as the first ones .
they were packaged the exact same way as the first set .
i suppose i got what i paid for ?
i received these and loved them .
the feel is amazing and makes drumming so much easier .
this makes me very sad because they should last so much longer than this .
this thing does not work .
still works as a normal drum key though .
- currently a percussion major
although the graphics look the same it is not the same strap .
the stitching was very loose .
mine started to unravel after only a couple of days of use .
this is definitely not the strap i was expecting .
in short , these sticks gave me the worst blisters of my life .
ive never bled before by playing drums for literally 1 freaking song .
does n't sound like a spring reverb at all imho .
no huge surprise there , but it really sucks .
i did n't expect much , but it was still an awful let-down .
these had the potential to be my favorite pair of sticks .
they have great balance and the grip recess is a marvel of control .
back off a little and let them float and they just hang in perfectly .
they became completely unusable due to the broken tips .
i would be happy to try an improved model maybe with nylon tips ?
broke in the center after an hour of normal use on an electronic kit .
well , i started to notice that the ever click cam sooner and sooner .
i requested this as a gift for my esp ltd m-103fm .
the guitar is too long for the `` universal '' case .
this type easily shatters .
it works , but i just do n't like it .
leather is thin and cheap .
extension but i bought one anyway .
the strap is just too short .
oh , and by the way the strap is pretty .
if you 're absolutely broke , this is an ok strap .
it holds the guitar up .
but it is pretty seriously ugly unless you 're really going after that look .
it is made of the thinnest plastic shell i 've ever seen .
its basically a hollow case for a hollow body guitar .
gator 's product quality has totally slipped and this thing is proof .
just bought a drumdial and hope that it lives up to its reputation !
i did find one that fit .
i purchased this item from woodwind and brasswind on 11/12/12 .
i wo n't be purchasing from the seller again .
i bought clarinet reeds , but i got saxophone reeds .
they 're just meh .
if you just want inexpensive reeds , then go for it .
you get what you pay for .
junky , budget-line low grade with a nice logo .
i decided to return within 10 seconds of looking this over .
this case is shockingly inferior .
in the real world this wo n't last 6 months without falling apart .
made in china , naturally .
you do n't rosin your bow in a rut .
if you own a student model violin , go for it .
i personally think this is an embarrassment to rosins .
too sticky and it seems to gum up the strings .
it broke easily and quickly .
the cheap rosin that came with the bow lasted much longer .
does n't really work too well .
it will last forever if you do n't drop it .
due to the humidity in south florida this rosin was very sticky .
maybe if you 're elsewhere it 'll be better .
it can make a lousy bow perform
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars .
i was told it was just as good as the fender case .
both ended up in checked luggage .
the gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips .
the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on .
i bought this to put my dean custom 350 electric guitar in .
also the case is open inside .
i am now in the process / hassle of trying to send it back .
two strings tore instantly .
teacher said it should have never happend .
my son is a very talented viola player .
d'addario is the only brand he has every used and he is very disappointed .
he played for about one month and the d and a strings are un-winding .
the result ; he has to buy new ones .
i want my money back or a replacement .
i hear a big difference with this rosin from what i am used too .
too scratchy and gritty of a sound produced .
i would prefer a rosin that could give a smoother glide on the strings .
the rosin puts out way to much dust that gets caked on the strings .
would not buy this again .
salieron de 2 1/2 y no de 3 1/2
i have no idea if the rosin is any good because it was unuseable .
foam was splitting and separating out of the box .
do n't expect any special material , this is really just foam .
definitely not worth the price , i 'm going to try a different item .
this product is absolutely terrible !
when i opened the box almost all the reeds were cracked on the top .
unfortunately i received the wrong item .
i ordered for a clarinet and instead received for a saxophone .
waste of money in my room with hard wood flooring .
no audible difference noticed nor when using rew measuring software .
and this is the way both studs were right out of the package .
but since they go in the body it doesnt show much anyway .
playing with vandoren b45 mouthpiece .
i have moved position of reeds and everything .
i switched to the v21 reeds and they are exceptionally better .
second , they 're butt-ugly .
its not for me , i 'm staying with vox
my son just finished his 2nd year with the clarinet .
the price per usable reed is pretty bad with that ratio .
i 'm a guitar player .
this eb pedal does not work all that well for panning your signal .
i would not buy this again for my application .
i hope this one keeps working since it was not a cheap pedal .
i wish i could find a quality alternative pan pedal , the quest continues .
has none of the percussive qualities of the intro model dunlop crybaby .
hard to clean off .
decent sounding wah , but no on & off switch !
if you step on it and move it forward it automatically comes on .
if you bring your foot all the way back it turns off .
so here are the two main problems with this design .
2. ever like to leave the pedal somewhere in the middle ?
take your foot off and play for a while ?
not on this one .
i 'm selling this thing .
it does n't do the things that wah pedals have always done !
good pedal , but extremely big and heavy .
this pedal is big big big .
poor quality , i bought a morley and it was much better .
the volume is controlled by a string on this .
not a whole lot of expression , honestly .
consider another pedal for volume .
otherwise they 're fine .
it barely picks up the acoustic tone coming out of my guitar .
maybe i got a defective unit ?
none of my other guitars generate this much noise .
bought these for an entertainment center woofer being that i have wood floors .
opened the box , closed , the box , and sent them back .
after using them , you can hardly notice the difference about the the vibration .
overall , you do n't need spending so much on this everywhere-can-find foam .
try a/bing them with a pair of black yoga blocks also available on amazon .
they are made from very similar material .
do n't say i never did you a favor .
a pair of yoga blocks will also give you three different height options .
fishman makes good products .
the pickups are clear and good entry-level equipment .
( direct quote from the pickup packaging . )
the hum makes this nearly worthless to me .
i guess the next step is to buy a `` humbucker '' pickup .
in retrospect , it 's obvious why they 're named that .
auralex is too greedy here .
i sent mine back .
got lots howling on d string .
which i did n't have that until change to this brand new string .
i am very frustrated .
get a lot of howling on the d and a strings
string broke the first time i tuned it
returning product and want a full refund .
i 'm a street musician .
i used this pickup to amplify my steel string acoustic .
what 's the deal with this pickup ?
what 's to recommend ?
a. it works at least for 6 months .
it will amplify your guitar .
b. it 's easy to install and uninstall .
c. you can send the cable directly to your amp without preamplification .
what else is the deal with this pickup ?
what 's not so great ?
a. build quality is so-so .
the pickup stopped working after about 6 months .
wear and tear may occur quickly with this pickup .
b. cable placement is awkward .
c. cable feels flimsy .
d. lots of hum .
e. seymour duncan offers a slightly cheaper pickup of the same style .
so far it sounds better than the fishman .
should you purchase it ?
go for seymour duncan instead .
within 1 week , 2 strings have broken already .
will not purchase again .
i purchased this `` gibson '' brand bridge for my les paul studio faded .
which had a defective bridge on it .
so a low action without buzz is impossible .
and this bridge is really no better .
i am guessing gibson stopped notching them to cut costs .
very very disappointed , at this point .
waiting to hear from amazon
i rate this low for two specific reasons .
guitar straps are a bit like clothing in that fit is really important .
# 3 not a true 3 in stiffness .
it is not designed very well .
i ordered for my les paul abd it doesnt fit .
the spread is too wide and post are different size also .
so much for gibson parts .
now im stuck with it
its too quiet even with a preamp .
not a good invesment .
search for a better pickup or spend a little bit more .
not happy with the product .
easy to install its just that its too quite .
pa used , fender 700 .
these reeds are highly variable in their quality/usability .
i will need to keep looking for a more quality-consistent reed manufacturer .
i used this product for my live performances with a martin d-15 acoustic guitar .
i did not have any problems with the quality of the sound .
but it stopped working one fine day .
i did n't think this would be a problem , but it is .
apparently the pickup is designed to have the low e only one way .
so i have to return it .
so other buyers who have similar issues need to look elsewhere .
but - i did try it on a normal guitar and it worked great .
so if you have one of these , it 's 4 star .
broke after playing for 5 minutes .
was n't even playing hard .
not worth the money .
we ordered these sticks for my son to use during band camp .
his instructor told them they needed the white ones .
the picture on the website showed white sticks .
the ones we received were wood grain , not white .
we did n't have time to send them back before band camp .
i wo n't ever buy this brand again .
they fall apart so easily .
did me no good .
i will stick to rico reeds .
unfortunately i never got to play because the a string snapped while tunning !
sad to say i was wrong .
i am not a professional cellist , i 'm only learning as a hobby .
so i ca n't say the string has been `` overplayed '' .
i should have probably just gotten the cheaper nickel-wound , it might last longer .
this mic made me look bad several times while djing .
lots of noise and no on and off switch .
do n't use this in aloud environment .
the feedback is horrible .
they look so small i feel like they not be of quality i desired .
may i know please , why they are so small ?
i thought they were regular size micros .
it is to tight to stay in tune .
i will need a medium gage a string .
the string broke within 5 minutes .
that was the life span of the product .
never got to use the string because it snapped when putting it in !
i am afraid its a case of get what you pay for
not all that for it to be a shure brand !
quality and sound were awful for the price
my daughter could not use these reeds .
she could not play clarinet properly .
they also broke easily .
we went through 10 in one week .
i ordered this product expecting wonderful things to happen .
i think it 's overpriced for what little it does .
neither one of us were very impressed with it .
pin of hinge easly came out , and can not hold the reed tight .
and no good for open/close .
one thing more the price is high compare with product it self .
i do n't like it and it look like toy
vandoren must be having a ton of trouble with their cane supply .
even their traditional reeds are sounding like saw dust .
i bought these twice and had them replaced twice .
the evans dot drum head is much better .
i bought this head after reading that it is especially for hard rock players .
that may be , but for my taste it sounds like crap .
i am using a pearl steel snare drum .
do not buy this head if you want any degree of crispiness !
this mic does no even compare to my peavey mic .
it was cheap enough so i did not even bother sending it back .
shure is normally a good mic , maybe it is just a cheaper model .
but , it works .
wish i 'd have gotten something a little nicer though .
they break easily and upon that , they are not consistent in the least .
i wish all the luck with finding the reeds for you !
is not a drum , just a plastic snare head , misleading
daughter did n't like the quality and sound of these reeds .
we will be going back to another brand .
for me this box had an extremely high noise floor .
so i sent it back .
if you are international buyer you will buy this item at your own risk .
i do like a lot of the boss pedals but not this one .
rad sounding pedal but poor internal quality .
it went bad after one year on my pedal board .
it was protected with `` pedal power '' but just stopped working .
i sincerely expected a $ 170 pedal to last longer than one year .
i swear by these picks .
few shops ( including guitar center ) carry these gauges in this shape .
the only gauge i play is the 1.00mm .
i 'll keep playing claytons , but i ca n't play with these .
bought it for my son .
bad quality compared to store bought .
the reeds ' quality is not that great .
so far 2-3 reeds were damage when we opened the package .
honestly i should have just stuck with moongel 's .
on the plus side they can be adjusted some what .
i use them on the resonant heads .
i recommend getting some damper pads instead .
other than that , i would not waste my money on the product !
they look cool , but break very easily .
i go through 1-2 every gig or practice .
id suggest something sturdier if you play with any power at all
that black part starts peeling off after about 15 minutes .
works well for the first couple of days then it begins to fall off .
it 's the first time i have been disappointed by an evans product .
nice to look at not to use !
leaves black marks on the drums that is very hard to het off !
if u like the black stick look go with clear or uncolored tips !
you live u learn !
sorry , but the moongel gave me best results .
these were straight up bad .
not what i expected .
stick with the control rings , moon gel or good ole ' duck tape .
bought this product for my son 's 11th birthday .
arrived with mottled patina ; the hour hand was swinging loosely .
can not be polished without removing zildjian stencil .
zildjian should pull this from the shelves before it taints their name .
deserves zero star rating , but amazon wo n't let me do that .
just an average drumstick , but the black paint stains the hands .
ok ... ..but heavy .
they do n't work well at all .
bought two pairs and both broke within a couple of weeks
we 've never experienced this with locally purchased reeds .
i have been buying these reeds for my daughter for the last 3 years .
vandoren should look into this .
i am left buying a new set within a month .
will vandoren bother with sending replacements to customers who got junk ?
logo and paint come off right away .
fingers are black from paint after 1st hour of use
it showed up and it was a plain black strap , no bolt .
very annoying because i paid more for the design .
i bought this thing and it was a complete let down .
shoddy quality and crappy looking lightning bolt .
sent it straight back .
looks great , but does not work .
put a battery in and nothing happened !
so , i recieved these yesterday , ordered 2 pairs .
wood is too soft .
should 've looked before buying .
broke after 3 practices .
i loved the grips , but the wood was just too weak .
this strap is what you pay for .
it is cheaply made and will not last the rigors of stage .
strap is not for pro use .
would not recommend for stage use unless you want a busted guitar neck .
i purchased two pair and each pair broke on the first use .
loved the style and the gibson logo but the parts on it are plastic .
had to send it back for that reason .
this bolt is not woven - its just a kind of cheap paint .
only 2 out of this box were functional .
the others were split or warped .
this is the last box of these i will be purchasing .
i loved my first pair ( purchased elsewhere ) .
these sticks felt awkward and cheap .
made in china , over all lacking craftsmanship .
never got to play it
this amp sounds absolutely terrible with a bass .
even at low volumes the farty buzz is overwhelming and extremely unpleasant .
amazon took care of return in a matter of minutes..hats off to them..tks again
today i received an email showing that the new estimated delivery is july 11th !
and my invoice magically changed to $ 322 !
so much for `` no additional cost '' .
i wanted to replace a broken knob on a les paul gibson guitar .
the knobs on my guitar and in the photo have a rounded center post .
the knobs i got have a flat center post .
they work but do n't match the other three on the guitar .
oh well , i tried .
why call these nylon ? ?
i thought they were `` plastic '' as in , nylon .
these are not the same thing .
deceptive description for sure ...
these are nylon tipped sticks , not nylon sticks - please change your description .
the packaging left a sticky residue on one of the sticks .
nevertheless , the prime shipping helped me out in a bind .
they 're just drumsticks , and you can surely play with them .
i question the quality of the brush .
seems like an abnormal number of hairs shed each time i use it .
now that there are multiple alternative offerings , we 'll be changing to those .
very cheaply made , fimsy .
wrong color , i put them in the parts drawer .
broke after 2 practice sessions of use .
it freakin broke a week in .
i loved the sound but not strong at all
i ended up buying the comparable mxr dist/d.i .
sharp edges , feel cheap , horrible fit .
even with gibson name on it .
so gibson part on gibson guitar , no go .
edit : i take back what i said .
half the reeds do n't work .
they chip easily and i had to constantly buy more .
did n't expect it to get here so quickly .
these sticks split then broke within a few days of playing with them .
first bad experience with zildjian sticks .
these sticks broke fairly easy and leaves black marks all over your cymbals .
probably wo n't be buying these again ever
says the numbers are white and embossed .
packaging is different as well as the knobs themselves .
this looks like a pro mic , but it 's not .
i guess the price should have given me a clue , huh ?
the problem never corrected itself and we deemed the box defective .
he is in process of returning the item to the music store .
it had its use to mic a guitar , but still , fairly crispy .
glad it was just a run through !
i have never had such serious vibration in a stick before .
i wo n't use them again .
i bought this book for a college level music theory class .
not worth the money .
it looks like paint chipped away but it is supposed to be brand new .
these are fine i suppose .
i liked the page-like gold-foil topped ones better .
the gold on these appear too `` golden '' for the guitar tho .
plastic is not very sturdy .
two knobs chipped upon installation .
would be better if they had metal inserts to reinforce .
the spider cage was not threaded to mount on a stand .
did not work with my sons computer .
i expected a lot more of zildjian .
i feel like i threw away money and my son was very disappointed .
i 'll never consider using them .
i have been playing with promark drumsticks for about 15yrs .
i opened the box and noticed the sticks looked funny .
i ordered four pairs of sticks and one stick is cracked half way through .
i do n't believe these are true promark sticks but actually fakes .
they play fast but i never felt comfortable with them .
thirdly the hickory seemed 'softer ' than vic firth 's .
