0	but macaulay himself , kukshina started to say
0	copyright by the hudson review
0	i ’ m not shouting ; i ’ m speaking very calmly ; it ’ s you who is shouting ; i ’ m a student , and i won ’ t allow you to shout at me
0	bazarov said , interrupting him
0	i ’ ve come from katerina ivanovna ; she had no one else to send
0	like the individualist sexual rebels of early nineteenth-century europe , many women nihilists avoided organized movements , whether feminist or radical
0	oh , how low i ’ ve fallen !
0	is he resorting to his previous practice , or what ?
0	still , he felt timid through and through ; instead of using all the apologies and greetings he would prepared in advance , he mumbled some nonsense to the effect that evdoksiya , that is , kukshina , had sent him to inquire about anna sergeevna 's health and that arkady nikolaevich had always sung the highest praises of at this point he hesitated and became so confused he sat on his hat
0	had he been more perspicacious , he would have seen that there was no question of a sentimental mood ; rather , something completely opposite was in play
0	here we are at home , said nikolai petrovich , removing his cap and shaking his head
0	what a splendid horse i have for you !
0	but here ’ s the fourth floor , here ’ s the door , and here ’ s the apartment directly opposite ; that one ’ s also empty
0	and he that was dead came forth— ’
0	that lesson was useful to me ; i hope that it will be useful to you as well
0	you are in a melancholy mood today , evgeny
0	look : he ’ s jumped up and is bowing
0	water cascaded onto the ground not in drops , but in entire streams
0	above bazarov stands that fear , that love , those tears he inspires
0	madam , madam , calm yourself , began the civil servant
0	though they thirsted after learning , nihilist women often preferred to seek it abroad than to join the slow struggle for higher education in russia itself
0	let ’ s have a song , lads !
0	i heard everything , how he tormented you
0	and he tumbled down the stairs
0	the possible association between turgenev 's creation of bazarov , his project for primary education and the arevolutionary ' planning of ogaryov makes it likely that the claim in the letter to sluchevsky that if bazarov 'is called a nihilist , then one ought to read : revolutionary ' , is not accidental , nor simply an instance of turgenev pandering to youth
0	do you know , sir , do you know , that i even pawned her stockings ?
0	he saw everything , no doubt
0	but what does this letter mean now ?
0	seven o ’ clock tomorrow ; they ’ ll be here , too , and you ’ ll decide on your own
0	he wondered to himself
0	in my opinion , it is just the opposite
0	these are special cases , i agree with you ; the example i presented is really a special case , sir !
0	sonya accepted it , blushed , jumped up , muttered something , and hastily began to take her leave
0	he was a lieutenant , the police superintendent ’ s assistant , and had a reddish mustache protruding horizontally in both directions and extremely fine facial features , expressing nothing whatsoever , however , except a certain insolence
0	there , on the corner , stood a large crowd of people , all peasants
0	‡ aleksandr radishchev ( – ) was a leading liberal writer who opposed serfdom and the russian judicial system
0	just think about the predicament we ’ re in now !
0	one fellow was thrown out of a pastry shop a few days ago
0	i asked whether you believe that ghosts exist
0	she worked for her sister day and night and served at home in place of a cook and a laundress ; she also sewed to order , washed other people ’ s floors , and turned all the money over to her sister
0	petr petrovich took out his watch and looked at it
0	hey , damn it , you devil !
0	better , evgeny , better ; but who knows , it 's all in god 's hands , while doing your duty
0	but why are they such fools ?
0	besides , you ’ re the brother of a person who ’ s interested me a great deal ; lastly , at the time i heard a considerable amount about you from that person , from which i concluded that you have great influence on her
0	i am here , bazarov 's voice rang out from arkady 's room
0	by the way , i just remembered
0	i do not even know what your quarrels were about , but i saw how you twisted him around your little finger
0	they grieve over people , they weep , but they do not reproach them , they don ’ t !
0	why are you laughing again ?
0	but why precisely now did he happen to overhear just such a conversation and such ideas when in his own mind
0	a law , a law , let 's make a law ,
0	it really is possible
0	you reject everything , or , to put it more precisely , you destroy everything but one must also build
0	sonya had been waiting for him all day in horrible agitation
0	bazarov observed , moving away from the window
0	it ’ s very , very original , but
0	my acquaintance tolstyakov , whenever he enters some public place where others are standing around wearing their hats and caps , feels compelled to doff his hat
0	the princess appeared looking very sleepy , which lent her wrinkled , old face an even more spiteful expression
0	i ’ m lying and i ’ m not worthy of you
0	nikolai petrovich took a step back and flung his arms open wide
0	for a moment there was no reply , but it was clear that several people were standing behind the door and seemed to be pushing someone
0	so elegant and so stupid !
0	and he came in and went right to the cabinet where i keep my pipes
0	may you live a long , long time ; you ’ ll be needed by others
0	your father certainly has good taste
0	besides , i am sure you could not have made a bad choice ; if you have invited her to live here with you under one roof , she must deserve it
0	in doing so , he may have spoiled the portrait for some readers ; he most certainly appears to have violated the novel 's internal chronology ; but , chiefly , he underlined that the idealism of his own generation of westernists involved an ultimate commitment to revolutionary change and that to deny the revolutionary ideal was a betrayal
0	they ’ re on your hands , you know
0	mostly they were street urchins , boys and girls
0	but he himself has admitted that he lied at first ?
0	but while i remained on guard below , he got dressed and slipped out
0	she suddenly wailed in a harrowing cry , overflowing with tears , protect these orphans !
0	after finishing his sewing , he thrust his fingers into a small opening between his turkish sofa and the floor , groped around inside the left corner , and pulled out the pledge he ’ d prepared long ago and hidden there
0	you ’ ve gotten me drunk even without drinking
0	they indulgently regard even the excessive use of such substances , although they acknowledge that such excesses are harmful to the health
0	what do you think ?
0	only on his deathbed does bazarov concede having been psychologically and morally misguided ; his rigid subscription to his ideas and his fixation on their future realization have deprived him of the satisfactions he might have found in the present
0	his face was distorted by a smile
0	he ’ s come to , echoed the stranger
0	just as i thought !
0	just look at your hand !
0	but she needs them herself now , doesn ’ t she ?
0	why was he trying to divert razumikhin ’ s eyes to mikolka ?
0	you should have seen his lancets , said bazarov and left the room
0	no , so help me god , i ’ m not !
0	do you like him , dunya ?
0	i hope you are not just coming from the governor 's ?
0	while i think : here i lie under a haystack the tiny space i occupy is so small compared to the rest of space , where i am not and where things have nothing to do with me ; and the amount of time in which i get to live my life is so insignificant compared to eternity , where i have never been and wo not ever be yet in this atom , this mathematical point blood circulates , a brain functions and desires something as well
0	to m e saltykov
0	the social-political interpretation of fathers and sons has been widespread
0	it was him , him !
0	he gathered everything up in his hands and stood in the middle of the room
0	do you love your sister sonya ?
0	the tradesman must be hiding in some corner
0	in the end odintsova remarries , but she does so without abandoning her icy composure
0	and i felt such a hatred for your every last muzhik
0	not in the least , replied arkady
0	the candle stub had long since burned down in the twisted candleholder , dimly illuminating in this impoverished room the murderer and the prostitute , strangely united for the reading of the eternal book
0	it 's hard to say
0	bazarov shook his head
0	if they ask , perhaps i ’ ll even tell them , he thought as he approached the police station
0	then i found out , sonya , that if i waited for everyone to become smart , it would take much too long
0	the nigilistka 's rejection of all this fit in with her desire to be functional and useful , and with her repugnance for the day-to-day existence of the superfluous woman
0	the lender is free to sell your property and to pursue all legal steps against you
0	i ’ m saying this so you know
0	asked avdotya romanovna , growing frightened
0	what i did hear was really rather strange
0	and besides , your sister can ’ t stand me
0	she repeated , withdrawing slightly from him
0	and in ottsy i deti the portraits of the kirsanovs , their babies , their joyous participation in the natural cycle , all lead us to infer that all is right with the world
0	my wife and i—we both respect literature , and my wife is passionate about it !
0	my twenty-five years ' service of the muses ended in the gradual disenchantment of the reading public and i do not foresee any reason why it should reverse its view
0	sainthood and revolutionary dedication first emerged as prominent ideals in turgenev 's work with this novel
0	he was very clever , although sometimes really naïve
0	everywhere and in everything i go to the limit
0	on the contrary , there won ’ t be any horns in a common-law marriage !
0	svidrigaylov said with a smile , standing and picking up his hat
0	truly great individuals , it seems to me , must experience great sorrow in this world , he added , suddenly becoming contemplative , and no longer in a conversational mode
0	i don ’ t need your sentence reduction at all !
0	alarm , cries of fear , moans
0	sonya sat down , looked around—at lebezyatnikov , at the money lying on the table , at petr petrovich again , and then didn ’ t take her eyes off him , as if her gaze were riveted to him
0	katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears ; she also prayed , at times adjusting the child ’ s small shirt , and managing to cover the little girl ’ s bare shoulders with a scarf that she took from the wardrobe without having to get up from her knees or interrupt her prayers
0	he has spoken of moldering or decaying , but now he writes of the place where i shall rest
0	who approaches everything from a critical point of view , observed arkady
0	now that arbor 's done well , he added , because it 's all acacia and lilac—they are good boys and do not need much care
0	although cultural anthropologists might not agree , the concept of ethnicity need not be confined to national , regional , or linguistic groups but ought to be applied to any category of human beings that constitutes a more or less clearly defined cultural community visibly distinguishable from the surrounding society
0	so you ’ re here only counting on engaging in debauchery ?
0	why are you saying this ?
0	you call a friendly conversation 'prattle ' ?
0	she even has a very nice smile
0	you ’ ve distorted my idea !
0	a woman ’ s voice asked in alarm
0	you think we ’ ll become closer ?
0	the rain had stopped , but the wind was still blowing
0	in many instances he was even too indulgent of her character , all seven years
0	in the society of his day , as turgenev fills it in with a few quick strokes , bazarov is as superfluous as rudin
0	they accepted my offer with enthusiasm and considered it an honor ; since then we ’ ve been acquainted
0	why not mention it ?
0	you must respond and acknowledge your obligation , while the fact that you happened to be in love and all those tragic particulars , all that is none of our business
0	you know , living in the country with marfa petrovna , i was tormented to death by memories of all these mysterious nooks and crannies where one can find so many things
0	therefore it was essential to him that you be here !
0	it was impossible to make out any other words ; the footsteps died away and everything became quiet
0	yes , sir , we had a case that was almost the same in our legal practice , sir , a psychological case , a morbid one , sir , porfiry rattled on , speaking very quickly
0	he cried , banging his fist on the table again
0	where , if i may ask ?
0	what methods do i need now ?
0	what an insensitive , spiteful egoist !
0	cried dunya , jumping up from her seat
0	in a review of my monograph on turgenev 's ottsy i deti , edward j brown remarked rather cryptically that on the pages of his greatest novel turgenev had
0	both imagination and vision carry us beyond the permitted ; odintseva 's thoughts are a hidden defiance of the decorous house in which she lives , an erotic transgression she has no will to sustain
0	you see , lately , since you fell ill , i ’ ve frequently had the occasion to talk about you a great deal
0	it ’ s all because i ’ m very ill , he decided gloomily once and for all
0	she had a reputation as a frivolous coquette and devoted herself eagerly to all sorts of pleasures , dancing until she collapsed , laughing and joking with young people whom she received before dinner in a dimly lit drawing room ; but at night she wept and prayed , finding no solace anywhere , often pacing her room until early morning , wringing her hands in anguish or sitting , cold and pale , over her psalter
0	her plump arms were instantly entwined around his neck , her head pressed to his chest , and there was complete silence
0	he approached the door on tiptoe , opened it very quietly , and listened for any noise on the staircase below
0	at first anna sergeevna was afraid that the sight of their happiness might be too difficult for her to bear ; but it turned out to be the complete opposite : it not only failed to oppress her , but even interested her , mellowed her at long last
0	on their return they usually got into an argument ; arkady was usually demolished , even though he spoke far more than his comrade
0	i say this for the benefit of those readers who attribute great significance to refined manners , who look with aversion on bazarov , as on a man who is mal élevé and mauvais ton
0	where can one discern the impulse which makes his greatest work acquire a degree of transcendence beyond impartiality , conscientious objectivity and the rigorous topicality which is inseparable from realism ?
0	let ’ s have a talk ; it ’ s a pity that i have so many affairs to attend to , other people ’ s and my own
0	this special form of address had an impact on bazarov he turned his head a little ; obviously trying to free himself from the burden of oppressive oblivion , he uttered , what is it , father ?
0	arkady 's voice was shaky at first : he perceived himself as magnanimous , but at the same time realized he was delivering something of a lecture to his father
0	cried the other caretaker , an enormous peasant dressed in a heavy tunic and carrying keys on his belt
0	and perhaps even forgives
0	surely you wouldn ’ t dare to decide that ?
0	you should know that he has friends
0	he cried with such bitter irritation , with such a despairing look , that razumikhin gave up
0	turgenev 's first two women are depicted only posthumously : they were beloved by the two kirsanov brothers , nikolai and pavel
0	just in case , he thought again and rang the old woman ’ s bell
0	they ’ re very nice people , and the children often come to see me
0	i will tell him the history of your illness since sidor sidorych has gone [ that was the name of the local doctor ] , and we will have a short consultation
0	the more harmless sources of pleasure there are , the easier it is to live in the world , and the whole task of our generation is precisely to decrease the sum of suffering and increase the strength and amount of pleasure
0	there they are , they ’ re bringing them ; the older one caught them
0	it ’ s written in legalese , and it can ’ t be written in any other way ; it came out more crudely than he might have wanted
0	raskolnikov thrust his summons at the head clerk
0	we know that dostoevsky admired fathers and sons , at least that he wrote to turgenev about it in terms of appreciation which turgenev said made me throw up my hands in amazement—and pleasure
0	what do you mean , sir ?
0	of course , you ’ re right that none of it ’ s new and it all resembles everything we ’ ve read and heard a thousand times before
0	one could say yes , he did , almost for certain
0	these days it ’ s hard to tell who ’ s gentry and who ’ s not
0	it ’ s a terribly filthy place : dirt , stench , full of suspicious types
0	someone shouted at him when he came out to the canal
0	all she needs is a train out behind her and a crown on top of her head
0	yes , yes , i know you , bazarov , she repeated
0	do you think i ’ ll give my dunya away to a man such as you ?
0	my father 's pure gold
0	victor , open the bottle ; that 's in your line of work
0	really , you look much better
0	nihilism is supposed to relieve all our ills , and you , you are our saviors and heroes
0	coughs choked her , but her threat seemed to work
0	how will you protect them from those svidrigaylovs or from afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , you future millionaire , you , you zeus , disposing of their fates ?
0	he finished it along the way
0	you think he ’ s clever ?
0	perhaps he had hastened to reach that conclusion , but he didn ’ t think about that
0	at the basis of the main character , bazarov , there lay the figure of a young provincial doctor that had struck me
0	have you come to see us ?
0	of course , i blamed it all on my fate , pretended to hunger and thirst for light , and finally set in motion the greatest and most certain means of conquering a woman ’ s heart , a means that never deceives anyone and that acts decisively on every woman , without exception
0	yes , yes , yes i have been asking myself where i would heard the name bazarov before
0	raskolnikov felt and realized at that moment , once and for all , that sonya was with him now and forever ; she would go with him to the ends of the earth , wherever fate might send him
0	cinq sous , cinq sous ,
0	why isn ’ t this the place ?
0	turgenev—after pushkin—is almost the sole genius of measure and , therefore , a genius of culture
0	and when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth
0	no , i haven ’ t , replied raskolnikov
0	but how will you live ?
0	a remarkable play of tones characterize these passages
0	it wasn ’ t like that then , he thought
0	please don ’ t trouble yourself !
0	he was fine just a little while ago
0	what was it , for example , that led them astray from the very start ?
0	everything about her was still green and fresh : her voice , the light down on her face , her pink hands with white circles on her palms , and mikhail mikhailovich speransky ( - ) , a leading statesman and liberal reformer under alexander i he was the son of a village priest and one of the first to rise to a position of great power from such humble origins
0	the pestilence grew and advanced further and further
0	but never , never did these people consider themselves so intelligent and so infallible about the truth as when they were infected
0	he ’ s a civil servant , a retired titular counselor , marmeladov !
0	that she had every confidence in me and so on
0	the walls looked as if they had been roughly assembled from boards and were covered with worn-out wallpaper , so dusty and torn that although one could still guess its color ( yellow ) , it was no longer possible to make out the pattern
0	the gentleman asked sternly , frowning in haughty astonishment
0	i love nikolai petrovich with all my heart
0	you could make anything you like of her ; while the other one 's an old warhorse
0	how disgustingly i fawned and flattered that despicable ilya petrovich !
0	however , that lasted for only a moment
0	realism as a method of the artistic depiction of reality in the history of russian nineteenth-century literature not only develops but stratifies
0	well , should i come in or go away ?
0	if someone didn ’ t know about it beforehand—he wouldn ’ t notice a thing
0	but am i really so removed from everyone ?
0	a little more , and he might have given himself away completely , in actual fact
0	of course , you are joking
0	cried a witness ’ s voice from the crowd
0	should we take him to the police station ?
0	have you been to the police station ?
0	concerning the actual conditions of our duel , since there wo not be any seconds—
0	i ’ ll have zosimov spend the night at the landlady ’ s , so he ’ ll be right here if needed
0	if only he ’ s at home , he added
0	he even spoke a few words of decent french with a foreigner who was waiting there
0	without even stopping to consider what all this might mean , in a burst of nonsensical joy , he ran out onto the steps a footman in livery opened the carriage door ; a lady wearing a black veil and black mantilla was emerging
0	i wanted to tell you , find out your opinion , and ask for your hand , because i am not a wealthy man and feel i am ready to make any sacrifice you are not answering ?
0	how can you even ask about that ?
0	he is willing to receive extreme unction , though at the sight of the priest in his robes , of the smoking censer and the candles before the icon something like a shudder of horror passed for a moment over the death-stricken face
0	but this kind creature does not reject me , he thought , and his heart once again experienced the sweetness of magnanimous emotion
0	raskolnikov sat down ; his trembling was ending , and his entire body felt hot
0	they are completely convinced that all an author does is to convey his ideas ; they do not wish to believe that to reproduce the truth , the reality of life accurately and powerfully , is the literary man 's highest joy , even if that truth does not correspond to his own sympathies
0	there is , she says , a mother , a very reasonable lady , this mama
0	i have no memory , none at all , or i ’ d remember !
0	how could he have left all those things in that hole under the wallpaper ?
0	how can i afford to bury him ?
0	thought—whatever it may be , it is thinking nevertheless and not the digestive process
0	for that matter it 's easy to alleviate the situation if , while maintaining all his contempt for sitnikov , he at some time mentions to arkady that one must preserve the sitnikovs on the basis of the rules promulgated by prince vorontsov , who replied to complaints about the abominations of a certain police inspector , i know that he is a scoundrel but he has one important merit—he is genuinely devoted to me
0	he finds one and says it , 'crisis , and now he feels relieved
0	i was merely curious
0	she would come back , sit down again , pick up her fan , and would not even be breathing more rapidly ; meanwhile arkady would resume his chatter , suffused with happiness by being so near her , talking to her , looking into her eyes , at her beautiful forehead , at her pleasant , imposing , intelligent face
0	he thought about the main point and put off the details until such time as he himself would be sure of everything
0	i ’ m in a hurry and have to leave
0	you , sister , seem to have been offended by the fact that out of the whole letter i ventured such a frivolous remark , and you think that i mention such trivialities intentionally to make difficulties for you because i ’ m annoyed
0	why does he die ?
0	it won ’ t take place ?
0	my impressions at that time though of various sorts were all similarly oppressive
0	odintseva , as we later discover , will not frequent her garden portico after seeing a grass snake there ( viii , [ p ] ) ; it is in this portico that arkady proposes to katya
0	at the end of the novel , when the most important surviving characters are gathered together for one last time , katya is in complete control
0	the novel has neither plot nor denouement , nor a particularly well-considered structure ; it has types and characters , it has episodes and scenes , and bazarov 's teacher is chernyshevsky or dobrolyubov , and the circle is that of the journal the contemporary
0	she sighed very deeply and died
0	in general she said very little and , as already indicated , she was very humble and timid
0	perhaps ; you know best
0	my sister received an education by chance and is condemned to seek positions as a governess
0	he ’ d probably just been beaten
0	in the country , fifteen days pass imperceptibly ; bazarov talks with anna sergeyevna a lot , argues with her , expresses himself fully , and finally begins to feel for her a kind of malicious , tormenting passion
0	how can we get her home ?
0	his speech is distinguished by its simplicity , appropriateness , mockery , and completely russian cast
0	i ’ m curious as to whether mr luzhin has received any official decorations ; i ’ ll bet he has the order of saint anna§ and that he wears it at dinners with contractors and merchants
0	all the merchants at their tables , stands , shops , and stalls were locking up their establishments , removing and packing up their wares , and dispersing to their homes , just as their customers were
0	my reason must not have deserted me entirely ; i must still have my ability to reason and my memory , if i remembered and figured that out myself !
0	you continue to jest , pavel petrovich said , getting up from his chair
0	well , sir , my good sir—marmeladov suddenly seemed to shudder , raise his head , and stare at his listener—well , sir , the next day , after all these daydreams , that is , exactly five days ago , toward evening , by clever stealth , like a thief in the night , i stole the key from katerina ivanovna ’ s box , took out what was left of the money i ’ d brought home , i don ’ t recall how much it was , and now , look at me , all of you !
0	to tell you all this , i would have said , if i did not believe a useless lie was stupid
0	she ’ s an absolutely , utterly unexpected character !
0	of course , they chased her away ; but she herself says she abused him and threw something at him
0	odintsova repeated , lowering her voice
0	he was still a student then
0	why did you run away ?
0	praising turgenev for his absolute sanity and the deepest sensibility , for an unerring instinct for the significant , for the essential in the life of men and women , joseph conrad nonetheless wrote to edward garnett that with the year the age of turgenev had come to an end , too
0	maybe he ’ s not home , said a male voice
0	a peasant runs away , or a modern sectarian—a lackey of someone else ’ s ideas—because if you just show him the end of your finger , like gogol ’ s midshipman dyrka , ¶ he ’ ll believe in anything you like for the rest of his life
0	you ’ re insane , really , insane !
0	once again the rubbish , the same eggshells on the spiral staircase ; once more the apartment doors left wide open , the same kitchens from which smoke and stench emanated
0	in a word , i ’ m marrying petr petrovich , dunechka continued , because i ’ m choosing the lesser of two evils
0	dmitry prokofich came to see me just yesterday—i agree , i agree , i have a nasty , caustic character , but the conclusions he drew from it !
0	as one of kropotkin 's acquaintances observed , they would not stand up when a woman entered the room , but they would often travel halfway across the city to help a girl in her studies
0	at best , the author was drawn as a
0	and i found a job here
0	oh , that ’ s not it , not it , sonya exclaimed in anguish
0	it is also extremely likely that katerina ivanovna wanted , precisely in this case , precisely at this moment in time , when it seemed as if she ’ d been abandoned by everyone in the whole world , to show all these worthless and nasty lodgers that she not only knew how to live and how to entertain guests , but had been brought up not for such a fate in life but in the noble , one could even say , aristocratic home of a colonel , and that she had never been raised to sweep the floor or to wash the children ’ s rags at night
0	why are they tormenting me ?
0	she was already a widow when i married her , with three children , each smaller than the other
0	bazarov put his hand on his forehead
0	as for the last point , however , marfa petrovna was fairly calm all along ; she was a clever woman and , therefore , couldn ’ t regard me in any other way than as a depraved and dissolute man , incapable of genuine love
0	the fact that you ’ re daring , arrogant , serious and
0	is this really , really all true ?
0	this timofeich , an experienced and clever old man with faded yellow hair , a weather-beaten reddish face , and tiny teardrops in his squinting eyes , had appeared before bazarov unexpectedly , wearing his shortish coat of thick blue-gray cloth , tied with a leather belt , and tarred boots
0	i have not lacked confidence in a single one of my things as strongly as in that very one
0	doctors are mercenary , you know
0	now you really have to be prim and proper , so that everyone will see that you ’ re respectable children
0	everything was just as it had been before : chairs , mirror , yellow sofa , and framed pictures
0	i can only take off my hat and bow low as in the gypsy song
0	it ’ s better not to sleep at all , he decided
0	and he ’ ll keep on , keep circling around me , constantly narrowing the radius of his circle—and then—plop !
0	so you have noticed my reserve how else did you put it my reticence ?
0	razumikhin had been sitting there in his dressing gown , which was worn to tatters , with slippers on his bare feet ; he was disheveled , unshaven , and unwashed
0	now , since we ’ ve begun talking openly ( and it ’ s excellent that we ’ ve begun
0	he is least of all interested in other characters , but the others are all the more interested in him
0	of course , mama , avdotya romanovna remarked earnestly
0	it was as if i myself was completely dumbfounded then
0	but as far as the basic , most important point was concerned , he had no doubts even for one moment , even while he was reading the letter
0	what ’ s all this about ?
0	she had come with a commission , one that , apparently , she liked very much
0	the two problems of youth and anger , or maturity and acceptance , come to a head in bazarov 's involvement with odintsov , the central episode in the novel , which also serves as a kind of structural dividing line between the political ( or social ) and the psychological
0	never did they consider their pronouncements , their scientific conclusions , their moral convictions and beliefs so infallible
0	by the way , for two days i was telling her at length about the prussian house of lords ( because , what else is there to talk about with her ?
0	and where , i say , did you get those earrings ?
0	in order to say i dissect frogs , or i make soap [ as in ustryalov 's parody of fathers and sons ] , certain generalizations , albeit negative ones , are necessary —to wit , to elevate disbelief in any other knowledge than particular knowledge into a principle
0	all this current anguish had taken root in him ages ago ; it had grown , accumulated , and of late matured and intensified , having assumed the form of a terrible , wild , fantastic question that tormented his heart and mind , irresistibly demanding a solution
0	i see ; but you must admit , you too possess a bit of that vanity we were just talking about
0	allow me to ask you to explain yourself immediately and inform me as to why you ’ ve bestowed the honor of a visit on me
0	it ’ s strange that you ’ re late even for your father ’ s funeral
0	what does it say there : so the right hand , isn ’ t it , doesn ’ t know
0	odintsova turned to bazarov
0	were you drinking with him , too ?
0	and bring me the newspapers , older ones , for the last five days , and i ’ ll give you some money for a drink
0	it all depends on you , on you , on you alone , he began with flashing eyes , almost in a whisper , losing the thread , even failing to utter some words because of his excitement
0	he seemed to be in a stupor
0	where are your clothes ?
0	he wanted to run away as quickly as possible
0	it ’ s for you , for you , sofiya semyonovna , and please , without further conversation , because i have no time for it
0	now , what do you suppose they made of all that ?
0	if she went out , it must be to see a particular lady on account of her orphans
0	turgenev has a propensity for idealism , but , nevertheless , not one of the idealists in his novel can be compared to bazarov either in strength of mind or in strength of character
0	yes , insane , i lost my head , i went crazy , completely
0	for me the strangest thing of all is that the number of crimes among the upper class is also increasing , in parallel , so to speak
0	he himself had no particular interest in all these teachings , ideas , and systems ( which andrey semyonych threw at him )
0	confront such terrible danger for a reward of one hundred rubles !
0	you insist that it was at your instigation !
0	why should i stay ?
0	a curse burst forth from his soul
0	after that he met no one , not a single soul , on his way up to his room ; the landlady ’ s door was closed and locked
0	i have even invented a new resin
0	let ’ s go , decided raskolnikov
0	( wringing her hands , she pointed to the children )
0	turgenev does not glorify the russian people or its past
0	the second she calls monumental time ; it is linked to eternity , all-encompassing and infinite , like imaginary space
0	there 's a peasant here suffering from icterus
0	they were there painting ; by any chance did you see them ?
0	how is it that i didn ’ t know that ?
0	yet they all pay a high price for their allegiance to their private cause
0	they dared think that you were mad
0	he placed the axe on the floor next to the dead woman and immediately reached into her pocket , trying not to get covered with her spurting blood—into that same right pocket from which she ’ d taken her keys the last time
0	at least , he touched the ground with one finger of his right hand
0	is it about twenty-five versts to your estate ?
0	once , about three years ago , he happened to spend a night at an inn in a remote district town
0	katerina ivanovna took lidochka , lifted the little boy from his chair , and , moving to the corner of the room near the stove , went down on her knees and placed the children on their knees in front of her
0	avdotya romanovna stared intently at her brother and kept waiting
0	are you that disenchanted ?
0	open up , you thinker , you , wake up !
0	ah , it ’ s a pity there ’ s so little time , because you ’ re such an interesting subject !
0	here you are , sir , if you ’ d care to see : mr writer , that is , a student , that is , a former student , doesn ’ t pay his debt
0	never mind , do not be alarmed sit down do not come near me : my illness is contagious
0	no , i have to cast that aside , he thought , coming back to his senses
0	at the end of the novel fenechka is the woman who is most radically altered
0	said her mother , looking timidly into her daughter ’ s eyes to read her thoughts , already feeling somewhat consoled that dunya was defending rodya and , therefore , must have forgiven him
0	suddenly she rested her right hand on the railing , lifted her right leg and thrust it over , then her left leg , and threw herself into the canal
0	when nikolai first meets her ( to remove a cinder from her eye ) , she has a tender , timid face ; her hair is soft ; her lips innocent and slightly parted ; her teeth , moist and pearly white
0	so you be the judge : it ’ s all the same to me now ; consequently , i ’ m doing this solely for you
0	besides , what right did he have to judge petr petrovich so quickly and rashly ?
0	and this infection 's already spread quite far
0	well , if you like , i ’ ll tell you how a woman tried to save ’ me , to use your language
0	fix it ; i ’ ll wait
0	tomorrow morning it ’ ll all be
0	come to see me and i ’ ll put it on you ; we ’ ll pray and go together
0	such a beginning did not bode well for a good ending
0	it would ’ ve been important for us to know if someone had seen them that same evening before eight o ’ clock , in that apartment , and it just occurred to me that you might be able to tell us
0	katerina ivanovna received it and bowed to him politely , even ceremoniously
0	obviously he was uncle ’ s pupil
0	look at how your hand is trembling !
0	the older couple believe that the younger pair treat each other as brother and sister
0	but there was no reason to be so underhanded about it
0	tell me , i ’ m convinced that you regard me with suspicion because i ’ ve been so tactful with you and up to now haven ’ t pestered you with any questions
0	the place is right ; if they come and ask you , tell them that i up and left for—oh , america
0	later on , things reach the stage that he is himself carried away for a moment and kisses fenichka , and pavel petrovich challenges him to a duel
0	† references to napoleon ’ s significant military victories and audacious crossing of mont blanc
0	how true , oh lord !
0	for god 's sake , said vasily ivanovich , let me do that myself
0	his introduction of motifs associated with a literary type serves his central problematic : the relationship of men and women to their own passional nature
0	i recently wrote you , but after your letter which i received yesterday i consider it necessary to write a couple of words in reply
0	for example , i ’ m obliged to arrest one person sooner , but someone else has a different character , sir ; so why shouldn ’ t i let him gallivant around town , sir , ha-ha !
0	and she was not the only one—all the others were also smiling and seemed to be asking forgiveness ; everyone was feeling a little awkward , a little melancholy , and , in reality , very happy
0	is there such an article ?
0	he was simply out of date
0	i was simply trying to educate her , completely innocently , trying to incite her to protest
0	but instead , bazarov talked about medicine , homeopathy , and botany
0	sonya stood there , deathly pale , regarding luzhin , unable to utter any reply
0	just like sitnikov , she was always anxious
0	he will be remembered for his enigmatic personality ,
0	what did i say ?
0	once upon a time
0	some flies , disturbed from their sleep , clustered around the untouched portion of veal still sitting on the table
0	it has been , razumikhin replied , frowning , and added , as if reluctantly , kokh recognized the item and positively identified the person who ’ d pawned it , and he verified that the item was really his
0	voyage , i ’ d like to carry out all the necessary preliminary arrangements
0	in fact , i even took a liking to her
0	her nose was a little broad , like almost all russian noses , and her complexion was not entirely clear ; nevertheless , arkady was sure he would never met such a lovely woman
0	what more do i want ?
0	it ’ s the very same vakhrushin , sir , afanasy ivanovich , according to your mother ’ s request , who once sent you some money in a similar manner ; he didn ’ t refuse to do it again this time , sir , and several days ago semyon semyonovich was informed that he should transfer thirty-five rubles to you , in anticipation of better times , sir
0	and there ’ s one more daughter
0	i have the honor to inform you that because of some sudden delays , i was unable to meet you on the platform , so i sent a very efficient fellow in my place
0	allow me , ladies and gentlemen , allow me ; don ’ t crowd me
0	raskolnikov walked across the square
0	dunechka asked anxiously , exchanging glances with her mother
0	‡ the man is a scoundrel !
0	and i ’ m drinking , sir !
0	et voilà comme on écrit l'histoire !
0	you ’ re not telling the truth !
0	believe me , i have borne and am able to bear the harshest truth from my friends
0	i left my uncle in charge
0	i see , she said , he has time for his own girl
0	nikolai petrovich was born in the south of russia , just like his older brother , pavel , about whom more later , and was brought up at home until the age of fourteen , surrounded by underpaid tutors , free-and-easy but obsequious adjutants , and other regimental and staff people
0	raskolnikov spoke loudly and pointed directly at him
0	that 's an important question as well
0	wouldn ’ t it be possible to see someone else ?
0	wasn ’ t he perhaps making a mistake ?
0	why , she ’ d even give you money , you fool !
0	i want to go see him right now and find out what he means by that
0	well , marmeladov , he says , you ’ ve disappointed my expectations once before
0	god knows what sort of ideas and plans you have in mind or what sort of thoughts you ’ re conceiving ; is it for me to pester you and ask what you ’ re thinking about ?
0	i assume you do not require any further explanation ?
0	if i ’ d seen through him before , i never would have been tempted
0	however , there ’ s no difficulty now
0	thank you , arkasha , nikolai petrovich began in a hollow voice , his fingers once again running over his brow and forehead
0	we ’ d drink it with pleasure
0	he was one of a countless and diverse legion of vulgar people , feeble retards , and uneducated morons who instantly and without fail latch onto the most fashionable current idea in order to vulgarize it and immediately caricature the cause they themselves sometimes serve in a most sincere manner
0	it was a one-hundred-ruble banknote , folded in eighths
0	a strange lethargy could be detected in all his movements ; even his step , usually forceful and decisively bold , was different
0	amaliya ivanovna rushed around the room , screaming , moaning , brawling , and flinging everything she could lay her hands on onto the floor
0	where will we put him , that 's the question ?
0	git in , everyone git in !
0	i know this for certain , even from the facts , sir
0	katerina ivanovna regarded him with a grim but stern look ; tears flowed from her eyes
0	without fail they ’ d have discovered him there if kokh hadn ’ t been such a fool and gone to fetch the caretaker
0	long since the issues that he fought out have ceased to be of any actual interest
0	thrash ’ er , go on !
0	oh , my dear , i just don ’ t know what to talk about , pulkheriya aleksandrovna burst out
0	obviously they had not been expected
0	i ’ m not such a boor as you think
0	his cynicism has two aspects , an internal and an external one , a cynicism of thought and feeling and a cynicism of manner and expression
0	bazarov school had happened upon turgenev 's theme , then , of course , the picture would have been drawn otherwise and the colors would have been applied differently
0	perching on the sofa at his son 's feet , he hoped to have a nice chat with him , but bazarov sent him away at once , saying that he wanted to sleep ; but he did not fall asleep until morning
0	sorrow , sorrow is what i sought in its depths , sorrow and tears , and i found them and tasted of them ; but he who has pitied all men and who has understood everyone and everything , he will take pity on us ; he and no one else ; he is the judge
0	and only then did he completely understand the meaning these poor little orphan children had for her , and the pitiful half-mad katerina ivanovna , with her consumption and her banging her head against the wall
0	what book did he give you ?
0	my son , my dear , kind son !
0	to nihilism , incidentally , russia owes the well-known and remarkable fact that in our culturally deprived country , women began , earlier than in most civilized states , their surge toward higher education and equal rights —a fact which already [ as of ] has had enormous significance and which in the future will obviously play a great role in the fate of our country and even perhaps throughout the civilized world
0	well , if you like , we can hire a cab !
0	the point is that this idea
0	raskolnikov asked with obvious agitation
0	but enough about me—and it is time to stop these sporadic reminiscences which , i fear , will hardly satisfy readers
0	peter returned to the carriage and handed him his matchbox and a fat , black cigar , which arkady lit immediately , spreading such a strong and acrid smell of cheap tobacco around himself that nikolai petrovich , who would never been a smoker , turned away , though unobtrusively so as not to offend his son
0	as for your being a great sinner , that ’ s true , he added almost enthusiastically
0	she ’ s sitting there with her mouth open wide , just look : she ’ s like an owl , a genuine screech owl in her cap with new ribbons , ha-ha-ha !
0	svidrigaylov was observing and scrutinizing him in silence , which also struck raskolnikov at once ; it seemed as if he wanted to get up and slip out of the tavern surreptitiously so that no one would notice him
0	the room in which they found themselves looked more like a study than a drawing room
0	the one rambles idealistic poetry , the other grumbles his faith in the dissection of frogs ; the one is all too obviously weak , the other seems spectacularly strong
0	raskolnikov walked along next to him
0	why do you think that ?
0	true , i consider that you ’ ve been sent to us by providence , and so i was convinced that you already knew everything about it
0	it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
0	the radical critic pisarev came to turgenev 's aid
0	yes , you did the sensible thing
0	he felt , at least , that if not now , he would be capable of doing it later
0	all dressed in white
0	for a little while all right
0	to hell with all that !
0	what are you waiting for ?
0	do not worry , i have not given anyone the evil eye
0	peter , he called , extending his arm , are those our peasants over there ?
0	i don ’ t recall his exact words , but the idea was that he ’ d become wealthy for free , as quickly as possible , without having to work for it !
0	he extended both his hands to me , yet didn ’ t give me even one ; he withdrew his hand in time , flashed through his mind suspiciously
0	razumikhin turned as pale as a corpse
0	nikolai the miracle worker ; a tiny porcelain egg on a red ribbon fastened to the saint 's gold halo hung over his chest ; there were jars of last year 's preserves on the windowsills , carefully arranged , glistening bright green ; on their paper lids fenechka had written in large letters : guzbery
0	bazarov 's transgression of culture and his painful death echo ovid 's rendering of the story of actaeon , a hero whose transformation images destruction rather than reward
0	everyone ’ s pestering me on all sides , saying , it ’ s a crime , a crime !
0	yes , yes , that would be better , much better , she responded with feeling
0	i will introduce you to her
0	for which you received the st vladimir cross ?
0	i began with the thesis that fathers and sons is a novel with two entwined themes :
0	what what was that ?
0	i am wondering where you acquired those powers of observation you genuinely possess
0	but they don ’ t stutter
0	he was now almost running around the room , moving his stout little legs faster and faster , looking down at the floor , his right hand thrust behind his back , his left constantly waving about , executing various gestures , each time astonishingly ill-suited to his words
0	nikolai petrovich tried to establish monetary fines for any damages , but the matter usually ended when the horses were returned to their owners after a day or two of grazing on the master 's land
0	the russian peasant 's just like the mysterious stranger that mrs radcliffe used to go on about at such length
0	are you always home alone ?
0	it seems that way , at least
0	i don ’ t even have any matches
0	there ’ s only one thing that matters , only one : to be able to dare !
0	the whole interest , the whole meaning of the novel is contained in the death of bazarov
0	it ’ s just that as soon as i saw you , the drink went to my head
0	it is the cognitive revolution that took place between a time when nature was felt to reflect man , and a later time in which man was conceived as little more than a reflection of nature that makes the local relationship of turgenev and secenov of particular interest
0	enough of that , evgeny
0	no , he says , i didn ’ t
0	it was a balance involving ' the body and pressure of time and that rapidly changing physiognomy of russians of the cultured stratum ' , which he described as being preeminently the object of his observation as a novelist ; it was therefore arealistic ' in its devotion to the realities of russian life and topical in its concern with chronicling the history of the russian intelligentsia
0	do you know what i remembered , brother ?
0	i can ’ t believe it !
0	lying on the 'earth , looking up at the 'heavens ' you know , there 's special significance in that
0	i just don ’ t know how she can ask like that !
0	yes , indeed , avdotya romanovna !
0	and so on and so forth
0	i told you once for all that you not dare say to me amal lyudvigovna ; i ’ m amal-ivan !
0	of course , he had quickly managed to discern in andrey semyonych an extremely vulgar and simpleminded man
0	she surpassed the ludicrous in her attitudes and behavior
0	crossing the bridge , he calmly and peacefully looked at the neva , at the bright setting of the burning red sun
0	i don ’ t believe it !
0	they should be more careful with him today
0	you yourself can see that it ’ s not right !
0	katerina ivanovna wants me to implore you to attend the funeral tomorrow morning
0	however , lebezyatnikov , in spite of the fact that he was a nice man , had also begun to have some difficulty tolerating his fellow lodger and former mentor petr petrovich
0	bazarov said with particular emphasis
0	you should have seen how he abused me today !
0	why did she take him away ?
0	yes , of course , evgeny ; there 's an excellent room in the wing next to me : he will be fine there
0	and this dream of so many years had almost been realized : he was impressed by avdotya romanovna ’ s beauty and education ; her helpless position excited him in the extreme
0	i do not see any obstacles i am happy for katya and for arkady nikolaich
0	just imagine , he said , turning to raskolnikov , that ’ s the way it was last evening
0	that will suffice for me
0	his gaze and his thoughts demanded space
0	it was so stuffy that it was even unbearable to sit there ; everything was so saturated by the smell of alcohol that it seemed a person could become drunk in about five minutes just inhaling the air
0	each one would depend on all the others for the rest of their lives !
0	well , what ’ s the matter ?
0	anna sergeevna took hold of katya 's chin and raised her face
0	no , it ’ s better to do it without thinking , and get it off my back !
0	in translating the laws of science into ideological practice , scientism gives up the extrahistorical claim to truth attaching to mathematical signs
0	the type of bazarov seemed to him practically an apotheosis of the contemporary ,
0	look at my watch ; but i ’ ll tell you about it because it ’ s an interesting little matter , my marriage , that is , in its own way
0	he was crossing the street and a carriage ran him over ; don ’ t be upset ; he ’ ll come to
0	well , they pressured him and pressured him , squeezed him and squeezed him , and he finally confessed
0	she ’ s an orphan ; god has sent you !
0	i could never trust his character , not even when he was only fifteen years old
0	never mind , let them eat
0	is this still my dream or not ?
0	it was burning with fever
0	it was like a hideous joke , an absurdity !
0	he told her that amaliya ivanovna was driving them out of the apartment and that katerina ivanovna was rushing off to look for justice
0	i nearly put off speaking about it until another time , but really , you ’ re capable of frustrating a dead man
0	she did not play cards and kept laughing frequently , in marked contrast to her pale and worried look
0	that was a thunderbolt , sir !
0	soon everyone turned away from him
0	i said anna sergeevna odintsova 's here and has brought a gentleman with her , a doctor
0	so , he will be living in a fine white hut while i am pushing up burdock ; well , then what ?
0	she troubles me ; you ’ ll see , you will
0	she stood there and turned around in front of me
0	uttered pavel petrovich ; his face took on such a detached , remote expression , as if he would entirely withdrawn to some cloudy height
0	take , for example , that theme of the doorbells once again : i , that is , the examining magistrate , wholeheartedly revealed that precious detail to you , that fact
0	that appears to be something felt by all readers—and one might add that , like the heroes of dostoevsky , bazarov does not so much proclaim his views—he speaks of them unwillingly and rarely—as incarnate them
0	i swear to you , he continued to whisper , already on the stairs , just a little while ago he came close to beating us up , the doctor and me !
0	he ’ s such a
0	no , wouldn ’ t it be better to try svidrigaylov : to find out what that was all about ?
0	he whispered gloomily a plump , blue-gray dove flew down onto the road and went off to drink from a puddle near the well
0	i said it about you not because of your dishonor and your sin , but because of your great suffering
0	how could he possibly care about a promissory note at this time , or about some overdue payment ?
0	you are , aren ’ t you ?
0	he turned around ; lebezyatnikov came running toward him
0	turgenev decided to choose as a representative of the bazarov type an uncouth man ; of course as he delineated his hero , he did not conceal or try to gloss over his awkwardness
0	he decided to keep silent and wait : what would happen next ?
0	send someone to fetch odintsova , anna sergeevna ; she 's a landowner who lives nearby do you know her ?
0	have you seen them recently ?
0	now it ’ s almost clear to me how you regard crime , but
0	he sometimes thought : svidrigaylov was constantly skulking around him and was doing so now ; svidrigaylov knew his secret ; he had harbored designs against dunya
0	maybe we should put on our frockcoats ?
0	it tasted not quite like copper , not quite like resin ; the flies were also a bother
0	what ’ s the life of that consumptive , stupid , spiteful old woman worth on the common scale ?
0	a strange thought occurred to him suddenly : perhaps it would really be better in prison
0	well , i can almost see it somewhere in a garden—a garden , isn ’ t that what you told zametov , and then repeated to me a second time ?
0	the schiller in you is always getting confused
0	should i get rid of the axe ?
0	why am i going now , when i myself know that all of it will be just as it is in the books , and not any different ?
0	in one town , we learn that a former student has robbed the mail along the main road
0	but our carriage only seats two , and i do not know how your friend will
0	the cleanliness of his room and freshness of the bed linen made a pleasant impression on him
0	a moment later he rang it again , louder
0	fenechka 's eye got better soon , but the impression she would made on nikolai petrovich did not fade quickly
0	he remained there for rather a long time ; when he came back to breakfast , nikolai petrovich inquired solicitously after his health because his face looked so dark
0	not only is turgenev not a novelist , he is more precisely not a russian novelist
0	now all that ’ s over and done with and we can say that we ’ re all happy again
0	what do i care ?
0	my whole life , or anything
0	i can hear her sighing through the wall , but when i go out to see her—i have nothing to say to her
0	i was a little drunk , sir , and i heard my sonya ( she ’ s very meek and has such a soft voice
0	but that ’ s all nonsense , too !
0	i was so furious that the next day i went to the address bureau to give it a try , and what do you know , they located you in two minutes
0	the description of bazarov 's death is one of the best passages in turgenev 's novel ; indeed , i doubt whether anything more remarkable can be found in the whole body of his work
0	you ’ re lying , i won ’ t let you catch me !
0	she directed the conversation to music , but when she learned that bazarov did not acknowledge art , she quietly returned to the subject of botany , although arkady was just about to launch into a disquisition on the significance of folk melodies
0	odintsova gives her sister and brother-in-law a handsome present , and even bazarov— now dead—has earlier recommended that arkady follow the example of the jackdaw , which is , as natural history instructs , a most respectable family bird ( [ ] )
0	yesterday he so insistently demanded that petr petrovich be refused , and now we ’ re told that rodya can ’ t be received !
0	stop it , sonya , stop it !
0	deliberately setting aside the consolations of religious faiths , his was a realistic view of life which attempted from first to last to peer beyond the veil , or to cross the threshold separating reality from eternity
0	the poetic sensibility at work in turgenev 's tales of destructive passion evokes ennui in the modern reader
0	that ’ s the main thing , remembered afterward , and there ’ s your evidence
0	was that all right ?
0	he had gone to her first , to sonya , with his confession ; in her he ’ d sought another person , when he ’ d needed to find one ; she would follow after him wherever fate sent him
0	but it ’ s particularly true for women
0	for destitution you ’ re not even driven away with a stick—you ’ re swept out of human company with a broom so that it will be even more humiliating ; and that ’ s fair , for in my destitution i ’ m the first one prepared to humiliate myself
0	she very much wanted to remember him , to honor him , his memory
0	what do you mean , you don ’ t need the sentence reduction , how can that be ?
0	at the time he himself still didn ’ t believe in his dreams and was merely irritating himself with their repugnant , though seductive audacity
0	now things are getting extremely boisterous : some very large and extremely drunken peasants in red and blue shirts , their heavy coats slung over their shoulders , come out of the tavern shouting , singing , and playing balalaikas
0	his turning away from his former passion finds affectionate but mocking reflection in rudin and dvorianskoe gnezdo and becomes the subject of bitter denunciation in gamlet shchi-grovskogo uezda
0	pavel petrovich exclaimed impatiently
0	well , therefore you could ’ ve challenged men to a duel
0	where were you all last night ?
0	bazarov does not like to argue or , in general , to express his opinions and only pavel petrovich is sometimes able to draw him into a significant discussion
0	secondly : my conscience is completely clear ; i have no ulterior motives in making this offer
0	and it seems that as recently as yesterday , you supposed he loved katya like a brother
0	it does not matter , he muttered
0	i ’ m gon na make ’ er gallop !
0	that is the point of view from which the action and events of the novel may best be evaluated
0	so what , if they deserve to be despised ?
0	fathers and children : turgenev and the liberal predicament
0	katerina sergeevna , he began , his voice trembling , his hands clasped tightly together
0	and it ’ s impossible to drag a man off with what they have
0	) ; he thought , by this time she 's forgotten entirely about my existence , and in his soul he felt a sense of exquisite humility
0	in comedy , the villains , the blockers , are laughed off the stage , while in tragedy the people who do not belong come to a more frightful end
0	why did you try to hang yourself ?
0	bazarov leaned out of his carriage , while arkady poked his head around his comrade 's back and saw on the little porch of the manor house a tall , gaunt man with disheveled hair and a thin aquiline nose , dressed in an old , unfastened military jacket
0	he provides in answer an effective presentation of life which fixes and crystallizes youthful rebellion , a program which substitutes for love between the generations a whole other world of affections and loyalties among peers
0	in the rear blind wall of this portico or gallery , there were six niches for statues , which odintsov had planned to order from abroad
0	what if there ’ s no one else to see , nowhere else to go ?
0	arkady nodded his head , as if he himself were not shy
0	it ’ s what ’ s called bonne guerre , † and the most permissible deceit !
0	he thought to himself
0	razumikhin roared and suddenly threw himself at zosimov , grabbing him by the throat
0	he listens to me , his eyes wide open , and suddenly grows pale as a ghost
0	that ’ s why sofiya semyonovna ’ s been summoned to appear today at the hotel where the aristocratic lady is staying temporarily , having just arrived in town from her dacha
0	he ’ s been vegetating his whole life as a district postmaster
0	his words made quite an impression ; silence reigned for a moment , but soon the previous laughter and curses resumed
0	he had already heard something about it yesterday ; he even recalled that he had been invited ; but as a result of his own affairs , he let everything else slip from his attention
0	but , of course , it ’ s now that you won ’ t come
0	bazarov reverses in his biography the direction taken by the movement from romanticism to naturalism : he is a naturalist who metamorphoses into a romantic poet
0	perhaps we wouldn ’ t even reject sonechka ’ s fate !
0	no , if i ’ d handed them some fifteen hundred rubles for a dowry and for gifts , nice little boxes , toilet cases , jewelry , fabrics , and all sorts of trifles from knop ’ s and the english shop , then everything would have turned out better and
0	i don ’ t believe in a future life , said raskolnikov
0	and to base it all on that ?
0	an ecstatic smile parted his broad lips and remained fixed there
0	at last everything quieted down all at once , as if cut off ; the men departed
0	well , sonya , where ’ ve you been ?
0	six months ; he will be seven soon , on the eleventh
0	now the letter from his mother had suddenly struck him like a thunderbolt
0	with faint , weak steps , trembling knees , and a terrible chill , raskolnikov turned back and climbed the stairs to his little room
0	she reached the third floor , turned down the long hallway , and rang the bell at number : on the door , written in chalk , were the words kapernaumov
0	one thing is certain : it was a derivative of the masculine word and followed it into the language of popular usage
0	in silence , only occasionally exchanging small talk , our friends arrived at fedot 's
0	he said , shaking his head
0	she ’ s now a widow , a consumptive , and a pitiful woman with three young orphans , hungry
0	so that 's what you think !
0	of course , he was not that horrible if he held out for seven years
0	i get six rubles for sixteen pages , which means about fifteen rubles for the whole thing , and i got six rubles in advance
0	i was fed up with all of them yesterday , raskolnikov replied , turning suddenly to porfiry with an arrogantly challenging smile
0	but turgenev did not bring bazarov out of his gloomy mood
0	he was apparently steady and serene
0	i wo not undertake a refutation ; perhaps the lady even told the truth
0	he ’ s a very nice young man
0	raskolnikov didn ’ t utter a word during this conversation , yet he learned everything all at once : lizaveta was the old woman ’ s younger half sister ( they had different mothers ) and was already thirty-five years old
0	raskolnikov turned around quickly and sat down on the chair next to the table
0	of course , he has his own aims , and most likely they ’ re bad ones
0	we ’ ll see , we ’ ll see , he repeated to himself
0	i ’ m not even referring to the means
0	perhaps even later today
0	that ’ s the explanation of her way out !
0	having once imagined this hospitality , she had come to believe in it as a sacred thing
0	still i ’ ll know that you love me , and for me even that ’ s enough
0	with a nod of his head , he indicated his outstretched , enfeebled body
0	sofiya semyonovna , raskolnikov corrected him
0	it suits you , if you only knew : a romeo who ’ s six feet tall !
0	how can this be ?
0	what about your head ?
0	pelouse et frémy , notions générales bazarov replied
0	she was acquainted with everyone in town , and during that month she visited town continually
0	or something of that sort—as is always done in similar cases by relatives or even by strangers , but in general by people wishing to assist
0	you just mentioned zametov
0	but , juxtaposed to such pitiful and insignificant fathers as the kirsanovs , the stern bazarov captivated turgenev and , instead of spanking the son , he flogged the fathers
0	rumors about this episode circulated through the whole town for an entire month , and it reached the point where dunya and i couldn ’ t even go to church because of all the contemptuous looks and whispers
0	tales were circulating about him
0	a restless and vacant expression appeared on the small , though pleasant features of his pampered face ; his little eyes , looking as if they would been squeezed into his face , stared intently and uneasily , and he laughed nervously , in an abrupt , wooden manner
0	do they know i went back to the apartment ?
0	he couldn ’ t , for example , imagine that at some time he would stop thinking , get up , and—simply go there
0	farewell , madame , bazarov said , as if guessing her thought , and headed back to the house
0	will you fulfill everything ?
0	however , he guessed right away that this wasn ’ t the only thing that was upsetting him ; there was something demanding immediate resolution , but he was unable to figure out what it was or to put it into words
0	that is , it seems to be the case
0	dunya went up to her mother and kissed her
0	first we must bring this creature back to his senses
0	with my constitution , i even fear that i might suffer a stroke
0	stackenschneider recalls that the term nigilistka was held in high regard among women of the sixties , while kiseinaya devushka was a pejorative term ( dnevnik , )
0	not the arrears , my friend !
0	there ’ s a certain circumstance
0	from time to time , with a sheepish and vague look , he glanced at the speaker but , obviously , didn ’ t have any idea what he was talking about , and it was doubtful that he even heard him
0	and the stricter the master , the better for the peasant
0	we can only be sure that after the publication of fathers and children , the image of the female nihilist ( turgenev did not use the word ) was firmly fixed in the public eye
0	even before this , she seemed , in spite of all her excellent qualities , to have a somewhat ecstatic and romantic cast to her views
0	the doctor complied so as not to irritate him and left
0	and avdotya romanovna ’ s not too tired , either ?
0	i will feel fine tomorrow
0	he came running in ecstasy
0	raskolnikov turned around quickly and stared directly at razumikhin
0	photographs of russian life and russian life in the interior
0	he cast a challenging and desperate glance at the caretaker , who silently handed him a gray piece of paper folded in two , sealed with bottle wax
0	the wallpaper here was still the same
0	i ’ m afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the latest fashionable disbelief
0	well , sir , let ’ s get down to business !
0	well , what of it ?
0	we ’ re furriers , tradesmen , and work at home
0	prokofich , in his own way , was just as much of an aristocrat as pavel petrovich
0	achilles said with a shudder , his pupils growing wider and wider
0	women regarded him as a charming melancholic , but he did not keep company with ladies
0	here ’ s how i would have changed the counterfeit banknotes : i ’ d have counted the first thousand very carefully , four times over , examining each note , and then moved on to the next thousand ; i ’ d have begun counting that one , reached the middle of the pile , and then pulled out some fifty-ruble note , held it up to the light , turned it over , and held that side up to the light , too—checking to see if it was counterfeit
0	raskolnikov stood there for the whole service
0	well , yes , of course , it 's all in the nature of things , vasily ivanych said , but we would better go inside
0	i ’ m not afraid of katerina ivanovna now , he muttered in agitation
0	he was russia in a large measure , henry james wrote in partial portraits ( )
0	polechka was wearing her usual dress
0	that peasant woman with a child is begging for alms ; it ’ s curious that she considers me more fortunate than she is
0	when bazarov , writhing in delirium , cries out , take ten from eight , what 's left over ?
0	why does he feel so grateful to me ?
0	other figures will gain , too , i think
0	now i believe it even less !
0	most frequently he does not even feel the need to express himself ; he thinks to himself and , from time to time , lets drop a cursory remark , which is usually seized upon with respectful eagerness by his proselytes and pupils like arkady
0	she hasn ’ t left this room ; as soon as she returned , you scoundrel , she sat down right next to rodion romanovich !
0	just at that moment , several people appeared in the doorway together with lebezyatnikov , among whom were the two recently arrived ladies
0	used to sing that song when he was courting me
0	on the other hand , pavel petrovich came to despise bazarov with all the strength he could muster : he considered him arrogant , impudent , a cynic , and a plebian ; he suspected that bazarov did not respect him , that he might even despise him—pavel kirsanov !
0	it ’ s simply work , a noble , useful activity to society , one worth as much as any other , and is a much higher activity , for example , than that of some raphael or pushkin , because it ’ s more useful ! ¶
0	i hope your journey was agreeable ?
0	i want to find out and will be able to learn , for certain , whether he ’ s a brother to me or not
0	there is , i believe , a fairly general consensus among those who have studied turgenev that he was a writer who took a remarkably objective , fair-minded view of the political scene while always seeking to hold the middle ground
0	taking arms against idealism and destroying its castles in the air , he himself , at times , becomes an idealist , that is , he begins to prescribe to man how he should enjoy himself and how he should regulate his own sensations
0	he then saw how her lower lip trembled in indignation in response to her brother ’ s bold and ungratefully cruel commands—and he could not resist
0	he lay there for a long time
0	he acts thus through calculation : he pays the price of a minor unpleasantness in order to secure greater comfort in the future or deliverance from a greater unpleasantness
0	well , it ’ s tempting , isn ’ t it ?
0	fenechka raised her eyes to look at bazarov , eyes that seemed even darker from the whitish reflection on the upper part of her face
0	he entered like a person condemned to death
0	bazarov would ask , interrupting him
0	pavel petrovich paced slowly back and forth in the dining room ( he never ate supper ) and occasionally sipped a goblet filled with red wine and even less frequently uttered some remark , or rather exclamation , such as ah !
0	you seem not to be yourself
0	young folks do not much like that , he explained to her
0	porfiry petrovich asked , glancing at razumikhin
0	( well , do you recall the public reading of pushkin ’ s egyptian nights ? ‡ those dark eyes ?
0	he ’ s here on business , he ’ s a lawyer , and even his conversation is so
0	odintseva 's psychic and sensual retreats will be governed by this allegiance to an order both psychological and social
0	the former preserve the world and increase its population ; the latter move the world forward and lead it to its goal
0	the older generation does not understand bazarov and for that very reason fears him : arkady 's father , a soft slothful landowner , is acute enough , however , to remark that bazarov is different : he has fewer traces of the slaveowner
0	the confession didn ’ t last very long
0	i am here with a small carnage , but there 's a troika of horses for your coach as well , said nikolai petrovich with some concern , while arkady had a drink of water from an iron dipper brought by the woman in charge of the carriage inn , and bazarov lit his pipe and walked over to the driver , who was unharnessing the horses
0	throwing over her head the same lightweight green shawl the late marmeladov had mentioned in his account , katerina ivanovna squeezed through the disorderly drunken crowd of lodgers , who were still pushing into the room
0	he stepped on the box and then picked them up !
0	one morning she declared openly that according to her calculations , rodya should be coming back soon ; that she recalled how , at their parting , he himself had reminded her that she should expect him in nine months
0	to m n katkov
0	i dared not tell you the truth because you ’ d be so unhappy , bitter , and angry
0	yes , sir , curtains ; nikolai petrovich was kind enough to give them to me ; they have been here for some time
0	it was lying there , beside the pillow ; raskolnikov saw it
0	rodya ’ s been ill for the last five days and was delirious for three of them
0	but that ’ s because he hasn ’ t dared to use them
0	dobrolyubov ) , but apart from that one could not conceive of a better reincarnation of bazarov than mayakovsky
0	russia 's true conservator , pushkin 's legatee who first revealed to europe that russia is also europe
0	but soon he felt very cold standing above the water ; he turned and set off on bolshoi prospect
0	he drew near , but even then did not raise his eyes and said in a hollow voice , i must apologize , anna sergeevna
0	her husband is said to be one of russia 's future statesmen , a lawyer who is clever , willful , kind , and cold as ice
0	these zones are formed from the fragments of character speech [ polurec ] , from various forms for hidden transmission of someone else 's word , from scattered words and sayings belonging to someone else 's speech , from those invasions into authorial speech of others ' expressive indicators ( ellipsis , questions , exclamations )
0	raskolnikov said with a particular look , and then smiled , nodded his head , and went down the stairs
0	this solace not only sheds light on the novel 's closing scene but also states its second , inextricably related theme : love and continuity between generations
0	how have they all turned out ?
0	they say , i ’ ll carry one small brick for universal happiness and as a result i ’ ll feel my heart at peace
0	they both remained silent , and that silence lasted for a peculiarly long time , about ten minutes
0	she asked , turning to bazarov
0	thus , rodya , all your clothes have been renewed , because , in my opinion , your overcoat is not only still serviceable , but even has a kind of elegance about it : that ’ s what happens when you order your clothes from charmeur ’ s tailor shop !
0	it also disturbed him what razumikhin had just said about porfiry
0	but not to try on the shoes
0	asked the perplexed razumikhin , shaking his head
0	i shouldn ’ t have said that to her !
0	considering that avdotya romanovna , in essence , was impoverished ( ah , excuse me , i didn ’ t want to
0	not only to sonya , but next you ’ ll go to dunya !
0	this is my friend razumikhin , a good fellow
0	one might similarly apply to turgenev 's novel isaiah berlin 's gloss on strakhov 's words about turgenev 's poetic and truthful genius
0	the dome of the cathedral , the outline of which could not appear more conspicuously from any other point of view than this spot on the bridge , some twenty paces from the chapel , was gleaming ; through the clear air one could discern every last detail of its decoration
0	he hastened to say when they opened the door
0	herzen was crying off from revolution because he rejected western civilization
0	waste , futility , and anguish are overwhelming , but then comes a dramatic reversal , and the novel ends with a declaration of hope :
0	can you be serious , rodya ?
0	but without turning around , vasily ivanovich merely gestured in despair and left the room
0	the role of aunt , guardian , mother , whatever you want to call it
0	congratulate me , bazarov cried suddenly , today , june twenty-second , is my guardian angel 's day
0	you ’ re capricious and spoiled , and you can ’ t deny yourself anything—i call that filth , because it leads directly to filth
0	sonya started to say , without so much as looking at razumikhin , and , as a result , became even more embarrassed
0	where has she gone ?
0	he does and he ’ s also lame
0	in a larger sense , the argument between the ordinary or prosaic and the extraordinary or dramatic pervades this book
0	there is the sound of a heavy thud
0	that ’ s all ; it seemed to me that this is what i had to do and what i had to start with
0	do you know that my wife was educated in a provincial school for children of the nobility , and at the award ceremony she was chosen to perform the shawl dance§ in the presence of the governor and other distinguished guests , for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit ?
0	what am i saying ?
0	when he decides to leave—abruptly and even cruelly after a visit home of only three days—part of his motivation is , in fact , love for his parents :
0	i ’ m really losing my mind !
0	i am in my right mind , sir , and you
0	well , the hell with all of you !
0	why did i reveal it to her ?
0	that 's all bazarov almost uttered his favorite word romanticism , but restrained himself and said , nonsense
0	in a word , i conclude that everyone , not only the great people , but even those who stand out just slightly from the everyday rut , that is , those who are even marginally capable of uttering some new word , must , by their nature , necessarily be criminals—more or less , it goes without saying
0	at first , he paid her no attention , just as he hadn ’ t focused on other things appearing before him up to now
0	he came to see the apartment , said the elder workman , drawing near
0	bazarov is exceedingly full of self-esteem , but this self-esteem is unnoticeable as a direct consequence of his vastness
0	they ’ re really the ones i ought to be wearing now
0	even though i know that you ’ re a man
0	it was because of my new clothes that i decided to fool you all
0	do you remember what i wanted to tell you yesterday ?
0	he went to the stove , opened it , and began searching in the cinders : pieces of the trouser fringes and fragments of his torn pockets were lying inside , just as they had been when he ’ d thrown them in there : this meant that no one had looked inside !
0	cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna , interrupting him
0	sonya followed katerina ivanovna closely , weeping and constantly imploring her to return home
0	do you still have the same steward ?
0	but to hell with all of them !
0	i couldn ’ t work up the courage to do it
0	hands at your sides , quickly , quickly , glissez-glissez , pas de basque ! ‡‡ stamp your feet
0	he was holding his cap , preparing to leave
0	don ’ t come to see me
0	and once even replaced it with father , pronounced , it 's true , between his teeth ; with excessive carelessness he poured much more wine into his glass than he really wanted and then drank it all
0	the high official repeats in annoyance
0	they have to be washed together
0	the sacrifice , have you both measured the enormous sacrifice ?
0	if you were now to reveal all your secrets to me , i might not even listen ; i might just spit and walk away
0	the first abuses the main character , the other two enthusiastically praise everything
0	i do not quite understand what you mean , replied arkady
0	to i p borisov
0	here ’ s the point : perhaps i ’ m very guilty before you ; i feel this to be the case , sir
0	he didn ’ t understand that such a premonition could be a prediction of a future crisis in his life , of his future resurrection , of a future view of life itself
0	anna sergeevna asked , among other things , what he would been doing at the kirsanovs
0	nothing liberates man as much as learning , and nowhere is freedom as necessary as in art , in poetry : not for nothing are the arts called liberal ,
0	it wasn ’ t that money , calm down !
0	saying good-bye to bazarov , odintsova stretched out her hand and said , we will see each other again , wo not we ?
0	finally the plan included even sonya , who would accompany katerina ivanovna to t—— and there would assist her in everything
0	he stood up , wanting to return home , but the emotions stirring in his heart could not be calmed ; he began pacing slowly around the garden , first gazing sadly at the ground under his feet , then raising his eyes to the sky , where swarms of stars were already twinkling
0	vasily ivanovich led him into the study
0	because you can ’ t remain like this—that ’ s why !
0	yet very rarely has their style been regarded as anything but exemplary
0	he pricked up his ears
0	well , then here ’ s a little example for the future—that is , don ’ t think i ’ d dare to instruct you : why , just look at those articles on crime you publish !
0	he wanted to finish everything before sunset
0	raskolnikov shuddered , but porfiry seemed not to notice him , all the while concerned only about razumikhin ’ s cigarette
0	as a pure empiricist , he enjoys the pleasant sensation and gradually becomes so accustomed to it , that when the time comes to tear himself away , it is difficult and painful for him to do so
0	the only difference is that i don ’ t insist in any way that extraordinary people absolutely must and are always obligated to commit all sorts of outrages , as you say
0	' i have conceived a loathing for this peasant , bazarov says , ' i have to work the skin off my hands for him , and he wo not so much as thank me for it ; anyway , what do i need his thanks for ?
0	he had been spurting these empty , meaningless phrases without stop , suddenly dropping in some enigmatic words , then wandering off into nonsense again
0	she as rich as a yid , can lend you five thousand just like that , but she doesn ’ t balk at taking a pledge worth a single ruble , either
0	and of patrick waddington 's excellent turgenev and england , london , ; pisma , vol
0	now splashes of rain flew in the window from the trees and bushes ; it was dark as a cellar , so that one could barely make out objects as vague dark spots
0	they did not know , and the author knows even less
0	are not you enjoying yourself here ?
0	we summoned chebarov , shoved ten rubles in his mouth , got the note back , and now i have the honor of presenting it to you—they ’ ll take your word for it now—here , take it ; i ’ ve even torn it a bit like it ’ s supposed to be
0	she didn ’ t hear and didn ’ t see the men entering ; she seemed to be in some sort of stupor in which she neither saw nor heard anything
0	was that why you frightened me , just to lead me to this ?
0	has it ever occurred to you that the sistine madonna has a fantastic face , the face of a sad holy fool ?
0	why did he come ?
0	i ’ d acquired new clothes before that
0	well , yes and the cigar does not taste very good
0	meanwhile raskolnikov persuaded someone to fetch a doctor
0	don ’ t tell me they should release your painter ?
0	do you also want to torment me to death ?
0	my head started spinning a little
0	but no friendship can survive such confrontations for very long
0	and he will stretch forth his arms to us , and we will kiss his hands
0	there have been many attempts to define russian nihilism , but i think nikolai strakhov came close to the truth when he said that nihilism itself hardly exists , although there is no denying the fact that nihilists do
0	how can he do it without a signature ?
0	take me , he says , to such and such a police station ; i ’ ll admit to everything
0	but healthy people can experience something similar , remarked dunechka , regarding zosimov uneasily
0	as you wish , but there ’ s something about you : precisely now—that is , not at this very minute , but now in general
0	he was at home in his little room ; at that moment he was busy writing ; he unlocked the door himself
0	as if in the theater
0	but he understood her , too
0	you , i trust , do not need logic to put a piece of bread in your mouth when you are hungry
0	no , dunya , i can see everything , and i know what those many things are that you want to talk over with me ; i also know what you worried about all night , pacing the room , and what you prayed about before the icon of our lady of kazan , the one that mama has in her bedroom
0	this certificate of merit , obviously , was now supposed to bear witness to katerina ivanovna ’ s right to establish a school ; but the main thing was , it was kept in reserve with the goal of finally putting those two overdressed tail draggers in their place , in case they came to the funeral feast , and to demonstrate clearly to them that katerina ivanovna was descended from a noble , one could even say aristocratic , household and was a colonel ’ s daughter , and that she was much better than certain adventure seekers who had become so very common as of late
0	i was conscious , conscious !
0	but the struggle was too uneven ; amaliya ivanovna pushed her away like a feather
0	i warn you that dunechka ’ s already decided the entire matter from the outset , but i , i still don ’ t know what to do , and
0	he rushed toward her
0	she was extremely agitated and tried to lift herself up
0	what if he still did now ?
0	and what does bazarov do amidst these three personalities ?
0	how could you not know that her mother ’ s borrowing money in advance against her pension to cover the cost of their journey ?
0	turgenev 's background in german idealist philosophy , especially hegelianism , is quite well documented and requires only the briefest summary
0	my mother , my sister , how i loved them !
0	he felt that he had gotten rid of a terrible burden , one that had been oppressing him for so long a time , and his soul suddenly seemed light and peaceful
0	why do you set off ?
0	to get to the police station , he had to go straight and then turn left at the second street : it was just a few steps away
0	one was holding a lit lantern , with which , by leaning over , he was casting light on something lying on the pavement near the carriage wheels
0	at that very moment , he was summoned to see porfiry petrovich
0	he grew angry that my mother and my sister , in spite of his slander , didn ’ t want to quarrel with me ; word for word , he began to utter unforgivably impudent things to them
0	he recommends stoff and kraft precisely as a popular book , that is , an empty one ; the duel with pavel petrovich is introduced precisely as graphic proof of the emptiness of elegantly noble knighthood , presented almost in an exaggeratedly comic way
0	raskolnikov thought for a minute
0	even the inevitable exclamations and sighs , interrogations and astonishment , suddenly were all unusually moderate and restrained ; on the other hand , the most enthusiastic gratitude was expressed and even accompanied with tears by the fiancée ’ s most sensible mother
0	well , remarked bazarov , those are fair conditions
0	you were a cardsharp ?
0	now i ’ ll wear lizaveta ’ s cross , and this one is for you
0	and if only fate had sent him remorse—burning remorse , crushing the heart , banishing sleep , to escape from which men dream of the noose or the maelstrom !
0	raskolnikov hadn ’ t managed to discern that at first
0	by this summons , raskolnikov managed to explain
0	after all , could there have been other ones , sir ?
0	'turgenev ' , he said to the novelist 's friend annenkov , 'should be ashamed of lowering the flag before a radical , or saluting him as an honourable soldier
0	nikolai petrovich jumped up and fixed his gaze on the road
0	preaching is an illness , a hunger , a desire ; a healthy person can not be a prophet or even a preacher
0	this is how i ’ d have behaved , began raskolnikov , once again suddenly drawing his face close to zametov ’ s , staring intently at him again , and whispering once more , so that this time zametov even shuddered
0	that ’ s so , isn ’ t it ?
0	she was killed with an axe
0	you knew my character ; you wanted to drive me into a fury and then suddenly startle me with priests and deputies
0	yea , lord : i believe that thou art the christ , the son of god , which should come into the world
0	we will see each other again soon , father , really
0	don ’ t mention that ; it hasn ’ t happened in petersburg ; the devil take it !
0	both had stated their positions earlier in different ways , but the direct confrontation between them in had all the features of a quarrel
0	but the point is that this is not just his personal ideal , but the ideal that was cherished by the young generation before turgenev 's bazarov and after him and which was embodied , not only by various characters in stories and novels , but also by real people who endeavored to base their actions and words on bazarovism
0	there was a burst of laughter and even some cursing
0	he managed to force him to take the glass of water in his hand
0	but the thirst for activity has reached the final , extreme point in him
0	she wanted to ask if at least his landlady was home , but she didn ’ t say anything
0	only the heart is necessary , the ability to sacrifice one 's egoism—one can not even speak of a calling here ( not to mention mr v d s decoration )
0	from the lack of restraint in their mode of address , bazarov observed to arkady ,
0	he didn ’ t meet any passersby or cabs along the prospect
0	no one will accuse you of having the intention or of complicity , especially since it was you who discovered the banknote by turning her pockets inside out , which means you had no idea of it beforehand
0	it was apparent that she was deeply moved , that she very much wanted to express something , to say something , to defend katerina
0	she could concede a great deal , agree to many things , even those that contradicted her convictions , but there was always a limit to her honesty , her rules , and her deepest convictions that no circumstances would ever force her to cross
0	all this isn ’ t the point
0	but what am i thinking ?
0	of course , he was late for the funeral , but he would get there in time for the wake , and there , right now , he would see sonya
0	jesus saith unto her , i am the resurrection and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live
0	but he scraped up some dirt and pressed it around the bottom of the block with his foot
0	he killed to rob them , and he did so ; he took the money and several items
0	you know , avdotya romanovna , you ’ re terribly like your brother in all sorts of ways !
0	however , it ’ s horrid to have to explain all this
0	the process of these thoughts remains in the shadows ; i doubt whether turgenev was in a position to render the description of this process : in order to portray it , he would have had to live through it in his own head , he would have had to himself become bazarov , but we can be sure that this did not happen to turgenev , because anyone who had even once , even for a few minutes , looked at things through bazarov 's eyes would have remained a nihilist for the rest of his life
0	i want to work , so please do not disturb me
0	he picked up his candle in annoyance to go out and find that ragged fellow , no matter what , and get out of there as soon as possible
0	and how did he throw it ?
0	meanwhile , at the time he ’ d proposed to dunya , he ’ d been completely convinced of the absurdity of all the rumors , which had been publicly refuted by marfa petrovna herself and long since discarded by the entire town , which had vindicated dunya
0	the officer asked with a laugh
0	he started up the stairs on this hunch
0	or or i dare not go on
0	the exchanges between him and pyotr stepanovich about the forthcoming revolution are a delight : pyotr stepanovich picked up his hat and rose to his feet
0	were you out of your mind when you signed it ?
0	for a minute or so he stared at her expressive and sickly little face ; then he kissed the portrait and handed it to dunya
0	why not say it ?
0	katerina ivanovna began laughing hysterically
0	as if i have made extensive preparations !
0	he , too , repeated bazarov with a humble bow
0	the noise coming from behind the door suddenly increased , and the door opened slightly
0	svidrigaylov stared into raskolnikov ’ s eyes and all of a sudden , after a short pause , lowered his voice and asked :
0	bazarov , in this passage , sees himself amidst red dogs : but in a position radically different from his earlier stature as hunter ( okhotnik )
0	suddenly he removed his arm , turned away , walked rapidly to the window , and stood in front of it
0	well , and then what ?
0	he took items worth ten or twenty rubles , stuffed them into his pocket , searched around in the old woman ’ s trunk , among her clothes—but later , in her dresser , in a box in the top drawer , they find fifteen hundred rubles in cash , plus some notes !
0	that is to say , they ought to be reduced to a state of exhaustion by the constant repetition of one and the same words ) ; and yet , to tell the truth , he does not give complete satisfaction either to the refined gentry , who talk with chic or with melancholy of the emancipation ( pronouncing it as though it were french ) , nor to the uncultivated gentry , who unceremoniously curse tha ' amuncipation
0	that 's all i care about
0	it was polyenka ; she was running after him and calling to him , wait !
0	has he had anything to eat ?
0	'that 's not our business first one must clear the ground
0	but how to end it ?
0	you see what i am doing : it turns out there 's empty space in my suitcase and i am stuffing hay into it
0	the fact that i came ?
0	the outlook of the woman-as-nihilist has been differentiated here from that of the woman-as-radical whom we shall encounter in the following chapter
0	it was not at all clear how that certificate of merit had suddenly turned up in her hands , the one that the late marmeladov had mentioned to raskolnikov , explaining to him in the tavern that katerina ivanovna , his wife , had done the shawl dance in the presence of the governor and other distinguished people at the institute graduation ball
0	although , this isn ’ t the way it ’ s done
0	i bet you will !
0	it would be another matter if there were witnesses here ; but we ’ re all alone , whispering to each other
0	at first bazarov stirred in his bed , then replied , my boy , i can see you are still a fool
0	you know , i won ’ t go see porfiry ; i ’ m fed up with him
0	and what am i to believe in ?
0	last year , there was one moment when
0	- ; martin malia , alexander herzen and the birth of russian socialism , j-j
0	i ’ m even glad other people are here
0	you have not forgotten your german ?
0	all because of me !
0	the head clerk , however , interested him greatly : he tried to guess something about him from his face , to penetrate to his core
0	i was not playing , arkady began and then fell silent
0	i let the chance slip by !
0	if they ’ d had that brainless idea , they ’ d have tried with all their might to conceal it and hide their cards so they could catch you afterward
0	marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dunechka in the garden
0	but it was clever of me to bring up the idea of the apartment : it ’ ll be useful later on !
0	they consider him a suspect in the murder !
0	i won ’ t go simply on principle , so as not to participate in this vile superstition , that ’ s what !
0	once for some reason they lingered quite a while ; nikolai petrovich went out to meet them in the garden and , upon approaching the arbor , suddenly overheard the rapid footsteps and voices of the two young men
0	true life is not lived where great external changes take
0	it would not be a bad idea to have something to eat , observed bazarov , stretching himself and sinking down on the sofa
0	but the lesson , the lesson you gave him today at the crystal palace ’ was beyond perfection !
0	and the consultation began
0	the point was that he ’ d also found out that among the invited guests would be raskolnikov
0	bazarov 's role as unmasker is here jovial , masculine , insinuating—but it is a frivolous rehearsal of more serious destruction
0	some demanded payment of their accounts or an increase ; others left , even after receiving their wages in advance ; horses fell ill ; harnesses were worn out in no time at all ; tasks were performed carelessly ; the threshing machine ordered from moscow turned out to be useless because of its enormous weight ; another machine was ruined the very first time it was used ; half the cattle shed burned down
0	and yet what richness of simple human feeling !
0	i read his journal article about people to whom everything is permitted
0	bazarov scents an enemy , and takes deliberate pleasure in describing himself and his allies as 'nihilists ' , by which he means no more than that he , copyright ® isaiah berlin , first published by oxford university press
0	my children have remained with their aunt ; they ’ re well off , and they don ’ t need me at all
0	he suddenly cried inadvertently
0	there must be more to it
0	to hell with it !
0	odintsova summoned an elderly aunt to live with them and reconciled herself to a wasted life
0	if he weren ’ t still lying there in a real fever , then perhaps it was precisely because this constant inner anxiety was keeping him on his feet for the time being and aware , at least artificially
0	it ’ s all so stupid , even loathsome to a person who has nothing to do with it !
0	i swore that i wouldn ’ t argue !
0	you seem to be trying to infuriate me on purpose , so that i ’ ll leave you alone
0	all these rumors reached her , but perhaps an unwanted pregnancy
0	what a splendid man !
0	bazarov left and arkady was overcome by a joyous feeling
0	if he hasn ’ t said so up to now , naturally it ’ s because that ’ s what he intends even without words ; but i ’ ll refuse
0	the sound of horses ' hooves rang out along the road a peasant appeared from behind some trees
0	this unfortunate lizaveta was so simple , so helpless , and so terrified once and for all , that she didn ’ t even raise her arms to protect her face , although that would have been the most necessary and natural gesture at that moment , because the axe was raised right above her face
0	and , as luck would have it , the peasants they passed were all in tatters and riding pathetic nags ; the roadside willows stood , bark torn and branches broken , like beggars in rags ; emaciated , shaggy cows , mere bags of bones , gnawed greedily on the grass growing along ditches
0	but true patriotism has nothing in common with this arrogant , conceited aloofness which leads only to self-deception , ignorance and irremediable errors
0	have you by any chance read livingstone ’ s journal ? †
0	and what will become of them ?
0	of course , that ’ s how it must be
0	not a thing , brother ; hello !
0	brother , think about what you ’ re saying !
0	by the way , he must have served in the military
0	why , there 's the peasant commune , for example
0	she read it with great interest and even read some passages aloud to us : and that was her entire education
0	you know , he 's only about thirty versts from
0	what do you mean , decided ’ ?
0	a swarthy warrior wearing a helmet and reclining in the foreground was particularly noteworthy for his rounded contours
0	rodya , rodya , you ’ re not going now , are you ?
0	i prepared it before
0	you ’ ve probably come from katerina ivanovna
0	we could even sing marlborough s ’ en va-t-en guerre , # since it ’ s a genuine children ’ s song and is sung in all aristocratic homes when they ’ re putting the children to sleep :
0	'these two representatives of two utterly opposed schools of thought were manifestly in accord on one point , morally linked for an instant by a common sorrow , by a very sincere and poignant grief at finally parting with a compatriot whom both alike could admire and esteem
0	this was organized with the civil servant ’ s efforts ; even the policeman helped carry katerina ivanovna
0	bazarov is the rare example of a turgenev character who lacks not only a pre-history , but to whom the writer never applies introspection ( ie , an authorial explanation and testing of his subjective world ) at those points where bazarov 's position—his past and future—is in question ( yet such introspection is applied to his experience of love !
0	it was his first endeavor , i tell you , his first
0	the doctor ’ s more useful , much more
0	bazarov did not get up at all that day and spent the whole night in a heavy , semiconscious torpor
0	not in the least !
0	you say he 's not indifferent to me , and it 's always seemed to me that he liked me
0	in our territory , began porfiry , extending both hands to him
0	after this first meeting with odintsov , bazarov endeavors to speak of her in his former jocular tone , but the very cynicism of his expressions belies an involuntary , repressed respect
0	it ’ s obvious , ob-vi-ous that something ’ s not right here , cried the young man , and he set off down the stairs at a run
0	† sonya reads from and recites verses from the gospel of john : –
0	raskolnikov continued examining him in silence
0	she was sitting on a bench , wearing a white kerchief on her head as usual ; next to her lay a large heap of red and white roses still wet from the dew
0	what symptoms of infection , evgeny ?
0	well , handsome or not , observed vasily ivanovich , still a man , as they say , ommfay
0	for people without exceedingly vivid imaginations , these wistful upward looks do not make the tea any tastier
0	it is not creation
0	here ’ s what you consider most important : is the man spending the money or not ?
0	he will continue to ask the question until he dies , and his preoccupation , usually just below the surface though sometimes bursting forth in bitter outrage , will be expressed in the imagery of disease or death , which first enters his consciousness and conversation in the moment we have witnessed : a splendid body !
0	she , with the help of some money left to her by svidrigaylov , had long ago planned and been preparing herself to follow the band of convicts in which he would also be sent into exile
0	as he left , raskolnikov managed to shove his hand into his pocket , grab the change left from the ruble he ’ d cashed at the tavern , and place it on the windowsill unobserved
0	an almost cheerful katerina ivanovna whispered to raskolnikov again
0	the last twenty-five pages are of an incomparable elevation and intensity , worthy of tolstoy and dostoevsky , and in some respects , particularly in their blend of tragic power and a mute underlying sweetness , superior to them
0	when zosimov , having pointed to him , had said , there ’ s raskolnikov , he ’ d suddenly and quickly raised himself , as if jumping up , and sat on the edge of his bed ; in an almost challenging voice , but also faltering and faint , he said :
0	well , sir , i ’ m at your service
0	to vasilievsky island , i ’ m going to razumikhin , that ’ s where , right now
0	mikolka stands on one side and begins to strike her back for no reason
0	and , without extending his hand , he left him
0	if you ’ d seen it , you might have given away the money , too
0	then i had dinner and went to see porfiry
0	it ’ s when it has no way of getting out and it ’ s trying to clog your liver ; you begin seeing things
0	just so , i have to , he replied vaguely , as if hesitating in what he really wanted to say
0	nikodim fomich was talking heatedly to ilya petrovich , and some of their words reached his ears :
0	he was a close friend of turgenev 's [ editor ]
0	now she was no longer hiding ; both her eyes were open wide : they enveloped him with a fiery and shameless look , they beckoned him , laughing
0	even if mr luzhin were made of the purest gold or solid diamond , even then she wouldn ’ t agree to become mr luzhin ’ s legal concubine !
0	i know this , ma ’ am
0	your career is a scholarly one , and you won ’ t be dislodged by failures !
0	but when he reached konnogvardeisky boulevard , where two days ago he had encountered that young woman , his laughter suddenly vanished
0	sonechka was embarrassed , and bowed somewhat hastily and fearfully , even with some painful sensation reflected in her face , as if she found avdotya romanovna ’ s politeness and thoughtfulness burdensome and distressing
0	give me that bundle , nastenka
0	forgive me that i began speaking of it ; i think about it all the time , and i can ’ t sleep at night
0	zametov remarked , then paused , as if suddenly struck by a thought that passed through his mind like a bolt of lightning
0	you ’ re a reasonable man
0	did you really doubt that ?
0	he and they regarded each other with distrust and hostility
0	mitrei hadn ’ t seen him since and was finishin ’ up the work alone
0	i have received a pleasant letter from maykov and will answer him
0	after seeing , began the tradesman , that the caretakers wouldn ’ t listen to me and go to the police , because , they said , it was already too late , and perhaps he ’ d get angry that they hadn ’ t come right away , i felt irritated and couldn ’ t sleep , and i started to make inquiries
0	someone behind her spat out
0	for the last hour and a half they had vied with each other in interrogating nastasya , who was still standing before them and had already managed to tell them all there was to know
0	after returning from the haymarket , he threw himself down on his sofa and sat there motionless for a whole hour
0	oh , evgeny , do not say things like that !
0	suddenly , far off , about two hundred steps away , at the end of the street , in the thickening darkness , he made out a crowd , voices , shouting
0	if the earrings , which turned up in nikolai ’ s hands on that very day and at that time , really constitute the most important factual evidence against him—though perfectly explicable according to his own testimony , consequently , still disputable evidence—then one must consider the exculpatory evidence , all the more so since there are irresistible facts
0	twenty years bazarov 's idols too will be replaced
0	the thought alone offends them ; they brush away the truth until the person they ’ ve so embellished rubs their noses in it with his own hands
0	however , he sometimes asked permission to be present at bazarov 's experiments , and once even brought his sweet-smelling face , washed with the finest of soaps , close to the microscope to see how transparent infusoria swallow green specks of dust and carefully chew them using some very efficient little devices in their throat
0	she cried , throwing up her hands
0	one extremely insignificant circumstance landed him in an impasse , even before he went down the stairs
0	take an axe to ’ er , that ’ s what !
0	another bird flown the coop ’ !
0	evgeny , you will take my study , of course
0	i shall endeavor to organize this material and , if i succeed , i shall explain why our old people will not come to terms with us , why they shake their heads and , depending on the individual and the mood , are angry , bewildered , or quietly melancholy on account of our deeds and ideas
0	she read his article over and over , even read it aloud sometimes , practically slept with it ; still , she hardly inquired as to where exactly rodya was now , in spite of the fact they were obviously avoiding that subject with her—that fact alone should have aroused her suspicions
0	nothing could correspond so well as this to the simplicity and straight forwardness of the view bazarov professes
0	and , setting aside all vanity , it also seems to me that they are farther from the truth than we are ; but at the same time , i feel they have something we lack , some advantage over us youth ?
0	she thought , lying in her magnificent bed on lace cushions under a light silk coverlet anna sergeevna had inherited from her father a share of his penchant for luxury
0	in addition , raskolnikov ’ s long-standing hypochondria was precisely affirmed by many witnesses , including dr zosimov , his former university colleagues , his landlady , and her servant
0	you must stay a while : it really is not too bad here
0	i bet you suppose that i ’ m now trying to worm myself into your good graces !
0	open that window it 's stuffy in here
0	there is no occupation , no love—consequently , there is no pleasure either
0	even when you were living at home ?
0	finding in turgenev merely beauty , it is inevitable that mirsky concludes by saying , we do not seek wisdom [ in turgenev ]
0	but from what i know now , i clearly see that i can ’ t understand a thing ; please , don ’ t think i came to interrogate you
0	how should i know if they ’ re broke or not ?
0	she ’ s an absolutely extraordinary character , absolutely !
0	what scientific means in his value system can be gathered from its opposite , the set of conventions and beliefs bazarov castigates as romantic : romantic means puskin , it means literature , it means metaphors
0	but i have not been here for some time
0	he listened in inexpressible agitation as this man , who had seen right through him , disavowed his own words
0	why , there 's someone over there
0	he even chuckled to himself , as another distressing idea suddenly rushed into his head
0	evdoksiya rolled a cigarette with her tobacco-stained fingers , licked the edge of it with her tongue , sucked on it , and then lit it
0	why do you like apples ? —also by virtue of our sensations
0	has this house been here long ?
0	turgenev , in other words , is the literary equivalent of the proverbial dumb blonde
0	judging from that remark , one can really suppose that you were counting on our helplessness , dunya observed irritably
0	i ’ ve already mentioned that petr petrovich is now heading to petersburg
0	well , you should know that i feel no love for her now , none at all ; i even think it strange that i experienced something before
0	how could we have done without that ?
0	this was relief from another , more somber and gloomy feeling , one he himself was unable to define in all its force
0	what kind of music do you prefer ?
0	and roared as loud as he could , pointing his finger at him—the young man suddenly stopped and violently grabbed his own hat
0	and three days later , as the friends are driving to odintsova 's estate : 'congratulate me , bazarov suddenly exclaimed , 'today is june nd , my guardian angel 's day
0	forty years later , in his famous 'poem in prose ' entitled porog ( on the threshold ) , which for prince peter kropotkin was an expression of tur-genev 's 'admiration of those women who gave their lives for the revolutionary movement ' , he celebrated the self-sacrifice of the russian girl who stands on the threshold of a life devoted to revolutionary endeavour , faces the consequences and yet decides to cross the threshold :
0	und zis nein respectable guest , herr kapitän , makes ze big shkandal !
0	that ’ s not exactly what i was talking about , petr petrovich , dunya interrupted with some impatience
0	ah , hello , old man , cried bazarov
0	to p v annenkov
0	but he wasn ’ t destined to reach the islands , either : something else occurred
0	in some drunkards this habit becomes a necessity , primarily among those who receive harsh treatment at home and who are ordered about
0	someone else in his place , for example , would have been a constant drag on his parents
0	did i want to abuse bazarov or to extol him ?
0	katerina ivanovna went to the window , leaned her head against the frame , and cried desperately :
0	well , if it ’ s siberia—he ’ ll go and i suppose that you ’ ll follow him
0	of course , they ’ ll be talking about family matters
0	oh , you stupid girl !
0	in the ranks of bazarov 's admirers there will undoubtedly be those who will be enraptured by his coarse manners , the vestiges of student life , who will imitate these manners , which are , in any case , a shortcoming and not a virtue , who will perhaps even exaggerate his harshness , gracelessness , and abruptness
0	raskolnikov asked clumsily , trying hard to look him in the eye ; but he was unable to endure it and suddenly added , i asked only because there were probably many people who ’ d pawned things
0	he stood on the stairs for some time and watched grimly as his friend walked off quickly in the direction of his street
0	there ’ s no hurry , there ’ s plenty of time , sir , and all this is mere nonsense , sir !
0	she cried suddenly , her eyes flashing
0	he couldn ’ t recall a thing : was he really thinking about anything at that time ?
0	they were both still wearing their costumes : he in his turban and she in her nightcap with the ostrich feather
0	his heart was pounding , and his thoughts were violently agitated
0	i don ’ t understand you very well
0	he slammed the top of the case shut and stood up from the floor
0	an awakened fly suddenly bumped into the windowpane and began buzzing plaintively
0	she says that it would be better , that is , not exactly better , but for some reason it would be absolutely necessary that rodya also deliberately come today at eight o ’ clock and that they meet without fail
0	do you know what zosimov whispered to me just now as we were leaving ?
0	what do you mean , 'why ' ?
0	then they turned her loose onto the street
0	—which are not science at all , but journalism , materialist propaganda
0	what does she want ?
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna suddenly let drop
0	bazarov is not only an empiricist , he is also an uncouth rowdy in the ranks of youth likes to express itself in various extravagant conceits and to strike the imagination with infinitely large images
0	pavel petrovich twitched his mustache
0	he was tormented by something else , much more important , extraordinary—about himself and no one else , but something different , something major
0	but it was impossible to be in any other relationship with razumikhin
0	i ’ ll take you there , it ’ s true , and i ’ ll show you my fiancée , but not now ; you ’ ll have to leave soon
0	it says something for the vitality of his creation that the debate did not die even in the following century , neither before nor after the russian revolution
0	what was the cause of it , for god 's sake ?
0	this is what one critic writes , reviewing the latest translation that appeared in riga ( [ ? ]
0	it would have been better if you ’ d come tomorrow !
0	and just where have you been spending your time ?
0	will we find him at home ?
0	but what do you think , is she , in fact— oh ho ho !
0	the contemporary will probably treat me with contempt because of bazarov and will not believe that during the whole time i was writing i was involuntarily attracted to him
0	we ’ re friends now ; we see each other almost every day
0	at least she fully restored dunechka ’ s honor
0	do i love her ?
0	or what about one for the road ? —and , after consuming one for the road , he did not spare the horses
0	yellowish , dirty , worn wallpaper was blackened in all the corners ; it must have been damp and smoky during the winter
0	his mother ’ s face glowed with ecstasy and happiness at the sight of this definitive , nonverbal reconciliation between brother and sister
0	perhaps you ’ ll hear my name sometime
0	did you go out yesterday ?
0	the sickly romanticism and sentimentality are gone
0	he might not even have foreseen the obstacles he ’ d encounter !
0	she was very devout and emotional , believing in all sorts of omens , fortune-telling , charms , and dreams ; she believed in holy fools , house spirits , forest spirits , unlucky meetings , the evil eye , folk remedies , maundy salt , and the imminent end of the world ; she believed that if on easter sunday the candles did not go out during the midnight service , there would be a good buckwheat harvest , and if a person looked at a mushroom , it would not grow any bigger ; she believed the devil liked to be near water , and that every jew carried a bloodstain on his chest ; she was afraid of mice , snakes , frogs , sparrows , leeches , thunder , cold water , drafts of air , horses , goats , redheaded people , and black cats ; she regarded crickets and dogs as unclean animals ; she did not eat veal , pigeon , crayfish , cheese , asparagus , artichokes , rabbit , or watermelon because a cut watermelon reminded her of the head of john the baptist ; and she could not mention oysters without shuddering
0	st petersburg is situated along the shores of the neva bay of the gulf of finland and on islands in the river delta
0	but i didn ’ t want to give them to her
0	you sent for them !
0	† russians often sweeten their tea by placing a lump of sugar between their teeth and drinking tea through it
0	so my brother just dropped in on you ?
0	after our conversation i reread pisarev 's article on bazarov , which i had completely forgotten , and i am very glad of it ; that is , not that i had forgotten it , but that i reread it
0	both fathers and sons believe in great deeds , they merely disagree about what deeds are great
0	it was still light , but evening was already setting in
0	ah , what shameful things occur nowadays in this world , oh lord !
0	well , let ’ s get down to business !
0	you were able to do it
0	petr petrovich asked , turning to zosimov
0	that dog 's in here again , the old woman muttered in reply
0	good lord , what is it ?
0	your prayer , perhaps , will be heard
0	katerina ivanovna rushed to lebezyatnikov
0	we thought you ’ d definitely come
0	he paused on each landing and looked around with curiosity
0	he did , no doubt , adopt a different tone in writing to different correspondents
0	he was an unusually cheerful and sociable fellow , good-natured to the point of innocence
0	he will be delighted , of course !
0	we ’ re heading for nevsky prospect
0	bazarov 's brief meeting with the radicals is a fine bit of horseplay , their emptyheaded chatter being matched only by his declaration , as preposterous as it is pathetic : i do not adopt anyone 's ideas ; i have my own
0	the peasant tugged at the reins
0	sofiya semyonovna was trying their mourning clothes on them
0	we must live while we are alive , eat dry bread if there is no roast beef , know many women if it is not possible to love a woman , and , in general , we must not dream about orange trees and palms , when under foot are snowdrifts and the cold tundra
0	katya gave arkady a bright and serious look and , after a long pause for thought , with scarcely a smile , said , yes
0	by the way , do you like schiller ?
0	he cried , clenching his fists and laughing , his lips foaming with rage
0	evgeny vasilich , why are you
0	but just you try to deal with passions , sir , passions , because even an examining magistrate is a human being , sir
0	who , who on earth would ever think of searching under that stone ?
0	it seems that he wants to take some sort of exam , but only to talk and brag about it here , that ’ s all there was to it
0	nature 's not a temple , but a workshop where man 's the laborer
0	we knew them , sir , and i begin worryin ’ about them earrin ’ s because we knew that the dead woman lent money for pledges
0	bazarov came in to see him around eight o'clock the next morning
0	what must we do ?
0	it ’ s better that way
0	i had been abroad before and had always found it sickening
0	said his mother , overjoyed
0	anna sergeevna did not want to get in the young couple 's way , and it was only out of a sense of propriety that she did not leave them alone for too long
0	no , i will stick around for a while yet
0	be careful , remarked anna sergeevna , porfiry platonych and i will beat you
0	if this whole affair was carried out consciously , and not in some foolish manner , if i really had a definite and definitive goal , then how is it that up to this point i didn ’ t even peek into the purse and don ’ t know how much i ’ ve taken ?
0	let me alone , i ’ ll do it myself , raskolnikov said ; he took the pen and signed the book
0	well , what do you think , is she— ooh là là , or not ?
0	she also had the habit of not listening to what other people said
0	i maintain a negative attitude , he says , by virtue of my sensations ; i like to deny—my brain 's made on that plan , and that 's all !
0	of course you do
0	here—it was either her road or his
0	but , after a very short spell of such marital bliss , marya suddenly died
0	arkady felt sad at having to part from her : he had so enjoyed spending nearly an hour with her !
0	soon dunya was invited to give lessons in several households , but she refused
0	git in , i ’ ll take ya all !
0	well then , am i being open with you or not ?
0	people are obsessed with debauchery
0	i didn ’ t exchange a word with zametov
0	the door to the larger room could be locked ; svidrigaylov felt at home in this little room and may have spent entire days in it
0	at sonya ’ s entrance razumikhin , who was seated on one of raskolnikov ’ s three chairs , at once stood up next to the door to let her pass
0	but now i have come to know him better and am convinced he 's clever the main thing is , he 's young , so young not like you and me , evgeny vasilich
0	it ’ s astonishing that he ’ s come to , the doctor whispered softly to raskolnikov
0	she erupted in a spell of coughing
0	but dunya and her husband could derive little joy from this news , especially at the beginning
0	are you acquainted with her ?
0	there was no doubt that she was dead
0	the country road that ran past the tavern was always so dusty and black
0	for the moment , that ’ s quite unnecessary
0	but i am surprised that up to now you have not found what you are looking for
0	but he didn ’ t heed it and began listening at the door to the old woman ’ s apartment : dead silence
0	he won ’ t understand anything , not one thing !
0	he had a rather soft heart , but his speech was self-assured , and at times even extremely arrogant—which , when compared to his slight figure , almost always appeared comical
0	nothing at present , most esteemed sir , replied bazarov
0	you know something , katerina sergeevna ?
0	but now , am i happy now ?
0	isn ’ t it terrible that you live in this filth that you despise and , at the same time , you yourself know ( all you have to do is open your eyes ) that you ’ re not helping anyone and not saving anyone from anything !
0	[ the contemporary was a leading periodical , in which the ideas repeated by bazarov appeared—
0	if i leave a particular gentleman all alone : if i don ’ t arrest him and don ’ t disturb him , but if he knows at every hour and every minute , or at least if he suspects , that i know everything , all there is to know , and that i ’ m following him day and night , watching him constantly , and if he feels the weight of my conscious suspicion and fear , well then , he ’ s absolutely certain to lose his head
0	nothing much : tea , vodka , and herring
0	is he a writer , then ?
0	two or three customers were drinking tea , and in one distant room a group of four was sitting , sipping champagne
0	also in the prison were some exiled poles , political prisoners
0	he sat down at the green card table , an expression of moderate satisfaction on his face , and ended up winning two rubles fifty copecks in paper money from bazarov : in arina vlasevna 's house there was no notion whatever of reckoning in silver
0	replied dunya , affectionately and awkwardly turning to him
0	meanwhile , he ’ d very much like and is hoping to arrange a meeting with you , dunya , and he ’ s asked me to serve as an intermediary
0	she was an extremely quarrelsome and disorderly german woman
0	pavel petrovich shuddered slightly and grabbed his thigh
0	let me have something to drink
0	you will agree , pavel petrovich , our duel is so unusual as to be ridiculous ?
0	both kotlyarevsky ( kanun , ) and koni ( peterburg , ) date the appearance of the new women in public at the beginning of the 's
0	besides , you and i are antiquated people
0	for some time they measured each other with their glances
0	his flabby , wrinkled face indicated that he was over fifty ; his small , swollen eyes looked grim , stern , and discontented
0	you are a good fellow , but , all the same , you are nothing but a soft , beautifully bred , liberal boy
0	i am saying plainly that you and i behaved very foolishly
0	vasily ivanovich said , raising his hand in military salute to the greasy skullcap covering his head
0	katerina ivanovna nodded at the landlady
0	passing the yusupov garden , he was about to consider the idea of placing tall fountains there , thinking how well they would refresh the air in all the squares
0	pavel petrovich took his walking stick
0	mama , he said firmly and insistently , this is sofiya semyonovna marmeladova , the daughter of that unfortunate mr marmeladov who was run over by horses yesterday before my very eyes and about whom i told you already
0	but this heteroglossia , as we have said , is also diffused throughout the authorial speech that surrounds the characters , creating highly particularized character zones [ zony geroev ]
0	the road to the right led into town , and from there toward home ; the road to the left led to odintsova 's
0	another terrible minute passed
0	but this question is not obsessive ; rather it provides a transition to the one consideration which can make the question of when
0	she kept losing blood but was beginning to regain consciousness
0	let them devour each other alive—what ’ s it to me ?
0	the young man was very pleased when he didn ’ t encounter any of them and managed to slip unnoticed right through the gates and directly onto the staircase
0	why didn ’ t you ask ?
0	your papa was a state councillor and almost became a governor ; there was only one step left , so everyone came to him and said , we already think of you , ivan mikhailych , as our governor
0	dunya raised the revolver and , looking deathly pale , her lower lip blanched and trembling , regarded him with her large black eyes flashing like fire ; she was determined , measuring the distance between them , and awaiting the first move on his part
0	do you know what ?
0	even now i am not too sure i am expressing myself clearly
0	the most fully portrayed female character in the novel and the one most responsible for bazarov 's downfall from his ideological heights into the abyss of romanticism , anna odintsova , seems to be the odd one out with respect to kristeva 's scheme of temporality
0	stay here , petr petrovich , said dunya
0	i have to go
0	vasily ivanovich expressed his regret that no one had thought of seeking medical assistance sooner and declared that there was no hope of saving him
0	his shirtfront protruded from under his heavy cotton vest , all wrinkled , soiled , and stained
0	¶¶ you have the most beautiful eyes , / girl , what more do you want ?
0	razumikhin thought for a moment and ran to catch up with him
0	there have been many economic changes , zosimov observed
0	we kept urging her to calm down all the way to your doorstep
0	is he always so irritable ?
0	he raised his head
0	into a bank office with counterfeit notes , where they know all the tricks of the trade—no , i ’ d get frazzled
0	it was apparent that he had the friendliest intentions
0	i know all this now
0	we coldly and soberly regard all that surrounds us ; let us regard ourselves just as coldly and soberly ; all around us is nonsense and backwardness , but , god knows , we are far from perfect
0	i hope you will not doubt that every word in it , every letter , is true
0	today your father said he 's received an invitation from your illustrious relative
0	are you clever , lying here like a sack , with nothing to show for it ?
0	) —she spoke suddenly , then stopped and shook back her hair
0	why do you think so , why ?
0	because as far as i can tell , you have a cold , serene manner ; one must have passion to argue
0	because it takes place shortly after pavel petrovich has survived the duel with bazarov
0	the narrator feels the same way
0	please don ’ t create a disturbance
0	it seems that zosimov was afraid of something exactly like this
0	if we understand turgenev 's novel that way , then , perhaps the moral we are seeking will also be disclosed to us more clearly
0	that ’ s why i ’ m especially grateful to you , rodion romanych , that you didn ’ t disdain my hospitality , even in such circumstances , she added almost aloud
0	you remember her , laviza ivanovna ?
0	raskolnikov awoke in a sweat , his hair drenched from perspiration ; he was panting and raised himself up on his elbows in horror
0	it had been established by sonya , who faithfully wrote letters each month to petersburg , addressed to razumikhin , and she faithfully received a reply back from petersburg each month
0	in particular he emphasized the fathers ' activity in publishing , at home and abroad , and their salutary effect on social development in russia
0	polya , lyonya , kolya , come here
0	was it you i didn ’ t recognize when i was delirious ?
0	† porokh = gunpowder , hence the lieutenant ’ s nickname
0	ah , arkadi , do me a favor , let 's have a fight , a real fight , till we are laid out in our coffins , till we destroy each other
0	but no one had noticed him , and he didn ’ t happen to run into anyone
0	can i really , really
0	there may be something to it
0	well then , are you afraid of the bourgeois shame ?
0	well then , when you were composing your little article—could it possibly be the case , heh-heh , that you might also have considered yourself , even the tiniest bit , to be an extraordinary ’ man uttering some new word , in the sense that you ’ re using it
0	marmeladov was in his last agony
0	however , you know my opinions in general ; i don ’ t blame anyone definitively
0	at some points in his description of fenichka , arkady , and katya , he seems not only to admire those values but even to be jealous of them
0	well , didn ’ t i say that there was a common bond between us , eh ?
0	two kinds of love are debated in fathers and sons
0	sonya rushed to the door in a fright
0	raskolnikov didn ’ t learn about his mother ’ s death for a long time , although a correspondence with petersburg was instituted at the very beginning of his exile in siberia
0	then i acted stupidly again
0	after finding out everything yesterday , i went today
0	he says to the boy
0	from their simple hearts there seem to be torn infinitely sad hymns , some sort of limitlessly deep and tender outcries that irresistibly touch the soul
0	that awaits us there is covered in mist
0	or else , i also began to think
0	everything ’ s been said and forgiven
0	i was counting on your character at the time , rodion romanych , on your character most of all , sir !
0	is it you saying this , pavel ?
0	think and analyze superstitions and authorities are shattered and their world view becomes completely devoid of various illusory notions
0	he asked , as if annoyed
0	i don ’ t need any
0	we saw , they said , that the apartment was open , and that someone must have been working there , but in passing we didn ’ t pay any attention and don ’ t recall precisely whether there were workers inside at the time
0	well , only because avdotya romanovna herself , voluntarily , was the one to choose him
0	of course , even if he ’ d had to wait years for a convenient opportunity , even then , having a plan , it would most likely have been impossible to reckon on a more apparent step toward fulfilling his plan than that which had suddenly been presented now
0	a healthy person , naturally , has no need to see them because he ’ s primarily a being of this earth ; therefore , he must live only his earthly life , for fullness ’ sake and for orderliness
0	( raskolnikov had made no such remark )
0	but more than anything else on earth , he loved and treasured his own money , earned by his hard work and other means : it made him the equal of everything above him
0	true , all this is obscure ; the testimony came from another german lady , an inveterate liar whose word had no credibility ; finally , in the end , no formal charge was brought , thanks to marfa petrovna ’ s efforts and money ; it was all limited to rumors
0	he was absolutely convinced that at that time he had been wrong about many things , for example , the time and sequence of several events
0	raskolnikov ’ s motionless and serious face was transformed in one moment , and he suddenly burst into the same nervous laughter as before , as if he were absolutely unable to restrain himself
0	raskolnikov got very angry ; he suddenly wanted to insult this fat dandy
0	if you ’ d conceived of another theory , you might even have done something a hundred million times worse !
0	i should think not !
0	i ’ ve been watching you : what a busybody you are , remarked zosimov
0	right here on my finger
0	said it in an impartial way
0	in a few moments of condescension or irritation or even unkindness by the sons , in nikolai kirsanov 's hour of melancholy in the garden , in the disappointment of bazarov 's parents that his visit is so short
0	some burden seemed to have been lifted at once from his heart ; perhaps it wasn ’ t merely the fear of death ; it ’ s doubtful he felt it at that moment
0	you won ’ t admit it even if you really believe that miracles occur
0	how outrageous it is !
0	he listened intently , gloomily , and broodingly , leaning forward at the entrance , glancing curiously from the sidewalk into the room
0	with his grand manner of offering his cheek to be kissed , his fussy concern for his manuscript amerci ' and his self-proclaimed loyalty to everything german , karmazinov emerged as an attitudinizing , self-important littérateur who set great store by his reputation as the confidant of youth
0	porfiry also wants to make your acquaintance
0	no , there wasn ’ t
0	how , for example , your failure yesterday upsets you , exclaimed the tenderhearted andrey semyonych , once again feeling more strongly disposed to petr petrovich
0	in the final analysis turgenev could neither condemn nor yet wholly redeem bazarov without falsifying or diminishing the portrait
0	the iron plate had been added to give the pledge weight , so that at first the old woman wouldn ’ t guess that the object was made of wood
0	observing her , he noticed how pensive and distracted she was
0	he shook his boot off his foot
0	i ’ m very tired : it would be good to lie down or sit down somewhere soon !
0	do you have any cigarettes ?
0	then in your opinion there 's no difference between a stupid person and a clever one , between a good person and a bad one ?
0	it was impossible to find even one speck of dust in the whole place
0	service in approaching the nihilists and so forth
0	yes , sir , very good , sir
0	he becomes angry and sour because of his failure , it annoys him to think that happiness beckoned to him but then passed on and it annoys him to feel that this event has made an impression on him
0	no , you can tell them to take the samovar away , nikolai petrovich replied and stood up to meet her
0	the road to town does not pass anywhere near here
0	well , perhaps i am
0	the bright yellow wooden houses with their closed shutters looked glum and dirty
0	marfa petrovna made the arrangement a week before she died , and it was in my presence
0	a moment later , lebezyatnikov appeared on the threshold ; he didn ’ t enter the room , but paused , also with some particular curiosity , almost in astonishment ; he listened , though for a long time seemed not to understand anything
0	cried pavel petrovich ; he was positively unable to restrain himself any longer
0	it may be a good thing that he considers me almost insane , thought raskolnikov
0	well , any money for shoes or anything else , she ’ s purchased jamaican rum and even , it seems , madeira , and—and—and coffee
0	but here someone at the other end of the table suddenly started chuckling
0	but what ’ s it to you ?
0	i would rather go to my friend porokh : i ’ ll really surprise him , produce quite the effect on him
0	i beg you to think about what you ’ re saying , katerina ivanovna began haughtily ( she always employed a haughty tone of voice when she spoke with the landlady , so that she would remember her place , and even now she could not deny herself that pleasure )
0	# good-bye , my pleasure ( french )
0	and how could he decline it ?
0	and why did you try to deceive the caretakers and urge them to go to the police lieutenant ?
0	listen , razumikhin , raskolnikov began softly , apparently in complete calm
0	he went up to dunya and quietly put his arm around her waist
0	well , at least on that score you ’ ve somewhat reassured me
0	her sister , right after tea , had summoned her to the study and , after some preliminary compliments , which always frightened katya a bit , advised her to be more careful in her behavior with arkady and particularly to avoid private conversations with him , which had apparently been noticed by auntie and others in the household
0	he merely looked around with his mouth open wide , which aroused general merriment
0	buntuiushchee serdtse ne skrylos v mogile , tsvety , rastushchie na nei , bezmiatezhno gliadiat na nas svoimi nevinnymi glazami : ne ob odnom vechnom spokoistvii govoriat nam oni ,  torn velikom spokoistvii 'ravnodushnoi ' prirody ; oni govoriat takzhe 
0	these people are perhaps right in their destruction , but in their naive self-adoration or in their adoration of the type which they consider that represents , lies their limitation and one-sidedness
0	if she didn ’ t leave the room , the money must still be on her !
0	she silently raised her eyes and looked at him
0	he was just on his way home , probably drunk
0	the reasons that have prompted us
0	i ’ ll take the money and go away ; i ’ ll rent another apartment , and they ’ ll never find me !
0	but i never express my feelings in his presence because he does not like it
0	fathers and sons created in bazarov not only a general iconic image of the nihilist that immediately passed into use , he created as well an image of the extrascientific implications of physiology
0	almost an hour later , steps were heard in the corridor and there was another knock at the door
0	and , the day after tomorrow he 's giving a grand ball
0	shouldn ’ t i wait a little longer
0	you won ’ t find all that in my article ; it ’ s only hinted at there , raskolnikov said
0	+ reprinted by permission from the hudson review viii , no
0	about herself , sonya informed them that she had even been able to make several acquaintances and patrons in town ; that she ’ d found work as a seamstress , and since there were hardly any dressmakers in town , she had become essential in many houses ; but she didn ’ t mention that through her raskolnikov also received a certain amount of patronage from the authorities , that his workload was lightened , and so forth
0	where are my clothes ?
0	in the first place , it contradicts everything
0	he walked around the room , then all of a sudden approached her , hurriedly said ,
0	at last , he gestured contemptuously , entered the building , but stopped in the middle of the stairs
0	no , even better , i confess
0	common people get drunk , educated young people having nothing to do but burn with unrealizable dreams and fantasies and deform themselves with theories ; yids have flocked here from somewhere , they hoard all the money , while all the rest lead debauched lives
0	then he glanced around for the last time , crept up to the door , straightened his clothes , and adjusted the axe in its loop again
0	neuzheli liubov ' , sviataia , predannaia liubov , ne vsesil'na
0	you will find it warm here , eh ?
0	do you wish to interrogate me officially , with all the formalities ?
0	consider the case of terebeva ( who ’ s in the commune now ) ; she was criticized when she left her family and
0	she was almost entreating svidrigaylov ; she had forgotten all her fear
0	why don ’ t they moan ?
0	it suddenly became clear as day : how could it be that up to now not one person had dared or dares , while bypassing all this absurdity , simply to seize it by the tail and heave it to the devil ?
0	he had more important things on his mind
0	he should be pleased to see you , but you ’ re tormenting yourself , she added , her eyes flashing
0	i ’ ve already spent it all on drink , sir !
0	nevertheless , he still highly valued his resolve to elevate dunya to his own level and considered it a valiant feat
0	and i have bowed down
0	and now it 's back to my dogs once more
0	then , without even finishing , she threw herself at the public ; if she noticed someone who was decently dressed , she stopped to look and immediately began explaining to him , in her words , that this is what children from a respectable , one might even say aristocratic , home were reduced to
0	i have nothing to light my pipe
0	no , you won ’ t run away , rodion romanych
0	looking at zametov , he suddenly seemed to recall everything and pulled himself together
0	i do not think so
0	even the crying children quieted down
0	don ’ t pity ’ er , lads ; everyone , bring yer whips , git ready !
0	'there , i thought , 'at long last i have found a man !
0	she ’ s not even your real sister , but your half sister , and she ’ s got you under her thumb
0	don ’ t you feel sorry for her ?
0	he cried , as sonya had before
0	there ’ s no need , said raskolnikov , pushing the pen away
0	he took off his cap , put it on the table , and stood still for about ten minutes
0	you imagine you are progressive , but you are only fit to sit in some kalmuck 's cart !
0	but the meal passed rather smoothly
0	chekhov , recalled russian theater director nemirovich-danchenko in his memoirs , cried out almost in despair that russia must pay for its past , that colossal
0	not to rob or murder , don ’ t be alarmed , not for that
0	he had been wandering along the embankment of the yekaterinsky canal for about half an hour , perhaps even longer ; several times he looked at the staircases leading down to the water
0	the matter was clear
0	perhaps if herzen had been able to read kristeva 's essay on women 's time , he might have interpreted this passage somewhat differently
0	you should know that !
0	vasily ivanovich left arkady and returned to his study
0	i myself will come and ask to be crucified , for it ’ s not joy i seek , but sorrow and tears !
0	but , staring fixedly at his face , she suddenly blanched
0	katerina ivanovna shouted at him irritably
0	i can swear to that
0	he was a man already past fifty , of average height and solid build , with graying hair and a large bald spot , a yellow , even greenish face swollen by constant drunkenness , puffy eyelids under which shone , like little slits , tiny but animated small reddish eyes
0	there ’ s no need for that , sir
0	she went back home and took ill ; now she ’ s in a fever
0	ah , there ’ s my coat—they overlooked it !
0	no , rodion romanych , that dream is gone !
0	you thanked me and even shed some tears ( i ’ m relating everything as it happened in order , first , to remind you and , second , to show you that not the smallest detail has been erased from my memory )
0	for some reason he felt like chatting with everyone
0	i bow my head , since there is nothing to be done about it , but i want to say a few words in my defense , though i know how unseemly and pointless it is
0	according to his calculations , it seemed , they should have seized upon him at once
0	but with that superiority he has over those around him and as a result of their all feeling his strength , these characters themselves seek closer relations with him and involve him in a drama he did not at all want and did not even anticipate
0	i didn ’ t kill to acquire the means and power to become a benefactor of humanity
0	is this all possible ?
0	i don ’ t want raskolnikov talking about it there
0	no , i ’ m a student , the young man replied , in part surprised by the man ’ s particularly ornate speech , and by the fact that he ’ d been addressed so directly , so point-blank
0	but i ’ m not afraid of a beating
0	get up , get up !
0	and i would ’ ve thought
0	but the affair hadn ’ t begun
0	but think what you will ; now , for my part , i wish to make amends for that first impression and to prove that i ’ m a man with a heart and a conscience
0	so , i gave her my address ?
0	i ’ ll support you ; just scribble raskolnikov ’ for him ; take the pen , because , my friend , money ’ s now sweeter than syrup
0	cried katerina ivanovna ( in spite of the clear evidence ) ; she shook sonya in her arms like a child , kissing her repeatedly , catching hold of her hands and kissing them , too , almost devouring them
0	he knocked on the door ; his mother opened it
0	i must think about something else
0	divides her , so far as thought and feeling are concerned , from the husband with whom she used to fancy herself entirely in accord
0	you just astonished me , rodion romanych , though i knew before that it would be the case
0	just don ’ t talk to me as you did yesterday !
0	so , in your opinion , i seem strange ?
0	but then—that is , in the beginning of an acquaintance—as you yourself know , you ’ re always more superficial and foolish , you make mistakes and see what ’ s not there
0	yes , sir , i do wish , sir , and i will tell you definitively , sir , he continued , gently , amicably , taking raskolnikov by the arm , just above his elbow
0	you didn ’ t load it properly
0	he shouted to her from across the room
0	and there ’ s some beer left , half a bottle , and it ’ s cold
0	excuse me for bothering you with such nonsense , he continued , a bit disconcerted
0	raskolnikov paused , trying to remember
0	why , oh , why didn ’ t i know you before ?
0	how did he seem to you ?
0	the inn ( ) , at first glance a simple anecdote , is a philosophical novella centering on russian man and history , a work ( like on the eve or a king lear of the steppes ) that reveals turgenev 's affinity with the tragic outlook of the greeks
0	nikolai petrovich has become an arbitrator and works at it with all his might ; he 's constantly traveling throughout the district ; he delivers long speeches ( being of the opinion that peasants must be made to understand , that is , ie , after the emancipation of the serfs , which occurred in february
0	is it really the end ?
0	arkady was very surprised , even saddened ; but he did not think it necessary to say that ; he merely asked whether his uncle 's wound was serious or not
0	the debate is not over yet
0	finally , his appearance with a confession , at the very moment when the affair was becoming extraordinarily tangled as a result of the false testimony of the dejected fanatic ( nikolai ) and , besides that , when there were no clear clues pointing to the real criminal , or even any suspicions ( porfiry petrovich kept his word completely ) , all of this definitely facilitated the mitigation of the defendant ’ s fate
0	that type is drawn so delicately by you that its future judges will hardly be able to understand it completely
0	dunya dreams only about this
0	i do not reject them , he said
0	what does that mean ?
0	but his reply seemed credible ; the old woman took the pledge
0	i like watches like this , said dunya
0	( sonya was about to make some movement and began blushing )
0	no one said anything much about fenechka , who would just turned seventeen , and she was rarely seen : she lived quietly , modestly , and only on sundays turgenev 's text lists different ages for fenechka
0	you kept jumping up for no reason at all
0	i ’ ve already done just that , if you want to know
0	it was almost eleven o ’ clock , and even though at that time of year there ’ s no real night in petersburg , it was very dark at the top of the stairs
0	do you need him ?
0	in prison , in his surroundings , there was a great deal that he didn ’ t see , of course , and that he didn ’ t want to see
0	she cast her sickly but intense and penetrating glance at poor , trembling sonya , who was wiping the perspiration from her forehead with her scarf ; at last she asked to be raised up
0	the butler rendered polite assistance , but arkady would gladly have hit him or else burst into tears
0	besides , i ’ m a very candid man , sir
0	it ’ s strange , however : why do i hardly think about her , as if i hadn ’ t killed her ?
0	when he finally drew his last breath and the sound of universal lamentation filled the house , vasily ivanovich was overcome with sudden frenzy
0	her feelings , her sufferings , at least
0	then he crouched all the way down to the floor and glanced up at her face ; he took one look and froze in horror : the old woman was sitting there , laughing—she was overcome with quiet , inaudible laughter , trying with all her might to make sure he didn ’ t hear her
0	they were both silent
0	the other lady , very plump , had a dark red complexion with spots ; a distinguished woman , very elegantly attired , with a brooch the size of a saucer on her bosom , she stood off to one side , waiting
0	it ’ s simply feverish weakness , momentary delirium , he decided and he tore out the whole lining of his left trouser pocket
0	she asked , staring at raskolnikov once again , weighing the pledge in her hand
0	this dialectical frame makes possible the inclusion of an entire range of temporal visions within it—and just such a range appears , even as that range too is segmented and confined
0	roared razumikhin , but raskolnikov made no reply
0	he ’ s behaving like a scoundrel ; here , sir , just have a look at him : he ’ s a most attractive sight !
0	a half hour ago , we ’ d never seen each other , we considered ourselves enemies , with some unfinished business between us ; we left that matter behind , and now look at how far we ’ ve come !
0	a large crowd had gathered , and some policemen were standing in front of them
0	one night pavel petrovich endured a rather severe attack
0	it ’ s not possible , not possible !
0	he paused for a moment
0	a beautiful borzoi with a blue collar came running into the drawing room , paws tapping the floor , followed by a girl about eighteen , with black hair and dark skin , a roundish , but pleasant face , and small dark eyes
0	while valuing and , so to speak , adoring you , it ’ s possible that , at the same time , i may very much dislike a member of your family
0	but he didn ’ t know that my mother had come !
0	i hear the sound of people moving around
0	razumikhin also rose from his place
0	they take along a peasant woman , fat and ruddy
0	this common tendency to extrapolate bazarov 's story , it seems to me , points to a certain contradiction between the novelty of bazarov 's emptiness ( ie , his openness , his capacity , like the heroes of the late dostoevsky , to change sharply and abruptly ) on the one hand , and that characteristic framework in which it is confined
0	just wait a little
0	just wait and i ’ ll deceive you , too—ha , ha , ha !
0	get out , you scoundrel !
0	why can ’ t it happen ?
0	§ a dance associated with upper-class young ladies , especially those educated in socially desirable finishing schools
0	bazarov followed her quickly , without raising his eyes , merely catching the whispering and rustling sounds of her silk dress as it glided ahead of him
0	that 's how trained dogs dance on their hind legs
0	it ’ s gogol , the writer , who ’ s said to possess that trait to the highest degree , isn ’ t it ?
0	oh , arkady nikolaich , my friend !
0	continued petr petrovich , expanding on this conversation as if he had some purpose
0	he asked , turning to pavel petrovich , or shall i add a few more ?
0	but other people , before whom i all too deeply feel my insignificance , might utter the great words perissent nos noms , pourvu que la chose publique soit sauvée !
0	for some reason they wanted to have an autopsy performed , and i had not done one in a long time
0	the doctor had not expected that , was embarrassed and asked , wouldid your master hiccup before he died ?
0	i also used to order some books by mail
0	raskolnikov felt that some great weight had fallen upon him and was oppressing him
0	this is probably a conscious attempt to rival the well-known passage in virgil 's first eclogue and tennyson 's imitation of it :
0	if i have no value , then who needs my devotion ?
0	his nervous trembling had become somewhat feverish ; he even started shivering ; he felt a chill , in spite of the great heat
0	be quiet , sonya , be quiet !
0	simply to characterize that man or with some future goal in mind : to persuade me to look kindly on mr luzhin ?
0	let anyone you like search her !
0	well , enough , enough , arisha !
0	just see how frigid she 's made herself !
0	zeitung , thursday , june , supplement , page ) : the unprejudiced reader will be completely puzzled how the radical russian younger generation could become so frenzied about a representative of its convictions and strivings as turgenev depicted bazarov that it subjected turgenev to formal disgrace and covered him with abuse
0	i have to do something
0	they stop at crossroads and in front of shops
0	then he expressed his doubt that your studies at the university would allow you time to work in his office
0	then martha , as soon as she heard that jesus was coming , went and met him : but mary sat still in the house
0	she was always shy and suffered conversations and explanations with difficulty ; she was about forty , quite plump , with black brows and dark eyes ; she was kind as a result of her stoutness and slowness ; and she was even very pretty
0	for now you need only air , air , air !
0	he sweetened her up , muttered nastasya , with a cunning smile
0	no , to refrain would also be unnatural
0	how else can they tell you ’ re from a respectable family , you ’ re well-brought-up children , and not at all like all those organ grinders ; we ’ re not presenting some punch and judy show on the streets ; we ’ ll sing a few respectable romances
0	to show his zeal , when he would catch sight of nikolai petrovich from a distance , he would throw a stick at a passing piglet or threaten a half-naked urchin , but for the most part he just slept
0	svidrigaylov paid for the spoon , stood up , and left the garden
0	there 's no arrogance in you , no malice ; there 's only youthful audacity and youthful fervor ; that 's not commensurate to our task
0	in the terms i have been using , allen 's realists explore and endorse the prosaic view of life
0	so that ’ s what you ’ re driving at !
0	vodovozova ( na zare zhizni , d ed
0	he picked her up , carried her into his room , sat her on the bed , and began to undress her
0	that ’ s what you say , it seems , if i ’ m not mistaken ?
0	where is thy daughter who pitied her earthly father , a useless drunkard , and who was not dismayed by his beastliness ?
0	it is not the concrete incident in which his life is endangered which obsesses the death-haunted man ; it is the subliminal question , when and where , which accompanies him whether wandering noisy streets or lounging beneath a haystack
0	¶ cyrus was a persian ruler in the sixth century bce
0	alas , he didn ’ t really know how to express himself properly in russian ( not knowing , however , any other language ) , so now he was suddenly utterly exhausted , as if he had even wasted away following his lawyerly feat
0	odintsova stretched out both her arms , while bazarov pressed his forehead against the window
0	that was what woke him now as well
0	all of a sudden , an unexpected extraneous thought almost made him laugh :
0	we have become tired of the phrases of the hegelians , our heads have begun to spin from soaring around in the clouds , and many of us , having sobered up and come down to earth , have gone to the other extreme and while banishing dreaminess have started to persecute simple feelings and even purely physical sensations , like the enjoyment of music
0	but now i ’ m getting angry , and that just might be a fact !
0	and you , vasily ivanovich , are you sniveling , too ?
0	it was the landlady , amaliya fedorovna , who wouldn ’ t allow it ( darya frantsevna had previously encouraged her in this ) , as well as mr lebezyatnikov
0	why 's katya playing so late ?
0	that should have been done sooner ; now , as a matter of fact , even the caustic 's of no use
0	why , just today , for example , as we were going past our bailiff philip 's cottage—the one that 's so fine and white—
0	and just as he wondered about this , somewhere nearby , the soft sound of a wall clock , seeming to rush ahead , struck the hour of three
0	was it fate or some instinct that was bringing them together ?
0	perhaps , but he has a very kind heart
0	how come he hadn ’ t known that right away ?
0	how does it go ?
0	give them to me as a present , sonya , she says , please
0	the policeman told him that the unfortunate man had been caught in the wheel and dragged along the road for some thirty paces
0	he was very poor and somehow arrogantly proud and uncommunicative ; it was as if he were concealing something inside
0	at least , you are a god ; am not i a dolt then ?
0	an inveterate romantic may still be without egotism among us , but is this possible for the latest negator ?
0	at a merely anecdotal level , nothing could be simpler than to define relations between secenov and turgenev : each respected the other ; both at one time or another belonged to the circle around the journal so-vremennik ; both spent great stretches of time in germany and france absorbing the very latest ideas across a broad spectrum of interests , and both shared an almost british liberalism that made their politics appear slightly unreal or wildly eccentric to their more millenarian fellow slavs
0	i ’ m sure that no one would give even a baked onion for me , even if you threw in all my entrails , and that ’ s only if you were included in the bargain , too !
0	is that all you have to base your case on ?
0	dushkin continues : i know this here peasant mikolai dementev from his childhood ; he ’ s from our district and province , zaraysk , and i ’ m from ryazan
0	that ’ s the crux of the matter : she ’ s selling herself for her brother and for her mother !

0	they came upon little streams with cleared banks , tiny ponds with fragile dams , little villages with low peasant huts under dark roofs often missing half their thatch , small crooked threshing barns with walls of woven brushwood and gaping doorways beside abandoned threshing floors , and churches , some made of brick with the plaster falling off , others of wood with slanted crosses and overgrown cemeteries
0	no , that would be too clever !
0	left alone , sonya immediately began tormenting herself with fear at the thought that perhaps he really would commit suicide
0	blood , so much blood !
0	asked pulkheriya aleksandrovna , even more worried than before by his sudden , new , businesslike tone
0	and do not you tell me these fruits are insignificant : the worst dauber , un barbouilleur , a ballroom pianist who gets five copecks to play for an entire evening , all of them are more useful than you because they are representatives of civilization , not some primitive mongol force !
0	that is , what did you say about me ?
0	svidrigaylov was already sitting in the carriage
0	katerina ivanovna liked them very much ; she put one on and looked at herself in the mirror
0	what do i care about my hair ?
0	one ruffian was cursing another , and a very drunken fellow was sprawled out in the street
0	secondly , that the novel is preeminently the literary genre whose constitutive feature is an artistically organized diversity of social speech types , particularly fathers and sons in which the major thematic and structural emphasis is on the ideology of scientism as it is expressed in the speech practice of the nihilists
0	that 's family feeling showing itself , bazarov said serenely
0	excuse her , sir , said sonya , and she got up to leave once again
0	he dies stoically , wondering whether his country had any real need of him and men like him ; and his death is bitterly lamented by his old , humble , loving parents
0	petr petrovich said to himself , grinding his teeth ; and yet at the same time a desperate hope occurred to him once again : has this all really fallen through and is it over and done with once and for all ?
0	once again it was unbearably hot outside : if only there ’ d been a drop or two of rain these last few days
0	well then , so what if you have to join a different category of men ?
0	bazarov can not be both things at the same time , yet the author 's in-decisiveness sways the reader 's thought too from one pole to the other
0	an aimless and idle anxiety in the present , and endless sacrifice in the future , by means of which he would obtain nothing—that was what the world held in store for him
0	he bent over her once more
0	sonechka , sonechka marmeladova , eternal sonechka , as long as the world lasts !
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna asked in embarrassment
0	i ’ ll explain that to you later ; but now , my dear fellow , i declare
0	it seems to be really happening
0	another half hour passed
0	i ’ ll let in some fresh air
0	that ’ s true , muttered zosimov
0	he muttered through his teeth
0	he argues with bazarov much more energetically than does his brother , and yet nikolai petrovich suffers much more from his merciless repudiations
0	svidrigaylov set down the candle , sat on the bed , and fell into thought
0	well , to hell with it , you hear
0	farther on , in the depths of the courtyard , the corner of a low , sooty stone shed peered out from behind the fence , evidently part of a workshop
0	here the whole question is : am i a monster or a victim myself ?
0	how do i know what ?
0	death itself is the answer to the great riddle
0	what ’ s to explain : it ’ s perfectly clear !
0	i will tell you one thing , i drew all those characters as i would draw mushrooms , leaves , and trees
0	yesterday your son , he said , turning to pulkheriya aleksandrovna , in the presence of mr rassudkin ( or
0	katerina ivanovna has taken the place of your mother , hasn ’ t she ?
0	i could kill and rob that cursed old woman , and can assure you , feel no pangs of conscience , the student added passionately
0	why does all this not arm the reader against bazarov ?
0	right ; and why should not i express my thought ?
0	how was i to blame for that ?
0	i think , he replied seriously after a little pause
0	i didn ’ t take it !
0	the swallows were flying very high ; the wind had died down completely ; some tardy bees were lazily and sleepily buzzing amidst the lilac blossoms ; a swarm of midges hung over a single outstretched branch
0	no , i thought , morgenfrüh ! † what does mikolka have to do with this ?
0	the little boy , a year older than her , was trembling in the corner and crying
0	what do you want ?
0	i ’ ve come for your crosses , sonya
0	i ’ ve known this for a long time , rodya
0	it seemed to me , as a result of all i ’ ve heard about you , that you , on your part , would be very pleased if this marriage could be broken off without harming her interests
0	here are my two rooms
0	in the ranks of bazarov 's enemies there will undoubtedly be those who will pay particular attention to these ugly features of his personality and will use them to reproach the general type
0	upon his arrival in petersburg he had stayed with him not merely for reasons of tightfisted economy , although that was really the main reason , but also for another reason
0	she came back—it seems she was driven away from somewhere , and perhaps she was even beaten
0	two peasants wearing caps stood in front of the first hut and traded insults
0	you know how i love you ; you ’ re all we have , dunya and i , you mean everything to us , all our hope , all our aspiration
0	the landlady had stopped providing him with food about two weeks ago , and up to the present he hadn ’ t taken it upon himself to have it out with her , even though he went without his dinner
0	a famous russian icon depicting the virgin and kept in the kazan cathedral in petersburg
0	the paper actually dropped from raskolnikov ’ s hands , and he looked intensely at the elegant lady , who was being rebuked so unceremoniously
0	i walked and walked , asked and asked !
0	it ’ s locked with a key
0	porfiry won ’ t reveal what he ’ s thinking , but he ’ s questioning those people who pawned items
0	good-bye , he said after a brief pause
0	this reading of the book can best be elucidated by beginning at its conclusion , at the almost unbearable closing picture of bazarov 's aged parents kneeling and weeping at his grave
0	it ’ s a bit delicate but important : if , that is , in any case ( but one that i don ’ t think will happen and consider you completely incapable of ) , if by any chance—well , just in case—the idea occurs to you during these forty or fifty hours to conclude this affair in some other way , in some sort of fantastic manner—to raise your hand against yourself ( an absurd supposition , forgive me for saying ) , then leave a short but detailed note
0	if i would continued in the civil service , engaged in such drudgery , why i would be an adjutant-general by now
0	he whispered , barely drawing a breath
0	that may be , but you are still wrong
0	and talk to him ?
0	marry whomever you like !
0	turgenev knew this and despaired of both , though he hoped the two might be reconciled
0	arkady immediately fell silent and katya grew pale
0	here ’ s an example : an old woman was murdered in our neighborhood
0	every man must fend for himself , and the one who deceives himself the best winds up the happiest of all
0	you wo not , for instance , fight , and yet you think yourselves terrific
0	i ’ m happy even now
0	do not compare me to my sister , please , katya interrupted him hurriedly
0	she walked quickly , swaying violently as she had before
0	therefore i put something of that romanticism in bazarov too , but only pisarev noticed it
0	my grandfather ploughed the earth , bazarov replied with arrogant pride
0	raskolnikov burst into laughter
0	then , still in chapter , bazarov articulates the first unequivocal statement of his intimation : every man hangs on a thread ; the abyss can open up beneath him at any moment
0	and then when i heard about those doorbells , i froze completely and even felt a shudder
0	he rushed toward the light to examine his sock and the fringe : there are some spots , but they ’ re not too conspicuous ; everything ’ s so dirty , worn out , and faded
0	this buffoonery prompted andrei gieroglifov , a member of pisarev 's circle , to face the issue squarely in an essay bearing the title love and nihilism , written just as cher-nyshevsky was completing his novel , and drawn largely from schopenhauer 's metaphysics of love
0	true to her name , odintsova is also temporally isolated from all the other characters
0	svidrigaylov sat down at the table and asked sonya to take a seat next to him
0	the words flowed out of him with ecstatic feeling
0	everythin ’ , my young friend , absolutely everythin ’ , the older man affirmed instructively
0	he filled three goblets and a little wineglass , toasted the health of their inestimable visitors , immediately downed his glass military style , and forced arina vlasevna to drink hers to the very last drop
0	in a word , though there might be some hope , it ’ s extremely slight , because in this case there ’ s no right to assistance , even maybe the opposite
0	good lord , it ’ s so dark !
0	he had been to the former location once briefly , but a long time ago
0	she is absolutely devoted to her husband , and both loves and fears her son bazarov
0	good lord , what a scream !
0	let the following example serve to guide you
0	he ’ s now involved with
0	once , walking somewhere outside the city , he even imagined that svidrigaylov was waiting for him there and that they had made an appointment to meet
0	i won ’ t come to ask your forgiveness , i ’ ll simply tell you
0	what i said about luzhin and about god was for myself
0	raskolnikov took a swallow from the glass and put a small piece of bread into his mouth
0	he suddenly fell silent and headed for the door
0	but mostly young people : there are few old men , even fewer old women , there are more children than old men , but still not very many ( italics added )
0	that evening anna sergeevna was sitting in her room with bazarov , while arkady was pacing the hall listening to katya 's playing
0	both stand outside the manor-house that is russia , peering in through a window ; rudin makes speeches and bazarov would like to throw stones perhaps erring conveys the spirit rather than the letter of the word better than sinning does
0	once more she made no reply
0	he could hear her unlocking the dresser
0	besides that , he informed me unequivocally that a week before her death , marfa petrovna , in her will , arranged to leave you , dunya , the sum of three thousand rubles , and that you ’ ll be able to receive that money very soon
0	ah , let ’ s sing cinq sous ’ in french ! ¶ i taught it to you , i did
0	i expected things to take a completely different direction
0	but i must behave more calmly ; lately i ’ ve become too full of bile
0	even if us can be construed as the modern reader , lowe does not indicate that his views of turgenev differ from those held by us
0	please let ’ s hear how he proves it !
0	furthermore , i added that he , petr petrovich luzhin , with all his merits , wasn ’ t worth sofiya semyonovna ’ s little finger , about whom he ’ d expressed himself so offensively
0	we even find it a burden to be men—men with our own real flesh and blood ; we are ashamed of it , we consider it a disgrace and strive to be some sort of imaginary men-in-general
0	i ’ ll be your slave
0	he constructed the house and outbuildings , laid out a garden , and dug a pond and two wells ; but the young trees had not taken , too little water collected in the pond , and that in the wells had a brackish taste
0	bazarov headed to his room , while odintsova shook arkady 's hand absentmindedly and also walked right past him
0	it ’ s clear , now it ’ s all clear
0	she still felt awkward with bazarov , even though she would told him , and she herself believed , that everything had been forgotten
0	he was still very young , dressed like a common worker , of medium height , gaunt , hair cropped around his head , and with fine , seemingly dry facial features
0	well then , you missed !
0	the red blotches on her cheeks were growing brighter and brighter , and her chest was heaving more and more
0	one she calls cyclical time ; it involves repetition , gestation , and the eternal recurrence of biological rhythms conforming to nature
0	it was as if now , intentionally , he had forgotten
0	would i do that ?
0	but these organisms were creatures endowed with intelligence and will
0	oh , what an unbearable child he is
0	pavel petrovich tapped his nails on the table
0	gasping for breath , she stops , and then tries to pull again , about to drop
0	asked sonya with some surprise
0	this guess , even as early as yesterday , during his severe anxieties and despair , had begun to strengthen in him
0	raskolnikov proceeded directly to the house on the canal where sonya lived
0	if not— be silent , things are bad enough without you
0	he had completely stopped handling his own everyday affairs and didn ’ t wish to deal with them
0	as he had been approaching bakaleev ’ s house a while ago , he ’ d suddenly imagined that some item , some small chain , cuff link , or even the paper in which the items were wrapped , with the old woman ’ s marks on it , might somehow have slid down and gotten lost in a little crack , and then might suddenly emerge before him as unexpected and incontrovertible evidence
0	effective people are nowhere to be seen
0	is it even worth talking with you ?
0	turgenev describes her as a genuine noblewoman of the old school , ie , old muscovy , who has somehow lived on into another age
0	well , weren ’ t you insane at his apartment ?
0	he had been following her from the moment she had emerged from the gate
0	at the time we deceived you , writing that it had come from dunya ’ s savings , but that wasn ’ t so
0	the subtlest critic of turgenev 's position in this debate , elizabeth cheresh allen , takes as her starting point the difference between turgenev and other novelists , such as eliot , trollope , and tolstoy , with whom he is often grouped
0	he was about to protest but remained contemptuously silent
0	you wanted to see me ?
0	andrey semyonych shuddered like a warhorse who ’ d heard the sound of the trumpet
0	so , even if you sacrifice your brother , you won ’ t be able to prove a thing ; force is very hard to prove , avdotya romanovna
0	let ’ s go right now
0	§ the streets on vasilievsky island are numbered and referred to as lines
0	she would start to say , and before he would even time to turn around , she was already fingering the laces of her handbag and would mutter : never mind , it 's nothing , i was only then she would go off to find vasily ivanovich and , resting her cheek on her hand , would say to him , my dear , how can i find out what enyusha would like for dinner today , cabbage soup or borsch ?
0	he said to arkady , after climbing into the cart ; pointing to a pair of jackdaws sitting side by side on the stable roof , he added , there you are !
0	petr petrovich , who that morning had for some reason exchanged several five percent government bonds , was sitting at a table counting packets of banknotes and bonds
0	about a month and a half ago , he remembered her address ; he had two items suitable for pawning : his father ’ s old silver watch and a small gold ring with three little red stones , given to him by his sister as a gift , a keepsake , at their parting
0	you are more fortunate than i
0	that i was looking for , that i was searching
0	if anything happens , just let me know
0	don ’ t bring children in here !
0	yes , katya repeated , and this time he understood her
0	forgive me , it seemed you did from your question
0	there are so many memories behind me : life in petersburg , wealth , then poverty , my father 's death , marriage , then a trip abroad , just as it should be many memories , but nothing to remember , while ahead of me—a long , long path , but no goal i really do not want to go on
0	now she was a modestly , even poorly dressed young woman , very young indeed , almost like a girl , with modest , proper manners , and an innocent but seemingly frightened face
0	even after that lesson , even during his second visit to the kirsanovs , he is carried away with fenichka and is forced to fight a duel with pavel petrovich
0	is mr kirsanov leaving us , then ?
0	she also understood that perhaps it was no longer possible to get away from him now
0	sat down on the sofa again
0	what do you want , sir ?
0	he was annoyed with himself that he ’ d dropped into the tavern
0	well , we don ’ t even have those books now , all our reading ended then and there
0	in our province , about sixty miles from here
0	i know what she said to you , so there ’ s no need to retell it
0	once again he was momentarily overcome by a strong feeling of joy , such as he ’ d experienced before in the police station
0	he did , but that ’ s not the point , not at all
0	of course , it occurred close by
0	look here , my dear friend
0	returning to his bedroom , he found his wife in bed and began praying in a whisper so as not to wake her
0	i warned you , my dear guest , vasily ivanych began , we live here , so to speak , in a bivouac
0	i have a receipt to that effect in my wallet
0	perhaps i ’ ll even come tomorrow
0	but she ’ s not too clever either , is she ?
0	after all , he 's no longer a young boy : it 's time to toss that rubbish aside
0	she said a minute later , raising her tearstained little face and wiping her tears with her hands
0	he added irritably , annoyed at his own involuntary passion
0	there was indeed in his bearing something to suggest a solid civil servant
0	you understand who i ’ m talking about : about her , her !
0	besides , while still in moscow i imagined that i was coming here to seek avdotya romanovna ’ s hand and become mr luzhin ’ s rival
0	so what ’ s better for him now , the doctor or you ?
0	it even struck him as almost amusing , while at the same time he felt somewhat heartsick
0	do not you know in our language , when we say 'not quite right , ' that means 'quite all right ?
0	he even felt very tormented on her behalf , which upset dunya
0	the idea is simple , but unfortunately , too long in the coming , hidden by a penchant for enthusiasm and fantasy ; it seems that a little cleverness is necessary to surmise that
0	i ’ m curious as to whether in the next fifteen or twenty years my soul will be resigned , whether i ’ ll whimper reverently before people , calling myself a criminal with every word i utter
0	and is nature nonsense ?
0	too bad about the forest , said arkady and began looking around
0	intelligentsia , a term , apparently of russian invention , that designates intellectuals of all persuasions dedicated in one form or another to the improvement of life in russia , and so carries far greater ethical implications than the mere word
0	however one chooses to label the dialectical thought at the heart of turgenev 's novel—hegelian , schellingian , or simply palka  dvukh kontsakh , turgenev 's dialectical intentions show themselves in the work 's very title , which links the generations even as it seems to set them apart
0	i really did wish to have a discussion with you and your much-esteemed mother , even about some very important matters
0	his face expressed sincere compassion
0	she didn ’ t agree with me , just as you don ’ t , and i ’ m glad that she ’ s no longer with us
0	they are not groundless , and i accept— without false humility—part of the reproaches made to me
0	and what sort of thoughts had he sometimes harbored ?
0	she embraced him firmly
0	what sort of permission do i need ?
0	nonetheless the whole man , not fragmentary traits , appears at that step of his development , as generally happens in development
0	at least you have enormous material for being one
0	raskolnikov had a terrible dream
0	at the very last farewell , he smiled strangely at the passionate assurances of his sister and razumikhin about their happy future when he would be released from prison , and he predicted that his mother ’ s illness would soon end in calamity
0	i lay there drunk , sir
0	as long as our beloved creatures are happy
0	that is , you mean to say , if i have understood you correctly , no matter what your theoretical view of dueling , in practice you would not allow yourself to be insulted without demanding satisfaction
0	well , and finally , if you won ’ t agree to drop in on me , then i ’ ll refuse to provide any explanations and will leave immediately
0	of course , she could tolerate everything with patience and almost without complaint—even this
0	when it becomes necessary i will have the time and strength to do what i must
0	well , to hell with it !
0	et toc , et toc , et tin-tin-tin !
0	but if svidrigaylov still hadn ’ t been there , would he or would he not go to see porfiry ?
0	why me in particular ?
0	as you wish , replied bazarov
0	it is less the portrait of an individual man than it is the icon of an era , one of those rare instances that let us actually see the otherwise invisible historical forces shaping whole eras
0	you gave us all your money yesterday !
0	on the contrary , i am ready to submit , but inequality is difficult to accept
0	a life for a life
0	sonya picked up her shawl and put it over her head
0	i do not quite understand you , arkady said
0	our nikolai petrovich fell into a reverie
0	the tenderhearted and sensible mother of arkady ivanovich ’ s fiancée pushed her husband ’ s wheelchair out to him , and , as was her custom , immediately began with some remote questions
0	i don ’ t know if he ’ s rich now , or how much precisely marfa petrovna left him ; i ’ ll find that out in a very short time ; but , of course , here in petersburg , even having any financial resources at hand , he ’ ll resume his former course of action
0	truth doesn ’ t vanish , but life can be beaten to a pulp ; there have been examples
0	vakhrushin , raskolnikov said pensively
0	the political details of the debate between the men of the forties and the men of the sixties , i suggested , were only the temporal , particular setting for turgenev 's eternal and universal theme
0	it was on the eve of my departure to come here
0	what a strange fellow you are !
0	in our calendar , and the october revolution is annually commemorated in the soviet union on november
0	analyzed bv dobrolyubov in a long article entitled the kingdom of darkness ( ) [ editor ]
0	i told you they were telling tall tales !
0	but this is all so vulgar
0	you ’ re a good man , i know that , he added with a smile , looking him right in the eye
0	though he could not sympathize with the aims of the revolutionaries , he could sympathize with them as people
0	that is the iu
0	for my part , i am very glad you are studying the natural sciences
0	she yelled at him
0	we will omit the long process by which he arrived at this last conclusion ; even without that , we have raced too far ahead
0	screams mikolka , and swings the shaft with all his might
0	what he 's saying , of course , is that physiological mechanisms are true , but they may become layered over with false metaphors , especially the kind to which lovers are notoriously drawn
0	waiting until the end of the quadrille , sitnikov led arkady to odintsova
0	rodion romanovich has two paths open to him : either a bullet in his brain or siberia
0	he was very suspicious of svidrigaylov
0	a second assertion expands on the subject :
0	of all the pejoratives bazarov uses , none in his eyes is more damning than
0	if porfiry really had anything positive , then of course it was in connection with the man from yesterday
0	because in this instance , as i saw it that was precisely how life turned out and above all i wanted to be honest and truthful
0	nikolai petrovich ordered several bottles of porter , which had just been delivered from moscow , and drank so much his cheeks turned red as raspberries and kept emitting not quite a childish , not quite a nervous laugh
0	the critic strakhov in his review spoke of him as a character conceived on a heroic scale
0	one more word , sir , rodion romanovich , about all this ; it ’ s as god wills it , nevertheless , according to our procedure , there are still some things i want to ask you about , sir
0	dunya cried in despair
0	here he is , dmitry prokofich razumikhin , she added , introducing him to luzhin
0	nature 's not a temple , but a workshop , and man 's the workman in it
0	she had lowered her revolver and , completely stunned , looked at him ; he could have grabbed her twice over—she wouldn ’ t have raised her arms in her defense if he hadn ’ t reminded her himself
0	what shall we sing ?
0	a faint breeze , rustling in the leaves of the ash , moved pale gold spots of light slowly back and forth across the dark path and fifi 's yellow back ; arkady and katya were enveloped in deep shade ; only occasionally did a bright streak gleam in her hair
0	he stood on the threshold like someone rooted to the ground
0	† a reference to the judicial reforms of
0	now go to bed , right now , immediately !
0	will i be better if i acknowledge then , crushed by suffering and idiocy , in old-age impotence after twenty years of exile , what i acknowledge now , and why should i continue to live ?
0	i suppose it 's time our travelers were nestled in the arms of morpheus , observed vasily ivanovich
0	but , after having reached the first line , § raskolnikov suddenly turned around , climbed the stairs back up to razumikhin ’ s , and , placing both the german pages and the three rubles down on the table , left again , without saying a word
0	how is he finding them ?
0	however , i ’ m not going there now to redeem those items , he said with some haste and special concern for his belongings
0	never forsake my poor brother nikolai !
0	besides , you can read pelouse et frémy , notions générales de chimie ; it 's a good book and very clearly written
0	she stood up and headed for the door
0	this capacity consciously to behave stupidly is an enviable virtue of strong and intelligent people
0	i do not beat her for no reason
0	he thought inadvertently as he climbed up to the fourth floor
0	lizaveta , the trader , or don ’ t you know ?
0	he paused on the threshold
0	why is this so ?
0	i ’ ve inquired about you many times
0	that is , i ’ m dead drunk , but that ’ s not the point
0	but there was no hope ; no doubt remained whatsoever ; it was all true !
0	he turned away and sat down on the couch
0	everyone was talking , shouting , and exclaiming ; the coachman seemed confused and kept repeating , from time to time :
0	this is pavel petrovieh ( : [ p ] )
0	marmeladov fell silent , as if his voice had broken off
0	the door opened , and in walked razumikhin
0	to deny completely arbitrarily one or another natural and real human need is to break with pure empiricism
0	raskolnikov hurried back to his apartment
0	indeed , the prospect of an affair with
0	besides , in order to determine what sort of person he is , one must deal with him gradually and carefully , so as not to fall into error or prejudice , which is difficult to correct or smooth over afterward
0	nature 's nonsense too in the sense you understand it
0	what if the cases floated instead of sank ?
0	merely to bury them and then acquire new responsibilities—a wife and children , and then leave them also without a kopeck or a crust of bread ?
0	the hell with them ; later we can beat them up , but for now , we ’ ll just laugh !
0	they won ’ t understand a thing , not a thing , sonya , and they ’ re not worthy of understanding
0	odintsova turned to arkady
0	exclamations flew from all sides
0	in this essay of herzen undertook to show other forms of civic action than those the nihilists proclaimed
0	having married a wealthy man who left her his estate and fortune upon his demise , anna sergeevna is wholly dedicated to the preservation of the status quo
0	it seems that i am more naïve than you assume
0	a gloomy , intense energy is manifested in the younger generation 's unfriendly attitude toward its mentors
0	this may be the last time i speak with you
0	have you seen luzhin ?
0	order yourself some tea at least
0	does bazarov present a subject for imitation according to you ?
0	but do you know , avdotya romanovna , that i could even lodge a complaint , ma ’ am
0	in spite of his weakness , he didn ’ t even feel the least tiredness
0	well , it ’ s not for my looks , and besides , what sort of husband am i ?
0	true , they depended on you before , and your late father would ask you for money so he could drink to cure his hangover
0	put in a third
0	in reply to the question of what had caused him to offer a confession , he answered frankly that it was his heartfelt repentance
0	that ’ s exactly what he was counting on , the fact that i wouldn ’ t have had time to think , that i ’ d hasten to reply more plausibly , and would forget that the workmen couldn ’ t have been there two days before
0	profound task to fulfill , turgenev is only the singer of our cultured stratum , and
0	because he ’ s so irascible
0	drink champagne with kukshina ?
0	what exactly did he say ?
0	tolstoy 's artistic genius was acknowledged early by writers and critics
0	once again they stood facing each other for a minute
0	but that ’ s not true at all
0	it seems to be a very simple and clear thing , and yet that 's just what one has to explain in our day , as if it were something completely new and yet it would seem , it is completely simple and clear , so simple and clear that the most organic view that emerges immediately from it is nothing other than a simple , untheoretical view of life and its manifestations or expression in science , art , and the history of nations
0	it ’ s not that she ’ ll begin tearing out my hair
0	there ’ s drawin ’ s , i mean
0	he cried to himself
0	nastasya brought him something to eat ; he ate and drank with a hearty appetite , almost greedily
0	the tide of public opinion , still so vague with us , turned but a shadow was cast on my name
0	pavel petrovich smiled and , placing his hand on his brother 's shoulder , made him sit down again
0	hundreds , maybe thousands of beings could be set on the right path ; dozens of families could be rescued from poverty , kept from dissolution , from ruin , debauchery , and venereal hospitals—all this with her wealth
0	soch , , - ( - ) ; m antonovich , asmodei nashego vremeni , sov , ( mar )
0	they were also packing to go home , but lingered as they chatted with a passing acquaintance
0	don ’ t be angry , rodion romanovich , but for some reason you yourself seem terribly strange to me
0	who knows , perhaps it ’ s not any better , but even worse
0	have you just come from the baths ?
0	yet these new men , herzen added in a later essay , are so dogmatic , doctrinaire , jargon-ridden , as to exhibit the least attractive aspect of the russian character , the policeman's—the martinet's—side of it , the brutal bureaucratic jackboot ; they want to break the yoke of the old despotism , but only in order to replace it with one of their own
0	listen , razumikhin , began raskolnikov
0	polechka knelt at her mother ’ s feet and kissed them , sobbing
0	never , never have i been stronger and more convinced than i am now !
0	that may be the case : i ’ m babbling because i ’ m not doing anything
0	since my arrival , i have felt really rotten , as if i would been reading gogol 's letter to the wife of the governor of kaluga
0	i ’ m a poor , sick student , disheartened—he actually used the word disheartened—by poverty
0	it ’ s a vile and ridiculous suspicion
0	calm down , mama , replied dunya , taking off her hat and cloak
0	as he made his way through the office , raskolnikov noticed that many people were staring at him intently
0	lebezyatnikov retorted , his temper flaring up
0	then you must reject everything ?
0	two lads from the crowd grab whips and run up to the little horse to start beating her flanks
0	but these people managed to carry out those steps , and therefore they were right ; but i wasn ’ t able to , and therefore i didn ’ t have the right to allow myself to take that step
0	aristocratism , liberalism , progress , principles , bazarov was saying meanwhile ,
0	that aspen over there , bazarov began , reminds me of my childhood
0	there was some sort—do not laugh—
0	but as you see , i haven ’ t left the matter unattended ; i have risen up and will tell you why : solely , madam , solely because of your blackest ingratitude !
0	i merely asked you
0	and if he started to gain the upper hand , he asked , would you stand up for me ?
0	better to coquette with science than with a dandy
0	you ’ re really sick , you know that ?
0	well , what are you afraid of , you little fool !
0	this isn ’ t why he doesn ’ t run away from me : it ’ s that he has nowhere to run ; he won ’ t run away psychologically , ha-ha !
0	leontiev in in one of his most revealing statements about his own artistic method
0	sit down , my dear ; i see that you must be tired
0	and then about mr razumikhin , that is , whether it was his own idea to come here yesterday to speak on your behalf or was it at your instigation ?
0	bazarov is more than an outsider to turgenev , but to pisarev he is more than a brother ; for heuristic purposes , of course , we should choose the viewpoint which regards bazarov as its desideratum
0	that ’ s the detective speaking !
0	lizaveta , the market woman , had sold me some collars and cuffs cheaply , very nice ones , new , with a pattern
0	are you some sort of prophet ?
0	arkady will be here , bazarov remarked
0	allow me to pass , ladies and gentlemen !
0	her face was pockmarked ; she was about thirty years old , covered with bruises , and had a swollen upper lip
0	he has important business there , since he wants to open a public lawyer ’ s office in the capital
0	a few moments later , the door opened a tiny crack : the inhabitant peered out at the caller with visible distrust , and all that could be seen in the darkness were her flashing beady eyes
0	in baden once again he somehow became as close to her as before ; it seemed she would never loved him so passionately but a month later it was all over : the flame had flared up for the last time and gone out forever
0	allow me to inquire
0	you always say that i ’ m a fool ; well , friend , i swear there are bigger fools than me !
0	the smolny costume is described and pictured in stefanie dogorouky [ dologorukayaj , la russie avant la débâcle ( paris , ) -
0	but no ; ennui overcomes you
0	i also had the opportunity to learn in detail about the scene in the police office , also by chance , sir , not merely in passing but from a particular , reliable source , who , without knowing why himself , grasped the scene surprisingly well
0	repeated lebezyatnikov , turning to each and every person present
0	there happened to be a young girl in our house , parasha , dark-eyed parasha , who ’ d just been brought in from another village ; she was a serf girl i ’ d never set eyes on before—very pretty but unbelievably stupid : she burst into tears , raised a loud howl , and created a scandal
0	you can imagine what occurred there
0	vassily ivanovich knows as a doctor how great the danger is , but he can not bring himself to look it in the face and tries to deceive himself
0	twenty rubles , i think—and if this can serve as assistance , then
0	well , what of it ?
0	it was the same in the furniture shop , where they didn ’ t want to refund even one ruble of his deposit for the furniture he had purchased , but which had still not been delivered to the apartment
0	they were just returning home from the governor 's , when suddenly a rather short man jumped from a passing carriage ; wearing a slavophile jacket , shouting , evgeny vasilich !
0	i shall enter the battle against evil only when i feel myself to be strong
0	he opened his eyes and , still not recognizing or understanding where he was , began scrutinizing raskolnikov , who was standing over him
0	before you were sitting on that chair as you ’ ve never sat before , somehow on the edge of it , shuddering from a spasm
0	well then , arkady , nikolai petrovich began again , turning to his son , shall we have the horses harnessed at once , or do you want to rest a little ?
0	he , too , of course , had scrutinized the sick man when he ’ d fainted , but he ’ d walked away as soon as raskolnikov had come to
0	arkady picked up the latest issue of a journal and began reading aloud
0	i saved you some , but you came home late
0	he 's become good friends with katya
0	the silence continued for a minute
0	i ’ ll get used to it
0	we tried to determine what sort of fringes you wanted
0	they came to terms because of me !
0	we see bazarov only in the last weeks of his life , and this is crucial in light of walter benjamin 's comment on the assertion that a man who dies at is at every moment of his life a man who dies at
0	formal admission into the ranks of womanizing céladons and then returned to his own room
0	praise the lord , her torments have ended , but i ’ ll tell you everything in order , so you ’ ll know what ’ s happened and what we ’ ve been keeping from you up to now
0	porfiry petrovich , apparently , was flustered
0	by way of example one might analyze the remarkably subtle structure of the third chapter of fathers and sons , underscoring the nuanced modulation of feeling and perspective , the art of implication , and the way that these recall ( for us , today ) chekhov , particularly in his plays
0	asked the frightened pulkheriya aleksandrovna
0	in his opening chapter
0	he had agreed to leave the party immediately and have a look at raskolnikov , but had come to see the women unwillingly and with great uncertainty , failing to trust the drunken razumikhin
0	when bazarov lauds hatred , how strange !
0	ba/arov 's mother beatifically adores him , while his father does not merely defer to his son 's views , he suppresses some of his own deepest feelings
0	to america , and the hell with them !
0	he felt like mocking himself spitefully
0	nikolai petrovich asked at last
0	he soon caught up with him , and for some time walked along behind him ; at last he came even with him and glanced into his face from alongside
0	to that ideal of civilization turgenev remained true all his life
0	the cleverer a person is , the less he suspects that he ’ ll be tricked by something so simple
0	i agree with evgeny , he replied
0	asked raskolnikov , glancing at him inquisitively
0	there ’ s some outburst for you ; he ’ s beating his drum !
0	give him something more substantial to read
0	i am very glad to hear you say that
0	he wrote that in the summer of wouldespicable generals praised me , the constantly quoted both for and against the conception of bazarov as a prototype of bolshevik activists
0	many of our realists are up in arms against turgenev because he does not sympathize with bazarov
0	long since the issues that he fought out have ceased to be of any actual interest
0	the image of a student who has solidly passed an examination is much more accurate than your image of the triumphant man , and let me tell you that your comparing yourself to a pigmy is worthless
0	dunechka shuddered , quickly cocked the revolver , and raised it once again
0	he fell to thinking deeply about how it might transpire that at last he ’ d humble himself before them all without any argument , humble himself by conviction !
0	we ’ ve already turned the corner , interrupted dunya
0	luzhin paused and waited with an offended and challenging look
0	in a commune , her role will change its present meaning ; that which is foolish here will become clever there ; that which is unnatural here , under present circumstances , will become completely natural there
0	if you like , all this , i said , could be explained in an entirely different way , and it even winds up being more natural
0	you don ’ t pay her any money and you won ’ t vacate the room
0	why did i undertake this mean , vile , base act ?
0	arkady remembered egorovna , sighed , and wished her eternal peace he did not pray for himself
0	in a word , through it all he could even provoke a rift between my family and me , and , of course , he hoped once more to restore himself to their good favor
0	why ’ s the caretaker here ?
0	we just got here ourselves
0	she asked , growing heated and upset
0	they didn ’ t know whom to condemn and whom to acquit
0	but in giving him the right to receive my pension for me , i was obliged to wait until i repaid my debt , and that ’ s only just happened , so all this time i haven ’ t been able to send you anything
0	what do you want ?
0	youngish , that is , recently turned forty , but already aspiring to an important government position and sporting stars on both sides of his chest
0	what do you think ?
0	leave me alone , all of you , leave me alone !
0	shouted dozens of voices ; people came running , and both embankments were covered with spectators
0	take a good look
0	and did you notice , rodion romanovich , once and for all , that all these petersburg foreigners—that is , mainly the germans—who come to us from somewhere or other are all stupider than we are ?
0	a russian translation appeared in
0	she was singing a romance in a coarse , rough , but rather strong , pleasant voice , in expectation of receiving a two-kopeck piece from the shopkeeper
0	finally , there is linear time ; time as project , teleology , departure , progression , and arrival ; time as history
0	katya and arkady could not see them , but heard their every word , the rustle of her dress , their breathing
0	he cried more threateningly
0	i don ’ t understand what promissory note you ’ re talking about !
0	'anonymous russia ' , as he called them in virgin soil
0	both of them , svidrigaylov and achilles , stood looking at each other in silence for some time
0	and so , despite your euphemisms , you do not like fathers and sons
0	he writes from afar
0	well , even for just a while
0	i really did know beforehand !
0	and therefore why not be a vulgarian for a while , when it ’ s so appropriate to appear as such in our climate and
0	i don ’ t want them to be lost , especially the watch
0	i wish you good thoughts and auspicious undertakings !
0	fenechka demonstrated with her own hands how , in her opinion , bazarov twisted pavel petrovich around his little finger
0	well , listen to my report , he began
0	wasn ’ t he the servant who came , after his death , to fill your pipe
0	he searched for her with a sad , timid look in his eyes ; she turned back to him and stood at his head
0	it may have been there since the house was built and will be there just as long
0	true , it was still lying on the sofa under his blanket , but it was so worn and dirty that of course zametov couldn ’ t have noticed anything in particular about it
0	he says , 'they are prepared to rob themselves in order to drink themselves blind at the inn
0	but at the same time , a gentleman in a civil servant ’ s uniform and an overcoat , a respectable man of about fifty with a medal around his neck ( this was especially pleasant for katerina ivanovna and had an effect on the policeman ) , drew near and silently presented katerina ivanovna with a green three-ruble note
0	however , i see that it ’ s a delicate matter and i ’ m an ass ; forgive me
0	how did it happen that she risked taking such a beauty into her house as a governess ?
0	go at once , this very minute , and stand at the crossroads , bow down , and begin by kissing the ground that you ’ ve fouled ; then bow down to the entire world , all four sides , and say aloud to everyone : i killed !
0	how do you know ?
0	you probably think , like everyone else , that i was too strict with him , she continued , turning to raskolnikov
0	oh , the vile scoundrels
0	triumph during their lifetime ?
0	again , it ’ s expressed in legalese , that is , with too obvious a display of its own aim and with extremely naïve speed
0	i ’ m feeling somewhat weak , dunya ; i ’ m very tired ; but now at least i ’ d like to regain control of myself
0	but as he uttered his last exclamation , he unexpectedly met dunya ’ s glance ; there was so much , so very much suffering in her eyes that he instinctively came to his senses
0	it 's awful , just awful
0	he decided to stop at a single step in his hero 's development
0	he must be large and heavy , thought raskolnikov , squeezing the axe in his hand
0	the question remains : does the illness give birth to the crime itself , or is the crime , somehow by its own nature , always accompanied by something like an illness ?
0	at that moment , a ray of sunlight lit up his left boot : on his sock , which stuck out , there seemed to be more spots
0	well , perhaps that ’ s just what i ’ m trying to do , hee-hee-hee !
0	that means you believe only in science
0	a little while ago , justifying my own love for avdotya romanovna , i said that i myself was a victim
0	he looked exactly the same as he had yesterday : the same figure , dressed the same way , but a major change had taken place in his face and in his glance : he now looked somehow saddened ; standing there for a little while , he sighed deeply
0	she was very plain
0	it was not all that long ago he would engaged in such dreaming while waiting for his son at the carriage inn ; but since then such a change had occurred , and their relations , which had at that time been so unclear , had now become quite well-defined how well-defined they were !
0	tears stood in their eyes
0	even if there ’ s no doubt whatsoever in all my calculations , even if everything i ’ ve decided this past month is clear as day , as correct as arithmetic
0	there can be no doubt that turgenev 's experience of revolution as a momentary event in history—providential , perhaps , accidental , ironical or fateful , he was himself unsure which— matched and possibly reinforced his sense that life 's ultimate joy was to be experienced in the momentary ecstasy of first love
0	the old woman hadn ’ t locked it after him , perhaps out of caution
0	on a leather-covered sofa a lady was half-reclining ; she was still young , had fair hair , a bit disheveled , and was wearing a silk dress , not altogether tidy , with large bracelets on her short arms , a lace kerchief on her head
0	but how did i kill ?
0	no , that wasn ’ t the dunya i knew , and
0	not that this narrator is incapable of appreciating prosaic values , too
0	contemplating that divide , steno thinks : before me i see a threshold—
0	he tried to run away !
0	it ’ s what ’ s called la nature et la vérité ! ‡ ha , ha !
0	he took the money for me
0	just write what i told you
0	but he was resurrected , and he knew it ; he felt it completely with the entirety of his renewed being , and she—well , she lived only in his life !
0	the old woman was no more than a mistake ; she wasn ’ t the point !
0	in he brought his son to the university ; he spent three winters there with him in petersburg , going almost nowhere and trying to make the acquaintance of arkady 's young companions
0	that does not prevent me from being a liberal
0	well , did you see that ?
0	when you do , the tip of your nose wiggles very sweetly
0	well , and for a young man with such self-esteem , this was humiliating , especially in our day
0	on the other hand , once he settled in the country , he never left it again , even during the three winters nikolai petrovich spent with his son in petersburg
0	you think i am infallible that is , i have organized my life in such a way ?
0	a fly passed by , and it saw !
0	instead of the dialectic , life itself had arrived , and in his consciousness something altogether different had to be worked out
0	in the depths of his soul , pavel petrovich is just as much of a skeptic and empiricist as bazarov himself ; in practical life he always acted and acts as he sees fit , but in the realm of thought he is not able to admit this to himself and thus he adheres in words to doctrines which his actions continually contradict
0	so help me god , the game isn ’ t worth the candle , and i wasn ’ t intending to talk to you about anything very special
0	the fez and the carelessly knotted cravat carried a suggestion of the more free life in the country but the stiff collar of his shirt—not white , it is true , but striped as is correct for morning wear—stood up as inexorably as ever against his well-shaven chin
0	i will pour it myself , nikolai replied hurriedly
0	up to this point i have not been afraid
0	he ’ d begun beating her toward the end ; although she didn ’ t let him get away with it , about which i have detailed documentary evidence ; she weeps to this day when she remembers him and reproaches me
0	what are you saying ?
0	a garbling of razumikhin ’ s surname resulting from the confusion of rassudok ( reason , intellect ) and razum ( reason , mind )
0	everyone 's face looks stupid when they are asleep
0	is there really no hope ?
0	she waited for ten minutes , and we stood over her in silence
0	moreover , they are likely to be impostors , as frye calls them , people who lack self-knowledge
0	no , it ’ s as if it happened in another world
0	we want to organize our commune in a special way , but only on a broader foundation than previously
0	i want to live myself , or else it ’ s better not to live at all
0	does that make you angry , perhaps ?
0	we ’ ll save him , we ’ ll rescue him
0	they were alone ; no one saw them
0	strength , he said , what strength i still possess , yet i have to die !
0	when evgeny vasilevich first told me that one need not acknowledge any authorities , i felt such delight it was as if i suddenly saw the light !
0	he simply lost his nerve
0	he was about to set off in the opposite direction , not understanding why he had turned onto obukhovsky prospect , when all of a sudden , in one of the farthest open windows of the tavern , he saw svidrigaylov sitting there by the window at a tea table , a pipe in his mouth
0	he rushed to the corner , thrust his hand in , began pulling things out and loading them into his pockets
0	raskolnikov regarded him gloomily
0	as a matter of fact , i probably said that more for my own zeal , as raskolnikov had guessed
0	neither over himself , nor outside himself , nor within himself does he recognize a moderator ahead—no exalted goal ; in his mind—no high design , and yet he has such great capacities
0	there are such remarks as bazarov drew himself up haughtily
0	and if the author 's relation to that figure is of even vaguer character , if the author does not know himself whether he loves the created character or not ( as happened to me in regard to bazarov , since that involuntary attraction
0	you don ’ t need any money ?
0	the silence persisted , painful and awkward
0	wait till you ’ re called !
0	amaliya ivanovna wouldn ’ t accept this and declared at once that her vater from berlin vas a very , very important mann and valked mit ze hends in ze pockets and always said , poof !
0	everyone crowded toward petr petrovich
0	various attempts have been made to render compatible the two opposing views regarding turgenev 's intentions in the novel
0	you still have another percussion cap
0	perhaps you ’ ve been drinking ?
0	the author says practically nothing about his hero 's development , how such a character could have been formed
0	i see that to some people i can really seem to be a romantic figure
0	pushkin was never a soldier
0	i bet you haven ’ t even thought of that
0	from odintseva 's own illicit imagination , via a reference to this woman 's beautiful body , the narrator has come to a vision of her bathing
0	it ’ s because he ’ s going to jerusalem , lads ; he ’ s saying good-bye to his children and his motherland ; he ’ s bowing down to the whole world , kissing the capital city of st petersburg and the ground it stands on , added a tradesman who was also a little drunk
0	in my opinion , if you won ’ t dare to do it yourself , it ’ s not a matter of justice !
0	and that it was a strange thing , of course , to look for equality in a fight
0	raskolnikov regarded everything with a strange sensation of indifference and unconcern
0	surely it ’ s not forever
0	she ’ s a most charming creature !
0	what are you thinking about ?
0	i do not know ; but send someone to fetch her
0	he waited , tiptoed out , and ran downstairs
0	i manage my own estate , and , just imagine , have a steward named erofey—he 's a wonderful character , just like cooper 's pathfinder : there 's something so spontaneous about him !
0	even this gives me enjoyment !
0	with pleasure , replied bazarov
0	well , i wo not give up so easily , his brother muttered
0	it seems as if you ’ re burying me or saying farewell forever , he said in a somewhat strange manner
0	i ’ m afraid and scared ?
0	i know his theory
0	why are you getting restless ?
0	good lord , what a question !
0	there was a minute of gloomy silence
0	turgenev thus makes his own contributions to what mario praz discusses as the tradition of la belle dame sans merci ; see the romantic agony ( oxford , ) , pp
0	well , rodya , sit up
0	no , it wasn ’ t merely springtime delirium , dunechka said with animation
0	listen , katerina sergeevna : that 's really an insult
0	turgenev did not find one essential indictment against this type , and thus his voice , the voice of a man who finds himself in a camp which is inconsistent with his age and his views of life , has an especially important and decisive meaning
0	i didn ’ t like arguing and didn ’ t lose my temper—another bad sign !
0	i do not believe all those rumors heard in town ; but i do like to think , as our educated governor says , that they are well-founded
0	but a boat was unnecessary : a policeman ran down the steps to the edge of the canal , threw off his overcoat and boots , and plunged into the water
0	it ’ s clearly tempting and one doesn ’ t have to think !
0	the thief has been unmasked , and i intend to prosecute , sirs
0	i ’ m ashamed even to mention it
0	that ’ s precisely what he ’ s missing !
0	there was vodka , rum , and lisbon wine , all of very poor quality , but all in sufficient quantity
0	that means god spared us the trouble : last week he was constantly asking me to introduce him to you , porfiry , but i see that you ’ ve already sniffed each other out without me
0	her glance , fixed on his face , expressed horror and inconsolable sadness
0	it may well be the case that lionel trilling , the meaning of a literary idea , in his the liberal imagination : essays on literature and society ( new york , ) , pp
0	i ’ ve insisted several times that this question can be explained to novices only at the very end , when a person ’ s already committed to the system , when he ’ s educated and politically progressive
0	they sat there for two hours whispering all the time : now , katerina says , since semyon zakharych is back at work and receiving a salary , and he ’ s even been to see his excellency ; his excellency came out himself , told everyone else to wait , while he took semyon zakharych by the arm and escorted him into his office
0	that it might have been an apparition
0	how would they have parted today if the unexpected disaster with nikolai hadn ’ t occurred ?
0	boiled rice with raisins and honey , traditionally eaten at a funeral repast
0	excuse me , i can ’ t remember your surname , he said , bowing politely to razumikhin ) , insulted me by distorting an idea that i conveyed to you in a private conversation , over coffee , namely , that marriage to a poor young woman , one who had already experienced hardship in life , in my opinion , was more advantageous for conjugal relations than marriage to someone who ’ s known prosperity , since it ’ s more propitious for moral development
0	perhaps i would ’ ve been glad to die ?
0	perhaps katerina ivanovna considered herself obligated to her deceased husband to honor his memory as befitting , so that all the lodgers , including amaliya ivanovna , in particular , would know that not only was he no worse than they , but perhaps , even much better , and that not one of them had the right to look down his nose at him
0	there for the moment are some of the impressions i have gathered on the wing
0	has the world turned upside down , or what ?
0	he can hardly stand , while you think
0	after doing so , he pulled out the axe , wiped off the iron blade , and for a long time , almost three minutes , scrubbed the wooden handle where it was covered in blood , even using soap to wash it away
0	this ending too has failed to satisfy many critics , even one so perceptive as prince mirsky , who complains that there is something arbitrary in bazarov 's death
0	it ’ s all because this wretched kolya ’ s so stupid , he ’ s such a bother !
0	but imagine her surprise when pavel petrovich , pavel petrovich himself , brought her hand toward his lips and leaned over , without kissing it , merely emitting convulsive sighs from time to time
0	my head ’ s spinning even more
0	there is , she says , an invalid father , a retired civil servant , who sits in a wheelchair and hasn ’ t been able to move his legs for three years
0	a man who , perhaps , has feelings and sympathies , who may know a thing or two , but who ’ s lived his life
0	he immediately wrote a note to my mother and informed her that i ’ d given the money not to katerina ivanovna , but to sofiya semyonovna ; in addition , he made reference in the vilest language to her
0	raskolnikov said , turning and walking away
0	then he recovered immediately
0	they were an eyesore to me and so i started to sketch them
0	on the fourth day he turns to his father and straightforwardly and seriously tells him that he will die soon , shows him the red spots on his body which are a sign of infection , gives him the medical term for his illness , and coldly refutes the timid objections of the broken old man
0	it may be that you fear it without even knowing it—because you ’ re young !
0	why do you think that ?
0	i told you last time
0	i have a beneficial aim
0	but it was impossible to figure that out
0	the greatest twist on this metaphoric use of metaphor is bazarov 's own use of metaphor : as he lies dying , he metamorphoses into a romantic of the kind his scientism previously had caused him to scorn
0	by the way , i just mentioned the word happiness
0	toward the end of the vacation bazarov dies , almost by accident , becoming infected from a decomposing body , and kirsanov marries , having fallen in love with odintsov 's sister
0	well , confer quickly , but not in latin ; after all , i know the meaning of 'jam moritur
0	yes , physics ; natural sciences in general
0	the fact is , instinctually he was beginning to realize that lebezyatnikov was not only a vulgar and stupid little man , but , perhaps , even a paltry liar , and that he had no more important connections whatsoever even in his own circle , and merely heard something thirdhand ; furthermore , perhaps he didn ’ t even know his own propagandistic business very well , because he would get all mixed up ; so how could he possibly be a denouncer ?
0	she stood there a little while longer , regarded him with compassion , and left the room
0	in my personal opinion , you ’ re absolutely correct : force is an abomination
0	i thought all the time
0	i agree that ghosts appear only to sick people , but that merely proves that they can appear only to sick people , and not that they don ’ t exist at all
0	‡‡ slide , slide , the basque step !
0	he bowed and left
0	as soon as he saw the earrings , he forgot all about the apartment and about mitka , grabbed his cap , ran off to dushkin , and , as is known , received a ruble from him , lying to him , saying that he found them in the street , and then he went off on a spree
0	a drawing can show me at one glance what might take ten pages in a book to describe
0	he recalled how he had just passed petrovsky park , and even thought about it with revulsion
0	bazarov said all this with a look on his face as if he were thinking : you can believe me or not , it 's all the same to me !
0	next , he slowly reached into his vest pocket , extracted an enormous bulging gold pocket watch in a case , opened it , glanced at it slowly and lethargically , and put it back in his pocket
0	people who give up their intellectual independence and substitute servile worship for criticism , by giving themselves over completely to one or another prevailing theory , reveal that they are narrow , impotent , and often harmful people
0	to hell with the wine !
0	raskolnikov could have sworn that he had winked at him , only the devil knew why
0	remarked zosimov , almost licking his lips as the two of them emerged onto the street
0	oh , you silly children !
0	muttered pulkheriya aleksandrovna , but somehow unconsciously , as if still not taking in everything that had just happened
0	he began shivering and for a minute regarded the black water of the little neva with particular curiosity and even with a question in mind
0	why do you ask ?
0	even as recently as last week !
0	do you believe it ?
0	porfiry petrovich , however , seemed not to have heard these strange words
0	perhaps he has some intention
0	but somehow he failed to open the dresser : none of the keys fit the locks
0	you say that my article was unclear ; i ’ m prepared to explain it to you , as best i can
0	it was the first time he had addressed her after yesterday ’ s disagreement
0	besides , you yourself told me yesterday you were not satisfied
0	halfway up the stairs he could already hear the noise and lively conversation of the large gathering
0	successful is another question , but the very
0	that makes sense—they share the same temporal modality— the one to which their husbands have submitted and the one that is clearly valorized by the narrator in that last scene at marino
0	i thank you , kind sir , she began from on high
0	he looked at the children : they were all on their knees at the coffin ; polechka was crying
0	he 's a student in the medical faculty , observed nikolai petrovich and fell silent
0	if in my proposal there was even a one-millionth part of calculation , i wouldn ’ t have made it so openly ; and i wouldn ’ t be offering her only ten thousand , when only five weeks ago i was offering her more
0	the love of the fathers for the sons , however , hardly needs demonstration ; instances can be found in every scene in which they appear together
0	he muttered , with his half-witted glance fixed on the little girl ’ s bare feet
0	and i also wanted to tell you , but you interrupted me , that you were right just now when you decided not to try to learn these mysteries and secrets
0	he added with a bitter smile
0	besides , it doesn ’ t matter ; they still don ’ t know anything , he thought , and they ’ re already used to thinking of me as an eccentric
0	he will be up and dancing in three weeks !
0	i love the comforts of life , sitnikov intoned pompously
0	he frequently and deliberately emphasizes his plebeian origin , as in the ironic reference to his similarity to the great speransky , his sharp reaction to his father 's apologies , his feelings about pavel kirsanov , and in numerous turns of speech that the english translation can not convey completely
0	odintseva has accomplished what she intended : she has come to know herself
0	allow me to ask , as a father in all candor , what do you think of my evgeny ?
0	there 's a kind of charm in that young , fresh feeling
0	since then i have grown calmer , if not wiser
0	do you know what ?
0	just as soon as raskolnikov had opened the door to the street , suddenly , there on the stairs , he met razumikhin , who was coming into the tavern
0	what are you talking about ?
0	seeing that she now stood blocking the doorway and wouldn ’ t let him pass , he advanced directly on her
0	i want to lay it all out to you , how it all occurred , the whole story of that entire confusion , so to speak
0	all this happened in a moment , while walking , and the passerby , trying not to let his interest show , went on farther , reducing his speed , as if waiting for someone
0	were all the words spoken honestly between them , or did they both understand that each of them felt the same thing in her heart and mind , and there was no reason to utter it aloud or to talk about it
0	are you afraid you revealed some secret ?
0	if it ’ s on business , it ’ s too early
0	put your cap down , sir , it looks as if you plan to leave at once ; really , it ’ s uncomfortable to see it
0	would he not be terribly amazed and disconcerted if he were suddenly approached with the question whether his theorem was progressive or reactionary ?
0	why are you afraid of pavel petrovich ?
0	katya understands family and perfect peace ; the narrator gives her beliefs their due , but still seems to sense in them the air of rural sybaritism , of gogol 's old world landowners and , perhaps most of all , of oblomovka , the vegetable idyll
0	dunya smiled and extended her hand to him , but the worried look didn ’ t leave her face
0	in a word : let 's be friends just as we were before
0	suddenly he jumped as if someone had torn him from the sofa
0	he 's cut four new teeth already , and now his gums are swollen again
0	cried raskolnikov , raising himself on his pillow and staring at him with a piercing , flashing glance
0	we will not discuss here the description of nature , of russian nature , which is so difficult to describe and in describing which turgenev is such a master
0	perhaps you yourself were taken aback by it ?
0	the train was terribly late
0	but i would not have called that unhappiness
0	he caught himself having all sorts of
0	aren ’ t these all signs of madness ?
0	all is concise and clear , the sum is tallied , the account is rendered , and from the point of view from which the author approached the problem everything is perfectly correct
0	no , it is you , sir , rodion romanych , you , sir , and no one else , sir , porfiry whispered sternly and compellingly
0	well then , in the second place ?
0	that ol ’ nag ain ’ t good for nothin ’ !
0	that i killed a vile , malicious louse , an old moneylender , needed by no one ; to murder her would pardon forty sins ; she used to suck the lifeblood out of the poor , and you call that a crime ?
0	he is ruled only by his whims or his personal calculations
0	the difference in question was most succinctly formulated by kant in the previous century when he defined an aesthetic idea as one that could only be grasped intuitively , in contradistinction to a rational idea , to which no intuition could ever be adequate
0	he was drunk and wound up under the horses ’ hooves !
0	the old woman was merely an illness
0	you should make a statement to the police , porfiry replied with the same businesslike expression , to the effect that , having learned about such and such an occurrence , that is , about the murder , you request , in turn , to inform the examining magistrate who was delegated to this case that such and such items belong to you and that you wish to redeem them
0	i was joking just now , of course , but look : on the one hand , here ’ s a stupid , mindless , worthless , spiteful , sick old hag , needed by no one—on the contrary , causing harm to everyone ; she herself doesn ’ t know what she ’ s living for , and she ’ ll die of her own accord tomorrow
0	i just learned about it from pashenka
0	give me yours , too
0	the narrator understands this position , understands above all the warmth of the life it makes possible , but clings unsurely to his disapproval of prosaic routine as deadening and lethargic
0	his pale , exhausted face even flushed with color
0	why pose such empty questions ?
0	he just came to , said nastasya
0	but whatever happened , the main thing was we did not need each other ; there was too much—how can i put it ? —
0	so this is how you live , sonya !
0	here he comes himself onto the porch of the house
0	but the person he really feared was svidrigaylov
0	bazarov is no longer haunted by wondering : the question of the date of the approaching anniversary has been answered and we have come to the scene of bazarov 's grave , to the grieving parents , to turgenev 's assertion that the flowers speak of eternal reconciliation and not just of
0	he could not get the sound of her voice out of his ears ; the very folds of her dress seemed to hang in a special way , more gracefully and elegantly than all the rest , and her movements were particularly smooth , yet natural at one and the same time
0	what does it mean to run away ?
0	i ’ ve told him so much about you at different times
0	either he did it on purpose , or else he was very drunk
0	at the age of twenty-eight he would already earned the rank of captain ; a brilliant career lay ahead of him
0	so she hands the promissory note over to this chebarov in payment for something , and he lodges a formal claim , and won ’ t be put off
0	you ’ ll drive yourself mad this way , i can assure you
0	once he began to recover , he recalled his dreams when he ’ d lain there in a fever and delirium
0	in public carriages or in shops , seizing upon some listener , she would lead the conversation to her son , his article , how he helped a student , how he was burned in the fire , and so forth
0	there is nothing left for me but , in the words of the gipsy song , to take off my hat with a very low bow
0	but especially avdotya romanovna
0	i ’ m fond of children in general , very fond of them , svidrigaylov said with a laugh
0	zametov seemed a little confused , but not overly so
0	what does talent and even erudition have to do with that ?
0	it must have been that the young man glanced at her with some special sort of look , because her former distrust suddenly flashed in her eyes again
0	well , just imagine that as i was on the train on my way here , i was counting on you to tell me something new and on the fact that i might be able to borrow something from you !
0	i ’ ll head out now , to petrovsky park : somewhere in there i ’ ll choose a large bush , dripping with rain , such that if i touch it at all with my shoulder , millions of drops will splash down on my head
0	but raskolnikov , expecting something completely different , regarded him vacantly and pensively and made no reply , as if he were definitely hearing petr petrovich ’ s name for the first time
0	they all live together in one room ; sonya has her own room , with a partition
0	any sort of excitement can be harmful we will talk more about it
0	the forms and types with which we can be contented and feel no need to look further have not yet been and perhaps never will be created by life
0	you must excuse my persistence ( i ’ m really sorry to bother you like this ) , but don ’ t you see : you ’ ve managed to reassure me now about my mistake , confusing your two categories , but
0	if i know , raskolnikov continued , staring steadfastly at her face as if he lacked the power to look away
0	he began to appear everywhere as soon as he became an officer
0	there must be some other motive , but what is it ?
0	well , here you are !
0	this boulevard was always deserted , and now , after one o ’ clock and in such heat , there was almost no one there at all
0	he surveyed raskolnikov ’ s cramped and shabby ship ’ s cabin with uncertainty , even with the pretense of a certain fright , almost as though taking offense
0	who spit on them ?
0	do you understand what it is that angers me most ?
0	after about ten minutes , however , she felt significantly calmer
0	he went on at length , trying to show off his erudition , and then left , tail between his legs
0	ja , herr kapitän , and he vas a nein respectable guest , herr kapitän , in mein respectable haus
0	then he said that he himself was not wealthy and that his entire estate would pass to his children , who are now living with their aunt
0	the crisis of culture , wrote the russian philosopher nikolai berdyaev in , reveals itself in a longing to escape from the middle course into some sort of all-resolving end
0	what will i do with them , rodion romanych !
0	what do you think ?
0	when he ’ d bowed to the earth a second time in the haymarket , turning to the left he ’ d glimpsed sonya some fifty paces away from him
0	her scarlet lips were aglow , burning or what ?
0	her light blond , slightly grayed hair was thickly smeared with grease
0	comforting oneself in the hard moments of life with a lofty goal is , if you will , just the same as drinking unsweetened tea while gazing on a piece of sugar hung from the ceiling
0	providence , accident , irony or fate ?
0	you have comforted me greatly
0	dunechka smiled at him , blushed , quickly withdrew her hand , and followed her mother out , also feeling happy for some reason
0	well this , my esteemed laviza ivanovna , is my last word , and i won ’ t tell you again , continued the lieutenant
0	yes , i ’ m really a louse , he continued , clinging to his thought with malice , burrowing into it , playing with it , enjoying it
0	is what they say about her completely true , huh ?
0	besides , i was looking for you , gentlemen , not to pay you any compliments ; in the first place , i wanted to let you know we will be eating soon ; in the second place , i wanted to warn you , evgeny you are a clever lad , you understand people , and you understand women ; therefore , you will forgive them your mother requested a church service to celebrate your coming home
0	you should have seen how i chatted with her papa and mama !
0	he ’ ll be cared for by his own people ; they ’ ll help right away , or else he ’ ll die before he gets to the hospital
0	luiza ivanovna , why don ’ t you take a seat ?
0	while i , perhaps , so to speak , have burned with devotion and lofty feelings ; in addition , i have importance , rank , and position !
0	raskolnikov himself lay on his back in silence and stubbornly , though without thinking , studied the gentleman who had just entered
0	i hope you ’ ll be cured of your mental illness and your shortsightedness
0	nastasya , who came in at ten o ’ clock the next morning , roused him with difficulty
0	he ’ s only known her since yesterday , and he didn ’ t even recognize her when she entered
0	perhaps , i ’ ll come
0	this is his doctor , who ’ s just examined him
0	what else was it that i wanted to say , he continued , trying to recall
0	how does it go in that tale
0	here i am , you see , just like cincinnatus , preparing a bed for some late turnips
0	that settled all my doubts ; he ’ s the culprit , no doubt about it
0	nikolai petrovich was forced to rummage through twenty boxes and trunks to find them
0	will not raise the question of talent and artistic merit but rather whether its author is the historian or ringleader of the party
0	you won ’ t know it even an hour before that you ’ ll come forward with a confession
0	it was a green cotton shawl , probably the same one marmeladov had mentioned back then , the family shawl
0	how your understanding still hinders you !
0	he added in a timid voice
0	he would have calmly overstepped all those obstacles
0	not a word here , or i ’ ll
0	what a thing to say , sir
0	pavel petrovich kirsanov was educated first at home , like his younger brother , nikolai , and subsequently in the corps of pages '
0	meatless cabbage soup with cockroaches in it ?
0	so you see , evgeny , said arkady , finishing his story , how unfair you were to judge my uncle !
0	where your free mind draws you
0	arkady and bazarov spent their fifteen days at odintseva 's in just such a manner
0	i almost got into a fight !
0	and it would have been to no avail !
0	he left quietly , without hurrying , unaware of his fever , full of an immense , new feeling of full , powerful life surging within him
0	the small nobleman 's house built in the moscow style where avdotya ( or evdoksiya ) nikitishna kukshina lived , stood on one of the recently burnt-out streets in the town of ; it 's a well-known fact that our provincial towns burn down every five years or so
0	even before the novel was published his editor , mikhail katkov , protested to turgenev
0	according to you , they are fine fellows , is not that so ?
0	katya dropped both hands and the basket into her lap ; she lowered her head , her eyes following arkady for a long time
0	pavel petrovich once again turned the book over in his hands and glanced at his brother from under his brows
0	but tell me this : how does one distinguish the extraordinary people from the ordinary ones ?
0	i ’ m fed up with all of this , sir , do you hear , and have been for some time
0	yesterday i was in great danger and thought all was lost ; today things have improved
0	some of them were over forty years old , but others were only about seventeen ; almost all had black eyes
0	hey , bring me some water !
0	death is bearable because life goes on
0	once and for all i realize that it ’ s not for me to try to understand or demand to know your reasons
0	what on earth are you saying ?
0	i think tea 's ready , odintsova announced
0	nowhere is there anything firm or solid ; nowhere is there any core
0	who knows , perhaps we were talking at the very same moment he was lying here , devising his own plan
0	good-bye , rodya , that is , until we meet ; i don ’ t like saying good-bye
0	there was something infinitely disgusting and offensive in that laughter , in those eyes , in all the nastiness in the child ’ s face
0	it seems that now
0	instead , this letter arrived this morning
0	fedka served the meal , obviously encumbered by unfamiliar boots ; he was aided by a woman named anfisushka , who had a masculine face and only one eye , who performed the duties of housekeeper , poultry keeper , and laundress
0	did he reproach himself for his own weakness ?
0	well , and if you ’ re not up to it , will you repent ?
0	the older girl , half awake , trembled like a leaf
0	razumikhin stood there deep in thought and uneasiness , trying to ponder something
0	paris , march ( ) , i have not yet received a copy of my tale , but three letters have already arrived about the thing from pisemsky , dostoevsky , and maykov
0	go out for a stroll ; but don ’ t go too far
0	you ’ re lying , you slanderer !
0	however , just to one side , about fifteen paces away , at the edge of the street , stood a gentleman , who , by all appearances , also very much wanted to approach the young woman for some purpose
0	instead , arkady , who has absorbed much more of the homely prosaic values of his mother and father than he realizes , comes to appreciate katya bit by tiny bit , while she is still in the background and his attention is focussed mainly on odintsova
0	did you see him ?
0	raskolnikov paused in the entryway
0	the certificate of merit was immediately passed around by the drunken guests , which katerina ivanovna did not prevent , because it really did indicate en toutes lettres that she was the daughter of a decorated court councillor , and as a result , almost in fact a colonel ’ s daughter
0	a little surprise , sir , right here , waiting on the other side of my door , hee-hee-hee !
0	you ’ re exactly what i want , he cried , grabbing him by the arm
0	the sanctioning of bloodshed as a matter of conscience ; why , in my opinion , that ’ s more terrible than an official or legal sanction to shed blood
0	he regarded them closely
0	this man has become used to looking on dreams as on a whim , peculiar to idleness and aristocratic pampering ; he has begun to consider moral sufferings to be products of daydreams ; moral aspirations and actions as imagined and ridiculous
0	you imagine that you are progressive ; you should be sitting in a kalmuck wagon !
0	and he set off toward sonya ’ s apartment
0	he was suddenly struck by the fact that sonya wanted to go with him
0	the idea ( ie , the form ) of fathers and sons is biographical
0	that old pawnbroker says ?
0	oh , where is the golden age of our youth ? )
0	he stared cautiously and distrustfully at the unexpected guest
0	you have probably experienced this more than once yourself
0	the obvious poverty of their apparel managed to convey to both ladies a look of special distinction , which always happens with those who know how to wear humble clothes
0	moreover , we ’ ll devise our own casuistry , we ’ ll learn from the jesuits , and perhaps we ’ ll reassure ourselves for a while , persuade ourselves that it ’ s necessary , really necessary for a good cause
0	raskolnikov entered almost exactly at the same time they were returning from the cemetery
0	managing the estate did not arouse any revulsion in him : he even used to dream about agricultural activity with pleasure , but at the present time other thoughts were swarming in his head
0	that 's also hard to believe
0	fenechka sat down in silence on the edge of the armchair
0	bazarov is my favorite child , for whom i quarreled with katkov , on whom i expended all the colors at my disposal , bazarov , that bright man , that hero—a caricature ?
0	he considers it completely unnecessary to lay any restraint whatsoever on himself
0	and right now , this very minute , without delay !
0	he felt terribly distressed
0	and just who might you be , sir ?
0	you see how i trust you , arkady ivanovich , that ’ s just how she put it
0	bazarov extended his long , tough fingers arkady turned around and prepared , as if in jest , to resist but his friend 's face appeared so malicious , his twisted grin and gleaming eyes contained such an earnest threat , that arkady felt an instinctive fear
0	what sort of truth is that ?
0	he was afraid of sonya
0	they both went out at last
0	she cried in a heart-rending wail and rushed to katerina ivanovna
0	i endured all the torment of this chatter , sonya , and wanted to shake it all off my shoulders : i wanted , sonya , to kill without casuistry , to kill for myself , for myself alone !
0	i heard about that murder before you told me , and i ’ m very interested in it
0	bryullov replied : art begins where the tiny bit begins
0	he was agitated and didn ’ t try to hide it
0	you don ’ t understand a thing , not a thing !
0	but instead of that , his head slid down onto the pillow again ; an unbearable chill rendered him numb once more ; he pulled his coat over himself again
0	her pale cheeks flushed once more , and her eyes expressed her torment
0	anna sergeevna wanted to say a kind word or two to him , but did not know where to begin
0	in general he was an extremely well-preserved man who seemed much younger than his years
0	the food 's well prepared , is not it ?
0	petr petrovich moved his arm around in a circle , displaying the banknote to everyone
0	you know , my precious rodya , it seems to me , for several reasons ( however , by no means related to petr petrovich , but just so , for some of my very own , personal , perhaps even old-womanish whims ) —it seems to me that perhaps i ’ d be better off if , after their wedding , i were to live on my own , as i do now , and not with them
0	vasily ivanovich left the room
0	it 's all the same thing
0	he crossed himself several times
0	in a word , he chooses the lesser of two evils , although he feels no attraction even to the lesser evil
0	everything receded immediately , and his thoughts became clear
0	porfiry was silent , as if pondering
0	he wrote that turgenev , with his devotion to timeless truth and beauty , only wanted to describe reality , not to judge it
0	several times , however , it happened that she herself began a conversation in which it became impossible , in answering her , not to mention where rodya was at the present time ; when the replies were , of necessity , unsatisfactory and suspect , she suddenly became extremely sad , gloomy , and taciturn , which condition continued for a very long time
0	besides , who wants to be a cardsharp ?
0	we arranged all that to upset you , therefore we intentionally spread the rumor that he would leak to you
0	well , just like that he ’ ll circle , circle around me , like a moth around a flame ; his freedom will no longer satisfy him ; he ’ ll start thinking , become confused , leading himself all around ; he ’ ll get tangled up in a net and worry himself to death !
0	then he declared that he himself would seek a meeting with you , by any means possible
0	it was completely unbecoming , sir
0	someone stood imperceptibly next to the lock and , precisely the way he was doing outside , was listening , hiding inside , apparently , also pressing one ear to the door
0	her light blue dress trimmed with white lace spread out around her chair like a balloon and filled almost half the room
0	raskolnikov was already entering the apartment
0	revolution , while clearly anticipating his portrayal of yelena and insarov in on the eve
0	soaked to the skin , at twenty minutes past eleven he called at the crowded apartment of his fiancée ’ s parents on vasilievsky island , at the corner of malyi prospect and the third line
0	who made me a judge to decide who gets to live and who doesn ’ t ?
0	it was an attempt to give flesh and substance to his image of the new men , whose mysterious , implacable presence , he declared , he felt about him everywhere , and who inspired in him feelings that he found difficult to analyse
0	almost crying herself ( which didn ’ t hinder her incessant and uninterrupted rapid speech ) , katerina ivanovna pointed at her sniveling children
0	did you , i ask , see mitrei ?
0	although petr petrovich was kind enough to take upon himself a portion of the cost of our journey to the capital , namely , he offered to convey at his expense our baggage and a large trunk ( somehow through his acquaintances there ) , we still have to consider our arrival in petersburg , where we can ’ t show up without a kopeck , if only for the first few days
0	the rudins did not become practical men , from them came a new generation , which regards its predecessors with reproach and mockery
0	his head was spinning
0	where do we put him ?
0	and now you stand here looking so beautiful
0	children are a social question and one of primary importance , i agree ; but the question of children will be resolved in another manner
0	here 's an example : in a few minutes it will be ten o'clock and i know full well you will chase me out
0	yet can our interpretation of the novel stop here ?
0	i embrace you very , very warmly and kiss you endlessly
0	around one o'clock in the morning , he made an effort to open his eyes and saw before him in the lamplight his father 's pale face and ordered him to go away ; he obeyed , but immediately crept back in on tiptoe and , half-hidden by the
0	so , i ’ m amusing myself for the sake of fantasy : games !
0	if they ’ d both left , the door would have been locked with a key from the outside , and not with the bolt from inside
0	it is not adequate , he insists , to think of ideas only as being highly formulated ; they need not be pellets of intellection or crystallizations of thought , precise and completed
0	he didn ’ t want to ask anyone about anything
0	according to me , bazarov objected , raphael is not worth a damn and they are no better than he is
0	the sun shone so brightly in his eyes that it was painful for him to see and he felt very dizzy—the usual sensation of a feverish person who suddenly comes outside into the blinding sunshine
0	cholera began to make an appearance here and there in the neighborhood and even carried off two people from marino itself
0	i still wo not understand a thing
0	the connection between the two appears even more ineluctable to anyone who has seen the famous photo of secenov , taken in , the year turgenev completes fathers and sons : we see a fierce-eyed , hirsute young man sitting at his work table in the medico-surgical academy , complete with bunsen burner , electrical charging mechanism and a laboratory clamp from which are suspended—of course—three frogs
0	raskolnikov said all of a sudden
0	mama writes that you can tolerate many things
0	bazarov separates himself from ordinary life
0	the titles alone are worth the price !
0	in his own work he is lost in the woods
0	i began telling him everything that happened , and he began pacing around the room , beating his chest : what , he says , what are you scoundrels doing to me ?
0	the previous , horribly tormenting , hideous feeling returned to him all the more distinctly and vividly ; he shuddered with every sound , yet it seemed more and more enjoyable to him
0	cried porfiry petrovich cheerfully
0	you were a student or you ’ ve studied at the university !
0	andrey semyonych thought about this and remembered it subsequently
0	a student , naturally , or former student !
0	but , my goodness , what sort of clothes is he wearing ?
0	am i much too agitated ?
0	she took a commission , went about on business , and had a large clientele because she was so honest and always set the best price : whatever price she stated , she stuck to it
0	if you dare take even one step forward , i swear , i ’ ll kill you !
0	bring them back , sonya , bring them back !
0	you can imagine how that ’ ll affect her
0	what do people usually say ?
0	so , we meet again , as you promised
0	why do i hate them now ?
0	so , you don ’ t love me ?
0	listen : he knows the merchant vakhrushin !
0	oh , you ’ re so rude , you even interpret—forgive me—the word development ’ in a stupid manner !
0	he 's embittered and gloomy—that 's what 's so terrible
0	or can i perhaps take him away from you ?
0	out , — experience again told me—perhaps mistakenly , but , i repeat , scrupulously ; there was no reason for hair-splitting , and i had to depict him precisely that way
0	are you in good health ?
0	excuse me , but i must say that the rumors that have reached you , or , better to say , those conveyed to you , haven ’ t the least trace of solid foundation , and i
0	perhaps everyone will join you
0	this amount ( i can now explain it all to you , precious rodya ) she ’ d accepted mostly so she could send you sixty rubles , which you needed then and which you received from us last year
0	pushkin felt that deeply ; not for nothing did he write in his immortal sonnet , that sonnet that every beginning writer should memorize and remember like a commandment ;
0	forgive a stupid old woman like me
0	at that moment his father , who ’ d been chasing him , finally grabs hold of him and leads him away from the crowd
0	und no shkandal , none vatever , und zey came trunken , und i vill tell all , herr kapitän , und i ’ m not guilty
0	besides , this businesslike and earnest man seemed in such disharmony with the entire gathering ; in addition , it was clear that he had come for something important , probably only some unusual reason could bring him into such company ; therefore something was about to happen , something would occur
0	saying good night to his mother , he kissed her forehead ; she embraced him and stealthily crossed him three times behind his back
0	does he really take me for an innocent man ?
0	hey , listen to an old man , i ’ m speaking in earnest , rodion romanovich
0	was he grasping at straws ?
0	and this is called nihilism , bazarov repeated again , this time with particular rudeness
0	be so good as to provide the required response
0	but then , on the slope of a gently rising hill at long last there appeared a small village where bazarov 's parents lived
0	ah , you ’ re not asleep ; well , here i am !
0	what ’ s the matter , rodya , i don ’ t know , she said at last
0	i prefer cigars , too , but it 's extremely difficult to obtain them in remote areas like this
0	only where his trousers were frayed and the fringe hung down did there remain some thick spots of dried blood
0	but in the doorway , her rear end collided with a stately officer who had a fresh , open face and who sported a splendid , thick blond mustache
0	even organ grinders can scrape money together ; now everyone will pay special attention to us and will realize that we ’ re a poor , respectable family of orphans , reduced to poverty
0	bazarov 's whole depiction in this novel is only the beginning , the embryo of some future figure
0	thanks for the offer , anna sergeevna , and for the flattering opinion of my conversational skills
0	but why should pisarev 's ideal interest us ?
0	soon his eyes came to rest on little lidochka ( his favorite )
0	i must attend the funeral of that same civil servant who was trampled by horses , about whom you
0	here one must hold one 's personal antipathy in check since under some conditions it can turn into the involuntary slander of people who do not have the opportunity to defend themselves with the same weapons
0	he went right to sonya ’ s room
0	haven ’ t you done the same thing ?
0	in essence , then , through the dialectic , chaos metamorphoses into cosmos , duality into unity
0	isn ’ t dunya home , mama ?
0	and this can happen with the cleverest fellow , with a psychologist or a writer , sir !
0	katya went to the piano unwillingly ; arkady , although he really did love music , followed her unwillingly
0	she stared intently at the bed and at the priest ; she was also panting from running so fast
0	this stillness is because of the moon , thought raskolnikov
0	when the cuckold ’ s horns are worn openly , as in a common-law marriage , then they no longer exist ; they ’ re inconceivable and even lose the designation as horns
0	that ’ s the worst thing you could do !
0	and if he had no other way open to him , he would have strangled her without letting her utter a sound , without even stopping to think !
0	and all of this was about to fall through !
0	at the one place in the novel where he exposes his inner feelings with ruthless honesty , the scene beneath the haystack , there is the following solemn exchange :
0	that 's what i think , too
0	an enraged razumikhin roared at last
0	it 's all the same , sir ; i express myself so i will be understood ; i am no seminary rat
0	so that ’ s my fault as well ?
0	he said to himself
0	andrey semyonych can bear witness to all this
0	he grabbed the bottle of wine and hurled it offhandedly out the window
0	that alyona ivanovna ’ s really terrified you !
0	everyone gets rich in his own way , so i also wanted to do so quickly
0	did you promise to marry her , perhaps
0	did you think i had water in my veins ?
0	perhaps you ’ re just telling lies , replied raskolnikov
0	what ’ s it matter to you ?
0	they had been awake since seven , or even earlier
0	at least in a properly organized society it wo not make any difference whether a person 's stupid or clever , bad or good
0	he asked suddenly and burst into puzzling laughter
0	did you really see him ?
0	i ’ m completely certain of it even without you
0	bazarov and odintsova argue about art and the ideology of love , about nihilism versus romanticism , but something else that they do not notice is happening
0	perhaps we ’ ll become closer
0	is that also a moral phenomenon ?
0	no—i needed her tears ; i needed to see her fear , to see how her heart aches and how she suffers !
0	oh , how bazarov would have made fun of him , if only he would known what he was feeling at that moment !
0	bazarov is a man ready for life , and can not find it
0	sonechka replied suddenly , in a strong and swift whisper , and then suddenly dropped her eyes again
0	it was apparent that he was prepared to wait a long time
0	pavel petrovich asked with studied courtesy
0	the princess had retired to her own room upstairs ; she could not stand guests in general , especially these new wild-looking ones , as she called them
0	don ’ t worry , i won ’ t let him get her , sir , said the mustachioed policeman and set off after them
0	even so , i have forgiven him !
0	a doctor was here , a priest , too , and everything ’ s in order
0	it ’ s clear as day , clear as day , nikodim fomich repeated excitedly
0	done for , no doubt !
0	raskolnikov couldn ’ t keep from laughing
0	perhaps he ’ ll never love anyone , replied razumikhin abruptly
0	when he is sick , he takes medicine , although he feels no direct inclination to swallow castor oil or assafetida
0	in its own way
0	he muttered , growing pale and moving toward the wall
0	in his heart and soul he was delighted with his friend 's proposal , but he considered it his obligation to conceal his emotions
0	love dunya , your sister , rodya ; love her as she loves you , and know that she loves you without limit , more than she loves herself
0	it must be so , because as soon as sofiya semyonovna entered the room , petr petrovich asked me , were you here ?
0	she held the gun ready
0	she finally grew so sick and tired of him , even though at first she would say that she would have been completely lost had it not been for this obliging and generous man
0	he braced himself with all his might , preparing for some terrible and unknown catastrophe
0	i do not want to become delirious , he whispered , clenching his fists , what nonsense that is !
0	so you won ’ t be at katerina ivanovna ’ s tomorrow ?
0	in the corridor they bumped into luzhin : he showed up precisely at eight o ’ clock and was searching for the number of the room , so all three of them entered together , but without looking at or greeting each other
0	in general , something oppressed him inside , but not too much
0	in particular , don ’ t ask him about his health
0	oh , these vile characters !
0	when would you appear , at what moment ?
0	then , all that morning , as if intentionally , one unpleasantness followed another
0	it was as if during all this horrible time his heart had suddenly softened
0	have you ever heard how people with this illness breathe
0	even your hands are trembling !
0	what book do you have there ?
0	bazarov 's appearance on the scene offers her a chance to escape from this temporal stagnation ; after all , he is the quintessential man of history pss ,
0	katerina ivanovna immediately emphasized to her that since she was a slut , she couldn ’ t judge what genuine nobility really was
0	well , yes something like an epidemic
0	the sun was scorching ; a smell of warm rye bread wafted from the dark passage of the carriage inn
0	as is well known , turgenev spent the winter of - in berlin , where he shared quarters with a fellow hegelian , mikhail bakunin , and attended lectures on hegelian philosophy given by the letter 's berlin disciples and interpreters
0	bazarov is something else
0	bazarov looked around the room
0	the proximity of the haymarket , the abundance of certain establishments , and , primarily , the population of tradesmen and craftsmen , all crowded into these streets and lanes of central petersburg , sometimes filled the general panorama with such subjects that it would be strange to be surprised at all on meeting another such figure
0	i can ’ t just up and reveal everything to you , hee-hee !
0	and he himself would not now deny the fact that he ’ d known it all at the time
0	he merely felt and knew that everything had to change , one way or another , no matter how , he repeated with desperate , resolute self-assurance and decisiveness
0	the old woman dug into her pocket for her keys and went into the other room behind the curtain
0	all of a sudden he shuddered
0	they ’ ve simply detained them , but one shouldn ’ t assume
0	well , and has arkasha been here again ?
0	bewildered figure simultaneously attacked by frantic democrats from the left and threatened by armed fathers from the right , as he stood helplessly between them
0	half an hour ago , ilya petrovich , the police superintendent ’ s assistant , on the staircase
0	one doesn ’ t have to go far : do you know how , a year and a half ago , he astounded me , shocked me , and was nearly the death of me , when he decided to marry that girl , what ’ s her name—the daughter of this zarnitsyna woman , his landlady ?
0	vasily ivanovich grew animated
0	oh , that was a long time ago !
0	he couldn ’ t even imagine such brutality , such rage
0	you ’ re being pursued and tormented on a stupid , foul suspicion
0	he said suddenly in a low but clear , intelligible voice
0	how do you explain his finding the earrings , if he really found them as he maintains ?
0	annoyances stemming from running the household depressed him ; it always seemed to him that nikolai petrovich , in spite of his zeal and love for hard work , did not set about things in the right way , although he was unable to specify the exact nature of nikolai 's failings
0	please do not be angry , evgeny , continued vasily ivanovich , wo not you let me check your pulse ?
0	what lies you ’ re telling !
0	i merely said that in his own way he was a good man !
0	there was a dresser against the third wall
0	his movements were precise and assured , his certain intentions clear
0	excuse my audacity , but you do not love me and never will , is not that so ?
0	thousands of lives saved from wrack and ruin—for one life ?
0	only now do i see clearly the full absurdity of my faintheartedness , now that i have resolved to face this unnecessary shame !
0	i didn ’ t leave the country for seven years
0	marry fenechka she loves you ; she 's the mother of your son
0	in spite of all my desires , i was unable to meet you yesterday
0	he was very poor and he alone supported himself completely , earning money by some sort of work
0	what do you think , judging by the nature of our legal system : will they accept such facts , are they even capable of accepting them—based exclusively on a psychological impossibility , on their mental disposition—as irresistible facts obliterating all accusatory and material evidence , no matter what they are ?
0	ilya petrovich had seated himself and was rifling through some papers
0	listen , arkady that 's the way contemporary young people should express themselves !
0	no shouting , if you please !
0	who do not pay their quitrent ?
0	thank god , i am free , i have no children what was that i just said ?
0	raskolnikov was out of breath and didn ’ t finish what he was saying
0	besides , the state councillor ivan ivanovich klopshtok—have you ever heard of him ?
0	he ’ s worn that shirt of his too long , like some old rag , and torn it all to pieces
0	even nastasya hadn ’ t touched it
0	i myself am renting a room from lodgers
0	toward morning the fever worsened a bit and he became slightly delirious
0	ah , you don ’ t know her ?
0	what a slippery fish you are !
0	sometime i will tell you the story of my life but first you must tell me yours
0	are you all ears ?
0	then you don ’ t know such a virtuous man !
0	razumikhin opened the door and stood on the threshold for some time , as if in thought
0	the coach headed in the direction of nikolskoe
0	i ’ d still like to have a few words with you
0	you smoke , do not you ?
0	for a moment , he left the young woman and approached the gentleman
0	it was delivered only a quarter of an hour ago , raskolnikov replied loudly and over his shoulder , also suddenly and unexpectedly growing angry , even taking a certain pleasure in this feeling
0	he made a complete confession to her
0	it turned out that a doctor lived two houses away
0	why did you come looking for me when i first fell ill ?
0	but , in spite of the fact that we may very soon be meeting in person , i ’ ll still be sending you some money in a few days , as much as i can
0	but if that were the case , of course they ’ d be coming for him at any moment , because
0	this was the first time he would become aware of any distance between him and his son ; he felt that with each passing day this distance would increase
0	you bushy beard , you
0	the present condition of the people demands it , arkady added pompously
0	cried porfiry petrovich , emerging from his momentary stupor
0	and when we started scrutinizing your article then , when you began expounding on it—we understood each and every one of your words in two ways , as if there were another word implied by each !
0	she had been singing her rhymed ditty with the same serious and respectful look on her face
0	he ’ s insane , thought raskolnikov
0	arkady lowered his eyes
0	either in the family or in the social sphere , that does not deserve absolute and merciless rejection
0	he thought suddenly in a fit of unlimited malice
0	what seems to enrage bazarov is that arkadi can accept the unity of life and death , can see death as a part of life rather than as its negation
0	so , what should i do , tell me !
0	repeated lebezyatnikov , staring directly at him
0	they ’ ll be carted off to the police
0	even i know she wasn ’ t a louse , he replied , looking at her strangely
0	one way or another , i can state once more : there would ’ ve been no unpleasantness if it hadn ’ t been for the incident in the garden
0	he is not interested in the trifles of which commonplace human relationships are composed ; it would be impossible to insult him with obvious disdain or to make him happy with signs of respect ; he is so full of himself and stands so unshakably high in his own eyes that he is almost completely indifferent to other people 's opinions
0	he whispered at last
0	about ten minutes passed
0	they ’ ll come to an agreement !
0	no , what do you think , the same one about whom it ’ s said that this girl
0	she was shy and compliant , but only to a certain extent
0	greift nur hinein ins volle menschenleben !
0	raskolnikov rushed after him
0	evgeny vasilich , tell me , what 's going on ?
0	it was very dark on the narrow , steep stairs
0	so they ’ re really in there !
0	another reference to chernyshevsky ’ s novel what is to be done ?
0	you have to trick the cleverest person with the simplest matter
0	aniska doesn ’ t make them like this
0	she would smile and bow to them ; they all loved it when she smiled at them
0	but when he reached the bottom , he suddenly heard hurried footsteps behind him
0	svidrigaylov muttered to himself , frowning
0	a quotation from nikolai gogol ’ s ( – ) comedy the government inspector ( )
0	let me kiss the hem of your dress , let me , please !
0	i haf respectable haus , herr kapitän , und respectable vay of life , herr kapitän , and i never , never vanted no shkandal in mine haus
0	ah , rodya , all this happened before two o ’ clock
0	he looked at this unhappy deranged woman almost with torment
0	he spat in disgust and hastened back to the crystal palace to interrogate zametov as quickly as possible
0	like kukshina—she still has the nicest pair of shoulders i have seen in a long time
0	first , that an interplay between science and literature is possible because both are , in the end , exercises in language
0	suddenly he wanted to understand precisely what was so strange about her
0	there was nowhere to hide
0	you may be right ; an outsider can see things more clearly
0	i must tell you
0	anna sergeevna started to say , but the wind came up , rustled the leaves , and carried her voice away
0	moreover , each does so in the same way , by psychologically entrenching a sense of self in a single temporal stage : one in the past , one in the present , and one in the future
0	he has become an icon
0	it ’ s past ten o ’ clock !
0	five months after the criminal ’ s confession came his sentencing
0	he 's more deserving of compassion than mockery
0	imagine , one of my neighbors , a retired major , also treats patients
0	dunechka shuddered and came to herself
0	at the beginning of his prison term , he ’ d thought that she would torment him with religion , that she would talk about the gospel , and pester him with books
0	dunya was in a frenzy
0	really , i thought i would have some sort of fit ; i never imagined that i could reach such a state of frenzy
0	and she also didn ’ t like her cap with the new ribbons : isn ’ t this stupid german woman taking pride in the fact that she ’ s the landlady and has agreed to help some poor lodgers out of charity ?
0	asked nastasya , holding a saucer in her open hand and sipping her tea through a lump of sugar†
0	why did you lead her on then ?
0	he found bazarov at the inn where they were staying and spent a long time persuading him to visit the governor
0	at least , that was how he saw it
0	she timidly prepared herself to listen to him
0	guzbery jam , lots of fresh flowers , and a songbird in a cage
0	it was a spacious , lofty room , furnished rather elegantly , but without any particular taste
0	he rejects life yet at the same time lives profoundly and strongly
0	he ’ d arrived there , removed his cross , a silver one , and asked for a glass of vodka in exchange
0	i got all mixed up !
0	yet i am assured that i was on the side of the fathers i , who in the character of pavel kirsanov even erred against artistic truth and overdid it , practically turned his faults into caricature , made him comic !
0	with that , and conveying my special regards to the respected avdotya romanovna , i beg you to accept my feelings of respectful devotion ,
0	i ’ m certain that she already understands half of it
0	we physiologists know what these relations are
0	i ’ ve reached the conclusion that it ’ s now best for us to be forthright with one another , continued porfiry petrovich , tilting his head back slightly and lowering his eyes , as if not wishing to embarrass his former victim with his gaze and disregarding his previous tricks and subterfuge
0	but what 's to be done ?
0	he starts to cry
0	what are you doing ?
0	that , of course , was the catch , because it was the very point pulkheriya aleksandrovna was now too afraid to mention
0	cried the young man
0	i ’ ll grab hold of you , tie you up in a bundle , carry you home under my arm , and lock you up
0	you know rodya ’ s character best of all , and you can advise us best of all
0	that morning he scrubbed himself diligently , with soap provided by nastasya ; he washed his hair , his neck , and especially his hands
0	seeing this , she neither pulled the door back nor let go of the handle , the result being that he almost yanked her out onto the landing along with the door
0	just half an hour ago , while escorting raskolnikov home , although he had been excessively talkative , as he himself would admit , he ’ d been feeling completely fearless and almost renewed , in spite of the enormous quantity of alcohol he ’ d consumed that evening
0	about the murder of the old woman , the pawnbroker , the civil servant ’ s widow
0	he was standing near the wall , arms folded across his chest , regarding her with a fiery gaze
0	no , i ’ m gloomy : i don ’ t do any harm , just sit in a corner ; sometimes they can ’ t make me talk for three days in a row
0	consider that varents spent seven years living with her husband , abandoned her two children , and in her letter she quipped to her husband , i realized that i couldn ’ t be happy with you
0	ritter toggenburg ( the knight toggenburg )
0	he himself had requested it from her not long before his illness , and she ’ d brought him the book without comment
0	i confess , i even wanted to call on you and have it all out , but i thought that perhaps you ’ d
0	and the main thing is , he ’ s so crude , filthy , with manners of the tavern ; and
0	we will have to tell him we quarreled over politics
0	pour monter notre ménage
0	he ’ s had a fever since yesterday , she added
0	but immediately , at that very moment , she understood everything
0	odintsova turned her head slightly
0	but , having decided to do something stupid , the friends maintained an even more stubborn silence than before and even seemed angry
0	were you in your right mind then ?
0	drunks are leaving the taverns , he thought
0	raskolnikov said , brushing him aside , after listening with disgust to the strained playfulness of his account of the purchase of the clothes
0	and so he rages at others but feels that he should really rage at himself more than at them
0	she would inherited her mother 's love of order , common sense , and propriety ; but she was so young and lonely ; nikolai petrovich was such a kind , modest man there 's no need to tell the rest
0	i began with a purpose , but all of this chatter for self-amusement , all these incessant , endless commonplaces , over and over again , have become so loathsome to me over the last three years , that , so help me god , i blush when other people utter them in my presence , let alone when i myself say them
0	nikolai petrovich wrung his hands surreptitiously , while pavel petrovich laughed and made jokes , especially with bazarov ; he put on a fine white linen shirt , a fashionable morning jacket , and a fez ; he did not allow the curtains to be drawn and complained amusingly about the need to refrain from eating
0	it was about eight o ’ clock , and the sun was sinking in the sky
0	they sat her up in bed , supporting her on both sides
0	just think : i struck her only twice with a riding switch ; it didn ’ t even leave any marks
0	you must be interested in the women 's question
0	now the giant 's only task is to die in a decent manner , even though no one really cares about that either all the same , i am not going to start wagging my tail
0	that 's what got him sent to st helena , father aleksei replied and trumped the ace
0	bazarov 's appearance reassured him immediately , although a more experienced eye might have discerned in the still energetic , but haggard figure of his unexpected guest signs of internal agitation
0	i consider such fine talk indecent
0	did the doctor really say that ?
0	right then and there i did myself in , forever !
0	they are not capable of accommodating themselves to its conditions , not one of them ever attained the rank of head of a department
0	to a v toporov
0	but now , at least , i can no longer count on it and , in particular , i don ’ t wish to interfere with the communication of arkady ivanovich svidrigaylov ’ s secret proposals , which he authorized your brother to convey and which , as i see , have an important , perhaps even extremely pleasant significance for you
0	i even had the pleasure of interesting you in my opinions
0	bazarov leaves almost completely rejected and again begins to be amazed at himself and to upbraid himself
0	that 's why i heard you coughing last night , said arina vlasevna
0	what are you talking about ?
0	dmitry prokofich , thanks be to him , drops in to see me and talks all about you
0	svidrigaylov led the astonished raskolnikov farther away , into a corner
0	fix your dress , polechka , the shoulders have slipped down , she remarked through her cough as she caught her breath
0	that ’ s precisely how it was !
0	what can one do ?
0	it is high time , he wrote p v annenkov in , for the french people to take a look at themselves , inside their own country , and to see their own ulcers and try to cure them
0	in precisely this way arkady and bazarov spent about two weeks at odintsova 's
0	that ’ s exactly what i thought !
0	you can see that they ’ ve been worn , but they ’ ll do you for the next two months or so , because the material and the workmanship are foreign
0	i ’ ll go at once
0	it seems that if i could form a strong attachment to something
0	the traits are so minute here that strong mental magnifying glasses are needed for understanding them , and not everyone is obliged to have them
0	if bazarovism is a disease , then it is the disease of our time , and must be endured to the end no matter what palliatives and amputations are employed
0	in other words , there 's something to be gained
0	it ’ s the last and largest request i make of you
0	raskolnikov sat there and listened in silence and with disgust
0	yet here , in this case , one could adopt a whole new approach
0	valued is even not quite appropriate here : i simply could not and can not work differently ; and in the final analysis there was no reason for me to do so
0	you say that katerina ivanovna ’ s mind is muddled ; your mind is muddled , too , he said after some silence
0	the service began , quietly , decorously , somberly
0	we act on the basis of what we recognize as useful , bazarov replied
0	and there ’ s one key that ’ s bigger than all the others , three times bigger , with a notched tip ; it ’ s not for the dresser , of course
0	i don ’ t even know if there was any money there , he added quietly , as if in deep thought
0	the revelation that oppositions mask an identity is profoundly dialectical in the hegelian sense
0	the caretaker was standing at the door of his little room and pointing him out to a small man who looked like a tradesman , dressed in a vest and some sort of long robe , and who from a distance very much resembled a peasant woman
0	he had passed the whole night alone , god knows where
0	when raskolnikov arrived at his building , his temples were damp with sweat and he was breathing heavily
0	at first pulkheriya aleksandrovna was speechless with elated surprise ; then she seized his hand and dragged him into the room
0	well , listen : i came to see you because besides you , i don ’ t know anyone else who could help
0	then he left the courtyard and headed off to the square
0	he thought it necessary to inform his son so he would not get angry
0	arkady went up to his uncle and once again felt the touch of his fragrant mustache against his cheek
0	he ’ ll begin to run ahead , butting in where he ’ s not asked for , he ’ ll begin talking incessantly about those things he really should keep silent about , he ’ ll use sly allegories , hee-hee !
0	everyone knows that our real representatives , that the carriers of thought in our generation , have long ago renounced being practical , that active participation in the life around them had long ago become impossible
0	it was another matter altogether when he met some of his acquaintances or former comrades , whom , in general , he didn ’ t much like seeing
0	i wouldn ’ t trade him for five lessons in any merchant ’ s house
0	nothing more ’ s needed today
0	but upon arrival in petersburg two days ago , he quarreled with me at our first meeting and i drove him away , to which event there are two witnesses
0	nikolai petrovich explained his state of mind briefly , then moved on
0	he looked at her in silence and without any particular thoughts
0	yes , friend , he said , that 's what it means to live with feudal types
0	when he calls the life a dream , is his point their happiness or the sleepiness of that way of living ?
0	that 's not the source of their superiority ; is not it that in them there are fewer traces of the slave owner than in us ?
0	she asked in fear , unintentionally taking a step back
0	perhaps porfiry ’ s angry that there are no facts and so he burst out with all that
0	is that a good sign ?
0	the hotheaded lieutenant was obviously bewildered
0	i told you all this before , don ’ t you remember ?
0	do not deny the child anything that comforts him you know what i mean
0	forgive me for disturbing you , she began , stammering
0	but it still seemed somewhat harsh to me , and i conveyed this to dunya later
0	in any case , i must see svidrigaylov as soon as possible , he decided definitively
0	a hero or a devil ?
0	you ’ ll suffer and die suffering , she repeated , stretching her arms toward him in desperate entreaty
0	it is this legacy and its meaning for turgenev 's reputation that i wish to examine
0	just a little while ago when i was with her , i felt this in my heart !
0	i have come to put a question to you
0	just then a whole group of men entered from outside , already quite drunk , with the sound of a rented accordion and the soft , cracked voice of a seven-year-old child singing the little farm
0	raskolnikov ’ s appearance attracted almost no attention
0	some sort of prophet ?
0	you do not believe me ?
0	half an hour later anna sergeevna entered the study accompanied by vasily ivanovich
0	in part that was due to the order she maintained in both her house and her life
0	anna sergeevna 's auntie , the princess kh , a short , slender woman with a face pinched like a fist and nasty , steady eyes under a gray wig , came in
0	porfiry petrovich was laughing and wished to be laughing , but it was obvious that he needed some sort of explanation
0	the absence of flirtatiousness and the very harshness of his judgments
0	over there was freedom ; over there lived other people , not at all like the ones on this side of the river ; it was as if time had stood still there , as if the age of abraham and his flocks had not yet passed
0	and i , said anna sergeevna , i was depressed at first , god knows why , and even thought about going abroad , just imagine !
0	can it be that she is only amusing herself with impressions and is not capable of becoming carried away by them ?
0	she was about to yank the door open so she could let loose a storm of abuse at them , but in the doorway she bumped into mrs lippevekhsel herself , who had just heard about the accident and come running in to restore order
0	but it turned out to be too much for turgenev ( or for his poetics ) to do what the late dostoevsky did in the brothers karamazov ; that is , to finish the novel , leaving the young heroes alive and their fates open , to call the novel in question only a prehistory—or to refer to that
0	what sort of surprise ?
0	i even looked for you under your sofa !
0	let 's do our duty , precisely as you say , and let 's see if we can achieve happiness in the bargain
0	but calm down , madam , calm down !
0	just imagine , it 's pure chance , he replied ; turning to his carriage , he waved his hand five times or so and shouted , follow us , follow us !
0	he also remained true , i believe , to the idea 'that revolution brings it into effect ' ( yeyo privodit v deystviye revolyutsiya )
0	where does his father live ?
0	lately , she ’ d begun chatting more often and at greater length with her elder little girl , the ten-year-old polyenka , who , even though she didn ’ t understand all that much , knew very well that her mother needed her , and therefore followed her with her large clever eyes , pretending with all her might that she understood everything
0	zosimov started laughing even more than before
0	i remember everything , to the last detail , but just think : i really can ’ t explain why i did what i did , where i went , or what i said
0	these three characters are all tragic , therefore , in that none can partake of any intimate relationship with an individual psychically rooted in a phase of time other than the one with which their identity is entwined
0	unnatural condition , if i may express it that way
0	the accident of fate that kills him comes only after he has been defeated in every possible social and personal encounter : it is the summation of those encounters
0	i never expected to die so soon ; to tell you the truth , it 's a most unpleasant circumstance
0	is that terebeva the same one you told me about , the one who ’ s entered her third common-law marriage ?
0	the same words could be uttered about turgenev by anybody who has come into close contact with his fiction , essays , and correspondence
0	they washed the floor ; will they paint it ?
0	for two years he ’ s been nagging me , telling me to take this thousand and pay him six percent interest
0	but katerina ivanovna could no longer stand it and rapidly , for all to hear , blurted out that perhaps amaliya ivanovna never even had a vater , that amaliya ivanovna was simply a drunken petersburg finn , and that most likely she had worked somewhere as a cook before , perhaps even worse than that
0	it 's from lamp oil and sweet clover , said bazarov , yawning
0	and if there was an attempt to avoid exiling me , they ’ d all go mad from righteous indignation !
0	for heaven 's sake , the logic of history demands
0	at last razumikhin looked more cheerfully at avdotya romanovna
0	it makes no difference !
0	a little peasant on a white nag was trotting along a dark , narrow path next to the grove ; he was clearly visible , all of him , including the patch on his shoulder , even though he was in the shadows ; the horse 's hooves could be seen plainly rising and falling in a pleasant fashion
0	in that case i really do not understand that gentleman
0	this idea alone drove him into a dark rage
0	he was angry and he was conscious of the fact that he was committing a folly but , nevertheless , went on committing it , because his desire to live for his pleasure was stronger than his desire to be consistent
0	i did write an article in connection with some book about six months ago , when i left the university , but i sent it to weekly discourses , not periodical discourses
0	remember that however subtle and complex the inner structure of some tissue in the human body , the skin , for example , nonetheless it is comprehensible and homogeneous
0	but i must make her acquaintance
0	you yourself say it ’ s mere psychology ; meanwhile , you ’ ve veered off into mathematics
0	he wants a radical change and does not shrink from brute force
0	he took his time ; he even seemed afraid of something
0	you ’ re our hope , you ’ re our everything !
0	the policeman understood everything in an instant and thought about it
0	he ’ s a fine fellow , my friend , you ’ ll see !
0	besides , the interior door swung open , and several curious onlookers peeked in
0	all of these circumstances had a certain positive influence on raskolnikov ’ s fate
0	but the tenderhearted mama immediately began in a low voice and rapid speech to resolve certain important quandaries , namely , that arkady ivanovich was an important man , a man of affairs and connections , a wealthy man—god knows what he had in mind ; he might up and leave , might give away money , and , therefore , there was no reason to be surprised
0	i ’ ll go back to my own apartment
0	don ’ t try to make me come back ; it ’ s too late for that
0	it ’ s a good thing you ’ ve come to , my friend , he said , turning to raskolnikov
0	if i ’ ve been crying a long time , it ’ s because my maternal heart has foreseen misfortune
0	and they ’ ve gotten used to it
0	true , it comes with a guarantee : if you wear this one out , they give you a new one next year at no cost , so help me god !
0	and you asked for the fringes from your trousers , in such a tearful voice !
0	one instance ended for the exposed personage in a particularly scandalous way , and the other almost ended in an extremely troublesome manner
0	i ’ ll tell you everything , because he ’ s such a fool
0	and odintsov , like all the other characters , becomes interested in him , as she probably had not become interested in anyone else in her whole life
0	you ’ ve forsaken them , abandoned them
0	love for one ’ s future partner in life , for one ’ s husband , must exceed the love for one ’ s brother , he announced sententiously
0	he turned pale , and his lips began to tremble
0	well , you should know that the murderer ’ s been found ; he himself has confessed and presented all the evidence
0	setting aside the question of money—you ’ ll excuse me for mentioning it , he said , turning to zosimov , i don ’ t know why i deserve such special attention from you
0	surely it was impossible to arrive at any other correct interpretation except for one
0	and so what if in eight years he would be only thirty-two and could start to live his life all over again ?
0	perhaps you ’ re not a boor at all , he said
0	the best discussion of this phenomenon is t s eliot 's , in his article , tradition and the individual talent : no poet , no artist of any art , has his complete meaning alone
0	oh , lord , what would i have thought ?
0	i could hear it outside on the stairs
0	then why did you need me ?
0	that is , you ’ d enjoy someone ’ s hospitality and then spit on it , the same as you would on those who invited you there
0	besides , he ’ s a very prudent man and of course will realize that his own conjugal happiness will be more assured the happier dunechka is with him
0	why such a racket ?
0	however , there ’ s no way of knocking you off track !
0	thank heaven for that
0	she said gently and affectionately , as if surprised to see her there
0	we have to sing something much more respectable
0	i used a riding switch only twice during all our seven years together ( if you don ’ t count a third time that was , however , extremely ambiguous ) : the first time—two months after our marriage , right after our arrival in the country , and now this latest incident
0	oh , what dreadful people !
0	raskolnikov , with pale lips and immobile eyes , quietly approached him , stepping up to the desk ; he rested his hand on it , and tried to speak , but was unable to ; only incoherent sounds emerged
0	after taking the policeman by the arm , he pulled him over to the bench
0	yes , repeated bazarov gloomily ; you are still a fool ( [ ] )
0	now your vaulted sense of self-dignity has betrayed you , bazarov observed phlegmatically , while arkady flared up , his eyes flashing
0	in a corner on the right was a bed ; near the door leading into the other apartment stood a simple wooden table covered in a blue tablecloth ; two cane chairs were next to the table
0	in the readers ' eyes bazarov emerges the victor from his trials
0	a perplexed razumikhin repeated , trying with all his might to refute raskolnikov ’ s conclusions
0	why indeed did you slip it secretly into her pocket ?
0	it had all been decided long ago : throw everything into the canal : get rid of all traces and that would be the end of it
0	his face expressed a certain agitation
0	in turgenev , heteroglossia and language from the dialogic imagination : four essays by m m bakhtin , edited by michael holquiest , translated by michael holquist and caryl emerson
0	his soft , loving nature , striving for faith and sympathy , is jarred by corrosive realism ; his delicate esthetic sensibility , not devoid of a large dose of aristocratism , takes offense at the faintest glimmer of cynicism ; he is too weak and sensitive to bear dismal repudiations ; he must become reconciled with existence , if not in the realm of life , at least in the realm of thought , or , more precisely , dreams
0	i am not lying , pavel petrovich
0	if he is disliked as he is , with all his ugliness , it means that j am at fault and was not able to cope with the figure i chose
0	besides , they are russian and i am russian , too , are not i ?
0	other names were written on the wrappings of the items , and other people came forward on their own , when they heard about it
0	he had long ago prepared a needle and thread , and they had lain wrapped in paper in the little table
0	it led to a neighboring apartment with a different number
0	he ’ s been back with us for a while , since this morning !
0	but nikolai was left with the feeling of a life well-spent , and his son was growing up before his very eyes ; pavel , on the other hand , a lonely bachelor , was entering into that troubled , twilight phase of life when regrets resemble hopes , and hopes , regrets , when youth has passed , but old age has not yet set in
0	why , even now she had a right : she was suffering , and that was her fund , so to speak , her capital , which she had the absolute right to expend
0	me , continued svidrigaylov , shaking with laughter
0	pavel petrovich found it difficult even when princess r was in love with him ; but when she cooled , and that happened rather soon , he almost lost his mind
0	for example , you know beforehand , absolutely , that this most well-intentioned and most useful citizen won ’ t give you money under any circumstances because why , i ask , why should he ?
0	she announced in a thin voice , fedosya nikolaevna is not feeling well and ca not come ; she told me to ask if you will pour the tea yourself or should she send dunyasha ?
0	he was breathing hard ; his whole body was trembling visibly
0	the scene produced a strong impression on me and as a consequence the other characters and the action began to take form in my mind
0	it was at that time i thought , sir , i ’ ll wait , sir !
0	said bazarov at last
0	it was almost nine o ’ clock when he passed through the haymarket
0	i didn ’ t want to travel anywhere ; marfa petrovna invited me to go abroad several times , seeing that i was bored
0	sonya ’ s letters were filled with the most ordinary reality , the simplest and clearest description of the circumstances of raskolnikov ’ s life as a convict
0	he was speaking to her but looking to one side , as if he wanted to avoid staring her straight in the eye
0	herzen , whose disillusionment as a result of was far greater than turgenev 's , spoke of don quixote in a different sense , as the embodiment of the crisis that had overtaken utopian idealism , as the failed idealist who went on repeating the old revolutionary slogans
0	she repeated to herself
0	brother , now i know everything , everything
0	and why , precisely , did they involve you—i also think it superfluous to say
0	consequently , you ’ re selling yourself for money ; and , consequently , in any case , you ’ re behaving in a vile manner
0	lebezyatnikov started to head for the door
0	both , for example , regard self-control as the mark of respect for human dignity and obligations
0	if they had commanded him to serve them by immediately casting himself headlong down the stairs , he would have done so at once , without considering or hesitating
0	just imagine , she rushed to where they were eating
0	it was almost evening ; the sun was hidden behind a small grove of aspens that stood about half a verst from the garden : its shadow stretched endlessly across motionless fields
0	attractive and feminine coiffures
0	like a rose in springtime !
0	the first i heard was from afanasy pavlych , the third day , in the tavern
0	he added in a loud voice
0	he plans to cut them up , pavel petrovich observed
0	john garrad ( new haven : yale university press , ) - , -
0	what good would it have done to send bazarov to london ?
0	katerina ivanovna , he began , last week your late husband told me the story of his life and all the circumstances
0	kukshina also wound up living abroad
0	it was on the tip of my tongue
0	that was the more important for me since people whom i trust very much ( i am not talking about kolbasin ) seriously advised me to throw my work into the fire—and only recently ( but this is confidential ) pisemsky wrote me that bazarov is a complete failure
0	they had already heard from nasta­sya what this capable young man had done for rodya all during his illness ; that phrase was how pulkheriya aleksandrovna raskolnikova herself had described him in her intimate conversation with dunya that very evening
0	of course , that ’ s what would happen
0	i think so , too , said pulkheriya aleksandrovna with a defeated look
0	you see , i haven ’ t been to petersburg in the last ten years
0	and i ’ d heard about you before , from my late father
0	do you know , sonya , that low ceilings and cramped rooms oppress the soul and the mind !
0	listen , he began decisively , as far as i ’ m concerned , you can all go to the devil
0	perhaps he didn ’ t have enough strength to answer
0	du hast diamanten und perlen
0	don ’ t be angry at what i say
0	it is scientism as a language , as a discursive practice claiming a unique relation to truth that turgenev will test in his fiction
0	that 's very comforting news
0	well , just think , porfiry , he could barely stand on his feet , but as soon as we , that is zosimov and i , let him out of our sight yesterday—he got dressed , slipped out , and was up to some mischief almost until midnight , and all this in his total delirium , i tell you
0	he could have tolerated everything , even shame and disgrace !
0	reprinted by permission of princeton university press
0	no , my friend , no but
0	† dostoevsky himself endured such an experience in ; he was pardoned and sent into exile
0	he ’ s not a bad fellow
0	does he have something on his mind , huh ?
0	the two young men shared an apartment under the distant supervision of a cousin on their mother 's side , ilya kolyazin , an important man
0	in general bazarov said very little in the presence of the little old kirsanov men ( as he called the two brothers ) , but that evening he was in a bad mood and sat in silence drinking cup after cup of tea
0	turgenev 's art , his aesthetic and social thought , involved as they are with limits and compromises in all areas of human existence , constitute a powerful counterweight to the utopian and the apocalyptic in russian social and political thought and ideology
0	he immediately began stuffing everything into this hole underneath the torn wallpaper
0	in the first place , you ’ ve needed a change of air for some time
0	meanwhile , nikolai petrovich had also awakened and set off to see arkady , whom he found already up and dressed
0	so that 's how it is !
0	you won ’ t believe , you can ’ t imagine , polyenka , she said , pacing the room , how cheerfully and splendidly we lived at home with your papa , how that drunkard destroyed me , and how he ’ ll destroy all of you , too !
0	could it really be half past seven ?
0	the office was about three hundred yards from his house
0	i was going to your apartment to look for you , began raskolnikov , but why did i suddenly turn into obukhovsky prospect from the haymarket ?
0	the worshipper of eternal truth and eternal beauty , he had the proud aim of showing the eternal in the temporary and to write a novel neither progressive nor reactionary but , so to speak , constant
0	she ’ s simply in a frenzy—that is , not sofiya semyonovna , but kate­rina ivanovna is in a frenzy ; but so is sofiya semyonovna
0	he cried at the top of his lungs
0	honest faces grew red with indignation at the mere mention of his name '
0	she lost consciousness again , but this oblivion lasted only a short while
0	she cried , jumping up from her place
0	this brutal , fanatical , dedicated figure , with his unused powers , is represented as an avenger for insulted human reason ; yet , in the end , he is crushed by heartless nature , by what the author calls the cold-eyed goddess isis who does not care for good or evil , or art or beauty , still less for man , the creature of an hour ; he struggles to assert himself ; but she is indifferent ; she obeys her own inexorable laws
0	cried the workman apprehensively
0	they even loved her gait and would turn to look at her as she went by and would praise her ; they even praised her for being so small ; they didn ’ t even know what else to praise her for
0	sonya stood in the same place , as if unconscious : she didn ’ t even seem very surprised
0	i repeat , cried raskolnikov in a fury , i can ’ t tolerate this any longer
0	if we examine it attentively , we will find that that higher something is not a character but that life which inspires them
0	a few minutes later bazarov does still worse : he discloses a longing to choke his tender friend arkady , to choke him for no particular reason and in the guise of a pleasant trial already spreads wide his long and hard fingers
0	what if during that time the axe was needed , she began looking for it , and started yelling—that would arouse suspicion or , at least , grounds for suspicion
0	but you should know in advance that i don ’ t believe you !
0	did you know , mikolai , a certain widow and her sister on that day and at that time were murdered and robbed ?
0	well , now , we ’ ll see what you ’ ve come up with
0	only the chosen ones are in a position to convey to posterity not only the content but also the form of their thoughts and views , their personality which , generally speaking , does not concern the public
0	although it was as stuffy as before , he greedily inhaled the stinking , dusty air contaminated by the city
0	dunya said with a laugh , also agitated
0	to hell with life !
0	i wish you happiness
0	rodion romanych , rodion romanych !
0	sonechka , my little sweetheart , had merely provided the money , while for the time being , she said , she thought it wouldn ’ t be proper for her to visit us too often , except after dark , so no one would see her
0	in general , it livens things up
0	think , mademoiselle , he began sternly , as it were , still exhorting her , consider carefully
0	to cut other people down to fit your own measure is to fall into narrow-minded intellectual despotism
0	phew , how people shove each other !
0	laugh several people in the crowd
0	you think they won ’ t ?
0	what ’ s happening there now ?
0	i wo not argue with that , bazarov said , interrupting
0	pavel petrovich exclaimed with a sudden burst of emotion
0	petr petrovich paused and waited , but since nothing followed , he continued :
0	i merely wanted to say that i ask your forgiveness , mama , he concluded abruptly and sharply
0	petr petrovich stood up , indicated that sonya should stay where she was , and stopped lebezyatnikov in the doorway
0	a candle was burning down on the table ; there was an almost empty decanter of vodka , some goblets , bread , glasses , cucumbers , and dishes from tea that had been consumed a long time ago
0	pushkin has prepared this final statement in stanza : as i caress a sweet little child
0	perhaps he would have replaced his anger with favor and would have ceased to regard us with reproach and mockery
0	why did she turn up there ?
0	and i read about it in the papers !
0	was it really that the desire for life was so strong and so difficult to overcome ?
0	there wasn ’ t even anything to be gained by it !
0	i can ’ t be making a mistake in the amount , because just before your arrival , i ’ d finished my counting and found the total correct
0	he bent his head down and covered his face with his hands
0	she may be a fool , just like i am , but what about you ?
0	her children to kiss her hand in the morning , and gave them her blessing at night—in a word , she lived life just as she pleased
0	in my opinion , much of this , very much , was unnecessary ; but such was marfa petrovna ’ s character
0	i do not know how to thank you ; you are really very kind
0	as a matter of fact , about five minutes later , lebezyatnikov returned with sonechka
0	a small table stood in front of the sofa
0	there was a globe depicted on the back of the case
0	you must have spent several days without anyone to talk to , raskolnikov said
0	he 's always asking me
0	he looked timidly at avdotya romanovna ; but at that moment her haughty face expressed gratitude , friendship , and such complete and unexpected respect for him ( instead of mocking glances and the involuntary , badly concealed scorn he had expected ! )
0	he inquired , going up to pavel petrovich
0	you see , here ’ s the entrance to sofiya semyonovna ’ s ; you see , no one ’ s home !
0	you seem to find it wrong that i talk about women in this way ?
0	in general there is a sobriety to turgenev 's approach to russia and the russian people that is absent from the utterances of so many of his peers , radical and conservative alike
0	cried his poor mother
0	he ’ ll certainly die within five or ten minutes
0	i ’ ll tell you one thing , rodion romanovich , old boy , about myself , to explain my character , so to speak , porfiry petrovich continued , still bustling about the room and , as before , avoiding meeting his guest ’ s eyes
0	when , one month ago , mr lebezyatnikov beat my wife with his own hands , as i lay there drunk , don ’ t you think i suffered ?
0	i have money and friends
0	she was also struck by petr petrovich ’ s dry , businesslike tone , even full of some contemptuous menace
0	enough , mama , he muttered in embarrassment , squeezing her hand without looking at her
0	that one , sofiya semyonovna , who was just there
0	she said very little , but her words revealed her knowledge of life ; from several of her remarks arkady gathered that this young woman had already managed to feel and think a great deal
0	dunya was simply indispensable to him ; it was unthinkable that he might have to lose her
0	so then , it ’ s not a gift from her suitor , thought razumikhin , and for some reason felt overjoyed
0	he turned and left and never came again
0	then when could it come about ?
0	well , let ’ s suppose those greenhorns succeeded ; let ’ s suppose each one got away with a million rubles ; well , then what ?
0	he was already on the first step
0	porfiry suddenly asked with alarming familiarity
0	katkov is horrified by that force , power , superiority to the crowd , and ability to subjugate people which he noted in bazarov ; he says it is the contemporary raised to an apotheosis , and despairs for thought and science when people like the author of the tale instead of fighting with the corrupting tendency , strike the colors before it , yield before it , give up , venerate in thought its empty , phosphorescent , and deceptive lustre
0	in the first place , could you guess , dear rodya , that your dear sister has been living with me for the last month and a half , and we ’ ll no longer be separated in the future
0	and wrapped himself up in his overcoat
0	that would be infinitely more advantageous for you , for me as well—because it would be a load off my mind
0	a couple of years in a row ; then we moved around
0	well , sir , here ’ s my opinion : i don ’ t sympathize at all with the gentleman who struck that german woman , because , as a matter of fact , what ’ s there to sympathize with ?
0	must we really consider your every wish our command ?
0	and he adds , with reference to fathers and sons : there is no personal immortality , no god who cares for man ; nature is even a disease beyond reason—this seems the message turgenev wants to convey
0	his blood caught fire as soon as he thought about her ; he could have easily coped with his blood , but something else had taken root in him that he would never been able to admit , something he would always mocked , something that irritated his pride
0	( bazarov was a great lover of women [ velikii okhotnik do zhenshchin ] ;
0	are you rodion romanovich raskolnikov , a student or former student ?
0	without boots , you can ’ t go teach
0	but it was impossible ; still trembling from his chill , he began taking everything off and examining it again
0	what , after all , is the usual experience of youthful political idealists ?
0	grown so accustomed ; but it would also be awkward for him to stay on alone
0	what a mess , just think !
0	the huge , round copper-red moon shone directly in through the windows
0	razumikhin brought it to me
0	why ’ s this policeman coming after me ?
0	he walked along , looking around absentmindedly and spitefully
0	the door flew open and on the threshold appeared a squat , short old woman , wearing a white cap and a short colorful blouse
0	this is a most unpleasant sensation
0	in addition , he felt endless moral exhaustion , even though his reasoning was functioning better than it had for all these last few days
0	his novel , the career of a nihilist , paid more than lip service to turgenev 's celebration of the youthfulness of the revolutionary vocation ; it gave overt expression to the religious aspect of it or , as stepniak described his aim in his preface : ' i wanted to show in the full light of fiction the inmost heart and soul of those humanitarian enthusiasts , with whom devotion to a cause has attained the fervour of a religion , without being a religion
0	god knows whether that 's a good or a bad thing !
0	otherwise , i won ’ t allow it ; therefore , farewell for the time being , since there ’ s nothing now left for the two of us to talk about
0	is he not showing off ?
0	i understand , i do , and it ’ s been a pleasure
0	their points are well known : crime is a protest against the abnormal structure of society—and that ’ s that , nothing else ; no further reasons are permitted—nothing more !
0	it is these two types of temporality which , kristeva says , have traditionally been linked to female subjectivity , even though they are not fundamentally incompatible with masculine values
0	nikolai petrovich merely sighed ; he did not even suspect to whom these words might pertain
0	we reject more things !
0	or something of the sort—however , they ’ ll write it for you
0	but after the generous acquiescence you have demonstrated , i have no right to complain so , everything 's been settled by the way , you do not have any pistols , do you ?
0	you were wrong to say that , dunya !
0	to begin with , the dialectic neatly describes the shift in the alignment of characters that occurs in the course of the novel
0	the remarks and judgments of people whom i am accustomed to believe were extremely unfavorable
0	a few curious onlookers crowded into the doorway
0	only in time did other , more flexible approaches to the notion of realism become possible
0	it ’ s impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion about that
0	she wept and wept so much today !
0	your uncle 's a bit of an eccentric , bazarov said to arkady , sitting down next to his bed in his dressing gown and smoking a short pipe
0	it 's a pity you have not worked him out a little more
0	when did you manage to lock it ?
0	some editions now produce a handsome profit !
0	he fell upon raskolnikov even with some voraciousness , as if he also hadn ’ t spoken with anyone for a whole month
0	well , what ’ s to be done ?
0	during this conversation , he had glanced at her frequently but fleetingly , for only a moment , and then looked away immediately
0	that much i knew
0	down to answer what is to be done ?
0	a beggar ’ s song from a french melodrama
0	dream , to pursue an ideal , to aspire to an unattainably lofty goal
0	[ arkady pointed to peter ]
0	whispered razumikhin in a fury , seizing hold of raskolnikov ’ s shoulder
0	the one in whose house i ’ m living ?
0	especially me , a future medic , a medic 's son , and a sexton 's grandson did you know i am the grandson of a sexton ?
0	bazarov would not have been portrayed as an awkward student dominating the people around him through the natural strength of his healthy mind ; he , perhaps , would have been turned into the embodiment of the ideas which make up the essence of this type ; he , perhaps , would have manifested in his personality the clear expression of the author 's tendencies , but it is doubtful whether he would have been bazarov 's equal in faithfulness to life and roundness of characterization
0	then there ’ s that fellow , perhaps , this petr petrovich !
0	let ’ s assume that luzhin didn ’ t want to do it right now , he began , without looking at sonya
0	his recollections of his recent successes at work seemed to invigorate him , and some were even reflected in his face by a sort of radiance
0	there are laws about such things
0	arkady it 's nikolaich , is not it ?
0	the insistence upon complete equality of the sexes also induced men of the new generation to cast overboard the ballast of chivalry and stylized gallantry
0	i was his guardian at one time
0	well , who would feel sorry for the likes of me ?
0	did they question nikolai while you were still there ?
0	therefore , there must be some kind of box or chest
0	here ’ s the caretaker of our building ; he knows me very well ; he ’ s bowing to us ; he sees that i ’ m coming with a lady , and , of course , he ’ s managed to observe your face ; that will serve you well if you ’ re afraid of me and suspicious
0	that turgenev did alter his text as a result of katkov 's pleading is certain ; he may , however , have restored some , at any rate , of the original language when the novel was published as a book
0	and if he is called a nihilist that word must be read as revolutionary
0	well , yes , so , you are denouncers—that 's what it seems to be called
0	little by little he arrived at diverse and curious conclusions ; in his opinion , the main reason was contained not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime , but in the criminal himself : the criminal himself , almost every one of them , at the very moment of the crime , is subject to some failure of willpower and reason , which are replaced , instead , by phenomenal childish thoughtlessness , precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed
0	then don ’ t believe it !
0	i ’ d have been to the yard beforehand and have looked for a large rock , weighing some forty or fifty pounds , somewhere over in a corner , near a fence , that had perhaps been there since the house had been built ; i ’ d have lifted up this rock—there ’ d have to be a space under it—and i ’ d have placed all the items and the money into that space
0	sonya turned the pages of the book and searched for the place
0	asked porfiry petrovich , who had turned to go
0	he exchanged glances with razumikhin
0	sonya blushed , but katerina ivanovna suddenly burst into tears , remarking that she was a nervous fool and was too distraught , that it was high time she stopped , and since the meal was finished , it was now time to serve tea
0	but she picked up the book
0	one of the women remarked , shaking her head at duklida
0	the novel is representative of its time in perhaps just this sense : that such imagination was still possible
0	i have some matters to attend to
0	in the face of all the natural revulsion avdotya romanovna felt toward me , and in spite of my gloomy and repulsive appearance—at last she began to feel pity for me , pity for a fallen man
0	is he responding like this from a sense of obligation ?
0	nikolai petrovich asked fenechka
0	luzhin repeated his question and was silent for several seconds
0	however , he ’ ll come to me and tell me everything
0	incidentally , you know that formerly i never really appreciated your close friendship with arkady nikolaevich ; i considered him rather insignificant
0	bazarov was not fated to awaken again
0	he whispered , what are you saying ?
0	one could hear how on every floor , up and down the staircase , a crowd was gathering ; voices could be heard , exclamations , as people came out , knocked on doors , slammed them shut , and then clustered
0	you are not a hunter ?
0	there is such a thing , he says , as being too fair ; this leads to its own brand of distortion of the truth
0	they ’ ve upset you again !
0	it ’ s my opinion that with all your merits , you aren ’ t worth the little finger of that unfortunate young woman at whom you ’ re casting stones
0	not god , but man makes pot and pan !
0	on the other hand , arkady
0	here the concept of an idea was simply transferred , unchanged , from the sphere of life to the sphere of art—and the transfer involved a relative neglect not only of the presence of art in a given work , but of the radical difference between idea inside and outside a work of art
0	and put your stockings next to it
0	raskolnikov turned toward the wall and the soiled yellow wallpaper with little white flowers ; he chose one ungainly white flower with some little brown lines and began staring at it : how many leaves did it have , how many serrations on each leaf , how many brown lines ?
0	using only psychological facts , one could show how to follow the right path
0	here ’ s the third floor
0	is he cutting new teeth ?
0	you left so suddenly will it bore you ?
0	yes , he will be living in a white cottage , while the nettles are growing out of me
0	but if you don ’ t kill me
0	he took a few dainty steps , then rushed around like a hunted hare at the edge of the woods—and suddenly , almost in fear , almost in a wail , announced that he too intended to leave
0	then , if you contribute another thousand from your three thousand , we ’ ll have enough in the first instance ; we ’ ll form a partnership
0	it can ’ t be that !
0	now she ’ s demanding payment according to this acknowledgment of debt : judge for yourself !
0	will i tell them or not ?
0	and you , she says , arkady ivanovich , in the midst of all your bustle today , you forgot to wind the clock in the dining room
0	in dresden , on the brühl terrace , between two and four in the afternoon , the most fashionable time for strolling , you can meet a man aged about fifty , already quite gray , seeming to suffer from gout , but still handsome , elegantly dressed , with the special air conferred only on those who have spent considerable time mixing with high society
0	you were told to come at nine o ’ clock and it ’ s now already past eleven !
0	you will see her , evgeny ; but first we must have a little chat with the doctor
0	and jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , father , i thank thee that thou hast heard me
0	well , after all that , isn ’ t it really an amusing job ?
0	i would not be so sure about that !
0	evgeny vasilich , muttered peter with difficulty ( shaking as if in a fever )
0	he wanted to sit down and was searching for a bench
0	but i tell you without flattery that i await your opinion in order to ascertain definitely what i should think
0	and why , when i was standing there on your threshold , and you were lying there on your sofa with your eyes closed , did you pretend you were asleep , when you really weren ’ t asleep at all ?
0	katerina ivanovna and i recently calculated it all , and there ’ s enough to provide for the funeral repast
0	she came here alone , sat down , and spoke with me
0	would you go up with him ?
0	trying not to look at her , raskolnikov proceeded quickly into her room
0	enough , that ’ s enough of your vile , base stories , you debauched , base , voluptuous man !
0	however , he was surprised to learn that the relatives he would invited had chosen to remain in the country
0	the kirsanovs , father and son , have settled down at marino ; their fortunes are beginning to mend
0	i learned for certain that some merchants ’ shop assistants and some office clerks wanted to insult us in the worst possible way by tarring the gates of our house so that the landlord would demand that we vacate our apartment
0	they ’ ve sent for one !
0	no , rodya , my dear , don ’ t resist , because it ’ ll be too late ; i won ’ t sleep all night , because i bought it merely guessing your size
0	there are times when society is so impervious to the kicks of criticism , when intellectual life softens so completely into the blur of gentility , that the rebellious man , who can tolerate everything but not being taken seriously , has no alternative to rudeness
0	he leaves her house the day after this incident ; afterward , he sees anna sergeyevna twice , even visits her in the company of arkady , but for both of them past events prove to be irrevocably past , and they regard each other calmly and speak together in the tones of reasonable and sedate people
0	you would be better off not respecting yourself , but doing something
0	and it was true that here and there some small strands of hay were sticking to his clothes and even to his hair
0	only old man prokofich did not like him , served him his food at the table with a gloomy expression , referred to him as a swindler and a knave , and asserted that with his side whiskers he looked just like a pig in a poke
0	the wind rushed violently into his cramped little room and clung to his face as if with cold hoarfrost , and to his chest , covered only by a shirt
0	the star pupil ’ s been caught
0	that was all true !
0	there was loud laughter
0	in turgenev 's russia ( ) victor ripp brings this line of thinking to its last stop : the meanings of turgenev 's fiction are so accessible , the questions his characters raise and the values they endorse are so easily comprehensible , that commentary seems superfluous
0	but if i am right
0	you can ’ t go to the landlady
0	fathers and sons : fathers and children
0	raskolnikov ran out after her , and lebezyatnikov followed
0	or , suddenly rousing himself , he would begin again :
0	not for anything , not until you give me your hands !
0	the next four hours were spent in insignificant discussion of this and that ; anna sergeevna both listened and talked without smiling
0	she felt ashamed for some reason , even a bit timid
0	he turned to one of them
0	that ’ s not why i came
0	the sun 's rays , for their part , made their way into the grove ; penetrating the thickets , they bathed the aspen trunks in such warm light that they began to resemble pine trees , and their leaves looked almost dark blue , while above them stretched the pale blue sky , slightly reddened by the sunset
0	norton critical edition page numbers appear in brackets
0	if , during turgenev 's visit to england in , at the close of his ventnor holiday that august , when he and annenkov had visited herzen at bournemouth , they had discussed—
0	and what ’ ll happen to our mother then ?
0	that ’ s where i come in
0	but i don ’ t want to burden myself anymore
0	soon he found out that her illness was not dangerous
0	§ a radical sect of old believers who fled from every sort of obedience to social institutions
0	petr petrovich , i beg you , said dunya , let ’ s not talk about svidrigaylov
0	he knows all about last evening !
0	do you really think that i went like a fool , without thinking ?
0	luzhin smiled caustically and haughtily
0	you say he was avoiding you , he said with a cold grin , but surely it 's probably no secret to you that he was in love with you ?
0	katya repeated , without changing her position
0	he remembered at once that his mother and sister already knew in passing , from luzhin ’ s letter , about a certain young woman of notorious conduct
0	he was afraid that he might let go of the axe and drop it
0	nihilist , said nikolai petrovich
0	that is , not that they ’ re able , but who have every right to commit any kind of outrages and crimes , and that the laws do not apply to them
0	i was at church last week , too
0	his son 's return had excited nikolai petrovich
0	he grabbed his large pocketknife and cut off the fringe
0	pochinkov ’ s house , number , babushkin ’ s apartment , remember !
0	but destitution , dear sir , destitution—that is a vice
0	see through it : if you ’ d done that , would you let it slip that you saw the workmen
0	illusoriness of aesthetic control in a world that is fundamentally messy and in which value is to be discovered only in aesthetically imperfect experience
0	you do like to joke
0	you were with anna sergeevna a long time today , arkady said , without replying to his question
0	he had been expecting this
0	what do you need razumikhin for ?
0	porfiry petrovich caught his breath for a moment
0	the metamorphosis of actaeon into a stag is , however , present in all versions of the story—a transformation that , if we interpret the tale as being about man 's urge to violate woman , seems to be less the consequence of diana 's curse than of actaeon 's own desire
0	bazarov asked , interrupting him
0	perhaps even more significant is arkadi 's behavior to his uncle
0	it also seems true that he should have a woman near him , she added in a thoughtful mood
0	i won ’ t let him out of my sight !
0	however it may be , bazarov is defeated all the same
0	the origin of the term nigilistka ( female nihilist ) is just as difficult to trace as that of the word nigilist
0	he had noticed dunya some time ago and was signaling to her
0	of course , i understood very little , but dunya explained to me that although he is not a well-educated man , he is clever and , it seems , kind
0	strakhov ( - ) was a philosopher and literary critic , and a close friend of tolstoy 's and dostoevsky 's
0	did not the local doctor have any caustic ?
0	bazarov had not been home for three years
0	all that , of course , is annoying , raskolnikov muttered in reply , but with such a distracted and almost inattentive look that dunechka regarded him in astonishment
0	is it true i ca not fall in love ?
0	but now , at last , all this uproar , which had gone on for a good ten minutes , gradually began to subside
0	it is a strange thing : you blame me for parallelism , but others write me why is not anna sergeyevna a lofty person , to contrast her more fully with bazarov ?
0	if bazarov were starving to death , then he probably would do both
0	let us assume that he has finally found that theorem
0	exactly the same ideas had recently arisen ?
0	and they mine it !
0	ilya petrovich opened his mouth wide
0	well , sir , i won ’ t keep you any longer , he said , turning to the agent
0	seeing her situation , with the unfortunate young children , i would like—as i already indicated—to be useful in some way , as best i can , that is , as best i can , but no more
0	what would i reply to you then , all the more so since your version ’ s more credible than his , because his testimony is pure psychology—which doesn ’ t fit his mug at all—while you hit it right on the mark , because that scoundrel drinks heavily and that ’ s even very well known
0	i wonder if it might be better for the time being
0	from this it in no way follows that newton had the right to kill anyone and everyone he pleased , or to rob people every day at the market
0	my nose tells me something 's not quite right
0	—bound hand and foot with graveclothes ; and his face was bound about with a napkin
0	well , we ’ ll talk about her later
0	just look , he ’ s gathered some rags and is sleeping with them , as if they were a treasure , nastasya said , then went off into fits of painfully nervous laughter
0	you yourself sent me to the crossroads ; why now , when it ’ s time for action , do you have cold feet ?
0	asked bazarov , as he downed a third glass
0	i drove her away just like a dog
0	the bad thing is that i ’ m almost delirious
0	you go to the right , while i turn to the left
0	he didn ’ t resist it ; two tears formed in his eyes and clung to his eyelashes
0	why is he here ?
0	to attach importance to preaching would mean to admit intellectual activity , to admit that men are ruled not by the senses and need , but also by thought and the words in which it is vested
0	four five go on , brother , go on ; you can even stand behind the tree and cover your ears , but do not close your eyes ; and if anyone falls , come help him up
0	she ’ s quiet , gentle , meek , and agreeable , agreeable to everything
0	my brother 's galloping toward us !
0	the second component is more directly implied in the novel 's title as the conflict between generations , apparently an inherent problem in human nature , though manifesting itself in different forms and in different degrees
0	excuse us , please , he began with forced embarrassment
0	well , i ’ m telling you that i spent a terribly long time suffering over this question , as a result of which i became extremely ashamed when at last i guessed ( somehow all of a sudden ) that not only wouldn ’ t he be repulsed , but it wouldn ’ t even have entered his head that this wasn ’ t colossal at all
0	twenty-two in all , timofeich observed with some dissatisfaction
0	sonya , sonya steal his money ?
0	lord , what should i do ?
0	still , she has pampered herself ; oh , how this lady 's pampered herself !
0	petr petrovich glanced around quickly
0	they give away everything
0	what are you doing in the meantime ?
0	i merely learned that this match , already settled , and which didn ’ t take place only because of the bride ’ s death , was not at all to mrs zarnitsyna ’ s liking
0	this passage has always struck me as intriguing : on the one hand , it provides evidence of the systematic investigation of time and space introduced by the new empirical and experimental science of the nineteenth century of which bazarov is a staunch advocate ; on the other hand , it sounds very modern—an inkling of einsteinian relativity in the middle of a classical russian novel
0	here 's a servant for you , he added , pointing to a closely cropped young boy wearing a blue caftan with worn-out elbows and someone else 's boots
0	he walked around the room again
0	i cough , sir , i have a tickle in my throat , and i ’ m short of breath
0	but wait a minute , it 's out of your way and quite far to my place
0	and i said , i have to leave , because i didn ’ t want to read ; i ’ d stopped by mainly to show some collars to katerina ivanovna
0	what do you think of him ?
0	think about where you ’ re staying !
0	she was easily amused , and when she found something funny , she laughed inaudibly , her whole body rocking and shaking until she felt sick
0	i have money ; i can get a ticket in three days
0	the wound 's not serious
0	katerina ivanovna stood there , inhaling painfully , holding her arms across her chest
0	coarse , heartless , ruthlessly dry and brusque the fault is mine ; i have not succeeded in my task
0	many speculations are possible , but it seems to me likely that dostoevsky , the great poet of the living life , would surely have responded to turgenev 's portrayal of bazarov the nihilist as a man doomed by his preoccupation with death
0	porfiry petrovich inquired for some reason
0	he doesn ’ t wait to hear what people are saying
0	the old woman stood up from her chair
0	he fell silent again and clenched his teeth : once more the image of dunechka appeared before him , exactly as she had been when , after she ’ d fired the gun for the first time , she ’ d been terribly frightened
0	he told peter to report to him the next day at dawn for some important business ; peter thought he planned to take him along to petersburg
0	two hours later he knocked at bazarov 's door
0	now it ’ s time for me to leave , too !
0	for some reason , he ’ d become friends with razumikhin—that is , not exactly friends , but he was more sociable with him , more honest
0	anna sergeevna objected ; but arina vlasevna did not hear her , and vasily ivanovich merely repeated : angel !
0	james himself saw in turgenev a class of very careful writers whose line is narrow observation , and whose manner is that of a searching realist a devoutly attentive observer
0	the blood , which was almost dry , was smeared on his hand ; he looked at it sullenly ; then he soaked a towel in water and wiped his temple
0	even though you don ’ t appear to be a person of consequence , my experience tells me that you ’ re an educated man and not accustomed to drink
0	he tormented himself with this question and was unable to understand why , when he ’ d stood above the river , he could already sense a profound lie in himself and in his convictions
0	please , old boy , or else i ’ ll think you ’ re angry
0	his exhaustion was quickly increasing
0	it even seems to me that you come from very good society or , at least , if need be , you know how to behave like a decent person
0	i was just there
0	avdotya romanovna couldn ’ t finish what she was saying ; her breath literally failed her
0	he respected me , he respected me very , very much !
0	and then—i ’ m afraid of her breathing
0	walking onto the bridge , he paused by the railing and began looking at the water
0	see how much money i have !
0	translated by ralph e matlaw
0	i called him an idiot , just as he deserves
0	resounded the voice of pavel petrovich behind them
0	he is too softhearted for both sets
0	i began that same day
0	two things : the kirsanov family and the story in which they appear ; fathers and children and fathers and children ; ordinary virtues and an extraordinary act of storytelling
0	you are a slavophile
0	the doctor , whom he implored to stay , would nod his head in agreement , give the patient lemonade to drink , and asked first for a pipe for himself , then for something
0	i repeat what i have said before
0	he was about fifty , taller than average , portly , with broad , sloping shoulders that gave him something of a stooped look
0	a commune is organized so that there won ’ t be any roles like that
0	arkady called after him in fear
0	you ’ re an anxious , weak scoundrel
0	† the russian word is dobro , which means property or goods as well as good ( as opposed to evil )
0	you ’ re a font of goodness , purity , reason , and
0	your present berth reminds me , my dear sirs , he began , of my military life in bivouacs , dressing stations , somewhere like this next to a haystack , and we were grateful for it
0	the doorman showed him the way immediately
0	he still wanted to look into her soft , clear eyes , but somehow couldn ’ t manage it
0	have a great heart and be less afraid
0	he ’ s a man of means , and she doesn ’ t seem repulsed by him
0	besides , in your eyes it 's all romanticism
0	if necessary , you know , and even the large majority of them do it
0	just consider these last few days !
0	of course , not for long ; but i ca not help expressing what i what we how much i how much we
0	if she ’ d been lame or a hunchback , i probably would ’ ve loved her even more
0	ne sait quand reviendra
0	the whole second floor of the house on the left was occupied by a tavern
0	i have met your father on two occasions and have heard a great deal about him , she continued
0	that ’ s how this town ’ s affected me from the very beginning , with its familiar stench
0	how things have turned out !
0	she gained control of herself , suppressed the throat spasms that had broken her voice at the beginning of the verse ; then she continued reading the eleventh chapter of the gospel of john
0	thus , dear rodya , he might prove extremely useful for you in all sorts of ways ; dunya and i have already supposed that you , even from this day forward , might definitely launch your future career and consider your fate now clearly determined
0	can she stand over her own ruin , directly above that stinking pit into which she ’ s being drawn , and can she wave her arms and block her ears when she ’ s being told about the danger ?
0	the door to the landing was open , so that some of the waves of tobacco smoke coming from the other rooms could disperse ; it was making the poor consumptive woman cough long and hard
0	his heart was about to burst
0	another thing : what do you mean , how could it be advantageous to you ?
0	he suddenly wondered to himself
0	he walked along , looking down at the ground
0	that ’ s why i drink , because i ’ m seeking compassion and feeling in this drinking
0	god knows what she says , and she doesn ’ t explain her purpose to me !
0	little by little he began to feel calmer ; he used all his strength to urge himself to cheer up and gather his thoughts
0	fenechka liked bazarov ; but he liked her , too
0	and get me a little sausage from the sausage maker , the cheapest sort
0	that surprises me , she began
0	flashed through raskolnikov ’ s mind , and he cast a swift glance at everything in the room to take it all in and remember its arrangement
0	he must have turned at once into the first stairway
0	do not you like that ?
0	raskolnikov noticed all this and was also alarmed
0	he said to arkady the next day
0	he stopped suddenly when he emerged on the embankment of the little neva on vasilievsky island , near the bridge
0	his entire spiritual struggle of the last few months came to him at once
0	accustomed to victory , he soon achieved his goal with her , too ; but the ease of his victory did not dampen his enthusiasm
0	excuse me , please , he said , turning to porfiry with trembling lips , for disturbing you with such trivial nonsense for the last half hour
0	my argument may be stated in a number of theses , which i will first list , and then go on to specify
0	he stashed them all in various pockets in his coat and in his right trouser pocket , trying to make it all look less noticeable
0	what do you want here ?
0	it ’ ll even be better if she begins tearing it out !
0	he remembered afterward that he was very focused , careful , trying hard not to get smeared
0	the ragged fellow , who had returned with the veal and tea , couldn ’ t refrain from asking once more , do you need anything else ?
0	i myself wanted to do good for people and i ’ d have done hundreds , thousands of good deeds instead of this stupid thing , not even stupid , but simply clumsy , because this idea was not at all as stupid as it seems now , given my failure
0	charming little feet , she thought , slowly and lightly climbing the stone steps of the terrace baked by the sun
0	me of insulting the younger generation , of being out of touch , of obscurantism , inform me that they burn my photographs with contemptuous laughter—others , on the other hand , indignantly reproach me with grovelling before that same younger generation
0	he added to himself ,
0	once he gave her a present of a ring with a sphinx carved on a stone
0	sometimes it seemed that he ’ d been lying there for about a month ; another time , that it was still the same day he had fallen ill but about that—he had completely forgotten about that ; on the other hand , he constantly recalled that he had forgotten about something that he should not have forgotten about—he suffered and agonized , trying to remember ; he moaned , fell into a rage or into horrible , unbearable fear
0	on the three occasions when he condescends to him he does
0	just imagine : it was all very sudden !
0	he has such noble instincts , and how simply , delicately he ’ s resolved yesterday ’ s misunderstanding with his sister—merely by extending his hand with such a fine look
0	i ’ ll tell you more later , but for now i have my own affairs
0	later they won ’ t have to lie
0	it really was a strange spectacle , capable of arousing the interest of a street crowd
0	grigorev ( - ) was a brilliant though eccentric critic extolling traditional russian life , and a good poet
0	they ’ re all drunk and singing songs ; next to the tavern porch stands a strange kind of cart
0	it 's all the same thing
0	not only is fathers and sons dedicated to turgenev 's old friend belinskij , the still-invoked conscience of the russian intelligentsia , but it was as well a central document in the intellectual—not only the artistic or political—life of russia during one of its most formative periods
0	true , during the whole time he constantly felt she was indulging him , that he ought to feel grateful to her but young hearts are not burdened much by this feeling
0	arkady declared that he dare not trouble her further and began chatting with her about mozart
0	dunya jumped up and rushed toward the door
0	of course he crushes the man with the fragrant mustache and others !
0	i think that has to be changed : one must not approach such a special phenomenon of life so directly and indiscriminately
0	i happen to know that my sister received some sort of letter this morning
0	today 's friday , your exc-c-cellency
0	raskolnikov regarded him with surprise , not understanding where he had come from , and not recalling him in the crowd on the street
0	the old woman came back
0	you ’ re leading up to something again
0	we must dispense with the notion that the novel portrays the conflict of generations and recognize that from the russian novel from pushkin to pasternak , ed
0	what depth and breadth of spiritual life among the most ordinary life that does not rise a jot above the lowest level
0	hear me out to the end !
0	he lay there on his sofa facedown , still dazed from his recent stupor
0	razumikhin was about to criticize the rooms forcefully , but , recalling luzhin , he kept silent , felt embarrassed , and then was overjoyed when pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s questions finally rained down on him without interruption
0	the moth flies right into the flame
0	jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee , that if thou wouldst believe , then thou shouldst see the glory of god ?
0	bazarov spares arina vlasyevna ; he tells her that he has caught cold ; on the third day he goes to bed and asks for lime tea
0	i don ’ t know what to say
0	raskolnikov wondered to himself
0	i know one thing : i started with no preconceived idea , no tendency ; i wrote naively , as if myself astonished at what was emerging
0	bazarov may regard pavel petrovich as an archaic phenomenon , but the archaic phenomenon retains social power
0	not a doll or a plaything , says gieroglifov , but a woman of knowledge who rejects the archaic , the passive , and the impotent and embraces the new , the creative , and the forceful
0	he also picked up all the five-kopeck coins , the change from the ten rubles spent on clothes by razumikhin
0	let 's go , arkady ; good-bye , gentlemen !
0	fortunately , i can probably become convinced of this even today
0	wax before the face of the lord ; he melts like wax !
0	asked vasily ivanovich in a whisper
0	do me a favor , raskolnikov continued with irritation
0	cried raskolnikov , not so much angry as astonished
0	i dare ask you for such publicity because it corresponds completely to the truth and , of course , in no way contradicts your convictions
0	the next day , early in the morning , anna sergeevna summoned bazarov to her study and with forced laughter showed him a folded piece of writing paper
0	polechka , terrified , cowered with the children on a trunk in the corner , where , embracing the two little ones and trembling , she began waiting for her mother ’ s return
0	there ’ s nothing i can tell you
0	you promised to prove it : well , speak !
0	i take this to mean that he is unlike tolstoj or dostoevskij insofar as he is not a thinker : he is precisely what the most characteristic strand of russian criticism would have most vigorously objected to , ie , someone who is only an artist , someone who provides merely aesthetic pleasure
0	perhaps you do not know it , but i am very much afraid of you
0	as i was leaving , i said that i might be saying good-bye to you forever ; but if i came today i would tell you
0	he said to sonya , returning to his room and looking directly at her
0	bazarov , like the underground man , is sick , and turgenev is extremely acute in diagnosing bazarov 's disease : he is suffering from an illness that is the opposite of dostoevskij 's anti-hero , who suffered from an excess of consciousness ; bazarov , on the contrary , suffers from an unconsciousness of the metaphoric nature of language
0	then you must share proudhon 's opinion ?
0	he robbed us and went off to the tavern with the money
0	torments and tears—that , too , means life
0	no , she decided once and for all , god knows where it might have led ; one must not fool around with this kind of thing ; serenity is still better than anything else on earth
0	i ’ m not marrying him without being convinced that he values me and appreciates me
0	arkady nikolaich , do not you think it 's a bit absurd ?
0	i ’ ve been meaning to look in on you for some time ; i was passing and thought—why not drop in for a visit for five minutes or so
0	i have heard leibig has made some astonishing discoveries concerning the fertilization of fields
0	and especially if one ’ s naturally inclined to be so , he added , laughing again
0	i was so surprised when i saw it : you fool , you , i thought to myself , here ’ s what he ’ s been doing , here ’ s the answer to the riddle !
0	said pulkheriya aleksandrovna , looking at her daughter , full of alarm and anxiety
0	it 's very important ; in my opinion all the happiness of your life depends on it
0	he took money and some items
0	nikolai petrovich rang and called , dunyasha !
0	lizaveta ivanovna , you indescribable beauty !
0	cried bazarov with a contemptuous laugh
0	svidrigaylov was suddenly naïvely alarmed , without paying the least attention to the epithet characterizing his intentions
0	it might be possible
0	here ’ s one , sir , he continued , offering his guest a cigarette
0	perfect for the dissection table
0	he turned around quickly , threw her a devouring look—and , seizing both her hands , suddenly drew her to his chest
0	did anyone disturb you at all ?
0	i decided this a while ago
0	the agent was here a while ago , from vakhrushin ’ s office
0	who had called upon him to judge ?
0	it 's you , herr sitnikov , said bazarov , continuing along the sidewalk
0	why do i agree now to live like this ?
0	she was not alone but was surrounded by kapernaumov ’ s four little children
0	i ’ ll come and go
0	razumikhin blushed desperately at this idea ; all of a sudden , as if intentionally , at that very moment , he clearly recalled how he had told them yesterday , standing on the stairs , that the landlady was jealous of avdotya romanovna with regard to him
0	razumikhin cried in ecstasy
0	lizaveta gave it to me ; i asked her for it
0	did he come on his own ?
0	but doubts still remained : let ’ s suppose he returned an hour later to put it back , but nastasya was also there
0	in such circumstances that must mean something
0	on the staircase he hid from kokh , pestryakov , and the caretaker in the empty apartment exactly when dmitry and nikolai had run out
0	after i ’ ve escorted you home , i ’ ll pour two buckets of cold water over my head right here in the canal , and i ’ ll be fine
0	meanwhile , razumikhin sat down next to him on the sofa , clumsily , like a bear , and put his left arm around raskolnikov ’ s head , in spite of the fact that he could have raised his head by himself ; with his right hand razumikhin carried a spoonful of soup to his mouth , first blowing on it several times beforehand to make sure he didn ’ t burn himself
0	fenechka started laughing again and even clapped her hands , so amusing did bazarov 's request seem to her
0	at first the elegant lady trembled as a result of this thunder and lightning
0	haven ’ t you seen them since then ?
0	a terrible , deep cough disrupted her words
0	i owe you an explanation and feel obligated to provide you with one , sir , he continued with a little smile and even tapped his hand on raskolnikov ’ s knee lightly
0	how could that be ?
0	the only good point about a russian is that he has a very low opinion of himself
0	but why did not you tell me i have a brother ?
0	in fact , not only does nikolai love her , but both his brother pavel and their houseguest bazarov find her very attractive , virtually irresistible
0	the influence of dostoevsky and chekhov on turgenev 's fathers and sons
0	this man used to love me !
0	he looked at fenechka carefully , almost mournfully
0	such pacing from corner to corner in deep thought was avdotya romanovna ’ s usual habit , and her mother always feared interrupting her reflections at such times
0	blood was flowing from his face and head ; his face was all beaten , battered , and mangled
0	she rushed from one person to the next
0	he was so poorly dressed that someone else , even someone used to seeing such , would be ashamed to appear on the street during the day wearing such ragged clothes
0	meanwhile , now , as soon as he had said it , it suddenly seemed to her that it was just as if she had foreseen exactly that
0	then i became so fed up with all this chatter , so very fed up !
0	not friendship , but the feeling of a man and a citizen , the feeling of humanity and love for the almighty
0	bazarov can be brusque to his parents but never treats them with the rudeness with which he treats everyone else
0	are they all being interrogated ?
0	a little path ran right past the bushes that concealed the portico
0	that ’ s the only song she knows , and everyone sings it !
0	it was not for nothing he was a nihilist !
0	no , it ’ s not , replied dunya resolutely
0	sonya understood that he was tormented
0	bazarov 's purpose is not the discovery of scientific truth , else he would not peddle cheap popular tracts—büchner and the rest
0	arina vlasevna was very kind and , in her own way , not at all stupid
0	but we will see what we shall see
0	even in turgenev , however , this unitary language is very far from poetic absolutism
0	but petr petrovich didn ’ t accept the reproach ; on the contrary , he became more and more annoyed and irritated with every word , as if he were starting to enjoy it
0	today i ’ ve noticed , my friend , that since morning you ’ ve been in an unusually excited state
0	the policemen had gone , except for one who stayed a little longer and tried to push the spectators who had come in from the stairs back out again
0	he was also in a state of some agitation
0	at first , arkady thinks that passion most interests him , but he does not notice that really he is most occupied with prosaic love , a love that values trifles—that is , what appear like trifles from the perspective of romance
0	to live for hap for hap for happiness
0	for a long time now i have reacted to that accusation with contempt
0	or else , you could lie down on the couch—you ’ d still be among us
0	having returned home from abroad , pavel went to visit his brother with the intention of spending a month or two , to share his happiness , but he could stand no more than a week of it
0	but it 's very hot
0	anyway , he seemed like a fool
0	she was nearing the words of the greatest and most unprecedented miracle , and a feeling of immense triumph took hold of her
0	finally arkady could stand no more
0	she really loves it—well , it began with a song ; but you ’ re a virtuoso on the piano , a maestro , a rubenstein
0	oh , by the way , nikolai petrovich began , obviously eager to change the subject of conversation
0	prokofich did not take his eyes off him and merely chewed his lips
0	what good 's my youth to me ?
0	the conversation struck him as interesting and significant , and he ’ d enjoyed it very , very much—so much so that he had brought a chair in order that in the future , even tomorrow , for example , he wouldn ’ t have to subject himself again to the unpleasantness of standing on his feet for a whole hour , but he could make himself more comfortable , so that he could derive pure enjoyment in all regards
0	this expression is well-chosen and characterizes our hero perfectly
0	it ’ s not time that matters , but you yourself
0	in one of them , at that moment , there was a loud noise and a commotion that filled the whole street ; a guitar was being strummed , songs were being sung , and it was all very cheerful
0	if rudin has partly been created in turgenev 's own image , bazarov , the hero of fathers and sons , is a figure in opposition to that image
0	what will i say ?
0	and how much that irritated you then and became mixed up with your illness
0	it is , she muttered
0	but raskolnikov was no longer listening ; he greedily snatched the document , searching for a solution to the riddle
0	it was being redecorated ; there were workers inside ; that seemed to astound him
0	she ’ s only doing this today , sir
0	arkady has become a zealous proprietor and the farm is already bringing in a fairly substantial income
0	have you ever seen people in my condition not set off for the elysian fields ?
0	her marriage to nikolai is described in no less than idyllic terms ; had she lived longer , one presumes she would have produced more children and provided them with a loving and secure childhood
0	exactly like them he lives in the mental sphere for the time being and spends his spiritual forces on it
0	turgenev 's new novel affords us all those pleasures which we have learned to expect from his works
0	and they didn ’ t even know how to exchange the counterfeit notes : one of them walked into the bank office , exchanged five thousand rubles , and his hands were shaking
0	will there be chilled cream with the raspberries ?
0	i wo not forget myself precisely because of that feeling of self-worth that was so cruelly mocked by mister by mister doctor
0	and , let ’ s assume he knows he ’ s a decent fellow , at least a little
0	he sat down on the deserted bench
0	after getting undressed , trembling all over like a horse driven to exhaustion , he lay down on the sofa , pulled his coat over himself , and immediately lost consciousness
0	a moment of silence ensued
0	he stood regarding the entire company with a severe and attentive glance
0	perhaps one in ten thousand ( i ’ m speaking approximately , by way of illustration ) is born with even broader originality
0	and they ’ re all so full of bile , so very full !
0	but why do they love me so much , if i ’ m not worthy of it ?
0	first , he had to make a loop and sew it into his coat—that would take only a minute or so
0	schophenhauer 's influence on turgenev 's thought dates from no later than , and scholars have singled out the great pessimist as the inspiration for at least certain aspects of poezdka v poles ' e ( ) , prizraki ( ) , dovol'no ( ) , and senilia ( )
0	we sense the narrator 's perceptiveness of social forms , practices , and values at every moment ; we never forget his sophistication , his infinite superiority over nikolai petrovich , to whom , however , he is indulgent
0	how dare you , you scum !
0	ten years later , at the time of the emancipation of the serfs , turgenev , anticipating dostoevsky 's skepticism about russia 's foundations , asks in a letter to the countess lambert : has history made us as we are ?
0	in chapter , when odintsova asks whether happiness exists , bazarov can answer only : you know the proverb : it 's always better where we do not exist
0	yes , maybe it ’ s true
0	finally there were some who detected that the author himself was not wholly sure of what he wanted to do , that his attitude was genuinely ambivalent , that he was an artist and not a pamphleteer , that he told the truth as he saw it , without a clear partisan purpose
0	you will come back to us later , wo not you ?
0	i cite the article of harai golomb ; though it deals with chekhov 's plays , his words are applicable to the mature work in general
0	because only peasants and the most inexperienced novices flatly deny everything during interrogations
0	as soon as i saw you the first time , back then , that evening , you recall , when we first arrived here , i guessed it from your look alone ; my heart faltered then
0	i simply pushed her away
0	why do you want to know ?
0	why are you looking at me like that , as if you don ’ t recognize me ?
0	imagine , sonya , that you knew all of luzhin ’ s intentions beforehand , you knew ( that is , for certain ) that as a result katerina ivanovna would come to grief , and the children ; and you , too , in the bargain ( since you consider yourself worthless , let ’ s say in the bargain )
0	asked the younger lad
0	of course , they set off as fast as possible to find mikolai
0	just imagine , she talks about the most trivial things ; you have to marvel at her : that ’ s just what makes me so angry
0	it ’ s true , it ’ s all true !
0	no , it is not banal , sir !
0	for heaven 's sake , what are you saying ?
0	it turned out that this time porfiry petrovich was alone
0	why , it was you
0	perhaps i won ’ t sleep at all tonight
0	but odintsova and bazarov do , eventually , come to bless the ordinary love they can neither share nor truly appreciate
0	they do this with absolute sincerity
0	there was a strong odor of perfume
0	for example , during his second visit , after he ’ d already received her consent , he expressed in our conversation that previously , even before he knew dunya , he ’ d intended to marry an honest young woman , but one without a dowry , and certainly one who ’ d already experienced poverty ; because , as he explained , a husband should in no way be obligated to his wife , and that it ’ s much better if the wife considers her husband to be her benefactor
0	you ’ ve heard about that , too ?
0	white winter had arrived with its cruel stillness of cloudless frosts , thick , squeaky snow , pink hoarfrost on trees , pale emerald green sky , caps of smoke above chimneys , clouds of steam from doors opened hurriedly , people 's fresh faces nipped by the cold , and the brisk trot of shivering horses
0	your article is absurd and fantastic , but there ’ s a flash of such sincerity ; it contains a youthful , incorruptible pride , and the audacity of despair ; it ’ s a gloomy article , sir , but a good one , sir
0	you talk nonsense , but if it ’ s your own , i ’ ll kiss you for it
0	you ’ re causing him to faint !
0	now this seems strange and unintelligible
0	modern scholarship has frequently noted turgenev 's debt to schopenhauer , for instance
0	i wanted to call on katerina ivanovna
0	bazarov said , cutting him off abruptly
0	bazarov scratched the back of his head
0	he had found out , he had suddenly , abruptly , and completely unexpectedly found out that tomorrow , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , lizaveta , the old woman ’ s sister and the only person who lived with her , would be away from home , and , as a result , the old woman , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , would be at home alone
0	you ’ d better not get up , nastasya continued , feeling sorry for him and seeing that he was lowering his legs from the sofa
0	for example , it might be possible to organize a subscription for her , or a lottery , so to speak
0	as for bazarov , he was 'honest , truthful , a democrat to his fingertips '
0	i dreamt of a figure that was grim , wild , huge , half grown out of the ground , powerful , sardonic , honest—and doomed to destruction nevertheless—since it nevertheless still stands only at the threshold of the future—i dreamt of some sort of strange pendant to pugachev , etc—
0	i just told you that the silver watch , which is worth very little , is the only object left from my father
0	it all depends on the environment , and the person himself means nothing
0	it was all still only circumstantial
0	razumikhin would remember this moment for the rest of his life
0	here , i ’ ve brought the pledge i promised a few days ago
0	as you like , he said at last
0	she has struggled too hard to mold her immediate circumstances to suit her sense of responsibility to her sister and to satisfy her own need for psychic stability
0	and that old crone wrote down the date in pencil !
0	the point is that she was much older than me ; besides that , she constantly kept some sort of clove in her mouth
0	there ’ s something else : i ’ m certain that in petersburg there are many people who walk around talking to themselves
0	i will answer you like an echo , 'where ?
0	after examining her swollen red eye closely , he prescribed and prepared a lotion , and , tearing his own handkerchief into small pieces , showed her how to apply it
0	where do you live ?
0	i ’ m not the least bit worthy !
0	well , then , i ’ ve come to tell you
0	well , ma ’ am , how about it ?
0	one can find evidence of turgenev 's thorough study of hegel 's most important writings in the well-annotated copies of enzyklopädie der philosophischen wissenschaften , geschichte der philosophie , wissenschaft der logik , phänomenologie des geistes , and vorlesungen über die philosophie des geistes contained in the writer 's personal library
0	my maternal grandfather built it
0	she whispered with effort
0	there was a whole society of them
0	so , where are you ?
0	he remembered how he had constantly tormented her and rent her heart ; he recalled her little pale , thin face , but now these reminiscences had almost ceased torturing him : he knew how his infinite love would compensate for all her suffering
0	what , rodya , are you leaving already ?
0	you laid hands on yourself , you destroyed your own life
0	you—with your ambition—a district doctor !
0	no , i ’ m absolutely sure it ’ s possible
0	neither lady seems ever to have thought of taking the indispensable precaution of reading her version to a russian holding the russian text , who would at once have spotted the dropped-out negatives and the cases of one word mistaken for another
0	but mr razumikhin is the sort of person who won ’ t endure indignation
0	she spends most of her time eating and sleeping , and has but one occupation—she runs their modest household with ruthless efficiency
0	he wanted to cry out and—woke up
0	first in command of a brigade , then a division—and who always lived in the provinces , where , as a result of his rank , he came to play quite an important role
0	in the barn next door he ’ d fastened his sash to a beam , made a noose , then he stood on a stump and was trying to put the noose around his neck
0	that ’ s why i invited you , so we could speak privately and consider it carefully
0	do you recall how he started to introduce her ?
0	there ’ s a man who engages in trade here on this corner , with a woman , his wife , right ?
0	and so , it 's all settled : fenechka will be my belle-soeur
0	a body that is indeed no more than its physical makeup
0	you ’ re someone who ’ s said to be not lacking in connections
0	but however intriguing this passage may be , i do not want to talk about it or about any of the male characters in the novel
0	remembering this , he began shaking
0	how 's he so different from us ?
0	the criminal firmly , precisely , and clearly reaffirmed his testimony , without confusing the circumstances , not mitigating them in his own interest , not distorting the facts , and not forgetting the slightest details
0	when raskolnikov looked around , he saw even more inexplicable examples
0	if bazarov could only hear that ! ]
0	you know , sonya , only now , just this moment , did i understand : where i was asking you to go yesterday
0	she will be very upset , arkady said , and so will he
0	cried ilya petrovich from where he was sitting , also attending to some documents
0	i should think so !
0	she began tidying up the apartment and preparing for the reunion , began to arrange the room intended for him ( her own ) , to polish the furniture , to wash and hang new curtains there , and so on
0	i believe you found it impossible to avoid this duel , which which , to a certain extent , can be explained by the persistent antagonism that exists between your respective views
0	as far as your brother ’ s concerned , what can i tell you ?
0	marfa petrovna was completely astounded and once again crushed , as she herself acknowledged ; on the other hand , she was fully convinced of dunechka ’ s innocence
0	i called him names , but don ’ t pay any attention
0	i told you previously that i wasn ’ t able to support myself at the university
0	you see , i don ’ t have any lessons either , but i don ’ t give a damn ; there ’ s a bookseller at the flea market by the name of kheruvimov who ’ s a kind of lesson in himself
0	when i proposed to the object of my affections that she run away with me to america or switzerland , perhaps i nourished the most honorable feelings in myself and even thought i was making arrangements for our mutual happiness !
0	the poor little horse ?
0	after a brief silence he added : she 's a duchess , a regal personage
0	were the sounds so special , so noteworthy , or what ?
0	asked razumikhin , following them down the stairs
0	but that lasted only a moment
0	'yes , bazarov repeated weightily , 'you are still stupid
0	after dinner we will sit down to a game of cards and i will clean him out
0	almost all of them have been identified , and you were the only one who ’ d yet to come forward , replied porfiry with a barely noticeable shade of mockery
0	rather than forsake that time warp , odintsova finds an appropriate mate and invites him to join her there
0	raskolnikov could make out the girl ’ s thin but pretty little face ; she smiled at him , regarding him cheerfully , in a childlike manner
0	she cried , squeezing him in her embrace and kissing him
0	one of them , where he led our friends , was called the study
0	for that and for some other reasons i wo not list
0	i wanted to hurry up and overstep
0	he sobs , but his breath falters , and his words emerge as screams from his constricted chest
0	now called fedosya nikolaevna , she wears a silk dress , a broad velvet band in her hair , and a gold chain around her neck—all the trappings of her office as mistress of the house
0	i have seen your father 's entire establishment , bazarov began again
0	he added haughtily , as if addressing some dark force and calling upon it
0	let ’ s go : you ’ ll be a witness
0	what do you think ?
0	where did you find him , katya ?
0	as for me , i swear to god that i ’ ll arrange matters and contrive things there ’ in such a way that your appearance will seem as if it were completely unexpected
0	by the way , evgeny vasilevich , you really must drop in on a certain lady who 's completely capable of understanding you , for whom your visit will be a real treat ; i think you may have heard something about her
0	what will you tell them ?
0	if i haven ’ t thanked you properly before , then
0	why did you have your child taken away ?
0	how do you like my dress ?
0	the rudins and bel'tovs begat bazarov
0	on the other hand , there are young , fresh forces , going to waste for lack of support , by the thousands , all over the place
0	muttered the unfamiliar gentleman , and he began climbing the stairs after her
0	and one for your mother
0	hey you , you svidrigaylov !
0	the caretakers didn ’ t go to the police , but i did
0	imagine , i went to your room ; i ’ ve been looking for you
0	the ladies quietly followed razumikhin up the stairs
0	in the arbor sat fenechka with dunyasha and mitya
0	from habit he speaks of the rights and duties of the aristocracy , and from habit proves in arguments the necessity for principles
0	it seemed to her that by his signals that he was summoning her and asking that she not call her brother and leave him in peace
0	and just where are you planning on going ?
0	oh , no , what are you saying ?
0	perhaps he ’ d have to reveal himself to razumikhin as well ?
0	the tradesman paused and suddenly bowed once again , touching the floor with his finger
0	we may regard lavrov 's words as so much obituary rhetoric
0	raskolnikov kept silent and didn ’ t resist , even though he felt he had sufficient strength to raise himself up and sit on the sofa without anyone ’ s assistance
0	forgive me for my slander and my malice
0	we must make a man out of you
0	the impression that man made on me was very strong and at the time not entirely clear : at first , i could not myself make him out clearly , and i intently listened and examined everything around me as though i wanted to verify the justness of my own feelings
0	why should i read to you ?
0	the small sooty door at the end of the stairway , at the very top , was open
0	that damned tradesman was sitting behind the partition in my office—can you imagine that ?
0	i ’ ve been away from home five days ; they ’ re looking for me , it ’ s the end of my job , and my uniform is left in some tavern near the egyptian bridge ; i traded it for these clothes
0	it must be posing a riddle now
0	as he went down the staircase , he even paused several times , as if suddenly struck by something
0	it seems to me you have nothing to complain about
0	i remember you and love you
0	raskolnikov smiled silently and sarcastically ; razumikhin winced deeply
0	but what ’ s really original in all this—and belongs exclusively to you , to my chagrin—is the fact that you sanction bloodshed as a matter of conscience and , excuse me for saying so , even with such fanaticism
0	petr petrovich doesn ’ t conceal the fact that he was educated on the cheap ; he even boasts of having paved his own way , remarked avdotya romanovna , somewhat offended by her brother ’ s new tone
0	this idea took hold of them
0	then will we understand all things !
0	are you really ill ?
0	experience , my dear sir , repeated experience !
0	eliot , trollope , and tolstoy share an ethical sense foreign to turgenev ; for they see the ground of ethics in the activities of specific small communities and regard individual goodness as possible only in the realm of inherited customs
0	are you satisfied with your hired laborers ?
0	sonya wailed pitifully , suddenly crossing her arms in suffering
0	he repeated gloomily and insistently
0	said sonya , strangely and passionately agitated by his words
0	oh , very well , if you wish it !
0	a lamp was burning in the corner in front of a small icon
0	but , they say , we have the facts
0	nothing happened , replied arkady
0	let ’ s begin : we ’ ll start at the top
0	but it proved to be very difficult to get rid of
0	ilya petrovich even extended his hand
0	about my acquaintanceship with
0	however , to respect oneself and submit—that i understand , that 's happiness
0	giving it to you is the same as giving it to him
0	he stood there and gazed into the distance intently and for a long time ; this place was very familiar to him
0	she could scarcely remember her mother
0	it ’ s not polite , porfiry petrovich ; perhaps i won ’ t allow it , sir !
0	what ’ ll she have left after she arrives in petersburg ?
0	why am i explaining all this to you now ?
0	i ’ d borrow a nice , soft armchair for you ; my landlord has one
0	then i ’ ll rush back here and , in a quarter of an hour , my word of honor , i ’ ll bring you news : how he ’ s feeling , whether he ’ s asleep , and so on
0	meanwhile , darya frantsevna , a malevolent woman well known to the police , had reported her to the landlady several times
0	but those little scarves will add only twenty rubles a year to her hundred and twenty , that much i know
0	it ’ s not where you ’ re looking
0	of course , you didn ’ t tell him about it , did you ?
0	raskolnikov said , growing irritable
0	is that our forest up ahead ?
0	i began speaking about you—and she asked me to stop
0	she said loudly and harshly , turning to amaliya ivanovna with an extremely stern expression , which caused the latter to cringe , not like those overdressed tail draggers of yours who wouldn ’ t have been admitted as cooks into my papa ’ s kitchen ; and my late husband , of course , would ’ ve done them a great honor receiving them , even though it was only out of his inexhaustible kindness
0	it would be difficult to specify precisely the reason why the idea of this ridiculous funeral feast was conceived in katerina ivanovna ’ s distraught brain
0	he yelled after the mustachioed policeman
0	seeing that the cartoon figure of kukshina would be used as a weapon of ridicule against all advanced women , he suggested that , however ridiculous the unripe , progressive female might appear , the traditional upper-class woman was even more ridiculous
0	while his shirt was being changed , because it was going to be washed that night , the little boy sat up on a chair silently , straight and motionless , with a serious look on his face
0	on the first-floor landing , the window frame had been removed from one window
0	eh , it ’ s all nonsense !
0	but father twin heroes and inseparable friends in greek mythology , also called the dioscuri ; probably both sons of zeus
0	their extra-scientific claims for science become subject to all the confusions and historicity of natural languages , the limitations of which for anyone seeking to express extrahistorical , ultimate truths are all too obvious
0	clearly it was unnecessary to be dejected now or to suffer passively , merely considering these questions insoluble ; instead , it was absolutely necessary to do something right now , as soon as possible
0	their prolonged kiss in the arbor eventually provokes the duel with pavel , resulting in bazarov 's departure and nikolai 's decision to marry fenechka
0	she reminded him that he was a father and the head of a household , and , finally , she said how vile it was for him to torment and distress a young woman who was already in distress and defenseless
0	nikolai petrovich began cheerfully
0	later i was told , i found out , that you ’ re a young writer and even a scholar
0	svidrigaylov ’ s clothes were fashionable , summery , and light ; his linen was particularly elegant
0	no , that 's not what i wanted to say
0	does it for old time 's sake
0	he even managed to gain control of himself , at least outwardly
0	how many serfs does your father own ?
0	that ’ s what it ’ s come to
0	their son works somewhere in the provinces , but he doesn ’ t help out
0	where are you going , rodya ?
0	he looks down on people and rarely even takes the trouble to conceal his half-disdainful , half-patronizing attitude toward those who hate him and those who obey him
0	and i myself confessed to you candidly , several times already , that this psychology cuts both ways , and the second way is greater and more credible than the first ; and , besides that , i have nothing more against you at this time
0	clucked porfiry petrovich suddenly , at once altering his tone and his look ; he stopped laughing immediately
0	but they spent the whole day trying to convince each other constantly that this couldn ’ t possibly be ; they were calmer when they were together
0	but he hadn ’ t shuddered because of that thought
0	the plural emphasizes the universal implications of his action , and the transition from contradiction to reconciliation is entirely consonant with the logic of the dialectic
0	between them occurred something like the scene of their first meeting at raskolnikov ’ s room when he was asleep
0	we even dared mention a few words on this account to petr petrovich
0	nikolai and arkady 's ability to deal with the social problems of the day is limited but need not give cause for despair ; bazarov 's disgust with the gentry and with limited , gradual reform is understandable , but his solutions are wrongheaded
0	he did not belittle himself , nor did he offend others ; incidentally , he enjoyed a chuckle over seminary latin and rose to the defense of his bishop ; he drank two glasses of wine , but refused a third ; he accepted a cigar from arkady , but did not smoke it , saying he would take it home with him
0	won ’ t you have a seat ?
0	he added , turning to raskolnikov as if apologizing
0	he asks , for example , what day is it ?
0	a real man , he says , is one whom it 's no use thinking about , whom one must either obey or hate
0	you were carried away !
0	don ’ t you see that from the very beginning everything he said during the interrogations was the sacred truth ?
0	after the service , raskolnikov went up to sonya
0	nonetheless , tied to a mode of existence characteristic of the past , pavel petrovieh finds life hard ( : [ p ] )
0	vasily ivanovich 's bronze cheeks turned dark red
0	his mother and sister were sitting on the sofa in his room and had been waiting for him for the last hour and a half
0	poem , indeed , is a major passage in the conclusion of one of turgenev 's most important early works , diary of a superfluous man ( dnevnik lishnego chelov-eka )
0	he did not try to clarify his own thoughts , yet felt he wanted to preserve that blessed time with something stronger than memory ; he wanted to feel once more the presence of his marya , experience her warmth and breath , and he could already imagine above him
0	playful wit and abstract conclusions of reason merely tempt you , sir
0	there was almost no furniture at all in this large room
0	is that fellow raskolnikov there ?
0	to hell with it all !
0	he blurted out suddenly , surprising even himself ; but at once , recalling what he had just said about her brother , he turned red as a beet and became flustered
0	hear that , mityukha , said another driver who was standing nearby , hands thrust into the rear slit of his sheepskin coat
0	pavel petrovich oppressed everyone , even prokofich , with his frigid courtesy
0	when i think of russia , h g wells wrote in , i think of what i have read of turgenev
0	after seeing no one in the courtyard , he strode through the gates and noticed at once , right next to the gate , a trench dug along the fence ( the kind often found in buildings with many factory workers , craftsmen , cabdrivers , etc
0	it seemed that there was still plenty of time before the fateful moment , a great deal of time remaining , and he could think about many things
0	then he stood up , bowed imposingly and cordially , and was escorted out with blessings , warm gratitude , and prayers
0	is not it all the same thing ?
0	oh , what did he care about all this torment and suffering ?
0	so , mr zametov , was i in my right mind yesterday or delirious ?
0	the dialectics of turgenev 's ottsy i défi
0	at that moment in his imagination there flashed the figure of ilya petrovich , lieutenant porokh
0	her eyes met bazarov 's and she blushed slightly
0	she started crying right there in the shop in front of the merchants , because we didn ’ t have enough money
0	then he thought about sonya
0	only the young people ate : the master and mistress had eaten their dinner some time before
0	on the face of it , bazarov 's ideas have little to do with politics , yet he is acute enough to think of them in political terms ; he recognizes that they are functions of his frustrated political passion
0	i saw it when you entered , and that ’ s why i turned to you right away
0	in his government inspector gogol said there was a single honorable character in the play—laughter
0	no matter how smart you young fellows are , old man paracelsus spoke the truth when he said : in herbis , verbis et lapidibus you know , i do not practice anymore , but two or three times a week i am obliged to relive the past
0	you have to gain strength by means of strength , that ’ s what they don ’ t know , he added proudly and self-confidently
0	signs of such a reliance in both writers are the frequent pauses and ellipses ; and particularly the eloquent gestures , quite as telling as words ( eg , the way on first meeting bazarov nikolai petrovich firmly grasps the uncovered red hand , which
0	well , sir , my idea is that you notice more and learn more when observing our younger generation
0	bazarov 's jeers did not in the least perturb vassily ivanovich ; they were positively a comfort to him
0	he waved his arm dismissively , foreseeing that this would turn out to be a bothersome affair
0	these ethereal young ladies in tarlatan gowns and outlandish crinolines—the phrase is kovalevskaya's—bedecked themselves with jewelry and swept their hair into
0	muttered the old woman as she came running from the living room
0	bazarov is not only an empiricist , he is also an uncouth rowdy , who has known no life other than the homeless , laborious , sometimes wildly dissipated life of the poor student
0	i wanted to tell you , mama
0	so , if you were not such a fool , not such a vulgar fool , an absolute fool , a translation from the original
0	for some reason , he ’ d imagined that he would find the place just as he ’ d left it then , perhaps even with the bodies in the same place on the floor
0	this was not at all the way he had planned to announce it ; he himself didn ’ t understand what was happening to him
0	cried ilya petrovich , extremely pleased to be teased in that manner , but still sulking
0	here ’ s the third floor ; should he go on ?
0	we ’ ve heard all that before , and it ’ s just an attempt to frighten us , but now ?
0	you ’ ve become friends ; i heard that , sir
0	everythin ’ you could possibly wish for !
0	excuse me , not here
0	five minutes later , he stood on the bridge , at the very same spot where the woman had thrown herself into the water not long ago
0	raskolnikov extended his hand and shook his host ’ s , still apparently with extreme effort to suppress his good cheer and to utter at least two or three words to introduce himself
0	and allusions—it ’ s all very clear
0	it divides life from eternity
0	just imagine what it ’ s like !
0	no , just think about this , he cried
0	i don ’ t drink , sir , that ’ s the whole problem , hee-hee-hee , that i don ’ t drink , sir , it is a problem !
0	i beg you , most respected amaliya ivanovna , remember the words you just spoke here in the presence of witnesses
0	i ’ ll say you did !
0	and my mother 's all right : her day 's full of all sorts of activities , 'oohs ' and 'ahs , she 's no time to think ; while i
0	his heart pounded in agitation
0	what , then , what must we do ?
0	as for pavel kirsanov , we need only think of prince andre 's disdain for speransky in war and peace to judge the gulf that in pavel 's mind separates bazarov from him
0	the old man was the only one laughing ; arkady managed to smile
0	odintsova quickly turned to face him
0	in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness , though he was in the highest degree well bred and poised , as though there was some false note—not in vronsky , he was very simple and nice , but in herself , while with levin she felt perfectly at ease
0	it ’ s true that all the way here in the train i was thinking about how we ’ d get to see each other , how we ’ d talk about everything
0	you think i want money ?
0	screams mikolka in a fury
0	but bazarov 's ridicule did not upset vasily ivanovich in the least ; it even comforted him
0	really in total delirium ?
0	this pledge , however , wasn ’ t really a pledge at all , but simply a smoothly fashioned wooden block , no larger than a silver cigarette case in size and thickness
0	abroad in the same period , and it is in at least one of these , in at least one of his works ( fathers and sons ) that turgenev 's importance both as a thinker and as a figure whose work had consequences in real life should rather be sought
0	stop it , he said , exchanging glances with arkady , who was standing near the carriage while even the peasant sitting on the box had turned away
0	i ’ m telling the truth !
0	and i would have told him the whole story
0	having learned , in turn , that he was depressed and concerned about her , sonya sent him a note written in pencil , informing him that she was much better , that she had caught a simple , mild cold , and that she would come to see him where he worked soon , very soon
0	sonya recalled how svidrigaylov had told her yesterday that raskolnikov had only two roads before him—siberia or
0	why is that the case ?
0	one of the convicts was about to attack him in a rabid frenzy ; raskolnikov waited for him serenely and in silence : he didn ’ t budge ; not a single feature of his face quivered
0	he stood there , stared , and didn ’ t believe his eyes : the door , the outer door from the entrance hall onto the landing , the one he ’ d rung and entered not that long ago , stood open , open as wide as his hand : no lock , no bolt , all the time , during all this time !
0	do you know what ?
0	that doesn ’ t happen here on earth , but up there
0	wouldid he hiccup a great deal ?
0	i gave away all my money
0	once nikolai petrovich had fenechka bring him a glass of lemonade ; pavel petrovich stared at her intently and emptied the glass
0	i thought about it all night and found where you are mistaken
0	of course , here you have a common commercial transaction , an undertaking for mutual profit with equal shares ; in other words , he ’ s splitting their expenses in half ; bread and salt in common , but bring your own tobacco , as the proverb says
0	ah , fichtrre , pst , pst , mon bibi , and so on
0	she repeated as if distracted and embraced him again
0	you can imagine her suffering !
0	turgenev does not depict this conflagration—though he alludes to it—for the same reason that he does not depict the meaningless ( bessmyslie ) or the formless ( hezobrazie ) : his novel is itself an icon of that culture he defends—restraint , order , form
0	what nonsense i just blurted out , eh ?
0	what do i have in common with this
0	the old woman kept coughing and wheezing
0	she turned abruptly and headed for the door
0	and i felt such a hatred for this poorest peasant , this philip or sidor , for whom i am to be ready to jump out of my skin , and what do i need his thanks for ?
0	the frying pan lebezyatnikov had mentioned was nowhere to be seen ; but instead of that , katerina ivanovna began to clap out the time with her hands as she forced polya to sing and lyonya and kolya to dance ; then she herself even began to join in the singing ; but , as a result of her tormenting cough , she broke off each time on the second note and collapsed into despair again , cursed her own cough , and even wept
0	he has often seemed to us to have left much unsaid , to have , as it were , only drawn the skin from his subject
0	petr petrovich , pulkheriya aleksandrovna proclaimed in a dignified manner
0	she was planning to come see you ; avdotya romanovna tried to restrain her , but she didn ’ t want to listen
0	how could i have possibly given her anything more ?
0	bazarov 's thoughts are expressed in his deeds , in his treatment of people ; they shine through and it is not difficult to make them out , if only the reader carefully organizes the facts and is aware of their causes
0	a year or so passed
0	this is the best time ; i couldn ’ t pick a better one !
0	and the person who calls him a scoundrel for that is also a scoundrel , he added a moment later
0	there 's no need for me to explain to you at this time why i sit here with my arms crossed , as you so kindly put it
0	he was even beginning to rave
0	poor vasily ivanovich hastened to reply
0	was it the arrears , or what ?
0	all of a sudden her arms , thin as matchsticks , embraced him very tightly , her head rested on his shoulder , and the little girl began crying softly , pressing her face more and more tightly against him
0	you conceived a theory and felt ashamed that it failed , that it proved to be not very original !
0	in that regard , we have here in petersburg
0	his role as a spokesman for his age , and for his position as cultural intermediary between russia and western europe
0	what i found out—and that ’ s exactly why i came here—about the murder of the old woman , the civil servant ’ s widow , he said at last , almost in a whisper , drawing his face extremely close to zametov ’ s face
0	pavel petrovich turned slowly on his heels and slowly withdrew ; nikolai petrovich followed him
0	luiza ivanovna hastened to curtsy very deeply to him ; hopping up and down with her rapid little steps , she flew out of the office
0	in vino veritas , and now the whole truth had emerged , that is , all the filth of his crude , envious heart !
0	the floors were strewn with freshly cut grass , the windows were open , and a fresh , light , cool breeze was blowing into the room ; the birds were chirping under the windows , and in the middle of the room , on tables covered with white satin shrouds , there stood a coffin
0	by it—yet you have invited two students to visit you here
0	she replied , but then directed the conversation in a different direction
0	finally , in one of the conversations between bazarov and pavel petrovich , one of them mentions cavour , directly citing a passage in the contemporary
0	nastasya cried suddenly and burst out laughing
0	he entered in a mood as somber as night and greeted them awkwardly , for which he grew angry at once—at himself , of course
0	anna sergeevna 's estate stood on the slope of a bare hill , not far from a yellow stone church with a green roof , white columns , and a fresco over the main entrance depicting the resurrection of christ in the italian style
0	gentlemen , gentlemen , please , let 's not get personal !
0	so all of that was just nonsense , and you don ’ t have your own girl , and so , most likely , you must be insane !
0	that ’ s all you need to say
0	he was breathing heavily , deeply , and infrequently ; blood had oozed from the corners of his mouth ; drops of sweat stood on his forehead
0	he began to fear his every word , every gesture , which , of course , would be embarrassing for anybody , especially for a person so unsure of himself
0	i ’ m getting married for myself , because i find things difficult ; of course , i ’ ll be glad if it also turns out to be of use to my family , but that isn ’ t the main reason for my decision
0	an enormous number of unresolved points and doubts still remained
0	what do you mean , the one ’ ?
0	i knew she vas a thief !
0	but peasants live there , genuine , homespun russian peasants ; so our contemporary , a developed person , would sooner prefer prison than life with such strangers as our peasants are , ha-ha !
0	i know , i know !
0	her only good feature was her eyes , not really her eyes themselves— they were small and gray—but their gaze , quick and deep , uncaring to the point of audacity , pensive to the point of despondency—
0	there were only two workmen , both young lads , one older , and the other much younger
0	thus , v v vinogradov found a whole multitude of realisms in the russian nineteenth century :
0	i can , but you can ’ t : she won ’ t take you in because
0	he was still on his knees
0	everyone who knew him found this man difficult to deal with but acknowledged that he knew his business
0	he finally found what he was looking for and began reading ; the lines jumped before his eyes ; however , he read the entire news item and greedily searched through following issues for the latest additions
0	you may laugh at me , but my mother ’ s come to visit—he turned to porfiry suddenly—and if she finds out , he said , quickly turning back to razumikhin , trying hard to make his voice tremble , that this watch has been lost , then i swear , she ’ ll be in despair !
0	what did svidrigaylov say to you ?
0	allow me to ask , have you known my evgeny for long ?
0	for two whole weeks !
0	i really don ’ t care ; i ’ m not here to cure you , but , of course , you understand me
0	breathed new life into hegel 's dusty triads
0	at this point raskolnikov became confused and was about to make a significant mistake
0	but that wasn ’ t the case !
0	he took a chair and sat down opposite raskolnikov
0	if i ’ d been racing or hadn ’ t called out to him—but i wasn ’ t going fast , only at a moderate pace
0	besides increasing in number , bazarov 's images of disease and death are now applied to himself : the machine 's become unstuck
0	and he will judge and forgive everyone , both the good and the evil , the wise men and the humble
0	as i was coming here
0	zosimov cried cheerfully as they entered
0	bazarov is a strong man , no doubt—and very possibly had he lived beyond his twenties he might have become , beyond the horizon of the novel , a great social thinker , a prominent physician , or an active revolutionary
0	it seems that you came to see me before you found out i was capable of having what you call my own opinion , observed raskolnikov
0	she , too , felt agitated all that day , and that night she even felt sick again
0	and it ’ s improper for me , an examining magistrate , to be carried away like that ; i had mikolka on my hands , and already had facts—say what you will , there were facts !
0	rest assured that he spoke about you with rapturous respect
0	ones , not only the nihilists like bazarov who were mentioned , but also the superfluous men , the failed quixotic idealists of herzen 's and turgenev 's generation , men perhaps like bakunin ; and if that conjecture is correct ( for it has to be admitted that it is only conjecture ) , then it is probable that turgenev may have decided to rehabilitate the reputation of his own generation of the intelligentsia by turning his failed idealist of a hero , dmitry rudin , into a revolutionary through the addition of the final short epilogue describing his death on a paris barricade
0	but my father 's all right ; he 's been around , had his ups and downs
0	i ’ m very , very glad to have made your acquaintance
0	then , like a spider , i took refuge in my corner
0	but in reality , it is actually marvelously clear , unusually attractive , and throbs with warm life
0	‡ long live perpetual war ( french )
0	raskolnikov took his cap ; still deep in thought , he left his room
0	and what makes it even worse , they apologize for not asking my advice and for deciding the matter without me !
0	who knows what might happen ?
0	how can that be explained ?
0	he thought to himself
0	tame and not the excitement of the wild
0	arkady turned around and saw a tall woman in a black dress standing near the door of the room
0	nikolai petrovich , fenechka 's voice rang out nearby
0	katkov took me to task for making bazarov into an apotheosis
0	what a swine you are !
0	you wo not believe me now , but let me say this : you and i fell into the society of women and found it very pleasant ; see above , p , n
0	if bazarov , for example , possesses the reader 's attention and sympathy , he does so because in reality all these words and actions flow out of a living soul , not because each of his words is sacred and each action fair
0	a feeling akin to suffering showed through it , but at the same time there was something immobile , almost insane
0	so you ’ ve come back !
0	at their last meeting , svidrigaylov explained to raskolnikov that he had made provisions for katerina ivanovna ’ s children and had been successful ; that he had , thanks to some connections , located certain people with whose help he had been able to place all three orphans , immediately , in an extremely respectable institution ; that the money he had set aside for them helped a great deal , since it was much easier to place orphans who possessed some capital than impoverished children
0	he was not to be found right away : he would made his way to the very depths of the garden and , resting his chin on clasped hands , sat there , lost in thought
0	believe me , i wish i were something ; well , a landowner , a father , a lancer , a photographer , a journalist
0	lizaveta ’ s work , thought the young man
0	katerina ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during the last week ; the red blotches on her cheeks burned even brighter than before
0	to his own astonishment , arkady constantly thought about ni-kolskoe ; previously he would merely have shrugged his shoulders if anyone had told him he could be bored under the same roof with bazarov , and whose roof at that—his father 's !
0	let ’ s go , mama , let ’ s just leave the room for a minute , a frightened dunya whispered
0	the next day he was supposed to leave for marino to see nikolai petrovich
0	i don ’ t want to !
0	kind sir , kind sir , you don ’ t know a thing !
0	a certain peasant named dushkin , the keeper of a tavern opposite that same building , appears in the office and brings in a jewelry case with gold earrings and tells a whole long tale : a fellow comes runnin ’ in two days ago , he says , toward evenin ’ , just after eight o ’ clock
0	it ’ s the blood , she replied at last , softly and as if talking to herself
0	and so , my young colleagues , i address myself to you
0	in spite of the fact that pulkheriya aleksandrovna was already forty-three years old , her face still preserved traces of her former beauty ; besides , she seemed much younger than her years , something that happens almost always with women who maintain their clarity of spirit , freshness of impressions , and honest , pure intensity of heart as they age
0	from my hands into yours
0	the door to the staircase was open wide , and he could hear shouts and arguments
0	a little while ago , i said to an offensive fellow that he wasn ’ t worth even your little finger
0	pavel petrovich turned quickly and frowned ; but his brother was looking at him so joyously , with such gratitude , he could not help but return a smile
0	you ’ ve been waiting for them !
0	moreover , the very form of a literary work , considered apart from its content , so far as that is possible , is itself an idea !
0	i ’ m so fed up with all of it !
0	let 's let bygones by bygones , she said , all the more so since , in all honesty , i was at fault then , if not for flirting , then for something else
0	she cried , resting after every word
0	he could hear women squawking
0	namely : he could never understand or explain to himself why , so tired and worn out , when it would have been most advantageous for him to go home by the shortest , most direct route , instead he headed home across haymarket square , which was completely unnecessary
0	when my only daughter went out for the first time with a streetwalker ’ s yellow ticket , † then i went out , too
0	you ’ ve lost your faith and you think i ’ m flattering you crudely ; but have you really lived much yet ?
0	perhaps you ’ re not in a good state ; you ’ re tired , she said gently
0	i am glad he 's come home
0	in this respect , the nihilism of the younger generation and the romanticism of the older generation are equally far from prosaic values
0	his work has become pure art
0	you have brought yourself , she said
0	i myself was present at some disgraceful affair
0	i ’ ll say too much again
0	i knew that you ’ d holler ; but , in the first place , even though i ’ m not wealthy , i have ten thousand rubles to spare , that is , i have absolutely , absolutely no need for them
0	but now he didn ’ t feel very afraid ; in fact , he didn ’ t even feel afraid in the least
0	from what heights of majestic serenity do you utter these philosophical prophecies ?
0	dunechka hastened to ask
0	that reconciliation , or at least the attempt at reconciliation , occurs on at least three levels
0	no , ma ’ am , this is not very nice , ma ’ am !
0	so then , what do you think ?
0	yes i have to
0	perhaps he ’ s saving you for something
0	she said , turning suddenly on raskolnikov
0	oh , what can be done now ?
0	as a result of prejudice , she might not agree to see me alone without a recommendation ; on the other hand , with your help , i can count on
0	some five minutes passed
0	are you going to a name-day party now , sir ?
0	but i ’ m a coward
0	so that ’ s what your convictions are !
0	when i ask him where he got ’ em , he says he ’ d found ’ em in the street
0	vasily ivanovich attended him in silence ; arina vlasevna came in to ask him how he was feeling
0	what sort of income ?
0	petr petrovich examined all those present with a hopeful look
0	the conductor conveyed it without any charge to you
0	you see , it 's sometimes useful for a man to take himself by the scruff of the neck and pull himself up like a radish from a row in the vegetable garden ; i did that several days ago i wanted to have one more look at what i was leaving behind , at the row in which i would been planted
0	indeed , the great effect of the ending is achieved not through bazarov 's speeches but by communicating the despair of his parents
0	he glanced up—it was zametov , the very same , looking the same , with rings and chains , his curled and pomaded black hair parted in the same way , wearing a fashionable vest , a somewhat worn jacket , and dirty linen
0	he ’ s a political conspirator !
0	by the way , do you believe in ghosts ?
0	and sometime , afterward , in a few years , after you ’ ve lived a while , perhaps you ’ ll come to understand what they meant
0	i don ’ t understand , whispered sonya
0	at the same time , i ’ ll let zosimov know , although he should have been here a while ago , since it ’ s already past eleven
0	he knew as well as anyone that in political terms there was a great gulf fixed between the representatives of the russian empire and the representatives of the russian exiles in paris , of whom lavrov was a recognized leader
0	behind the church a large village extended for some distance in two rows of cottages with chimneys visible here and there over thatched roofs
0	by the very way in which the butler met them on the steps of odin-tsova 's house , the friends realized they would acted unwisely in yielding so suddenly to a passing whim
0	so much so that even antonovich ( striking proof ! )
0	just now i wanted to throw it all into the water , the purse , together with all the items that i haven ’ t even looked at
0	hey , i ’ m an aesthetic louse , nothing more , he added suddenly and burst out laughing like a madman
0	the certificate ’ s still in her trunk , and she recently showed it to our landlady
0	where , though , in the final analysis , does a turgenevan ideal emerge ?
0	still less can he be reproached for abusing that superiority and that power
0	take care of your health , your health , sir
0	although razumikhin could rarely drink enough to get drunk , this time something was amiss
0	arina introduced order into the household
0	he 's such a good , kind man !
0	i have heard so much about i am an old friend of evgeny vasilich and can even say—his disciple
0	we were legally married , and she carried me off at once to her estate in the country , as if i were her treasure
0	no , you are a fellow artist , extending your hand in brotherly gesture to your friend
0	a strange smile distorted his face , a pitiful , sad , weak smile , one of desperation
0	were you friendly with lizaveta ?
0	you were asking the caretaker
0	he raised himself and sat up , but said nothing to her and looked at the floor
0	her eyes were wide open as if they wanted to jump out , and her forehead and entire face were wrinkled and distorted by a spasm
0	you think they ’ ll come and steal you away ?
0	tolstoy has anna read—
0	he cried , as he went through the gate
0	what , for example , could be more lowly than to teach a peasant to read , to help him , to found hospitals , etc ?
0	he made no reply and sank onto a chair
0	and you dared call me as a witness ?
0	let ’ s not sing a hussar leaned on his sword , § for heaven ’ s sake
0	what are you so glad about ?
0	zis izn ’ t ze place
0	the movement of the plot is dialectical as well , pitting tragedy and comedy against each other
0	i have never experienced anything of that sort , thanks to my sister ; i mentioned my income simply because it seemed appropriate at the time
0	i should ’ ve known all this , he thought with a bitter grin
0	thirty kopecks , yes , sir
0	fenichka , fedosya nikolaevna , after her husband and mitya , adores no one so much as her daughter-in-law , and when the latter is at the piano , she would gladly spend the whole day at her side ( [ ] )
0	from there the clattering of billiard balls could be heard
0	he took off his coat and jacket , wrapped himself up in a blanket , and lay down on the bed
0	with a shout he pushes his way through the crowd and runs to the mare , embraces her bloody , lifeless muzzle , and kisses her , kisses her eyes , her lips
0	as a matter of fact , some people really were laughing , while others were shaking their heads ; in general , everyone was curious to see this madwoman and her terrified children
0	well , go on and beat me , but don ’ t play with me like a cat with a mouse
0	so tenderly , with affectionate respect , with embraces , with loving compassion and gentleness
0	meanwhile my daughter from my first marriage has grown up ; i won ’ t describe what she had to suffer while growing up , my daughter , from her stepmother
0	i am sure you would not ever be the first to express your feelings , no matter how strong or sacred they were
0	that 's what she herself said
0	what can i do with a few five-kopeck pieces ?
0	once somehow , about two months ago , they were about to meet on the street , but raskolnikov turned away and even crossed over to the other side of the street so he wouldn ’ t be noticed
0	he deserted his mother and sister
0	i don ’ t recall , sir
0	a bit harsh , muttered nikodim fomich , sitting down at the table , where he started signing documents
0	i asked you for one reason ; i came for one reason : so you wouldn ’ t leave me
0	but his own lips and eyebrows were also twitching , his chin trembling obviously he was trying to control his emotions and appear almost indifferent
0	he ’ d even managed to slip something into the policeman ’ s hand
0	one morning arina came into his study and , after bowing deeply as usual , asked him if he could help her daughter , who had a spark from the stove in her eye
0	dostoyevsky mocked it and mocked turgenev 's interest in it
0	he used to meet her most often in the early mornings , in the garden or courtyard ; he never went to her room , and only once did she come to his door to ask whether or not she should bathe mitya
0	the trip to town , its purpose to look at people , also is not without consequences for him
0	the purse was crammed full ; raskolnikov stuffed it into his pocket without examining it and tossed the crosses back onto the old woman ’ s chest ; this time he also grabbed the axe and rushed back into the bedroom
0	you want to have contact with people , even if it 's only to abuse them , you still want to have contact
0	what will happen to you ?
0	he found razumikhin easily , as everyone already knew the new lodger in pochinkov ’ s house
0	pavel petrovich stood up from the table
0	a real man should not care ; a real man is someone you do not have to think about , but someone who should be obeyed or despised
0	going well beyond chernyshevsky , he insisted that love was not to be seen as a purely personal who scoffed at religion , customs , and convention ; those who busied themselves exclusively with studying the exact sciences ; and political radicals
0	arkady has become zealous in the management of the estate , and the farm now yields a fairly good income
0	amaliya ivanovna rushed to pick up the money
0	no , my friend , not at all
0	his legs were ready to give way beneath him , but he kept going
0	razumikhin asked suddenly , growing heated
0	the pain from the whip ’ s lash had eased , and raskolnikov forgot all about the blow ; one anxious and somewhat hazy thought now preoccupied him exclusively
0	in the background , katya , with her quiet sensitivity , her appreciation of daily rhythms , and her attentiveness to small gestures of sensitivity and kindness , plays the key role
0	they avoided her ; the conversation they would overheard accidentally would not leave their minds
0	good lord , pierre sapozhnikov why he 's always at lidiya khostakova 's
0	at least petr petrovich immediately pitied her
0	about the murder , he confirmed what he ’ d said before : i don ’ t know nothing and don ’ t have no idea ; i heard about it only two days ago
0	bazarov emerged as a simple man , free of all affectation , and at the same time firm and powerful in soul and body
0	i ’ m not talking about clues now
0	having thought it all through , while preparing for a new struggle , he suddenly felt that he was trembling—indignation even began to seethe in him at the thought that he was trembling in fear before the hated porfiry petrovich
0	the magical world he would already entered , arising from dim mists of the past , was shaken and then vanished
0	i ’ ll put on my sock !
0	the confession and communion ended
0	vasily ivanovich laughed and sat down
0	she said aloud to herself
0	what should i give him ?
0	no one can gain the upper hand over you
0	it seems we met somewhere
0	oh , if only i could guess the meaning of its secret ,
0	just imagine , rodion romano­vich , they found a gingerbread rooster in his pocket : he was dead drunk , but he was thinking about his children
0	because she ’ ll take the same road
0	i ’ ll be dirty , filthy , drunken , and to hell with it !
0	napoleon , the pyramids , waterloo—and a scraggly , vile widow , an old woman , a moneylender , with a red trunk under her bed—what a mouthful even for porfiry petrovich to swallow !
0	i don ’ t recall that i wrote any untruth , ma ’ am
0	his heart skipped a beat
0	we have to talk about something , don ’ t we ?
0	even without that , everyone he met would look up , stare at him , as if he was all they had to be concerned about
0	both virtues and shortcomings are more clearly apparent when regarded from a detached point of view , and , for this reason , a detached , severely critical view of bazarov proves , at present , to be much more fruitful than indiscriminate admiration or slavish worship
0	arkady turned to katya
0	raskolnikov folded his arms and began listening
0	raskolnikov stared in horror as the bolt jiggled in its latch , and he waited with dull fear for the bolt to pop out
0	dunyasha , she cried , please bring mitya here
0	perhaps it ’ s a good idea , but then again , god only knows
0	that compensates me for the unpleasantness of undeserved reproaches
0	that alone seemed somehow strange to raskolnikov : he ’ d just come from there , and here they were talking about her
0	porfiry petrovich will also be there ; he ’ s the local examining magistrate
0	he loves to dupe people , that is , not dupe them , but fool them
0	drink at least a little bit !
0	third , when arkadi agrees to give his father kraft und stoff to read , approving this choice because it is a popularization ( chap
0	while some accuse foreigners simply can not understand the merciless reproaches directed at me for bazarov
0	so far as the father and mother are concerned , it would be difficult to find anything more touching
0	he had something to say on that account that was both progressive and propagandistic and could console his esteemed friend and undoubtedly promote his subsequent development
0	they ’ re all you ever think about
0	as to whether he knows how to conduct the business , there ’ s no doubt about that either
0	you can ’ t imagine , rodion romanych , what cowards people are about having their own opinions !
0	consider the impact of the climate alone !
0	well , my friend , hell , i ’ ve gone on and on
0	what ’ s the matter with you , rodya ?
0	and nikodim fomich , of course , was also missing
0	raskolnikov identified himself , provided his address , and , with all his might , as if it concerned his own father , tried to persuade them to carry the unconscious marmeladov home as quickly as possible
0	gave herself to a man ; she wrote to her mother and father that she didn ’ t want to live among prejudices and was going to enter a common-law marriage ; people thought this was being too rude to her parents , that it should have been possible to spare them , to express it more gently
0	the translations of turgenev into french—though some are by mérimée and turgenev himself—have a tendency to strip him down to something much barer and poorer
0	i know one hand that could knock me over with a finger , if it wanted to
0	well , my boy , he said at last , give me a cigar , will you ?
0	what do you want her for ?
0	of course , we were careful not to let anything slip out about these future dreams of ours , especially about your becoming his partner
0	but tell me this : you seem to know the daughter of the deceased man , that very frail girl !
0	what ’ s there for me to ask ?
0	when i meet a man who can hold his own next to me , he said with slow deliberation , i will change my opinion of myself
0	the 'generation of the forties ' , his own and turgenev 's , may have been fatuous and weak , but does it follow that their successors—the brutally rude , loveless , cynical , philistine young men of the sixties , who sneer and mock and push and jostle and do not apologize—are necessarily superior beings ?
0	that means someone ’ s at home
0	he turned his pocket inside out in an instant and—so it was—there were spots , traces of blood on the pocket lining !
0	first , there seemed to be many people surrounding him , wanting to pick him up and carry him somewhere ; they stood over him , arguing and quarreling
0	i won ’ t sign it
0	but here arkady 's eloquence failed him ; he lost his train of thought , stumbled , and was forced to fall silent for a moment ; katya still did not raise her eyes
0	ah , here ’ s the news : a woman fell down the stairs—a tradesman burned up as a result of drink—a fire in the sands—a fire on the petersburg side—another fire on the petersburg side—izler—izler—izler—izler—massimo
0	of course , the fact that i killed the old woman—that was a bad thing
0	a chill seized raskolnikov at this hideous answer
0	it used to be that i ’ d lie around like a beast , and receive only abuse !
0	well , what about that poor mikolka , whom you must have tormented and tortured , psychologically , that is , in your own way , until he confessed
0	well , she asked after a little while , did it help ?
0	just at this time , some other steps were heard ; the crowd in the entrance divided , and a priest , an old man with gray hair , appeared on the threshold , carrying the sacraments
0	arkady , who at this point is just beginning to free himself from his discipleship to bazarov , allows himself to challenge his friend :
0	because we were alone , completely alone , she said in a plaintive voice and suddenly broke off , having recalled that mentioning petr petrovich was still rather dangerous , in spite of the fact that everyone was completely happy again
0	around the eating houses on the filthy , stinking lower floors of the buildings on haymarket square , and especially in the taverns , were gathered all sorts of craftsmen and ragpickers
0	if we have come this far , we might as well go through with it
0	razumikhin was also remarkable in that no failures ever troubled him and no adverse circumstances could ever seem to weigh him down
0	upon reaching the corner , she also turned into that street
0	yes , sir , fenechka replied
0	when he finished all this , he relapsed into gloomy thoughts once again
0	we met yesterday at your place , he said casually
0	it ’ s either me or luzhin !
0	one must not live in a disorderly fashion in the country , boredom takes over ( viii , [ p ] )
0	cried katerina ivanovna , indicating the dying man
0	the man was silent and suddenly bowed deeply to him , almost down to the ground
0	he ’ s not drunk at all !
0	but has come inside , has in fact become a part of odintseva herself
0	dmitry prokofich told me and explained everything
0	spite was seething in him more and more intensely , and if he ’ d encountered mr luzhin at that very moment , he might just have killed him !
0	terrible impatience pulled him farther and farther in
0	meanwhile pavel petrovich left the garden ; walking slowly , he made his way to the woods
0	he even followed the development of contemporary literature , though with casual condescension , it 's true : in the same way a grown man who meets a line of young boys on the street will sometimes fall in behind it
0	there was also this particular little theory of his—an ordinary one—according to which people are divided , don ’ t you see , into raw material and special people , that is , people for whom , by means of their high position , the law has not been written ; on the contrary , these people themselves create the law for others , for the raw material , the rabble
0	of course , i ’ m prepared to bow down before them , but you ’ ll agree , it would be terrible if there were very many of them , wouldn ’ t it ?
0	try to read a bit of it
0	what do you think ?
0	besides , she was proud , extremely proud
0	how do you do , arkady ivanovich !
0	for what is culture if not the measuring , the accumulation and preservation of values ?
0	well , the hell with all that , let ’ s get down to business !
0	mama also sent me
0	i will tell you straight out , like a peasant , god grant you health for your kind and good letter !
0	but painters—no , i don ’ t recall any painters
0	you know , he has something on his mind
0	later it seemed to zametov that the strangest thing about that moment was that their silence lasted a full minute , and for that minute they stared directly at each other
0	mikolka swings a second time , and another mighty blow lands on the unfortunate mare ’ s back
0	i live only once , and i also want to
0	the study of the mutual interaction , struggle and succession of forms and types of realism , together with their interrelations with other methods and systems of artistic representation in the history of russian literature in the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries is one of the central problems of the history of the russian literary art
0	if someone had come in , what would he have thought ?
0	the man noticed him right away , looked at him quickly , but lowered his eyes once more
0	that you ’ ve felt , felt a great deal—all that i ’ ve known for a long time , sir
0	your father always was a bit of an eccentric , he observed , playing with the tassels of his magnificent velvet dressing gown
0	for you a book , a pen behind your ear , learned research—that ’ s where your spirit soars !
0	i went back an hour later , but they wouldn ’ t admit me ; the third time i came—they let me in
0	razumikhin stood there , thought for a while , and removed his hand
0	nikodim fomich was about to add something more , but , glancing at the head clerk , who was also staring at him intently , he fell silent
0	raskolnikov turned to her and looked at her with agitation : yes , that was it !
0	last of all , i ’ m at least twice as strong as you are
0	leaning out over the water , he absentmindedly regarded the last pink glow of sunset , the row of houses , which grew darker in the deepening twilight , one distant little window , somewhere up in an attic along the left bank , shining with a flame from the last ray of sunlight that struck it for a moment , and the darkening water of the canal ; he seemed to be staring at the water with particular attention
0	we ’ ll see what the doctor says !
0	they do not know how to suffer , they will not complain , but at times they feel only that all is empty , boring , drab , and meaningless
0	you repeat that—forgive the blunt expression—silly reproach
0	snapped razumikhin , then turned abruptly to zosimov to resume their previous conversation
0	he asked upon entering an extremely spacious and even orderly tavern that consisted of several rooms , though they were rather deserted
0	well , go shoot yourself ; or don ’ t you feel like it ?
0	is he counting on my frayed nerves ?
0	you ’ ll drive him to madness and he ’ ll betray himself
0	in his autobiography he writes i was accused of proposing a nihilist philosophy [ he writes in obvious bewilderment ] unfortunately the censorship rules of the time prevented me [ from defending myself against such a charge ] such an explanation would have at once put an end to such misinterpretations
0	without the least delay , he began stuffing them into the pockets of his trousers and coat without sorting them or opening the wrapping or the cases ; but he didn ’ t manage to get very far
0	you ’ re the spit and image of him , not merely in your looks as much as in your souls
0	they would all begin a new life together
0	such is my nature !
0	directly , not stealthily—at his face , which was stern and irritable , his eyes downcast , signs of contemptuous resolution visible in every feature , and she thought , no no
0	some peasants were waiting inside
0	we must also say a word or two about peter
0	hear what the gentleman called you ?
0	to the memory of bazarov , katya whispered into her husband 's ear , clinking glasses with him
0	look , said arkady suddenly , a dry maple leaf 's broken off and is falling to earth ; its movements are like those of a butterfly in flight
0	she reached out her hand to take it
0	said ( yes , he ’ d said it clearly ) that he couldn ’ t live without her any longer
0	you both may be mistaken about rodya , pulkheriya aleksandrovna declared , somewhat offended
0	suddenly i look and see a girl of about thirteen , well dressed , dancing with a professional ; there was another one in front of her , vis-à-vis
0	at first marfa petrovna approved , but then she grew afraid that i ’ d overdo it
0	but also of fear
0	so , perhaps you can tell us something about him
0	yes , spring 's in full bloom
0	moreover , new motifs appear : insecure megalomania supersedes self-confidence , hostility to arkadi replaces condescending but genuine friendship
0	nikolai petrovich has been made one of the mediators appointed to carry out the emancipation reforms , and works with all his energies ; he is forever driving about over his district ; delivers long speeches ( he maintains the opinion that the peasants ought to be brought to comprehend things ,
0	you are being much too generous and modest , pavel petrovich objected
0	yes , the priest ; he 's going to dine with us i did not expect it and advised against it but that 's how it turned out he did not understand me well , and arina vlasevna besides , he 's very nice and reasonable
0	here ’ s the thing : an honest , sensitive man confides in a friend , while a businesslike man listens but keeps on eating , and then devours the other person
0	of course , i ’ m an ass , he said , black as a storm cloud
0	so much sorrow , grief , curses , and tears hidden from everyone , so much , because you ’ re no marfa petrovna , are you ?
0	but you know , evgeny vasilich , i have managed to figure you out : i was poor and ambitious like you ; i may have gone through the same trials as you
0	so , do you love her ?
0	katya drank the glass at one go , the way women usually drink , that is , in twenty gulps , without pausing ; she took the banknote , kissed svidrigaylov ’ s hand , which he had solemnly extended to her for that reason , and left the room ; the boy with the hand organ trailed along after her
0	did i ever think yesterday in the train that i ’ d feel grateful for this ?
0	where will justice be found afterward ?
0	brother , brother , what are you saying ?
0	there are sciences , just like there are trades and vocations ; but science in general does not exist
0	you have to do something right now , do you understand ?
0	in spite of the fact that he was almost collapsing , he managed to make a detour and approach his house from the opposite side
0	however , they don ’ t have any facts , not one—it ’ s all a mirage , it cuts two ways , merely a passing fancy—and they ’ re trying to use insolence to confuse the matter
0	anna sergeevna walked behind him slowly and , after calling katya , took her by the hand
0	here 's timofeich come to pay his respects to you , evgeny
0	you bound me by your word , and now you ’ re going back on it
0	you ’ re crying , sister , but are you able to give me your hand ?
0	what ’ s the matter with you ?
0	when bazarov leaves odintseva on the first night , the narrator describes her as she sits in solitude :
0	it ’ s a feverish blush , svidrigaylov thought , but it was more like a flush from wine , as if she ’ d been given a whole glass to drink
0	i wouldn ’ t have touched it for a year , or two , or three—well , just try to find that murderer !
0	it would be impossible for me to quote an excerpt from this magnificent episode ; it would destroy the integrity of the effect ; i should really quote the whole ten pages , but i do not have the space ; furthermore , i hope that all my readers have read or will read turgenev 's novel
0	and you would like to know the reason for my reserve ; you would like to know what 's transpiring within me ?
0	you ’ re in a government office
0	he added suddenly , looking at her
0	one enthusiast shouts from the crowd
0	it ’ s not his stinginess or miserliness that ’ s important here , but the tone of it all
0	turgenev 's narrator , voyeurlike , watches from jane costlow , worlds within worlds , pp
0	i ’ m not talking about you
0	the next morning , at precisely eleven o ’ clock , when raskolnikov entered the department of criminal investigations in the building housing the district police station and asked to be announced to porfiry petrovich , he was somewhat surprised by how long it took for him to be admitted : at least ten minutes passed before he was called
0	knowles , equally pessimistic about turgenev , is a good deal more patronizing :
0	my sister 's never been so favorably disposed toward you as she is now , much more so than on your first visit here
0	test , even then i understood perfectly well that i wouldn ’ t endure it
0	another unpleasant circumstance furthered katerina ivanovna ’ s irritation : at the funeral , almost no one , not one of the lodgers who had been invited , showed up , except for the little pole , who even managed to make it to the cemetery ; but at the wake—that is , for the refreshments—the most insignificant and poorest of them appeared , many of them even already intoxicated , the wretched good-for-nothings
0	we haven ’ t arrived at any truths without having uttered nonsense beforehand fourteen or so times , perhaps even one hundred and fourteen times , and that ’ s honorable in its own way ; well , we can ’ t even talk nonsense by relying on our own intelligence !
0	once he says the following to his friend arkady : you said , for instance , to-day as we passed our bailiff philip 's cottage—it 's the one that 's so nice and clean—well , you said russia will attain perfection when the poorest peasant has a house like that , and every one of us ought to work to bring it about
0	and i was eavesdropping here , sitting on this chair , two evenings in a row , for about two hours each time—and , of course , i was able to find out a thing or two , don ’ t you think ?
0	only after four hours does bazarov come to his father 's room and cauterize the sore spot , without concealing either from himself or from vassily ivanovich that this measure is useless if the infected matter from the corpse has entered the blood
0	the location must have registered in your memory automatically
0	what i wish to emphasize , rather , is what saternikov has in mind when he says the remarkable demonstration with which [ secenov ] illustrated his lectures acquainted students with the most recent techniques of scientific experiment and taught them to use the language of facts
0	as for the old aesthetic , literary culture , it will crumble before the realists , the new , tough-minded men who can look the brutal truth in the face
0	the only thing missing was for him to place his hand on his cheek and to lean his head to one side for him to resemble a peasant woman
0	in an instant , he shoved everything under his coat and fixed his eyes on her
0	dunechka ’ s already decided , and i ’ m in complete agreement with her , pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to say
0	in a good sense , my dear boy , arkady nikolaevich , in a good sense !
0	the next form for incorporating and organizing heteroglossia in the novel—a form that every novel without exception utilizes—is the language used by characters
0	what an eccentric you are
0	suddenly svidrigaylov appeared amidst this large crowd
0	my sister sonya , the little girl replied , smiling even more cheerfully
0	well , go on , said zosimov
0	martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , lord , by this time he stinketh : for he has been dead four days
0	turgenev 's view of russia , like chekhov 's , is nonetheless sadly relevant to twentieth-century russian history , particularly in the years of the development of the bolshevik revolution
0	it ’ s worth something , right ?
0	and as for zametov
0	this is in spite of the fact that she understands some of these questions perfectly
0	lebezyatnikov rushed over to him
0	the authorities ' choice fell upon matvei ilich kolyazin , son of the kolyazin whose patronage the kirsanov brothers once enjoyed
0	murder her and take her money and then use it to dedicate yourself to the service of all humanity and to the common good : what do you think , wouldn ’ t thousands of good deeds make up for one little , tiny crime ?
0	everything she did appeared to be done on purpose , as children say , that is , neither simply nor naturally
0	as soon as razumikhin left , raskolnikov stood up , turned to the window , bumped into one corner and then another , as if he had forgotten how small his room was , and
0	what will happen if you get taken away to a hospital tomorrow ?
0	as soon as he heard that his guest had a small matter to discuss with him , porfiry petrovich immediately asked him to sit down on the sofa
0	like luzhin and , probably , following his example , that nasty scoundrel lebezyatnikov had also failed to show up
0	[ fathers and sons , ch ]
0	young lady , young lady !
0	i treat you as a person ennobled by education
0	it is just as hesitant , ambiguous , and inconclusive about this intra-generic debate as it is about the inter-generic debate between the novel and the utopia or tract
0	other factors enter in : compromises of principle come to be accepted as expansion of experience , as recognition of life 's ambiguities ; more specifically , those who have created life and come to love what they have created are less willing to contemplate its destruction in the name of some abstract goal
0	bazarov drew a line on the ground with the toe of his boot
0	raskolnikov turned his pale , almost sad face to him and made no reply
0	and as far as anna sergeevna 's concerned , you recall , she agreed with bazarov about many things
0	he always frightens me
0	and her dress is torn
0	have some of the jellied fish , that ’ s the best
0	in the next room , somewhat larger than his own , there were two guests
0	- : the text of turgenev 's novel literally swarms with pauses and ellipses
0	whenever we put two emotions into juxtaposition we have what can properly be called an idea [ my italics—df ]
0	upon reaching her house , sonya turned in at the gate ; he followed her and seemed to be somewhat surprised
0	she collapsed onto the floor at once
0	in setting off to spend time with his parents and with friends bazarov had no particular aim in mind
0	suddenly flashed through arkady 's mind
0	she ’ s not that kind of woman
0	forms mustn ’ t hamper the interrogator at every step
0	when the question arose as to whether to shave his stubble or not ( praskovya pavlovna owned an excellent razor that had belonged to her late husband , mr zarnitsyn ) , the question was answered in the negative , even with some bitterness : let it stay like it is !
0	did you hurt yourself ?
0	i decided not to keep any of the freed serfs who used to be house servants , or , at least , not to assign them any duties carrying responsibility
0	as you can see , this is a task of vital importance , substantial and complex ; i probably will not be able to cope with it but i am willing to try
0	after a few hours of sleep the fever passed , but it was late when he woke up : it was two o ’ clock in the afternoon
0	when you still can ’ t walk , when your mug ’ s still pale as a ghost , and you ’ re gasping for breath !
0	you ’ re making things much easier for me , avdotya romanovna !
0	he felt oppressed , confined , and somehow awkward about having come here
0	now , if this old woman pawnbroker was killed by one of her clients , it must have been someone of higher social standing , since peasants don ’ t pawn gold items—how , then , do we explain this depravity of the civilized part of our society ?
0	he cried , wanting to extend his hand to her
0	will you be there ?
0	reprinted by permission of the author
0	having arrived here and now having decided to undertake a certain
0	she has such a kind face and eyes
0	meanwhile the doors of the inner rooms were beginning to be opened again by curious onlookers
0	while chatting with his organ of local government concerned with issues of trusteeship , foundling hospitals , and credit operations , including the mortgaging of estates
0	they think i ’ m sick !
0	this also surprised avdotya romanovna
0	the choice of the word primirenie strongly suggests a hegelian subtext , and the entire passages attempts to create harmony out of discord
0	bareheaded and all wearing cotton dresses and goatskin shoes , they were chatting in hoarse voices
0	what do you want ?
0	i didn ’ t kill to help my mother—that ’ s nonsense !
0	how can you take such bad care of yourself ?
0	i mean , will she really let you go ?
0	and someone else , as well
0	and yet the father is not only not offended but rather happy and satisfied
0	the sound of carriage springs , particularly noticeable in the depths of the countryside , suddenly reached his ears
0	she approached me , took my hand , and shook her head at me harshly , so harshly , as if she was censuring me
0	is there really no justice ?
0	§ a reference to nikolai chernyshevsky ’ s ( – ) influential novel , what is to be done ?
0	nikolai petrovich surmised that his brother 's loathing for bazarov had not diminished in the least
0	he ’ s innocent and very impressionable
0	raskolnikov entered the room and sat down on a chair in exhaustion
0	i ’ m an honest man , rodion romanych , and i ’ ll keep my word
0	the first is the thematic , where one of the major themes in the novel , if not in fact the major theme , is that all children rebel against their parents , thus embodying a principle that russian hegelians would identify as negation
0	evgeny , you know i have always been honest with you ; i can assure you , i can swear to you , you are mistaken
0	wait a moment , you derelict !
0	here ’ s where he lives , in this building , he thought
0	now , my friend , i ’ ve found out all there is to know about you ; it was not for nothing that you confided to pashenka when you were still on good terms with her , and now i ’ m speaking out of love
0	at the mitrofanyevsky cemetery , and then to come to our apartment
0	why are you all so tedious ?
0	about a minute passed
0	is he really trying to distract me with his foolish chatter ?
0	and thus the incident occurred
0	if a writer belonging to our younger generation and profoundly sympathizing with the
0	you ’ ve confused me completely
0	but he did not feel timid or agitated for very long ; odintsova 's serenity was communicated to him as well
0	a young girl was lying amidst the flowers ; she was wearing a white tulle dress ; her hands were folded and pressed against her breast—as if they were chiseled out of marble
0	i might be able to toss out an idea , a seed
0	'tell me honestly , he wrote to one of his most caustic critics , the satirist saltykov ( who complained that the word 'nihilist ' was used by reactionaries to damn anyone they did not like ) , 'how could anybody be offended by being compared to bazarov ?
0	bazarov , come over here and sit down on the sofa next to me
0	all i have to do is go down the stairs !
0	phew , what a fine young lad you are !
0	where are you going ?
0	his head is very badly injured
0	why , if i suspected you in the slightest , why would i proceed in that way ?
0	that was my money , my own , really mine
0	trying to untie the knot and turning toward the light from the window ( all of her windows were locked , in spite of the stuffiness ) , she left him alone for a few seconds and stood with her back to him
0	if it had been some other word , well then
0	are you therefore denying him any moral feeling ?
0	get some water right away , you devil !
0	regarding my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary , i agree that it ’ s somewhat arbitrary , but i ’ m not insisting on exact numbers
0	i do not wonder , incidentally , that bazarov has remained an enigma for many people
0	well , no , bazarov replied
0	there ’ s no reason to recall it !
0	in three years or so , you won ’ t be getting up to treat anyone
0	he still didn ’ t know why it was impossible ; he merely felt it , and this tormenting awareness of his frailty before this necessity almost overpowered him
0	three days ago there was another scandal in the tavern : a fellow ate his dinner and didn ’ t want to pay for it ; i ’ ll put you , he says , into my satire
0	but i told you sincerely , the whole truth !
0	is he also a relative of yours ?
0	which i mention in my diary is not love ) —then things are altogether bad
0	but the final words of the text , eternal reconciliation and life everlasting ( : [ p ] ) , convey the opposite message ; they take the novel beyond the confines of time itself
0	where am i standing ?
0	but where was that ?
0	and how , how will i feed them tomorrow ?
0	this doesn ’ t involve a question of permission or prohibition
0	ilya petrovich is here , and he ’ s beating the landlady !
0	bazarov and pavel petrovich , both distant from family life , argue over dinner , and we may , in the process of following the exciting and dramatic discussion , forget that a third set of values is tacitly present
0	with this thought , raskolnikov stared at him intently
0	turgenev begins this description of odintseva with an enumeration of her unresolved longings , her lack of passion ; he ends with a description of her in a moment of solitude—bathing—that both in allusions and rhetoric defies the decorum that odintseva so meticulously observes
0	on the other hand , if we take the novel 's tragedic side out of context , we are led to the view that life , ruled by fate and the irrational , is essentially meaningless : death is triumphant
0	i am writing this on the assumption that rodion romanovich , who seemed so ill during my visit , suddenly recovered within two hours , and that consequently , leaving his own room , he may be able to visit you
0	by this difference had diminished : nikolai petrovich had lost his wife and pavel petrovich , his memories ; after the princess ' death he tried not to think about her anymore
0	baden-baden , may ( june ) , [ original in german ]
0	i take the bet !
0	at times a shiver ran up and down his spine
0	rodya ’ s given me permission
0	or that if i posed the question , is a person a louse , then of course that person is not a louse for me , but is a louse for someone to whom that question never occurs and who acts without asking questions
0	is that possible now ?
0	i guessed it as if seeing through a clear pane of glass ; if i hadn ’ t been waiting for you in that exact way , then i wouldn ’ t have noticed anything about your laughter
0	he recognized that voice : it was that of ilya petrovich
0	he was crushed by poverty , but even his constrained circumstances had ceased to burden him of late
0	she also listened very attentively when i told her about the workers ’ associations in france
0	sometimes , upon emerging from a fragrant bath , all warm and soft , she would fall to musing about the insignificance of life , its sadness , travail , and evil her soul would be filled with unexpected boldness and seethe with noble aspiration ; but a draught of wind would blow in from a half-opened window and anna sergeevna would retreat into herself , complain , and feel almost angry ; the only thing she needed at that moment was for the nasty wind to stop blowing on her
0	don ’ t be angry , brother ; i ’ ve come for only a few minutes , dunya said
0	and do you believe in them ?
0	is there someone in my room ?
0	she cried out suddenly to one of them , have you had any pancakes ?
0	each of us has our own steps to take
0	we ’ ll translate , publish , and study , all together
0	such a sartorial ethos , requiring long hours of grooming and primping , gracefully underlined the leisure values of the society , the lady 's inability to work , and a sweet , sheltered femininity
0	from that point of view bazarov is a direct and immediate imitator of onegin , pechorin , rudin , and lavretsky
0	as even you must know , i didn ’ t have the honor of knowing your papa at all
0	my god , dunechka , what will happen ?
0	if only one could be other than oneself , or resemble oneself as little as possible !
0	this morning she chatted with me for half an hour , and it was very sensible and interesting
0	her braid became undone and curled around her shoulder like a dark snake
0	he was rushing to attend to some matter
0	i have friends ; i know useful people
0	bad idea , very bad !
0	arkady said with a tender smile
0	but she ’ s an awful bitch
0	he seemed to be grasping at anything and smiled coldly when he realized that fact , because he had definitely decided to go to the police station and knew for sure that everything would soon end
0	and there i was agreeing to live on one square yard of space !
0	he stood there awhile , smiled again , turned around , and once again headed up to the office
0	how did you say : to rob her , but you didn ’ t take anything ?
0	cried raskolnikov with exaggerated irritation
0	or anyone of that sort ; therefore , not being one of them , i can ’ t possibly provide you with a satisfactory explanation of how i would act , if i were
0	was clear : i knew very well that my attitude toward the character i had introduced was not only honorable and free of prejudice but even sympathetic , for i valued the calling of an artist , of a literary man too highly to be hypocritical in such a matter
0	all of these factors strongly furthered the conclusion that raskolnikov was not completely like an ordinary murderer , a robber , or a thief but something altogether different
0	the poor woman shouted in despair
0	i thought you ’ d cry out again , ah !
0	raskolnikov approached the gate and began looking : would he glance back and beckon to him ?
0	how dare you take ten rubles from him !
0	even i didn ’ t know the whole truth then
0	the preparations for the wake in katerina ivanovna ’ s room aroused his curiosity somewhat
0	vasily ivanovich sat next to bazarov
0	what do you want ?
0	first of all , you must get well
0	i ’ ll say she does !
0	svidrigaylov was busy making all the funeral arrangements
0	that ’ s sensible : you must cut your coat to fit your cloth ; and you , mr luzhin , what about it ?
0	but the peasant woman , who would come to complain that she felt
0	he had blustered only a little ; he hadn ’ t even managed to say everything ; he ’ d simply been joking , had gotten carried away , but it had all ended so seriously !
0	they do not retreat one iota from their rights , and consequently , they respect the rights of others ; they demand the fulfillment of obligations owing to them , and consequently , fulfill their own obligations
0	i can be both a public official and in the service , but i ’ m always obligated to feel that i ’ m a citizen and a human being myself and to render account
0	therefore , i must leave
0	he ’ s said to be a reasonable fellow ( which his surname shows ; he must be a seminarian ) ; well , let him watch over your sister
0	no , brother , you ’ re not telling the truth : the environment ’ plays a large role in crime , i can assure you
0	it ’ s well known what a fellow raves about in his delirium
0	he pulled some money out of his pocket and kept showing it to a policeman
0	razumikhin told me only yesterday that you were still delirious
0	on more than one occasion , upon returning home from a tender meeting with her , kirsanov would experience that lacerating and bitter annoyance that overwhelms one 's heart after a definitive failure
0	but that hurts more , sir , much more , sir , when they don ’ t reproach them !
0	n-no , sonya whispered innocently and timidly
0	after a fretful day spent in endless fantasies , in joyful daydreams and tears , that night she fell ill and in the morning was in a fever and delirium
0	or fashionable people , for example , people in high society , there ’ s always something to talk about , c ’ est de rigueur , but people in the middle , like us—that is , those who think—we ’ re always embarrassed and not talkative
0	it seemed that if he took another step , she would scream bazarov bit his lips and left the room
0	he needed to hurry and , at the same time , to make a detour : he wanted to approach the building in a roundabout way , from the other side
0	bazarov 's response to arkady is to insist on what is hidden , to insist that outer form dissolves to reveal something darker : his citation of a popular proverb ( still waters you know how it goes ! )
0	he looked at her
0	she shouted for a whole hour and finally ordered that dunya be sent back to me in town on a simple peasant ’ s cart , onto which they tossed all her things , linens , dresses , in any which way , untied and unpacked
0	she claims she ’ s only thirty-six and has a right to say so
0	he ’ s not a drunkard ; he never drinks !
0	the highest elected official in a province
0	what if that were true ?
0	never mind : he ’ ll come !
0	i ’ m waiting for him to come at any moment and recant his testimony
0	wait a bit , i told you only the beginning
0	when after repeated promises to return not later than in a month 's time , bazarov finally managed to tear himself away from the embraces that held him and climb into the coach ; when the horses set off , the harness bells began to ring , and the wheels began to turn ; when there was nothing left to see , the dust lifted , and timofeich , stooped and tottering as he walked , crawled back to his room ; when the old folks were left alone in their own little house , which now suddenly seemed shrunken and decrepit , vasily ivanovich , who for several moments continued bravely waving his handkerchief good-bye on the back porch , sank down on a chair , his head dropped to his chest
0	thus herzen had every right to claim that turgenev was more of an artist than people think in his novel , and so lost his way—happily , from my point of view : he was heading for one room but wound up in another and better one
0	you rang the bell , pulled it , but they didn ’ t open ; that means they ’ ve either both fainted , or else
0	for all that bazarov 's nihilism accurately reflects a phase of russian and european history , it must be taken more as a symptom of political desperation than as a formal intellectual system
0	by the way , don ’ t you recall , rodion romanovich , how several years ago , during the time of beneficial openness , a certain landowner—i forgot his name ! —was slandered for having beaten a german woman in a railway car , don ’ t you remember ?
0	well , i do , replied the officer , staring attentively at his impassioned comrade
0	it smelled of a freshly painted floor , as well as of camomile and melissa
0	you ’ re such a strange fellow
0	furthermore , i want to have a necessary and thorough discussion with you regarding one particular matter , about which i wish to learn your opinion
0	the offended young woman cried
0	despite his coolness bazarov begins to waver
0	she ’ s very nice , and all this is nonsense !
0	porfiry asked politely , extending his hand with excessive courtesy
0	he definitely had to hurry !
0	bazarov 's relationship with odintsov is brought to an end by a strange scene which takes place between them
0	no , rodion romanych , i ’ m not making a mistake
0	show it to me , mama
0	’ cause i was very afraid
0	is that an eating place upstairs ?
0	that ’ s all there is to it !
0	fenechka blushed , but glanced up at pavel petrovich
0	be so good as to choose
0	so then , my friend , so as not to go on too long , at first i wanted to unleash an electric current here throughout , in order to root out all the prejudices in this place at once ; but pashenka was victorious
0	she was breathing hoarsely and with difficulty , as if something were caught in her throat
0	however passionate , guilty , rebellious the heart concealed in the grave , the flowers growing over it gaze at us serenely with their innocent eyes : not only of eternal peace do they speak to us , of that great peace of indifferent nature ; they speak also of eternal reconciliation and of life without end
0	now i have a steward who 's a townsman ; he seems to be a sensible fellow
0	ten years passed in this way
0	( that ’ s a good phrase ! )
0	poetry can become outmoded because it is in a language that is false
0	their idealism is repulsive too
0	hey , wait a moment !
0	there was another one on a steamer last week : someone abused the family of a state councillor , his wife and daughter , with the foulest language
0	you know , i sometimes suffer from an excess of bile , pavel petrovich replied serenely
0	goodness , papa , whatever for ?
0	i ’ m entrusting them to you , so to speak , razumikhin
0	and immediately turned away
0	the hell with them ?
0	bazarov , meanwhile , falls prey to her charms , and flirts with her almost from their first meeting
0	if you didn ’ t believe that this could have happened , why have you taken the risk of coming to see me alone ?
0	but this is all nonsense , as i see now
0	no , indeed , it ’ s just that i ’ m interested , strictly , in clarifying the meaning of your article , merely in a literary sense , of course
0	tell me , why should i restrain myself ?
0	it wo not be easy to break the news to them
0	at least i try , as far as possible , not to let any grass grow under my feet , as they say , not to fall behind the times
0	what 's to be done , madam ?
0	well , let ’ s suppose there is evidence , sir , but evidence , old boy , cuts two ways , for the most part , sir
0	sonya looked at him , as he walked away , as if he were mad ; but she herself was like a madwoman , and she realized it
0	i ’ m talking about that question , how they themselves understand things !
0	raskolnikov took out whatever coins he had : three five-kopeck pieces
0	where could he run to , ha-ha !
0	how can i let him go away alone now ?
0	then , right after church , without making any stops , she came to us and told us everything
0	but i really don ’ t need any lessons
0	( they recalled it later )
0	no , sonya , that ’ s not it !
0	n-no , replied dunechka , growing more animated
0	leave me in peace !
0	it was very likely that he hadn ’ t washed or changed his clothes in those five days
0	magnificently well is the task performed ; but we should like to have seen the carcass disembowelled and hung up
0	i don ’ t need any
0	whispered the old woman , i would like to put an amulet around his neck , but he would not let me
0	here is another proof of the extent to which you familiarized yourself with that character : in the meeting between arkady and bazarov , at that place where , according to you , something was missing , bazarov made fun of knights and arkady listened to him with secret horror , etc
0	the rustic locus represents an escape to a simpler , less corrupt society
0	that 's what it 's called by your sort , is not it ?
0	nature ) , and is casting one last longing , almost nostalgic glance at monumental time ( eternal reconciliation and life everlasting )
0	have to well , then
0	he said , waving his hand irritably
0	raskolnikov was tormented by the fact that this senseless delirium lingered in his memory so sorrowfully and painfully , that the impact of these feverish fantasies was taking so long to fade
0	you can end up with a fever if such impulses happen to irritate your nerves and you go around at night ringing doorbells and asking about blood !
0	i ’ m not talking about the constant , universal robberies and arsons
0	he added , both catching and avoiding the inquisitive glance katya was directing at him
0	he hadn ’ t even thought about them just now as he was inspecting his clothes !
0	but there absolutely is a definite law and there must be one ; it can ’ t all be a matter of chance
0	besides , he ’ d known all this before and it was not a new question for him ; last night when he ’ d decided to throw it all into the water , it had been decided without any hesitation or objection , just as if that was how it ought to be , as if it couldn ’ t be otherwise
0	what did you really think of me ?
0	however , what could they have in common ?
0	i have no idea how they scraped the money together to provide me with a decent uniform , eleven rubles and fifty kopecks
0	why did you go out ?
0	what ’ s wrong with all of you ?
0	your fingers are like a dead person ’ s
0	[ fathers and sons , ch ]
0	it seems to me that i ’ m completely candid : i ’ m telling you all these things for nothing , and i ’ m not even asking any reward , hee-hee !
0	nikolai petrovich was afraid of the young nihilist and had some doubts about his influence on arkady ; but he listened to him eagerly and attended his experiments in chemistry and physics willingly
0	you ’ re still showing signs of yesterday ’ s drinking bout
0	oh , how you torment yourself !
0	well , enough of this , however
0	how gray he 's become , the poor old fellow !
0	he explained it psychologically , in his own way
0	he will leave now , thought fenechka , but he did not , and she stood there before him as if rooted to the spot , her fingers fidgeting weakly
0	i ’ ll go to the governor-general himself
0	confess , my dear young man , that you ’ d really like to know what i ’ ve been reading about
0	raskolnikov slid the bolt and opened the door—he heard nothing ; all of a sudden , completely without thinking , he went out , closed the door behind himself as tightly as he could , and headed downstairs
0	i didn ’ t mean that at all !
0	turgenev brilliantly uses these characters ' psychological connections to time in fathers and sons as a means of illuminating the costly sacrifices that may be required by subscription to his moral program
0	i much preferred to lie there thinking
0	do you hear , sister ?
0	in any case , it ’ s unforgivably insolent
0	she stood with her side facing the table
0	right here in front of you—right here , just now , she confirmed to everyone that she received nothing from me but the ten rubles
0	you and i , my dear woman , he said to her , pestered enyusha too much on his first visit here : now we have to be smarter
0	no , brother , do not say that : bazarov 's clever and he knows his stuff
0	toward morning he felt a bit better
0	who saw me with you ?
0	society is deaf and implacable toward them
0	almost all the lodgers at mrs lippevekhsel ’ s apartment had spilled out of the inner rooms ; at first they crowded only in the doorway , but later they came bursting into the room itself
0	pavel petrovich , anna sergeevna , and bazarov , however forceful their personalities , are sufficiently psychologically fragile to require the support provided by identification with a single temporal phase
0	it was a moment of complete , spontaneous , pure animal delight
0	well , you know what happens to a prisoner who attacks a supervisor with a weapon : he accepted his suffering
0	as far as i can recall from yesterday , from zametov ’ s account , about half the matter came clear to me
0	that 's not much , is it ?
0	he continued to ask , addressing the stranger
0	that 's not one of my habits
0	principle , rather than say what really bothers him
0	what a delectable body !
0	on his way to see razumikhin , he hadn ’ t thought about having to come face-to-face with him
0	one must behave in the most delicate manner , act in the most skillful way , but she carried it out so that this newly arrived fool , this haughty creature , this insignificant provincial woman , simply because she ’ s some sort of major ’ s widow who ’ s come to petition for a pension and is beating down office doors , and who , at the age of fifty-five , dyes her hair black and wears both powder and rouge ( this is well known )
0	all of a sudden , now with a cheerful face , he burst into laughter himself , as if nothing had happened , and went up to porfiry petrovich
0	but all of these were just trifles he hadn ’ t even begun to worry about , and there was no time to do so
0	he closed the door behind himself again and waited a little while
0	chernyshevsky 's novel was indeed a successful manifesto ; it recruited countless thousands into the radical movement and led lenin ( who is known to have read it at least five times ) to declare , [ it ] profoundly transformed me and created hundreds of revolutionaries
0	as a result , it was terribly stuffy
0	said the beggar woman in a mournful voice
0	but it ’ s as you like , sir , and i ’ ll be very , very , very
0	it has to be
0	he could drink without limit , but could also abstain totally ; at times he could be unacceptably mischievous , but he could also refrain from mischief completely
0	he wondered ; but the mistress turned out to be russian , a woman about fifty , neatly dressed , with a good-looking , intelligent face and a measured way of speaking
0	and he brought in his psychology , too ; i had to devote some time to him , because this was a matter of life and death
0	did she really give you any ?
0	he brought the book nearer to the candle and began thumbing through its pages
0	not all of them , replied bazarov with a short yawn ; it was obvious he did not want to continue the discussion
0	well , tell me what to do now !
0	yells mikolka , and now , as if beside himself , he jumps down from the cart
0	i am even afraid i might be ill
0	nearly a half century later , on the eve of the russian revolution of , the liberal historian of literature d n ovsyaniko-kulikovsky , confident that russia was marching boldly along the progressive path of western european social development , scolded turgenev for the pessimistic and skeptical attitude he had displayed in his correspondence with herzen toward russian reality , the russian people , our history , our whole past and , at least , our near future
0	i ’ ll have to take that into consideration , he thought
0	imagine , she made good on her promise and took the children !
0	but now , strange as it seems , a peasant ’ s small , scrawny , light brown nag is harnessed to such a large cart , one of those horses—he ’ s seen it often—that sometimes strain to pull some huge load of firewood or hay , especially if the cart has gotten stuck in the mud or a rut
0	he already knew that a german , a civil servant , had been living there with his family : it must be that the german ’ s moving out now and , consequently , on the fourth floor , on this staircase , on this landing only the old woman ’ s apartment will be occupied for a certain time
0	you see , ladies—he stopped suddenly , as he was now climbing the stairs to their rooms—even though my guests are drunk , they ’ re all honest ; and even though we ’ re talking nonsense , because i ’ m also talking nonsense , we ’ ll finally lie our way to the truth , because we ’ re on a noble path , while petr petrovich
0	it seems to me that your arrival will have an extremely beneficial effect on him
0	who sent the letter ?
0	well , thank you , rodya , for telling me this
0	we ’ re neighbors , he continued in a particularly cheerful way
0	) —now i can confess to you frankly , that i noticed this idea of theirs a while ago , all this time , it goes without saying , merely as a hint , a creeping suspicion
0	true , since that morning a great deal of time had elapsed , too much , much too much , and there had been no news at all about porfiry
0	then i recalled your little article in that journal , you remember , the one we talked about at length during your first visit
0	don ’ t torment me ; say what you have to say !
0	( oh , what will happen to them now , what ? )
0	the scene in the hall , near the lamp , hadn ’ t passed unnoticed
0	judge for yourself : why should they call the caretaker , if they ’ d done the deed ?
0	bazarov did not become abased , and the meaning of the novel emerged as follows : today 's young people become carried away and go to extremes ; but this very tendency to get carried away points to fresh strength and incorruptible intellect ; this strength and this intellect , without any outside assistance or influence , will lead these young people on to the right road and will support them in life
0	you count badly , raskolnikov interrupted him
0	bazarov dies amidst that light and that warmth
0	there he seemed to feel better and even more alone
0	replied svidrigaylov , smiling vaguely
0	this definition of a real man precisely fits bazarov himself : he continually seizes the attention of the people surrounding him at once ; some he frightens and antagonizes ; others he conquers , not so much with arguments as with the direct force , simplicity , and integrity of his ideas
0	all the money was to be left to a monastery in the novgorod province , for the eternal remembrance of her soul
0	it made me very glad , the more so as my confidence in my own work was badly shaken
0	what a gold mine they ’ ve discovered !
0	in the hallway , among the crowd , he noticed the two caretakers from that house , the same two he ’ d told to fetch the police that night
0	examining her closely , he guessed at once that she was completely drunk
0	but what a temperament you have !
0	he stood up from the table , paced the room for a long time , and then stopped next to the cardplayers , as if rooted to the spot ; but he did not go home any earlier than usual that evening
0	and so the novel sets up a parallel structure , with the proponents of great abstract theories and grand romantic passions yielding to those cherishing the quiet virtues of daily life
0	it ’ s after two o ’ clock
0	he began to question her ; the girl came to life and very quickly began to babble something to him in her childish language
0	we destroy because we are a force , arkady observed
0	she ’ s looking for justice
0	they were stretched across the path , blocking their way ; people were swearing at them from all sides ; they were on top of one another like little kids ’ ( the actual expression used by the witnesses ) , screeching , fighting , and laughing , each trying to outdo the other with his laughter , making the funniest faces
0	( our people sent us ) touchingly demonstrate
0	he passes himself off everywhere as a worthless fellow ; he lives like a fool and will die the same way
0	don ’ t interrupt me , sonya !
0	he thought , walking slowly and limply along the canal embankment
0	and suddenly raskolnikov remembered clearly the whole scene from two days ago under the gateway ; he recalled that in addition to the caretakers there had been several people standing there , including some women
0	we started to congratulate him
0	however , he decided to leave in a few minutes
0	however , these rumors were very significant
0	it ’ s better to run away completely
0	why didn ’ t you come sooner ?
0	he said suddenly and decisively ; and she won ’ t visit me in prison !
0	i am thinking : my parents have a pretty good life !
0	you ’ re right that i have acquaintances , svidrigaylov replied , bypassing the main point
0	it seemed to me
0	another clerk was about to take a seat in the corner
0	[ he waved his hand weakly ]
0	he ’ s a clever fellow , clever , even very smart , only he has a special cast of mind
0	take you , for example : you avoid society , feel oppressed
0	i do , repeated raskolnikov , raising his eyes to porfiry ’ s face
0	before , this zosimov said he was afraid rodya might lose his mind
0	then i have the honor of proposing the following : we will fight early tomorrow morning , let 's say at six o'clock , beyond the grove , with pistols , at a distance often paces
0	were you drinking with him ?
0	i merely believe in my main idea
0	in a word , i haven ’ t looked into the glass retort in which all this happens
0	however , emotion had been awakened in him ; looking at her , his heart contracted
0	death will disprove you , and that 's all !
0	good heavens , evgeny , you are speaking just as you should
0	to act , destroy , he continued
0	do me a favor , leave all those vulgar tales alone , svidrigaylov replied squeamishly and with revulsion
0	i found it even back at the time , sir ; god sent it to me !
0	and yet he is extremely nice
0	i am surprised at you !
0	but consider the fact that a mistake is possible only on the part of those people in the first category , that is , the ordinary ’ people ( as i called them , perhaps very inauspiciously )
0	sometimes the poor come for my help
0	( and , seeming to draw her breath with pain , sonya read clearly and compellingly , as if she herself was confessing for all to hear : )
0	who sees time as his project
0	but you can ’ t endure it , and if you remain alone , you ’ ll lose your mind , just as i will
0	since even these results , that in the final analysis deny thought any meaning , are in themselves the results of from a a grigorev , sochineniya , edited by n n strakhov ( st petersburg , ) -
0	what do you have there , leeches ?
0	the two together might , like dostoevsky 's shatov and kirillov , come to a whole man ; but they are not together , they alternate in russian life , as in russian literature , each testifying to the social impotence that has made the other possible
0	whose hand is that ?
0	in a word , there were many problems ahead
0	but that ’ s not true , not at all !
0	sometimes it seemed to him that a change was also taking place in odintsova , that something special had appeared in her expression , that perhaps but at this point he usually stamped his foot or clenched his teeth and shook a fist in his own face
0	i know even more so that drunkenness is not a virtue
0	and you , katya , she added , play something for arkady nikolaevich ; he loves music , and we will listen , too
0	admit that you believed me
0	he expressed himself cautiously and said that of course , since he wouldn ’ t be able to get along without a secretary , naturally it would be better to pay a salary to a relative , rather than to a stranger , if that person turns out to be competent to carry out his duties ( as if you could turn out to be incompetent ! )
0	well , sir , good-bye , sir
0	the next morning right after breakfast anna sergeevna set off botanizing with bazarov and returned before dinner ; arkady did not go anywhere and spent about an hour with katya
0	it ’ s funny-looking , and therefore noticeable
0	raskolnikov jumped up from the sofa , stood there a few seconds , and sat down again without saying one word
0	bazarov denies close bonds between parents and children ; the author does not reproach him for it ; he only develops a picture of parental love before us
0	what 's the matter with you ?
0	that sort of thing happens quite frequently , you know
0	was it in any way permissible for him , razumikhin , to harbor such a dream ?
0	he made her acquaintance accidentally ; she was very timid and shy , and their courtship consisted of half-words and half-smiles
0	it goes without saying that to label all these systems or forms of realism critical realism is too general and calls for concrete historical differentiation
0	what ’ s the worst part of it ?
0	cried razumikhin , shaking and squeezing the two women ’ s hands
0	i may be a scoundrel , but you mustn ’ t be
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna was also about to bow to sonechka , but somehow didn ’ t manage it ; she left the room hastily
0	love him , love my brother !
0	svidrigaylov stood up and recovered his senses
0	† david livingstone ’ s ( – ) account of his travels in central and southern africa
0	suddenly a clock struck once from somewhere
0	go buy me a roll
0	eh , he ’ s in a hurry !
0	here 's our mr nihilist come to grace us with his presence , he said in a low voice
0	you ’ re not involved in it , so the hell with them ; we ’ ll laugh at them later ; and if i were in your place , i ’ d still try to mystify them further
0	a stream of blood trickled down his white trousers
0	so that ’ s what you ’ re driving at !
0	i was feeling very generous yesterday
0	his conversation seemed to arouse general , though listless attention
0	he was indifferent to food , but it was so bad , except for sundays and holidays , that at last he willingly accepted some money from sonya to provide for his own tea every day ; as for all the rest , he asked her not to trouble herself , assuring her that all her worries merely annoyed him
0	bazarov 's jocular tone , but , of course , bazarov pays not the slightest attention and keeps on talking about odintsov 's beautiful shoulders , he asks arkady whether this lady is really ooh la la ! , he says that still waters run deep and that a cold woman is just like ice cream
0	the matter was most ordinary and didn ’ t involve anything unusual at all
0	am i right in what i say ?
0	after an even more imposing silence than before , he continued :
0	why had he stood over the river and then chosen to turn himself in ?
0	whether you confess or not—it makes no difference to me now
0	one can always forgive that kind of lie , because it always leads to the truth
0	perhaps i found a treasure somewhere—how do you know ?
0	the key concept here is aufheben , hegel 's term for a transition wherein contradictions from a lower stage pass into each other and are simultaneously annulled and preserved in a higher stage
0	i ’ m sure that you have already formed an opinion about this mr luzhin , a relative of mine through marriage , even if you spent only a half hour with him or heard something about him reported faithfully and accurately
0	at that moment an adjutant came rushing up and asked her to dance a quadrille
0	vasily ivanovich cheered up a little
0	i found all this out recently from a very magnanimous man , to whom i gave myself ; we ’ ll establish a commune together
0	it ’ s almost ready now
0	he shouted at him , almost in a fury
0	bazarov shook peter by the collar and sent him off for the droshky
0	however , he finally found something to do
0	in addition , he felt in his own heart that groundless grief familiar only to those very young
0	do you think i ’ m not in favor of their telling lies ?
0	she , too , will understand
0	zosimov asked , addressing raskolnikov , staring at him directly and seating himself next to him at the foot of the sofa , where he made himself as comfortable as possible
0	at first she shunned him and once , toward evening , meeting him on a narrow footpath through a field , she turned off into the tall , thick rye , overgrown with wormwood and cornflowers , so as not to be seen by him
0	the peasant turned his dull and weak-sighted face to the two friends
0	what sort of a dirty trick was it ?
0	after removing everything , even turning his pockets inside out to make sure nothing was left , he carried the whole pile over to the corner of his room
0	she said rapidly , greeting him in the middle of the room
0	soldiers were carrying out a sofa , and i had to press up against the wall
0	i can ’ t imagine anyone more horrible , dunya replied , almost with a shudder , frowning
0	yes , yes , i ’ ll come , he replied , rising and hurrying
0	are you and i gods , then ?
0	the words burst forth at last from sonya ’ s constricted chest
0	you see , at the time i kept asking myself : why am i so stupid , what if other people are stupid and i know for sure that they are ?
0	i ’ ve decided this for certain
0	he explained all the reasons to sofiya semyonovna ; at first even she didn ’ t believe what she heard , but at last she believed her own eyes , her very own eyes
0	he went abroad , lived in germany and france , and returned to russia only on flying visits
0	lord , how stupid it all is !
0	won ’ t you help me learn to deal with him ?
0	i arrived at the station at daybreak—i ’ d dozed off during the night , exhausted , barely able to keep my eyes open—to get some coffee ; i look—and marfa petrovna suddenly sits down next to me , holding a deck of cards
0	he ordered tea , sat down , and lapsed into deep thought
0	no , my friend , it 's all that lack of discipline , shallowness !
0	raskolnikov said slowly , as if recalling something
0	so then , what do you think ?
0	odintseva in a moment of literal nakedness ; the narrator 's own transgression , however , is matched by odintseva 's
0	it was a sorry and pitiful sight to see her running , crying , and gasping for breath
0	to present the appearance of simplicity and homogeneity , yet in fact reveal the full complexity and variety of individual and social consciousness : herein lies a cardinal feature of turgenev 's art
0	these paroxysms of pride and vanity sometimes occur in the poorest and most downtrodden people and at times turn into irritating and irrepressible necessity
0	as you please , just as you please ; of course , katerina ivanovna would find it rather difficult to understand ; but are you aware that in paris they ’ ve already conducted serious experiments regarding the possibility of treating the insane , using only logical persuasion ?
0	he must have seen us today , he thought
0	pavel petrovich gave a little shudder , but then gained control of himself
0	from the beginning—or , rather , for a long time before—he ’ d been preoccupied by one question : why are almost all crimes so conspicuous , so easily discovered , and the traces of almost all criminals revealed so obviously ?
0	( i owed a total of seventy thousand )
0	this tavern , his debauched appearance , his five nights on a hay barge , his bottle , and , at the same time , this painful love for his wife and family disconcerted his listener
0	i have got lots of experience ; i have been around , you know
0	you know , i sometimes imagine it like that
0	in spite of her triumph and vindication—after the first fright and the passing of her stupor , when she had grasped and understood everything clearly—a feeling of helplessness and insult weighed painfully on her heart
0	they both approached the crossing
0	vasily ivanovich adjusted his hat
0	not true , they ’ re not more effective
0	nikolai petrovich exclaimed , rising to his feet
0	all right , what ’ s your little idea ?
0	it was hard to sink lower or become more slovenly , but raskolnikov found this aspect even pleasant in his current frame of mind
0	the business concerning your sister had been wrung out to the last drop
0	he gave him some medicine , a powder , i saw it , and then you arrived
0	if you correct society , you wo not have any more illness
0	continued raskolnikov with a cruel smirk
0	this was some sort of infinite self-humiliation
0	we will merely add that in general the factual , purely material difficulties of this affair played a very secondary role in his mind
0	on a funeral feast
0	the servant entered and informed him that the chairman of the provincial revenue department had arrived , an old man with sugarsweet eyes and wrinkled lips , who loved nature deeply , especially on a summer 's day , when , in his own words , every little bee takes a little bribe from every little flower arkady left
0	no , that ’ s not right !
0	but mr luzhin gathered his strength and , it seems , resolved for the time being not to notice any of this strange behavior
0	the owner of the establishment was in another room but frequently entered the main room , coming down the stairs from somewhere above , indicated first by the appearance of his fashionable shiny boots , with their large red tops
0	at that moment , he would have liked to strangle zametov
0	yes , yes , i ’ ll come , of course , of course , i will
0	raskolnikov hadn ’ t been here since then
0	turgenev 's every word was mannered ; he contributed no new word to russian literature
0	half an hour later bazarov and arkady entered the drawing room
0	i must observe that from a legal standpoint , this matter is extremely obscure
0	they were spouting such nonsense !
0	she began after a brief silence
0	porfiry could count on my answering like that and saying what i saw to establish credibility ; then i ’ d bring up something to explain
0	raskolnikov lay in the hospital all during the end of lent and the holy week of easter
0	how did you kill them ?
0	they ’ ll hear you and come in !
0	say , for example , to kill and rob ?
0	what do you mean too late ?
0	the student did so with some particular enjoyment and kept laughing , while the officer listened with great interest and asked the student to send this lizaveta around to him to mend some linen
0	fifi gladly ran out in the hope that someone would take her for a walk , but when left alone on the other side of the door , she began scratching and whining
0	raskolnikov desperately wanted to hear the words that were being sung , as if that were the most important thing
0	naturally , it ’ s impossible , but
0	mr bazarov referred disrespectfully to sir robert peel
0	in fact , everyone is in love with her : arkady , of course ; but also her father-in-law nikolai , since she shares so many of the values of his beloved first wife marya , and has even named her first-born kolya , after him ; even fenechka ( who will be discussed below ) is very fond of katya , and for good reason
0	raskolnikov stood up and began walking around the room
0	the next morning bazarov woke up before everyone else and left the house
0	i merely want to say that aristocratism is a principle , and in these times only immoral or frivolous people can live without principles
0	something whizzed sharply past bazarov 's ear , and , at the same moment a shot rang out
0	turgenev permits him to maintain his character by shifting the problem of generations to its ultimate form , that of death
0	surely you must know it was solely out of respect for you that i did not fulfill what you justly describe as my obligation
0	who ’ s this marfa petrovna ?
0	i love to meet young people
0	the major disagreements concern the questions of which characters actually represent the novel 's heroes and with which characters and ideologies turgenev 's sympathies lie
0	when andrey semyonych finished his lengthy explanation , with such a logical conclusion at the end of his speech , he was terribly tired ; sweat was even dripping from his face
0	the lines became confused in front of her because things darkened in her eyes , but she knew the passage by heart
0	if i agonized for so long about whether napoleon would ’ ve advanced or not , then clearly i felt i was not a napoleon
0	and there were little woodlands and winding ravines covered in sparse low-lying shrubs that called to mind their characteristic representation on ancient maps in the time of catherine the great
0	you know , rodion romanych , i threw an inkwell at him
0	in general you do not pay enough attention to such things , and you have such nice little feet !
0	in those days of national renewal , wrote elizaveta vodovozova , a representative woman of the 's , the young intelligentsia was moved by ardent faith , not by sweeping negation
0	there are romantics of realism they long for a reality and strive toward it , as former romantics did toward the ideal
0	and i await your family , that is , your mama and sister , at any moment
0	a carriage driver struck his back soundly with a whip because raskolnikov had nearly stumbled and fallen under the horses in spite of the fact that the driver had shouted to him three or four times
0	he must have stepped carelessly into that puddle then
0	at the most he sometimes wants to look at people
0	is that the case ?
0	razumikhin blurted out without turning around
0	he said ; suddenly he felt his voice trembling
0	dunya couldn ’ t help feeling that he was still very angry with her ; pulkheriya aleksandrovna kept examining him timidly
0	ye are made in the image of the beast and ye bear his mark ; but ye also shall come forth !
0	they were in the southern army , on the fourteenth of december , you understand [ here vasily ivanovich pursed his lips knowingly ]
0	meanwhile , katerina ivanovna seemed not to hear anything more ; like a madwoman she was embracing and kissing sonya
0	i love her more than anyone !
0	her composure was not shaken , but she felt sad , even shed a few tears , not knowing why , but not from any insult inflicted on her
0	i ’ m annoyed that all these stupid , boorish mugs will surround me now , stare and gape at me , ask me all their stupid questions , which i ’ ll have to answer—they ’ ll point at me
0	svidrigaylov said with a laugh
0	yesterday , in my drunken state , as we walked home , i blabbed about all sorts of stupid things
0	that witch , she set the time herself
0	in essence , chizhevsky argues that hegelian philosophy contributed hardly anything to turgenev 's works
0	and if we are wrong , so what ?
0	you were out walking the streets ?
0	beneath the rough , deformed , artificial , and affected forms , the profound vitality of all the phenomena and characters brought to the scene is heard
0	his face expressed infinite suffering
0	something was happening within him , something new , and at the same time he felt a kind of yearning for people
0	it leads to reflection precisely because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity
0	through this , if one were to judge the novel superficially , it is not very comprehensible , presents little that is appealing , and seems to consist entirely of an obscure logical construction
0	i do not know how to reply
0	is that the way to do it ?
0	you were in my lair , you saw it
0	domesticated , a fate bazarov will not choose
0	arina vlasevna summons you to tea , said anfisushka , walking past with an enormous dish of ripe raspberries
0	katerina ivanovna simply couldn ’ t resist : a week before she ’ d had a really terrible quarrel with the landlady , amaliya fedorovna , and now she ’ d invited her to come for a cup of coffee
0	why have you turned so pale ?
0	his former landlady , the mother of raskolnikov ’ s late fiancée , the widow zarnitsyna , also testified that when they were still living in another building , at five corners , during a fire one night , raskolnikov rescued two young children from an apartment that had already been enveloped in flames , and that he himself received burns in that fire
0	pavel petrovich began , without hurrying , to spread some butter on his bread
0	as he was leaving , svidrigaylov met razumikhin in the doorway
0	luzhin made a sour face and fell into a dignified silence
0	do you know how to dance ?
0	the form hasn ’ t gone away , sir , you ’ ll see for yourself !
0	he ’ s in such a state !
0	the cypress cross , that is , represents the common people , the copper cross—that ’ s lizaveta ’ s
0	they shared one strange trait : the more definitive they were , the more outrageous , the more absurd they immediately became in his own eyes
0	suddenly the lantern brightly lit the unfortunate man ’ s face : he recognized him
0	until yesterday he was constantly delirious
0	he very much wants to present you with ten thousand rubles and wishes to see you once in my presence
0	where did you see me this morning ?
0	i swear , i ’ ll shoot again
0	the dust we raise will blind your eyes , our mud will splatter you , but you have not reached our level ; you admire yourself unconsciously , take pleasure in abusing yourself ; but we find all this boring —give us someone else !
0	all right , arkady replied lazily
0	as the science he feels to be most scientific is physiology , it is not surprising that body imagery dominates his rhetoric
0	odintseva 's justification of her insistence on routine is that , otherwise , one would perish of boredom :
0	pisarev pointed out that her counterparts in real life were not nihilists , but false nihilists and false émancipées
0	i didn ’ t kill a person , i killed a principle !
0	how did you decide to do this ?
0	i think you have the right
0	i agree completely with all your observations ( the more so since v p botkin also finds them just ) , and tomorrow i will begin work on corrections and revisions , which apparently will be of considerable scope , and i have already written katkov to that effect
0	do you know what it 's for ?
0	he thought swearing an oath ; just as he was opening the door , he returned to take another look at her , to see whether or not she was asleep
0	dunyasha will do it if you are not there ; sit here for a while with a sick man
0	perhaps you ’ ll change your mind and come ?
0	the conversation about odintseva , however , is not merely a dialogue of chivalry and bravado ; the entire exchange is an assault ( on bazarov 's part ) on a culture that dissembles , presenting elegant form as a mask for something unseemly
0	it ’ s not your revolver , but marfa petrovna ’ s , whom you killed , you villain !
0	she approached him gently , sat down on the bed next to him , and waited , without taking her eyes off him
0	it ’ s not at all like you , for example , or that mr razumikhin , your friend !
0	i consider you one of those people who , if their innards were being cut out , they ’ d stand there smiling at their tormentor—if only they ’ ve found faith or god
0	but we do not find a psychological analysis or a coherent compendium of bazarov 's thoughts ; we can only guess what he thought and how he formulated his convictions to himself
0	although both interpretations have validity , neither takes into account the extent to which these themes are overshadowed by the fact that fathers and sons is very much a novel about time itself
0	marmeladov obediently and calmly raised both his arms to the sides to make it easier to search his pockets
0	still those same methods of yours : how is it you ’ re really not fed up with them ?
0	the author clearly started by wanting to do something for the fathers , but they turned out to be such nonentities that he 'became carried away by bazarov 's very extremism ; with the result that instead of flogging the son , he whipped the fathers
0	allow me to introduce myself , he began with a polite bow
0	every once and a while it 's allowed , muttered the old man
0	all because i left the veal on the table
0	it ’ s very , very important for them !
0	by the way , i have to speak with you
0	order is needed in all things , she replied
0	the most serious charge against turgenev of this kind would seem to have been made by d s mirsky : there had always been in turgenev a poetic or romantic vein his attitude to nature had always been lyrical even in his most realistic and civic novels the construction and atmosphere are mainly lyrical
0	phew , these shameless beasts , always pesterin ’ me !
0	the third sentence of this paragraph , while being a part of the author 's speech if judged by its formal syntactic markers , is at the same time in its choice of expressions ( this son of a medico ) and in its emotional and expressive structure the hidden speech of someone else ( pavel petrovich )
0	turgenev does indeed resolve his novel with a celebration of form and order—but an order that is open , not repressive
0	he was a man with a kind soul !
0	you can always get some money from her
0	in turgenev , we see only the results at which bazarov arrived , we see the external side of the phenomena ; that is , we hear what bazarov says and we know how he acts in life , how he treats various people
0	and when he learned you were studying law and that as a result of circumstances you were unable to complete the course , he said , what a pity !
0	everything , bazarov repeated with indescribable composure
0	but we , the speaking and writing realists , are now too carried away by the mental struggle of the moment , by this fiery skirmish with backward idealists , with whom it is not even worthwhile to argue ; we , in my view , have gotten too carried away to maintain a skeptical attitude toward ourselves and to submit to rigorous analysis the possibility that we might have fallen into the dust of the dialectic battles which go on in journalistic pamphlets and in everyday life
0	what terrible things you say !
0	even if i were guilty ( which is not at all what i ’ m saying ) , for what reason should i come to you and confess , when you yourself say that if i ’ m arrested , i ’ ll be at peace ?
0	almost anything could happen now !
0	he suddenly wanted to abandon the whole thing again and escape
0	near the big locked gates of the house stood a little man , leaning his shoulder against the building ; he was wrapped in a soldier ’ s gray overcoat and was wearing a copper achilles-like helmet
0	on that score , i can even tell you about a most interesting incident , one that continues up to now
0	you took offense at something he said and were unable to restrain yourself , nikodim fomich continued , turning courteously to raskolnikov , but that was to no avail : he ’ s one of our best men , our ver-r-r-ry best men , i tell you , but he ’ s like gunpowder , pure gunpowder !
0	a young person , carried away by his own wit , overstepping all obstacles ’ ( as you were pleased to express it in the wittiest and cleverest fashion ) , never even thinks about this
0	besides the danger of such an ecstatic , morbid mood , there was always the chance that someone might recall raskolnikov ’ s name from the former legal process and begin talking about it
0	i still can ’ t do it !
0	there ’ s justice and truth on earth , there is , and i ’ ll find it !
0	too great a passion is aroused in bazarov , while odintsov 's inclination does not rise to real love
0	he always seemed to take her hand with reluctance , always greeted her with a kind of annoyance , sometimes maintaining his stubborn silence all during their meeting
0	pavel petrovich remained alone and this time looked around with special attention
0	'civilization ' , meaning the civilization of the west , was the one and only item in the plethora of left-wing and right-wing ideas which turgenev was prepared to defend
0	for a moment , everything seemed to be spinning around raskolnikov
0	a hundred rabbits never make a horse , and a hundred suspicions never make a proof , as an english proverb has it , but that ’ s merely good sense , sir
0	one glass of beer , a piece of rusk , † and then , in a minute , my mind grows strong , my thoughts grow clear , and my intentions are reinforced !
0	as soon as i read the letter , i went out
0	i myself have always respected education combined with heartfelt feelings , and in addition , i ’ m a titular counselor
0	rodya , don ’ t spoil me too much : stop by if you can ; if not , then there ’ s nothing to be done about it ; i ’ ll wait
0	you know that was not the cause of our separation
0	he muttered in a low voice , as if not fully aware of what he was saying , and walked out of the room
0	what 's there to apologize for ?
0	don ’ t worry : nothing was divulged about the countess‡ but much was said about a bulldog , earrings , some chains , krestovsky island , a courtyard , nikodim fomich , and ilya petrovich , the assistant to the superintendent
0	then a strange thought occurred to him : perhaps all of his clothes were bloodstained , perhaps there were many spots , and he merely didn ’ t see them , didn ’ t notice them because his reason had been weakened , shattered
0	he went to church to pray with the other men
0	it became unbearable : he turned his deathly pale face toward her ; his lips twisted helplessly , trying to utter something
0	in a word—he was almost shouting , aware that the words about his illness were even more inappropriate—in a word : please either ask me whatever you want to , or let me go , right now
0	he pulled out the keys right away ; as before , they were all in one bunch , on one steel ring
0	after considering my proposal , you will see it 's replete with common sense and simplicity
0	however , there wasn ’ t much preparation to be done
0	her , arkady repeated meaningfully
0	i wanted to renew the conversation we began yesterday
0	you are healthy , independent , rich ; what else is there ?
0	fenechka blushed with embarrassment and joy
0	she gave him a welcoming , joyful smile but extended her hand to him timidly , as usual
0	she cast a sidelong glance at him
0	he went to the door , opened it , and listened ; but that wasn ’ t it
0	the worse it is , the better
0	ten years passed like a dream
0	if he does not come to love him , i repeat—i am at fault and have not attained my aim
0	how can you ask that ?
0	razumikhin shouted after him
0	they ’ ll all be
0	it ’ s you , you vile man , who may have been drinking , not me !
0	it was not only about you
0	she asks that you do us the honor of attending the funeral in the church tomorrow , and then come to a repast at our place
0	what do you want ?
0	why , it would be more just , a thousand times more just and more reasonable to plunge your head into the water and end it all at once !
0	listen to me , sir , he began in measured tones , using all his strength to restrain himself , but gasping for breath nonetheless
0	dunya recoiled from him in fear
0	petr petrovich , get out of here !
0	i said 'lousy little aristocrat , replied bazarov , lazily sipping his tea
0	he associated with these clerks precisely because they both had crooked noses : one ’ s nose turned sharply to the right , while the other ’ s turned to the left
0	cut off the whole million and reduce everything to a question of comfort !
0	would you like a cigar ?
0	even such a keen person as the poet baratynsky , called upon to look over the papers of pushkin after the latter 's death , could not help exclaiming in a letter : can you imagine what amazes me most of all in these works ?
0	but i was still a thousand miles away from supposing that she could represent this matter in a form so distorted by her fantasy
0	well , in that case , i will visit him , too evgeny vasilich , introduce me to your
0	leaving the civil service in which his father had by favor procured him a post ,
0	i ’ ve seen him only twice , but he seemed horrible to me , horrible !
0	he did not not know
0	that ’ s because i can feel it all
0	still the question remained for him : how could she have stayed in her present situation for so long and not lost her mind , if she wasn ’ t strong enough to throw herself into the water ?
0	do as you like
0	suddenly it seemed that the door to her bedroom was opening slightly and there , too , someone was laughing and whispering
0	i ’ ve been waiting for you here for some time
0	i do not deny the strange nature of our duel , but i consider it my duty to warn you that i intend to fight seriously
0	as for where he could acquire an axe , that detail didn ’ t faze him in the least , since there was nothing easier
0	he remembered why as he was passing an establishment , something like an eating house , and felt that he wanted to have a bite to eat
0	and it happened the same time i sent you that letter , that very day !
0	zosimov interrupted nastasya ’ s chatter with a certain displeasure
0	you wrote , raskolnikov began abruptly , without turning to luzhin , that yesterday i gave some money not to the downtrodden widow , as i really did , but to her daughter ( whom i ’ d never met before yesterday )
0	but what am i saying ?
0	the note asked him to cease these personal declarations and secret meetings that he ’ d insisted on
0	he cried insistently and irritably all of a sudden
0	if you were to say to him : ivan sergeevich , you do not like bazarov , but what would you prefer ?
0	it was a sudden death !
0	but as soon as he reached the stairs , he suddenly heard porfiry petrovich ’ s voice again
0	and remember , it ’ s with the same guarantee : if you wear these out , next year you get others for no charge !
0	lebezyatnikov immediately yielded and withdrew politely
0	bazarov , who had noticed her the instant she appeared at the ball , speaks to arkady about her , involuntarily intensifying the usual cynicism of his tone , partially in order to conceal both from himself and from arkady the impression that this woman has made on him
0	no , after what you have just said , you are not russian !
0	i have had a lot of trouble with the peasants this year , said nikolai petrovich , turning to his son
0	the waiter at the tavern , filipp , was already an acquaintance and fawned over him
0	if turgenev did not depict all fathers and sons , or not those fathers and sons who would like to be different , he splendidly described fathers in general and children in general and the relationship between those two generations
0	his conviction was fortified by his vanity and a level of self-confidence that could best be described as self-infatuation
0	as if they were right !
0	he only wanted to kill the old woman
0	the next day we hear that alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna had been killed with an axe
0	katya gave arkady a sidelong glance
0	that is , no one ever dared utter it aloud because it ’ s such ridiculous nonsense , especially after they arrested that painter
0	some second-major or other ; he served under suvorov
0	you can even find preencesses there
0	so that ’ s why you
0	kirsanov knows full well we are no croesuses and you do not own a palace
0	grinding his teeth once again , petr petrovich called himself a fool—of course , only to himself
0	he didn ’ t know and didn ’ t even think about what direction he was taking
0	i intend to fight seriously , repeated pavel petrovich and went to take up his position
0	odintsova soon appeared in a simple morning dress
0	of fate involved , something stronger than the author himself , something independent of him
0	well , yes , i am prepared to admit in front of this gentleman here that i had a certain passion in my youth—that 's true ; i certainly paid for it !
0	that sometimes happens with those monomaniacs who are too focused on something
0	should i take a cab ?
0	however , yesterday i , too , was
0	oh , rodion romanych , don ’ t believe everything i say ; perhaps you won ’ t be at peace at all !
0	would you like to know how we met ?
0	the door to the caretaker ’ s lodge was closed but not locked ; therefore , he was probably at home
0	are you strong enough ?
0	there are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities , avdotya romanovna
0	he found svidrigaylov very suspicious ; he decided to follow him
0	at times he wanted to begin swearing at them , taunting them , until they managed to force the door open
0	and fulfill my obligations
0	i like him very much
0	to fasten it from inside , someone has to be at home , do you understand ?
0	her father had managed to avoid all contact with his neighbors ; he despised them and they , him , each in his own way
0	a man must refresh himself with pleasant sensations ; life without pleasant sensations , even if all the vital needs are satisfied , turns into unbearable suffering
0	i had such dreams , strange , diverse dreams ; there ’ s no point in trying to tell you about them !
0	i don ’ t see her at home very often ; she leaves me all alone
0	he was thinking about her
0	it would not take much to present him as an ideal ; but to make him a wolf and justify him just the same—that was difficult
0	she must be around forty years old
0	i would like to
0	though the soup was barely lukewarm , raskolnikov greedily swallowed a spoonful , then another , and a third
0	herzen 's disparagement of the educated class in russia provoked turgenev into an for a discussion of the possible influences to which turgenev was subjected while he was in ventnor , see my article 'turgenev at ventnor ' ( slavonic and east european review , vol
0	fedosya nikolaevna really does not feel well today and will come out later
0	in short , who are you and what are you ?
0	i came by to see you , you know
0	the agent handed over the money and withdrew
0	as he emerged from voznesensky prospect into the square , he suddenly saw on his left an entrance to a courtyard surrounded by windowless walls
0	i ’ ve moved today , completely , with my uncle
0	that ’ s why you became so upset yesterday when i told zosimov that porfiry was questioning the people who had pledges !
0	in this instance he may be compared to a mathematician who tries to find some important theorem
0	time provides not merely a backdrop but a central focus of this masterpiece
0	the thing is that i really did cause significant trouble and unpleasantness to your sister , whom i greatly respect ; therefore , feeling genuine remorse , i sincerely desire—not to redeem myself financially or pay her for the unpleasantness , but simply to do something advantageous for her , on the grounds that i have not reserved the right for myself to perform only evil acts
0	he called me over to the window so he could question me in secret
0	what sort of a person are you ?
0	why do you , sofiya semyonovna , assume all these contracts and debts so thoughtlessly ?
0	it was then i conceived an idea , for the first time in my life , one that nobody had ever thought up before me !
0	he had attached himself to the idea of progress and to our younger generation out of eagerness
0	he ’ s also generous and kind
0	then , once on the staircase , he reconsidered and wanted to return
0	show him , aleksandr grigorevich
0	yet it was clear to him once again that sonya , with her character and the upbringing she had nonetheless received , could in no way stay as she was
0	silence prevailed once again
0	a year ago this young woman died from typhus , while , however , i continued to be a tenant there as i had been , and the landlady , as she moved into the apartment where she now resides , said to me
0	what will i replace it with ?
0	certainly , sir , replied fenechka , how much would you like ?
0	i ’ ve brought you
0	he stretched forward , leaned over , and raised the hook
0	well , damn it all !
0	why was it so necessary for him to ruin her life ?
0	i was very interested in it
0	well , yes , yes , yes , razumikhin said hurriedly , for some reason agreeing with everything
0	he remembered a great deal afterward
0	but the humane andrey semyonovich ascribed petr petrovich ’ s disposition to the lingering effects of yesterday ’ s break with dunechka ; he was burning with a desire to speak about that subject
0	on his first visit , he stated that he was a positive person ; he shares to a large extent , as he himself explained it , the convictions of our younger generation , and he is an enemy of all prejudices
0	her head also began spinning
0	katya threatened him with her finger
0	he left the eating place and set off almost at a run
0	for her part , katya did not prevent him from feeling despondent
0	man 's deliverance to fate and chance and the love between generations , the continuity of generations as man 's only consolation for the knowledge of his inevitable mortality
0	' i can not act now , thinks each of these new people , ' i will not even try , i disdain everything around me and will not conceal my disdain
0	we will each fire twice ; and , just in case , each of us will have a short note in his pocket blaming himself entirely for his own demise
0	and though mikolai isn ’ t a drunkard , he does drink , and i knew he was workin ’ in this here house , paintin ’ , together with mitrei , and they ’ re both from the same place
0	if only , if only i could rush up to him , embrace him , and weep—but i ’ m afraid , afraid
0	that evening anna sergeevna also thought about her guests
0	i will right away , and i will write to her myself
0	they may be frightened by it , they may be puzzled , but that is where the road to the future lies
0	i am afraid of them , of frogs , observed vaska , a lad about seven , with hair as pale as flax , a gray smock with a stand-up collar , and bare feet
0	at last he walked away , not even remembering where he was ; but when he reached the middle of the square , he suddenly experienced a tremor , a sensation overcame him at once , seized hold of him entirely—both his body and his mind
0	i hope these words do not refer to me , arkady objected with some annoyance
0	these days i can hardly think straight
0	what do you think , brother ?
0	i idolize my son ; as for the old woman : you know how mothers are !
0	no one answered her
0	it ’ s a steep climb to golgotha† hmm
0	it was as if it had been waiting to ambush him !
0	exclaimed the extremely elated pulkheriya aleksandrovna
0	that i was drunk , but
0	the light was no longer so bright in the courtyard
0	well , rodya , let ’ s not detain our guest
0	ah , my goodness , dmitry prokofich , you still don ’ t know
0	then for some reason she rushed to collect her silver spoons from the table
0	he had never before heard such unnatural sounds , such howling , wailing , gnashing , weeping , beating , and cursing
0	deep in thought , he sank down on the bench , weak and exhausted , looking at no one , oblivious of his surroundings
0	what is important is that he recognized himself and others like him in bazarov and supplied what was lacking in the book
0	well , sir , that ’ s where i ’ m coming from ; it ’ s already my fifth night
0	he hardly survived the blow and his hair turned gray in the course of a few weeks ; he was hoping to go abroad to distract himself a bit but then came the events of
0	she was terribly offended , and i thought to myself : what 's to be done ?
0	but then a strange thing happened , something so unexpected in the normal course of events that neither raskolnikov nor porfiry petrovich could have counted on such a denouement
0	finally it seemed to achilles that something was amiss ; here was a sober man , standing only three paces away from him , looking him right in the eye , saying nothing
0	dunyasha giggled with him gladly and would give him sidelong , meaningful glances as she ran by like a little quail ; peter , an extremely vain and stupid man whose brow was eternally furrowed under the strain , a man whose entire merit consisted in the fact that he looked respectful , could read haltingly , and frequently brushed his jacket—even he would smirk and brighten up as soon as bazarov paid him any attention ; the peasant boys ran after the doktur
0	this brief gesture struck raskolnikov with confusion ; it was even strange
0	especially in the evenings , nastasya was frequently away from the house : either she ran off to the neighbors or to a shop , and the door was always left wide open
0	anna sergeevna left quietly
0	he soon found a purely literary career more appealing , however , and the rest , as they say , is history
0	this little idea of mine is so very playful
0	he said at last , placing his hands behind his head
0	svidrigaylov might also be another way out ; but porfiry was another matter
0	now i am going to return to my dogs
0	lord rest her soul !
0	there were no traces of blood left on it , but the wood was still damp
0	in a few minutes bazarov had covered all the paths in the garden , looked over the cattle sheds and stables , and come upon two local lads whose acquaintance he made at once ; he set off with them to a small marsh , about a mile from the manor house , to search for frogs
0	one must simply exercise one ’ s willpower and all one ’ s reason over these difficulties , and they will all be overcome in their time , when one becomes familiar with all the details of this affair in all of its precision
0	thus , turgenev does not fully sympathize with anyone or anything in his novel
0	the worst part is that you really do feel sad about something !
0	my , you ’ re a pretty one !
0	then he opened the notice with trepidation and began reading ; he read for a long time and finally understood
0	tell me what the peasant mir is all about ?
0	it ’ s all a mistake
0	she hadn ’ t come through the wall
0	aren ’ t you ashamed now , dunya ?
0	i ’ d go see him a day after that
0	he threw off his overcoat and looked at his father with such a young boy 's joyous face that his father embraced him once again
0	you ’ re still mocking me
0	do you love them , yevgeni ?
0	for almost two hundred years , we ’ ve been weaned away from any action
0	i will not expatiate on the impression made by that tale ; i will only say that when i returned to st petersburg , the very day of the notorious fires in the apraksin palace , the word nihilist had already been taken up by thousands of voices , and the first exclamation that burst from the lips of the first acquaintance i encountered on the nevsky was see what your nihilists are doing !
0	petr petrovich proved to be clever enough to accept this explanation immediately
0	papa , what are they doing ?
0	and does not conceal his hero 's blunders from the reader ; many express the desire that bazarov had been presented as an irreproachable man , a knight of thought without fear and reproach , and that thereby the superiority of realism to all other schools of thought would thus have been proved to the reading public
0	in the first place , i will have to risk getting shot and i will have to leave ; then there 's arkady and gentle old nikolai petrovich
0	everyone came running , crowding all around
0	and to put all this alongside avdotya romanovna !
0	i say this to both of you , he whispered over and over to himself
0	petty interests all the time , that 's what makes it so awful !
0	moreover , could he not ingratiate himself somehow with them and deceive them , if they really were all that powerful ?
0	following him , with a completely disconcerted and ferocious expression , as red as a peony , lanky and clumsy , came the embarrassed razumikhin
0	the term muslin miss or bread-and-butter miss
0	note-that his second marriage to the peasant girl fenechka is even more radical
0	all together they ’ re worth about five or six rubles , but they ’ re valuable to me as mementos
0	his thoughts , already painful and incoherent , began to get more and more confused , and soon a light , pleasant sleep came over him
0	at last he noticed that it had grown as light as day
0	it turned out poorly , that ’ s true , but you ’ re still not a hopeless scoundrel
0	well , now i can understand why we have become friends ; you are just like me
0	i understand only one word : useful !
0	once again an uproar , once more thunder and lightning , tornadoes and hurricanes !
0	how can i ever thank you ?
0	she ’ s a person who hungers and demands to accept some sort of torment for someone else , and if she ’ s denied this torment , then she might throw herself out a window
0	a chill ran up and down his spine
0	the mainstay of our enterprise consists in our knowing precisely what to translate
0	nature sometimes follows art : bazarov affected the young as werther , in the previous century , influenced them , like schiller 's the robbers , like byron 's laras and giaours and childe harolds in their day
0	† an area between nevsky prospect and the smolny institute
0	a moment later he heard the bolt being thrown
0	besides , my principal and most pressing request was not fulfilled
0	he exclaimed with an expression of tender and good-natured triumph on his face
0	in the first place , here are three shirts , coarse cotton , but with fashionable fronts
0	logic can anticipate three possibilities , but there are a million of them !
0	he has a fine face , does not he ?
0	katya took out mozart 's sonata-fantasia in a minor
0	i came to see you precisely because i ’ m wicked
0	she ’ d be very upset if it were to disappear !
0	no , i didn ’ t imagine it !
0	she muttered with a sinking heart , as if imploring someone like a frightened child
0	there was not a moment to spare
0	yes , sonya , the most amusing thing of all may be that this was exactly how it was
0	if it ’ s bad , i swear , i ’ ll bring you back here ; if it ’ s good , then you can go to bed
0	look , a guest has come with evgeny
0	you know , dunya , i was looking at both of you
0	the term nihilists has long been employed by both sympathizers and critics to describe a large , diffuse group of russians who made their appearance in the late 's and early 's and who formed the pool out of which radical movements emerged
0	stay with them tomorrow and
0	in complete despair , he headed back downstairs to confront them : come what may !
0	listen , said raskolnikov , here
0	raskolnikov passed by just then and didn ’ t overhear any more
0	petr petrovich , who had fought his own way out of poverty , had become accustomed to admiring himself to an extreme degree ; he valued his own intelligence and abilities highly , and even sometimes , while alone , admired his face in a mirror
0	well , i asked the local doctor if i could ; and , well , i cut myself
0	i really don ’ t know what to say
0	that ’ s all there was to it
0	only tell me where you live
0	besides those two drunks he met on the staircase , a whole group left right after them , about five men with an accordion and a young girl
0	listen : sometimes i wake up at night
0	his wife has it , too
0	in addition , his eyes were almost always sore
0	i wanted to ask you , raskolnikov said , turning to her abruptly , how have things been today ?
0	i am odintsova , she said
0	nastasya , why don ’ t you say something ?
0	razumikhin corrected himself suddenly
0	but there such a terror awaited him—one , of course , that he ’ d never experienced before
0	maybe they won ’ t fit !
0	the news about petr petrovich was well received
0	you promised to visit me ; bring your friend with you
0	hey , brother , you ’ re frightening me with this nonsense and trying to trick me !
0	no , no , it ’ s good that you came !
0	she ’ s aiming right for the head
0	—that tear should be mended ; take a needle right now and sew it up as i taught you , or else tomorrow
0	there ’ ll be just a square yard of space—ha !
0	razumikhin was greatly astonished , but all of a sudden , rage , genuine rage flashed menacingly in his eyes
0	no more medicine or anything ; i ’ ll look in again tomorrow
0	she received a letter ?
0	we ’ ll observe here that if katerina ivanovna bragged about anyone ’ s connections and wealth , it was without any self-interest , without any personal calculation , but was completely innocent , so to speak , out of the fullness of her heart , the sheer pleasure of bestowing praise and conferring more value to the person being praised
0	i ’ m not excited at all , razumikhin said , wincing
0	razumikhin exclaimed at last
0	welcome , replied kukshina and , fixing bazarov with her round eyes between which was a forlorn , turned-up , very little red nose , she added , i know you , and she shook his hand , too
0	it is symptomatic of turgenev 's aesthetic , both that he will veil those elemental acts , and that his narrative will work to reestablish the violated order
0	she said , gradually blushing all over
0	an ironic attitude toward emotion of any sort , toward dreaminess , lyrical transports and effusions , is the essence of the internal cynicism
0	bazarov is not an abstract theoretician who solves all problems and is completely calmed by that solution
0	the point may profitably be compared to a similar one in the red and the black where , in stendhal 's happier imagination , julien sorel rises to the top , only to insist perversely at his trial on his peasant origin and to accuse his jury of seeking to punish in me and to discourage forever that class of young men who , born in an inferior station and in a sense burdened with poverty , have the good fortune to secure a sound education , and the audacity to mingle with what the pride of rich people calls society
0	sonya ’ s face was distorted with horrible fear
0	that ’ s it , of course
0	you stay here while i run down for the caretaker
0	will that actually happen ?
0	she dared not accept any orders or work without the older woman ’ s permission
0	she didn ’ t even notice the cruelty of his words ( of course , she also didn ’ t notice the meaning of his reproaches and of his peculiar view of her disgrace , and this was obvious to him )
0	i ’ ve been lying for a long time
0	in any case , i regard you as a most honorable man , sir , even possessing the rudiments of magnanimity , although i don ’ t agree with all your convictions , which i consider it my obligation to inform you about in advance , directly , and in complete sincerity , primarily because i don ’ t wish to deceive you
0	what do you mean by that ?
0	petr petrovich was laughing wholeheartedly
0	but raskolnikov couldn ’ t see a thing and had already turned the corner
0	raskolnikov opened his eyes and lay back again , clasping his hands behind his head
0	raskolnikov raised himself up
0	it ’ s sodom , sir , of the most hideous kind
0	holding his greasy dressing-gown across his stomach with two fingers , and smoking his pipe , he used to listen with enjoyment to bazarov ; and the more malicious his sallies , the more good-naturedly did his delighted father chuckle , showing every one of his black teeth
0	you must fulfill what justice demands
0	yes , a wonderful thing , replied raskolnikov , regarding him almost with a smirk
0	actaeon is destroyed for an involuntary transgression : to see diana naked is , apparently , to enter a realm of taboo in which volition is irrelevant
0	besides she wouldn ’ t have understood anything
0	are you coming from enyusha ?
0	it was very dark and deserted in the entryway ; there was not a soul , as if everything had been removed
0	what ’ s the meaning of this ?
0	vasily ivanovich gave him some water and managed to feel his forehead
0	he passed through it and turned left , onto the street
0	où va-t-elle la virtu se nicher ? § you know , i ’ ll tell you such tales on purpose , just to hear your shrieks
0	a book lay on her dresser
0	razumikhin interrupted with passion
0	he sat down right in front of porfiry and looked directly at him , without batting an eyelash
0	he devised so many scenes , so many delightful episodes in his imagination on this seductive and playful theme as he rested after a long day tending to his business affairs !
0	he ’ s up to something , that ’ s clear , but if we get mixed up in it , it won ’ t be easy to get out
0	where is the patient ?
0	he suddenly stepped aside to allow a priest and a deacon who were climbing the stairs to pass
0	you think , pulkheriya aleksandrovna continued passionately , my tears would have stopped him then , my entreaties , my illness , my death , perhaps , from our anguish , our poverty ?
0	( it ’ s all the same ! )
0	( kiseinaya de-vushka ) was given greater currency at the time by pomyalovsky 's story meshchanskoe schaute ( ) and pisarev 's review of it ( soc/i , , - )
0	they tricked her , that ’ s for sure
0	those doorbells , in that illness of yours , in your semi-delirium ?
0	perhaps you think you wo not be missed ?
0	understanding the relationship between comedy and tragedy in ottsy i deti helps us understand in formal terms the initial and continuing furor created by the novel
0	that mikolka may even be right to want to suffer
0	when their glances met , the door slammed shut with such a bang that pulkheriya aleksandrovna almost cried out in fright
0	she always extended her hand to him timidly ; sometimes she didn ’ t even offer her hand at all , as if afraid that he would push it away
0	repeated the old man and sank into thought
0	you can see for yourself what ’ s happened to semyon zakharovich ; he ’ s dying
0	and there she glimpsed not even an abyss , but emptiness or formless hideousness
0	arkady felt some timidity in his heart when , at the first sounds of the mazurka , he sat down next to his partner ; preparing to engage her in conversation , he merely passed his hand through his hair , unable to think of anything to say
0	so , you can go home !
0	that ’ s very understandable , and i don ’ t condemn you
0	forget all about me
0	a poet must be a psychologist , but a secret one , turgenev wrote in a letter to k d
0	he got what he wanted !
0	science tells us to love ourselves first of all because everything on earth is based on personal interest
0	was it your first time ?
0	oh , for pity ’ s sake
0	there were lessons to give ; i was offered half a ruble for each
0	precisely through bazarov was ( and still am ) bespattered with mud and filth
0	happy are those who have no reason to lock their doors , right ?
0	no , no ; why trouble yourself again ?
0	discussion and questions followed ; arkady spoke most of all , especially during supper , which lasted until long after midnight
0	pavel petrovich himself calls her an empty creature
0	take me , for example : i advocate a negative point of view—as a result of my sensations
0	now the other pocket , there , there !
0	and i really might not have been there !
0	now he ’ s speaking so politely , but i ’ m afraid !
0	and now , brother , i think it 's time for us to chat with the steward
0	stay here , stay here !
0	time was passing , one minute , then another—no one came
0	i doubt that , sir
0	what ’ s happening to me ?
0	raskolnikov replied insistently and irritably , suddenly raising himself on the sofa , his eyes flashing ; then he fell back onto the pillow again and turned his face to the wall
0	the two women asked together
0	excuse me , sir , replied luzhin , trembling with rage
0	i didn ’ t believe in that thunderbolt even for a moment , as you could see !
0	the laws of art will again exert their power
0	be sure not to scare my brother , pavel petrovich said to him
0	he dreamt of his childhood , while they were still living in their little town
0	there 's an english washstand in my room and the door does not lock
0	is evgeny vasilevich still alive ?
0	polechka , my name is rodion
0	the prince knew me when i was young and unmarried , and he remembers semyon zakharovich very well , to whom he showed his favor many times
0	although the word had been used previously in russian thought , it was in the 's that it assumed its familiar meaning
0	we consider this immodesty , peering so deeply into the soul of another , to be very significant
0	ah , her poor deceased father !
0	yes , i was ; now come into my rooms ; there ’ s nowhere to sit here
0	when you were shown out , then i was also shown out , and they began to question nikolai
0	there was a thick fog outside , and it was impossible to see through it
0	she looked at him , not understanding a thing
0	sonya also has to buy makeup , he went on , grinning sarcastically as he walked along the street
0	i consider it my obligation to inform you that i do not share that opinion
0	pavel petrovich knitted his brows sternly , while nikolai petrovich appeared embarrassed
0	vasily ivanovich was astounded
0	all children behave well with me , replied bazarov
0	no sign , replied the servant a second time
0	have they sent for me , or what ?
0	i ’ d twist his nose if he so much as dreamt of it !
0	all of this had been kept hidden under the sofa in his room until the right moment
0	arkady began telling her about his friend
0	but we have philosophized enough
0	anna sergeevna gave him a drink without removing her glove , drawing her breath apprehensively
0	but she didn ’ t take her eyes off raskolnikov , feeling that he was her best defense
0	porfiry petrovich addressed raskolnikov directly :
0	all of a sudden he recalled marmeladov ’ s question from the day before
0	n n strakhov fathers and sons
0	there was a scandal right here , in the third room
0	i was hardly constrained by that document
0	so , he came to see you last night ?
0	his dark blond hair , long and thick , did not conceal the prominent bulges in his capacious skull
0	can it possibly be that you still haven ’ t received any news ?
0	while arkady and bazarov argue , bazarov 's parents overwhelm them ( and us ) with the ordinary kindnesses they take to extraordinary degrees
0	he kept pushing this thought away , foreseeing to what degree of rage and fury could it drive him , and feeling that he might lose his mind from that rage
0	the passage is secular rather than religious : life is without end not eternal ; it is life on earth , not in the hereafter
0	raskolnikov started shouting again
0	but even in him , despite the apparent distortion there are living and even energetic vibrations of the heartstrings
0	did you go far from here ?
0	running away is vile and difficult ; most of all you need life , a defined position , and suitable air ; well , what sort of air would you have ?
0	or else , why bother ?
0	i ca not pass judgment on him
0	he turned to razumikhin
0	for a dialectical reading of turgenev 's finest novel , however
0	the chain was made of steel
0	what a torment to bear !
0	you must know everything already
0	do you like to fight ?
0	wondered raskolnikov and began following him
0	no , he says , not in the last two days
0	colossal illnesses go with a great people
0	razumikhin , it goes without saying , was preposterous with his sudden passion , fueled by drink , for avdotya romanovna ; but , seeing her , especially now , as she was pacing the room , her arms folded , sad and pensive , perhaps many people would excuse him , without any mention of his extraordinary condition
0	what ’ s the matter , polechka ?
0	i agree that a decent man is obliged to be bored , but still
0	this same reproach is often directed at falls upon young men , even when they no longer deserve it ; and if i had more self-confidence [ help me , please help me !
0	zosimov observed him carefully
0	during the second week of lent , it was his turn , with those in his barracks , to fast before taking communion
0	petr petrovich noticed this smile and immediately held it against his young friend
0	and he wouldn ’ t even have understood one bit : what was there to be repulsed by ?
0	but why , why is he prompting me this way ?
0	suddenly arkady comes up to me and silently , with an expression of such tender compassion , very gently , as if i were a little child , takes my book away and places another one in front of me , a german one he smiles and then leaves , carrying away my pushkin
0	why did that fool razumikhin abuse the socialists a while ago ?
0	well , it ’ s just not , that ’ s all there is to it !
0	well then , good-bye ; i ’ ll drop in on you , very soon
0	arina vlasevna set about preparing the tea from lime flowers , while vasily ivanovich went into the next room and tore his hair in silence
0	turgenev has studied bazarov 's character , he has pondered its elements and the conditions of its development , and he has come to see that for him there can be neither occupation nor happiness
0	today i was sitting and reading pushkin as i recall , it happened to be the gypsies
0	however , this quest is only a transitional moment , an incomplete process
0	all the furniture and everything else
0	now i see what a practical fellow you are
0	or have you already decided to be discreet about it ?
0	it ’ s the various practical cases i still find troubling !
0	yes , so dark-skinned , as if she ’ s a disguised soldier , but you know , she ’ s not really a freak
0	you say , it ’ s me or him
0	no , that would be shameful
0	by the way , sonya , when i was lying there in the darkness and imagining all these things , was that the devil who was misleading me ?
0	the handkerchief was covered in blood
0	well , what ’ s there to be proud of in being a decent fellow ?
0	the attack from the left was a good deal more virulent
0	i have a good memory for faces
0	she seemed pale by the light of the single lamp , shaded in gauze of cutout paper
0	the woman , noticing a stranger , paused distractedly in front of him ; having returned to her senses momentarily , she seemed to be wondering why he ’ d come in
0	they had arrived at the entrance to bakaleev ’ s house
0	( everything seems stupid in failure ! )
0	their feel-yourself orientation was at odds with the imperatives of underground activity
0	arkadi and his father , riding
0	how do i get there ?
0	a tormenting , dark idea arose in him—the idea that he was behaving like a madman and that at this moment he was no longer able to reason or defend himself , and that perhaps it was totally unnecessary to do what he was doing now
0	he hastened to reassure her and seated her at the table opposite himself
0	they were not expecting you today , sir ; no beef 's been delivered , said timofeich , who would just dragged in bazarov 's case
0	once more she glared at arkady , but he raised his voice and , exchanging glances with katya , who was sitting next to him , continued reading
0	an arrogant young man , by your words you ’ re admitting the possibility of breaking the promise you made to me
0	we have no right to complain to the author that he did not choose a broader task and limited himself to the narrower one
0	i thought i might find you here , he said , turning suddenly to raskolnikov
0	poor , meek creatures with meek eyes
0	look , you monster , it ’ s empty ; there was a handkerchief and now the pocket ’ s empty , you see !
0	scarcely greeting the guests , she lowered herself into a large velvet-covered armchair , in which no one else had any right to sit
0	all the more reason , sir
0	amaliya ivanovna , i humbly request that you , in your capacity as landlady of this apartment , pay special attention to the conversation i ’ m about to have with sofiya ivanovna
0	it is precisely bazarov 's magnetic influence that for a while prevents arkady from coming to terms with his true , non-nihilistic self , after which recognition he proposes to katia
0	raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to stop by tomorrow without fail
0	despite all his views , bazarov eagerly seeks love for people
0	at least there i can lock my door
0	i also found out many interesting details yesterday from mr razumikhin , dmitry prokofich
0	scarcely ten days had passed since his return to marino when , on the pretext of studying how the sunday schools were functioning , he galloped off to town and from there to nikolskoe
0	it ’ s impossible to keep silent when you feel—you feel by instinct—that you could help in this case , if only
0	have you nothing else to say to me ?
0	i ’ ll add that he expressed himself a little more gently and affectionately than i described , but i ’ ve forgotten his exact words , and recall only the idea ; besides , he said it without any premeditation
0	or else i won ’ t have anything to do with you !
0	and those aren ’ t his clothes !
0	don ’ t be embarrassed , razumikhin rattled on
0	do you understand , sir ?
0	she became his wife ; he was happy as few people on earth ever are but ,
0	to k k sluchevsky
0	however , there ’ s no need !
0	arkady , not without embarrassment , explained to him in a few words who fenechka was
0	even outside it ’ s like being in a room without ventilation
0	and you , rodya , should go out , take a little walk , have a rest , lie down , and then come to see us soon
0	the latter buried his face in his cambric handkerchief
0	well , hell , that ’ s not the point , but this is : you ’ ll spend tonight in the landlady ’ s apartment ( i managed to persuade her !
0	till our next most pleasant meeting , sir
0	and he whips her and whips her again ; in his frenzy , he no longer knows what he ’ s doing
0	furthermore , turgenev 's general attitudes toward the phenomena of life which make up his novel are so calm and disinterested , so devoid of slavish worship of one or another theory , that bazarov himself would not have found anything timid or false in these attitudes
0	at the conclusion of comedy the blocking characters are either incorporated into or expelled from the given society , and as a result the hero and heroine are free to wed thus , comedies often conclude with a wedding and the birth of babies , often as not in a rural setting
0	i told her you were a fine , honest , hardworking man
0	afterward this same marfa petrovna asked dunya ’ s forgiveness , and now she ’ s suddenly died
0	why couldn ’ t that scoundrel petr petrovich have found you better rooms ?
0	asked bazarov , sitting down next to her
0	there was a time when i thought
0	in short , from the hannibal 's oath against serfdom at the beginning of his life to the work about revolutionaries planned at the end of his life , turgenev was concerned with the forces which would change the life of russia
0	i said this to arkady the day after he arrived here and i say it again
0	you ’ re lying and teasing me , so i ’ ll give myself away
0	you yourself said you wanted me to go to prison , but now you ’ re frightened ?
0	you should drink some water , my dear boy , this is an attack , sir !
0	will you come back here afterward ?
0	i ’ m ready , ma ’ am , and will answer for it
0	even in the country you did me more harm than i did you , while here
0	even if one were to speak of realism as the single , fundamental method of the classical novel , one might do that basing one 's construction of the term on other considerations ; eg , on the position and viewpoint of the reader
0	sonya asked weakly , glancing at him full of suffering , but at the same time not at all surprised by his suggestion
0	his face and entire figure were at that moment really ridiculous and justified raskolnikov ’ s laughter
0	she 's a retrograde woman and nothing more !
0	by disclosing arkady 's true sentiments bazarov destroys the masks of civility—he effects a drawing room attack on that civilization he so ardently denounced in polemic with pavel
0	why should there be any compensation ?
0	his sense of aesthetics would interfere : would a napoleon stoop to crawl under an old woman ’ s ’ bed ?
0	razumikhin and raskolnikov were facing pulkheriya aleksandrovna—razumikhin was closer to luzhin , raskolnikov next to his sister
0	he ate a little , without much appetite , three or four spoonfuls , as if automatically
0	in the experience of the world as we know it through his writings he emphasized both the ephemeral ecstasy that can suddenly transform life completely and the poignancy of lives sacrificed in the name of a revolutionary ideal
0	fair hair in little ringlets like lamb ’ s wool , full , rosy lips , little feet—charming !
0	i just woke up and wanted to come , but my clothes delayed me ; yesterday i forgot to tell her
0	cried luzhin , unable to believe up until the last moment in such an outcome and , therefore , having lost the thread completely
0	he left moscow to go abroad to improve his health and took up residence in dresden , where he associates mostly with the english and with visiting russians
0	this is how it happened
0	it ’ s so stuffy in here
0	is he expecting something ?
0	did you sleep well ?
0	but no one could suspect him , in that instance , of pleasure in the feeling of his
0	well , now i see i have overestimated your powers of observation
0	such is bazarov 's image for us , too
0	that was everything in the room
0	† a hard , dry biscuit
0	is he going to stay here with us ?
0	perhaps she had even seriously considered many times in her despair how to end it all , so seriously that his suggestion almost didn ’ t surprise her
0	but something strange happened to him
0	muttered dunechka through her deathly pale lips ; she was gasping for breath
0	these ideas and attitudes can gain point only if bazarov brings them to political coherence , and the book charts bazarov 's journey , as an uprooted plebeian , in search of a means of expression , a task , an obligation
0	why are you sleeping ?
0	economic truth adds that the more private businesses we have in society and , so to speak , the more cloaks remain intact , then the firmer its foundations and the more will be accomplished for the common good
0	at least , that was what he was hoping
0	yes , that ’ s it precisely , businesslike
0	it seems you weren ’ t expecting this ?
0	why are you examining my room ?
0	in a word , a certain fire flared up in them more brightly and more carelessly , and that fire frightened her , and she found it hateful in the end
0	what ’ s the matter with me ?
0	he rushed to the door and threw the bolt
0	if she ’ s gone out of the house , she ’ ll come to see you herself , he added peevishly
0	evgeny vasilich , i am here
0	is it twelve yet ?
0	but ten thousand—is a fine thing on occasion
0	but he couldn ’ t even conceive of carrying out his intention : either there were rafts moored at the bottom of the stairs where women were washing their linens , or else boats were tied up and the stairs were teeming with people ; in addition , from there along both embankments one could be observed , noticed : it would look very suspicious if a man intentionally went down the stairs , paused , and threw something into the water
0	who was he compared to such a young woman : just a drunken lout and yesterday ’ s braggart ?
0	none of this would have occurred !
0	katya gave him a silent , serious look ; the princess even made the sign of the cross under her shawl , so he could not see it ; on the other hand , sitnikov was completely disconcerted
0	in the first place , everything would be changed , even his own situation : he would have to reveal his secret to dunechka immediately
0	i trust there wo not be any , evgeny vasilich i am very sorry your stay in my house had such an ending
0	in her eyes he was both an excellent doctor and a simple man
0	your grandfather was a well-respected man , a true soldier
0	at which one of them , in a transport of defiance , shouts : down with all authorities !
0	they ’ re not all as clever as you are
0	it 's true that one was a foreign decoration , and not all that distinguished
0	why even talk to him ?
0	some other time we will talk about this subject in greater detail with you , my dear evgeny vasilich ; we will learn your opinions and express our own
0	you can be sure , amaliya lyudvigovna
0	in other words , he had grown weak , instantly and radically !
0	he ’ s fast asleep , soundly and peacefully ; god willing , he ’ ll sleep for ten hours or so
0	however , i confess that you stated it almost correctly , even , if you like , completely correctly
0	suddenly porfiry seemed to wink at him with his left eye again and chuckle inaudibly , just as he had before
0	it does not matter to me whether i am young or old
0	vasily ivanovich listened with great attention , blew his nose , twisted his handkerchief in both hands , coughed , ruffled his hair—and , at long last , could not stand it : he leaned over to arkady and kissed him on the shoulder
0	i ca not fight with them myself , my principles wo not allow me to summon the local police , and one ca not accomplish anything without the fear of punishment !
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s illness was a strange nervous ailment and was accompanied by something like insanity , if not completely , then at least partially
0	as for that wretched general
0	raskolnikov , now perplexed , suddenly flew into a complete fury ; but , strange to say , once again he obeyed the order to speak more quietly , even though he was suffering a strong paroxysm of rage
0	razumikhin thought for a moment
0	you have such an awful room , rodya
0	he felt he was not exciting enough to interest odintsova ; he became timid and confused when left alone with her
0	bazarov 's treatment of his parents will predispose some readers against the character , and others against the author
0	at that time nikolai petrovich had just settled into his new manor house and , not wishing to keep serfs on as house staff , he was looking for hired laborers ; the mistress , for her part , complained about the small number of travelers who came to town and about hard times ; he suggested she come to work for him as a housekeeper ; she agreed
0	and i ’ d hardly be able to do so
0	he stood in the middle of the room , deep in thought
0	it was for you that i
0	did they find him ?
0	it suddenly seemed to him that her long black eyelashes were fluttering and winking , as if they were about to open , and from under them looked a sly , sharp , somehow unchildlike eye , as if the little girl were not asleep , and only pretending
0	she realized that true personal autonomy required psychological independence , though not separation , from men
0	but apparently it can not be helped
0	the second level at which turgenev attempts a dialectical reconciliation lies within the plot , where comedy and tragedy coexist and interact to produce a monistic view of life
0	i ’ m a man who ’ s finished with life , nothing more
0	bazarov spent the whole day in his own room , feeling bitter and angry , dropping in to see the patient for very brief visits ; he happened to meet fenechka a few times , but she scurried away from him in terror )
0	nor drunk , sirs , and they will not believe two acknowledged atheists , troublemakers , and freethinkers who are accusing me out of personal revenge , which , in their own stupidity , they even admit
0	the servant , out of a sense of propriety , or perhaps because he did not want to remain under his master 's eye , had gone to the gate and lit his pipe
0	bazarov does not put on airs before other people , he does not consider himself a man of genius misunderstood by his contemporaries ; he is merely obliged to regard his acquaintances from above because these acquaintances only come up to his knees ; what else can he do ?
0	it 's already more than four hours since it happened
0	the most natural thing would be not to play him at all
0	indeed , after passing through the gateway and emerging into the courtyard , the tradesman suddenly turned around and seemed to beckon to him again
0	little by little he came to the conviction that if the summer garden could be extended to include the entire field of mars and even connect it with the gardens at the mikhailovsky palace , that it would be a splendid and most useful thing for the city
0	in her fury , katerina ivanovna grabbed luzhin and dragged him over to sonya
0	bazarov has called on his guardian angel ; whether he realizes it or not he is aware for the first time of his vulnerability to death ; he is subconsciously asking pushkin 's question : is the hour already near ?
0	you are a dangerous gentleman ; you are such a critic
0	moreover , i take the liberty of adding the earnest and , dare i say , insistent request that rodion romanovich not be present at our meeting , inasmuch as he insulted me unspeakably and impolitely during my visit to his sickbed yesterday
0	well , do you understand now ?
0	of course he had returned home dozens of times without recalling the route he took
0	in each cart there were one or two peasants wearing unbuttoned sheepskin coats
0	you were counting on it
0	don ’ t you want to see the little surprise i have ?
0	was he a positive or a negative figure ?
0	dunya asked , approaching him
0	it is understandable how the passionate , candid , simpleminded , honest , strong as a folkloric hero , and inebriated razumikhin , never having seen anyone like that , would lose his head at first glance
0	yes , yes , he would say to some peasant woman in a man 's coat and horn-shaped headdress , as he handed her a bottle of goulard 's extract or a jar of white ointment , my dear , you should thank god every minute of the day that my son 's visiting us : now you are being treated with the most scientific , most up-to-date methods , do you understand that ?
0	who ’ ll pay any attention to that ?
0	that means you ’ d be willing to introduce her into the company of your mother and sister ?
0	what are you saying ?
0	he would already begun to submit to her ; katya felt this and was not at all surprised
0	bazarov 's mother , arina vlasevna , is yet another representative of cyclical time , but one who seems to have taken it to the extreme , almost to the point of parody
0	thoughts were spinning like a whirlwind in raskolnikov ’ s head
0	it does happen , especially when you wear out a man ’ s last drop of patience , but , in any case , it ’ s rare
0	he himself never told me a thing about that episode , razumikhin replied cautiously , but i heard something about it from mrs zarnitsyna herself , who ’ s also not the most communicative person
0	stamping his feet because i disturbed him
0	nevertheless , his speech produced an extraordinary effect
0	she ’ d sell herself for a dear , beloved person !
0	after making your acquaintance , i felt an attachment to you
0	now i ’ ve clarified it all to myself , continued raskolnikov , turning directly to lebezyatnikov
0	he bowed deeply and watched her go ( her figure seemed so graceful to him , draped in the grayish sheen of black silk !
0	listen : when i went to the old woman then , it was only a test
0	it seemed to me that i did
0	yes , yes , he continued , it 's not for nothing you are related to anna sergeevna ; you are just as independent as she is , but you are more discreet
0	talk about whatever nonsense you want , but sit next to her and talk
0	he added , after a little while
0	copyright © by princeton university press
0	go on ahead , she said , with apparent serenity , though her face was very pale
0	he 's not opposed to playing cards , and even this is strictly entre nous smokes a pipe
0	the hell with it !
0	next year he hopes to qualify as a doctor
0	you ’ ve made me very happy , rodya , by dropping in , but she missed you by taking a walk ; when she returns , i ’ ll tell her : your brother was here while you were out
0	it will take me a while to climb the stairs , he thought
0	however , i didn ’ t really feel it coming since you seemed to arrive out of nowhere
0	incidentally , anna sergeevna : you should know that all this is not in my line
0	dunechka wasn ’ t at home
0	he looked for the caretaker and received vague directions for where to find the tailor kapernaumov
0	the things a person imagines !
0	once again the poem sheds light on fathers and sons
0	i communicated to him the thoughts that occupied me and with speechless amazement heard the following remark : but have not you already presented a similar type in rudin ?
0	such exclamations do not surprise me ; but neither will they make me renounce one iota of what said
0	however , when no one turned him away and anna sergeevna even introduced him to her aunt and sister , he quickly recovered and began chatting merrily
0	of course , that ’ s true , replied raskolnikov
0	by hearsay , bazarov replied angrily
0	i couldn ’ t just fill my letter with nonsense about this and that , when i felt such sorrow in my soul
0	who 's weeping over there ?
0	that ’ s a fact , sir
0	you see what an ugly spectacle i am : a worm half-crushed , but still writhing
0	he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov
0	nikolai petrovich was surprised : fenechka , bashful and modest , never displayed any affection in the presence of a third party
0	at that hour , on clear days , the sun always passed over his right wall with a long stripe of light and lit up the corner next to the door
0	she uttered , with feeling , looking intently at him
0	your mama sent it to you ; or did you forget that , too ?
0	he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from its loop but didn ’ t remove it yet , merely keeping hold of it with his right hand under his coat
0	the meaning of a literary idea ( )
0	he thought , glancing around , this place is not much to look at
0	and i stand before it
0	i might not have become a napoleon , but i might have become a major , sir , hee-hee-hee !
0	that ’ s none of your business , sir !
0	what a fine little lad you have here , he said and looked at his watch
0	his room was so small that he could undo the hook without even getting out of bed
0	the fact that it was
0	how quiet it was , even frightening
0	ask any of your peasants which of us—you or me—he recognizes as his fellow countryman
0	it ’ s way past six !
0	at the very moment she accepted your proposal , that you were extremely pleased that
0	it ’ s almost as if there were two contradictory characters alternating within him
0	meanwhile , pulkheriya aleksandrovna , without her daughter ’ s support , was apparently in a state of indecision
0	it was so enjoyable and required so little effort !
0	and , of course , the fellow got very angry
0	raskolnikov was about to speak again but wasn ’ t allowed to do so : everyone was shouting and crowding around luzhin with curses and threats
0	that saying is strikingly true not only of art but of all life
0	people cried out from the crowd
0	in chapter he illustrates a nonmedical argument to odintsova by an analogy with the lungs of a consumptive
0	she aspires in every way to participate in the masculine modality : her disheveled appearance , her slovenly study , her intellectual pretensions , her aggressive conversation , etc
0	then it was this , that , who , how , how old—twenty-two ’ —so on and so forth
0	we would better speak russian , said the old man
0	and now it seems one isn ’ t supposed to eavesdrop behind the door
0	the crisis has come the crisis has gone
0	with the english he behaves simply , almost modestly , but not without dignity ; they find him a bit of a bore , but respect him for being a perfect gentleman ,
0	she understood only that he was terribly , infinitely unhappy
0	besides that , they say the young woman was not very attractive , that is , they say she was even rather plain
0	well , you have to agree that you can ’ t just say , karl from ze pharmazist ’ s shop from ze fear his heart vas vounded , and that he ( the snotnose !
0	the whole matter depended on your social position and its associated habits
0	do you know what really irritates me ?
0	began arkady in a sad tone of voice
0	such bells could be found in almost all similar small buildings
0	on the other hand , in their brief introductions to their collections they respond to turgenev the man and writer so indifferently and tritely as to make the reader wonder what drew them to their enterprise in the first place
0	he was hardly able to stand and merely repeated , katya , katya while she wept innocently , laughing softly at her own tears
0	do you have any water ?
0	he 's a person of consequence now and writes that , as a relative , he wants to see us and has invited us and arkady to town
0	cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna , agitated in the extreme
0	his eyes were gleaming , and he took two more steps forward
0	raskolnikov maintained a gloomy silence and lowered his head ; he thought for a long time and smiled again at last , but his smile was meek and gloomy
0	fenechka in particular felt so comfortable with him that one night she even summoned him : mitya was having convulsions
0	she stood up and said , if he went out , then he must be well and he ’ s forgotten his mother ; that means it ’ s improper and shameful for his mother to stand on his doorstep and beg for affection , as if for alms
0	i thought you knew everything
0	they shouted at him
0	he asked a moment later
0	he wants to give thanks at a special church service , ha , ha , ha
0	in my opinion , that ’ s all nonsense : it wasn ’ t necessary to write more gently ; on the contrary , on the contrary , it ’ s necessary to protest
0	in my personal view , if you like , one can even say that something has been achieved : new , useful ideas have been widely circulated , several new , useful works have been disseminated in place of the previous fantastic and romantic ones
0	but he knows how to fill a pipe
0	but now , finally , he , too , seemed to have quieted down ; his voice could no longer be heard
0	of course , he values himself highly , perhaps too highly , but i hope that he ’ ll also come to value me
0	only by being so strict was it possible to restrain him somewhat
0	how could you have gone out unless you were delirious ?
0	with levin she is at ease , at home ; with vronsky there is the prospect of brilliance and adventure
0	according to our conditions , each of us still has one shot left
0	or else he , too , simply didn ’ t know anything and hadn ’ t seen anything with his own eyes ( and how could he have seen anything ?
0	such an approach is taken by the american hispanist stephen oilman when he writes : the novel may be defined as the kind of literature which presents a fictional world not necessarily resembling our own , but in a fashion resembling the way we experience our own—thus its natural realism less of mirrored content than of unfolding process
0	and i fell for it !
0	well then , now did you hear ?
0	to hell with me !
0	kukshina 's a marvelous person
0	you should know that !
0	just look more carefully and you ’ ll see !
0	the feeling of infinite revulsion that had begun to oppress and torment his heart as he ’ d been coming to see the old woman had now reached such proportions and was so palpable that he didn ’ t know where to hide from his anguish
0	he lay on his back and didn ’ t stir
0	only then did sonya notice him
0	are not you doing a lot of talking , too , just like all the rest ?
0	i didn ’ t bow down to you ; i bowed down to all human suffering , he uttered madly and went over to the window
0	—i do not completely understand that designation—answered arkady
0	ralph matlaw , in his preface to the valuable norton critical edition , explains that he has chosen the widely used english title fathers and sons rather than the literal fathers and children because 'sons ' in english better implies the notions of spiritual and intellectual generations conveyed by the russian deti
0	and i promised her so much then—the hell with it !
0	nikolai petrovich listened more intently arkady made no reply
0	however , it was not shame that seized him but a completely different feeling , more resembling fear
0	odintsova had heard all about this
0	at least one of his liberal friends who had read the manuscript of fathers and children told him to burn it , since it would compromise him for ever with the progressives
0	evgeny , for heaven 's sake
0	but what is to be done ?
0	except for champagne , nothing at all , and only one glass of champagne for the whole evening , and even then my head aches
0	bazarov enters odin-tseva 's chambers as a figure possessed , whose passion has driven him to the solace of violent midnight walks ( he would set out for the woods and walk through them with great strides , breaking branches in his way and cursing under his breath both her and himself—viii , [ p
0	incidentally , i told them not to unhitch my horses
0	she ’ ll consider it her duty to make her husband happy , and he , in turn , will concern himself with his wife ’ s happiness , which , for the time being , we have no major reason to doubt , even though , i must admit , this whole affair was concluded rather quickly
0	bazarov asked arkady coolly , as soon as the door closed behind the two brothers
0	the whole province will be singing his praises—he can do without us
0	we will rest at home , papa ; have the horses harnessed
0	he tried to catch it , but the mouse didn ’ t jump off the bed ; it darted back and forth in zigzags , slipped out of his fingers , ran across his hand , and suddenly plunged underneath the pillow ; he threw the pillow down , but felt at once that something jumped onto his chest and was running across his body , down his back , under his shirt
0	the question has been debated recently : does a member of the commune have the right to enter another member ’ s room , a man ’ s or a woman ’ s , at any time
0	it is impossible to erase it , it must be accepted
0	i have come ; if you need anything , ask me ; if not , then let me go
0	there 's no reason for her to be ashamed
0	an ironic reference to the ideas of jean-jacques rousseau
0	open up , will you ?
0	why in the world did i come to torment you with this ?
0	he remembered seeing her for the first time
0	as a result , the girl went away in complete ecstasy
0	well , it ’ s all nonsense , but when she realized that you were no longer a student , that you ’ d lost all your pupils and shed your decent apparel and , with the death of her daughter , that there was no longer any reason to keep supporting you as a member of the family , well , she suddenly got scared
0	it was dark in the room ; he lay on the bed , wrapped up in the blanket as before , and the wind howled outside the window
0	on one occasion a peasant from the neighboring village brought his brother , who was sick with typhus , to see vasily ivanovich
0	all that is not the least bit interesting , he said aloud , especially for you ; you and i are somber people
0	meanwhile , the sun was already setting
0	inside the portico it was cool , even at midday
0	today i asked , where does mr raskolnikov live ?
0	a new position in the russian civil service created by the legal reforms of , to carry out investigations into allegations of criminality
0	she was not surprised and did not ask any more questions at this time
0	arkady 's face retained its expression of the previous day ; katya had a worried look
0	scent ; that he played whist in a masterly fashion and always lost ; and finally , they respected him for his incorruptible honesty
0	it 's something like prince kuchumov or current russian dramatic literature in general where there is talk for talk 's sake and where a kind of repellent , tepid , and fetid psychology reigns
0	but turgenev just says calmly and simply : this is the sort of young people there are nowadays !
0	the tavern keeper said loudly
0	the extraordinary ferocity with which razumikhin reacted to this genuine laughter lent this scene the appearance of the most sincere merriment and , most importantly , naturalness
0	his best friends realized this , and everyone liked him
0	he got up and put on his jacket and coat , which were still wet
0	you ca not hide a pig in a poke ; i will take it upon myself to prepare peter in an appropriate manner and bring him along to the site of our bloody battle
0	the second category consists of people who break the law , destroyers or , judging by their abilities , those predisposed to be so
0	therefore , even the subscription , in my personal opinion , must be carried out so that the unfortunate widow , so to speak , doesn ’ t know about the money , but that you , for example , are the only one who knows
0	it 's a doctor from anna sergeevna odintsova , he said , bending over to his son 's ear
0	that 's from the latin nihil , nothing , as far as i can tell ; therefore , the word signifies a person who acknowledges nothing ?
0	she would eat only black bread and drink only water rather than sell her soul or give up her moral freedom in exchange for comfort ; she wouldn ’ t trade it for all of schleswig-holstein , ¶ let alone for mr luzhin
0	the last page of the novel shows bazarov 's elderly parents kneeling and weeping at their son 's grave ; this poignant scene occasions turge-nev 's rhetorical eloquence in a famous passage , one just as intriguing as bazarov 's haystack rumination on time and space quoted at the beginning of this paper , and one closely linked to it in its theme : however passionate , sinful , rebellious the heart buried in the grave , the flowers growing on it look out at us serenely with their innocent eyes ; they tell us not only of that eternal peace , that great peace of indifferent nature ; they tell us also of eternal reconciliation and life everlasting
0	he thought to himself , biting his nails in anger
0	there was nothing particularly caustic or burning about it ; but from it there arose something constant , eternal ; he had a premonition of endless years of this cold , deadening sadness , a premonition of some eternity in one arshin of space
0	he couldn ’ t feel whether he was standing on his own two legs
0	all this time i thought you were fed up with us , but now i see from everything that a great misfortune is in store for you , which is why you ’ re so upset
0	without suspecting any danger , however , firmly confident of himself , bazarov goes to visit odintsov , at nikolskoe
0	but the mirage was dispelled
0	the old man leaned his small head to one side
0	no , i can ’ t go through it , i can ’ t !
0	he spent exactly ten minutes there and managed to convince them completely and appease pulkheriya aleksandrovna
0	later , he said weakly
0	you ’ re staying at the kapernaumovs ’ !
0	very energetic people often exaggerate the prevailing tendency ; on these grounds , bazarov 's overly indiscriminate repudiations and the very one-sidedness of his development are tied directly to the prevailing striving for tangible benefits
0	understand this : i need dolts like him
0	why are you suddenly scared ?
0	and do not tell me they are worthless
0	the civil servant regarded the others in the tavern , even the owner , as somehow ordinary ; he was even bored by them ; at the same time , he felt a trace of haughty scorn , as if they were people of a lower order or a lower cultural level , to whom there was nothing to say
0	is he going to stay here long ?
0	there was something crafty contained in this question
0	such a hideous dream !
0	you really should decide on your own , lizaveta ivanovna , the tradesman was saying loudly
0	he did not even think of marriage , of course
0	however , please stay here during my conversation with her
0	she would drawn a pair of crossed lines over the sphinx and asked that he be informed that the cross was the solution to her enigma
0	can you vouch for the fact that avdotya romanovna regards me with loathing ?
0	don ’ t look , don ’ t look at me like that !
0	but there was no other vacant room ; all the others were occupied
0	don ’ t madmen make sense ?
0	you yourself described him as a monomaniac when you called me in on the case
0	not really , pour vous plaire
0	drenched to the skin , svidrigaylov made his way back home , where he locked the door , opened his bureau , took out all of his cash , and tore up several papers
0	go fetch sonya , quickly
0	no , it 's all right , it 's fine , replied pavel petrovich
0	and this same dunechka is planning to marry that seems !
0	i could tell you something
0	but you do not know , arkady replied , what a social lion he was in his own day
0	do you know that fellow
0	he made no reply
0	a moment later , he was out on the street
0	petr petrovich was even nervous , rubbing his hands , deep in thought
0	i ’ ll go with you to prison !
0	he looked at it fleetingly and said , wait , and continued to deal with the lady in mourning
0	dear sir , dear sir !
0	in a word , it all began with a fit of uncontrollable voluptuousness
0	should i go in ?
0	( my past and thoughts , volume iv ) : i would like to save the younger generation from historical ingratitude and even from historical errors
0	pavel petrovich announced solemnly
0	but you handed over all twenty-five !
0	take this for yourself , strictly for yourself , and let this remain between the two of us , so that no one else knows , no matter what you hear later
0	turgenev as author quite wickedly conflates his own imagery in his authorial voice with bazarov 's imagery : turgenev as author says bazarov 's eyes gleamed with their last light , but has bazarov say in his own voice , goodbye breathe on the dying lamp and let it go out enough now , darkness
0	the point here is not that arkady is not being wholly honest or sincere—which of course he is not
0	i think one ought to hint at her new psychological state with some sort of striking turn , otherwise it will turn out something like a japanese snuffbox , which contains miniature trees with fruit , ponds , and boats ; and that 's the more annoying since the general tone of the tale is sharp , in relief , and its progress completely solid
0	she said , raising the edge of her kerchief a little so she could look at him , and in so doing bared her arm to the elbow
0	i hate that so-called doctor ; in my opinion , he 's simply a charlatan ; i doubt he knows that much about physics , even with all his frogs
0	lads : instead of singing a folk song , they were bawling out some romance : 'the true time has come , my heart is full of love
0	it ’ s hard to spend your whole life as a governess earning only two hundred rubles and traipsing around the provinces ; but still i know my sister would sooner go work with negroes on a plantation or with latvian peasants for a baltic german # than defile her spirit and her moral feelings by a relationship with a man she doesn ’ t respect and with whom she has nothing in common—forever , merely for personal gain !
0	all of a sudden she pulled a revolver from her pocket , cocked it , and rested her hand with the gun on the little table
0	but now we are hungry as wolves
0	well , ma ’ am , how about it ?
0	arkady was amazed and did not understand katya immediately
0	the father-son and son-father relationships are , on the other hand , respectful , affectionate , and deeply loving , despite the faint note of menace at the very outset , on the ride home after arkadi 's father has met him and bazarov at the station
0	dunechka made no reply ; her decision had been made some time ago , and she was merely waiting for evening to arrive
0	we led a life of wandering , trudging around towns for the most part
0	that ’ s why one mustn ’ t get on his nerves
0	you see , rodya , i admit , you ’ re clever , but you ’ re still a fool !
0	it was even impossible to think of her as pretty ; on the other hand , her blue eyes were so clear and , when they came to life , the expression of her face so kind and sincere , that one felt involuntarily attracted to her
0	and it fell through !
0	yes , sir ; yes , sir ; i have seen quite a bit in my time , i have
0	crowds of people were walking along the streets ; craftsmen and workers were returning home , others were out for a stroll ; the air smelled of lime , dust , and stagnant water
0	every time the young man passed , he felt a painful and fearful sensation , one that he was ashamed of and that made him wince
0	the whole type in toto is a condemnation of the savage society wherein he could be born , and if that type becomes known to foreigners , it will be used by them as proof of that coarse , nomadic , brutal condition in which our state finds itself , though it has a gloss of books from the leipzig fair
0	sufferings will accompany the birth of the new russia , and they are inevitable
0	why do you thrust yourself upon us , for what reasons ?
0	she pounced on him at once and sat him down at the table on her left side ( amaliya ivanovna was sitting on her right ) ; in spite of her constant fussing and concern that the food would be served properly and that there be enough for everyone , and in spite of the tormenting cough that plagued her continually and choked her and , it seems , had worsened particularly in the last two days , she constantly turned to raskolnikov and in a half whisper hastened to pour out to him all her pent-up feelings and all her righteous indignation over the unsuccessful funeral feast ; this indignation alternated with fits of the most cheerful and most unrestrained laughter at the assembled guests , primarily directed at her landlady
0	raskolnikov stirred and was about to say something
0	and you can be sure that i won ’ t interfere with you
0	first i said that i wouldn ’ t convey anything to you
0	i dropped in on you two days ago , in the evening ; you didn ’ t know that ?
0	but , if you please , i ’ ll return to the previous subject
0	the aristocracy gave england its freedom and supports it
0	it had descended upon him like a fit : it started burning in his soul like a spark and suddenly enveloped him completely , like fire
0	but i could not have foreseen it
0	i paid the mailman three kopecks
0	neskol'ko slov po povodu ottsov i detei , turgenev writes that he has an interesting collection of documents and letters from readers who accuse him of doing totally contradictory things in his novel
0	from the crowd , silently and timidly , a young woman forced her way in ; her sudden appearance in this room was strange , amid the poverty , ragged clothes , death , and desperation
0	they ’ ve gone to bed next door , he thought , no longer seeing light through the crack
0	and could you shoot yourself ?
0	that ’ s not exactly what i said , he began simply and modestly
0	yes , a woman , an unexpected chance
0	she would died in paris , in a condition bordering on insanity
0	on the wall between two windows , above a small washstand , hung some rather poor photographs of nikolai petrovich in various poses taken by an itinerant artist ; there was also a photograph of fenechka that was a complete failure : a face without eyes and a forced smile staring out of a dark frame—it was impossible to make out anything else—and above fenechka , general ermolov in a circassian cloak was frowning menacingly toward distant caucasian mountains , peering out from under a little silk pincushion that had fallen over his forehead
0	there 's no need to rely on others ; one must do one 's own work
0	i think i wrote you that people whom i trust advised me to burn my work
0	if it had been possible for him to go somewhere at that moment and remain completely alone , even for the rest of his life , he would have considered himself fortunate
0	several times he was about to say something—but could not
0	meanwhile , raskolnikov had crowded in closer and had bent over the victim
0	the devil knows why we ’ re talking about this !
0	haven ’ t you seen children here , on street corners , whose mothers send them out to beg for charity ?
0	damn it all , he ’ s pretending !
0	did i ever think that i ’ d be so afraid of a meeting with my own son , with my dear , dear rodya , as i am now ?
0	in this way it took her several days to visit everyone in town , so that some people felt offended that she was partial to others
0	your father 's a good man , bazarov said , but he 's antiquated ; his song 's been sung
0	you mean to say you ’ re cruel ?
0	first , when arkadi , smiling affectionately , tells him that his shame at his relationship with fenichka is
0	the narrator goes on to say that , even at such moments , her blood remained quiet in her charmingly slender and quiet body
0	you seem to think i have some special aims ; therefore you regard me with suspicion
0	the traditional results were romance , courtship , and marriage , followed by years of disappointing boredom or domestic tyranny
0	in my own view , these two little insignificant things are not trifles at all
0	yes , sir , i do have a book , sir
0	mustard plasters on the stomach bleeding , he kept saying anxiously
0	he continued his reflections
0	it ’ s always the same with these schilleresque beautiful souls : ‡ up to the last moment they dress a person in peacock feathers , until the last moment they hope for the good , not the bad ; and although they have a feeling about the other side of the coin , they won ’ t utter a single word about it to themselves for any reason
0	once more he covered his face with his hands and bent his head down
0	why , he says , did you wash away the blood ?
0	to hell with him !
0	he lives near here , in kozel ’ s house
0	really , if you think about it—it is rubbish , he muttered with the look of a person unaware of himself and in delirium
0	to a n maykov
0	bazarov looked at anna sergeevna
0	the door was locked , but when they arrived with the caretaker , the door was unlocked
0	i can ’ t argue that perhaps he contributed to hastening the course of events , so to speak , by the moral impact of his insult ; but as far as his conduct is concerned and , in general , the moral character of the person himself , i ’ m in agreement with you
0	a russian has no need of them whatsoever
0	the only thing i managed to do was to kill
0	now it ’ s just happened
0	de rougement , it will be recalled , took his stand firmly on the side of ordinary , happy , family love , and against passion , romance , and the love of troubadours and minnesingers , which leads to a david lowe , turgenev 's fathers and sons ( ann arbor : ardis , )
0	he would have given everything on earth in order to remain alone , but he felt that he wouldn ’ t be alone even for a moment
0	i know only that it ’ s along one road ; that i know for certain—and only that
0	however , to judge in an impartial way about certain people , it ’ s necessary to discard some preconceived notions and one ’ s habitual way of regarding the people and objects that usually surround us
0	he raised his head and noticed that he was standing next to that same house , near the gates
0	die dogs , if you ’ re not happy !
0	i won ’ t allow it !
0	that had a powerful effect on her !
0	what right do i have to help ?
0	and it ’ s like that every step of the way , sir !
0	feared her son incredibly ; she left the running of the estate to vasily ivanovich—and refused to interfere in any way : she used to groan , wave her handkerchief , and raise her eyebrows higher and higher in horror as soon as her husband began talking about the impending reforms and his own machinations
0	yes , he replied , and you are that sphinx
0	you did not understand me
0	timofeich hesitated and made no reply
0	when you look from the side or from a distance at the empty life our 'fathers ' led , you think : what could be better ?
0	these people have a certain way of thinking
0	laughter redoubles in the cart and among the crowd , but mikolka grows angry and in his rage strikes the little mare with more blows , as if he really thinks she ’ ll be able to gallop
0	it will tear even more , she cried in a violent outburst
0	bazarov tossed his pistol away and approached his opponent
0	while his letters clearly do not show the same care in composition his facility for writing is notable
0	our great writers did not hold to any single and exclusive system of realistic depiction
0	raskolnikov said , turning suddenly to a gentleman , no longer young , who was standing next to him near the organ grinder and had the look of a flâneur
0	but he understood completely how monstrously she was tormented , and had been for some time , by the thought of her dishonorable and shameful predicament
0	i came , sir , to explain myself , so to speak ; i consider it my sacred obligation
0	they might even have seen him , but they didn ’ t notice him since lots of people pass by there
0	well , sir , that ’ s enough !
0	how could he do it ?
0	leaning over he planted a kiss firmly on her parted lips
0	everything in him fits his strong character unusually well
0	raskolnikov glanced at him over his shoulder , regarded him attentively , and said just as quietly and lazily :
0	excuse me if i ’ m interrupting , but i ’ ve come on rather important business , ma ’ am , petr petrovich remarked to everyone in general , not addressing anyone in particular
0	lebezyatnikov asked in surprise
0	therefore , the only exculpatory evidence is that they were punching each other and laughing
0	i will be right back , fenechka replied and left quickly
0	the connection with the grass snake in the portico seems clear
0	petr petrovich seemed not to have expected such an ending
0	you ’ re up to your old tricks , porfiry petrovich !
0	yesterday you noted that i have been remade during my time here ,
0	i would , replied raskolnikov
0	still , i ’ ll end it because i want to
0	porfiry petrovich and zosimov were among those invited to the ceremony
0	on the way to the duel , bazarov notices a peasant , who has gotten up early to attend to his daily tasks
0	i know it by heart
0	what 's so important about a kiss ?
0	raskolnikov stood up and took his cap
0	i don ’ t care at all ; i merely asked
0	let ’ s go , he says , to the police station , and i ’ ll tell you everything
0	has he gone back to his room ?
0	something extraordinary shone in that gaze even when her tongue was uttering the emptiest phrases
0	going back to sleep !
0	the only thing slightly unpleasant about him was that from time to time he would slowly and carefully raise his hand to capture a fly on his own face and sometimes squash them there
0	they had only about two or three hundred paces to walk
0	i wasn ’ t worthy of beholding her with my own eyes
0	sometimes bazarov would set off for the village and , in his usual mocking manner , enter into conversation with some peasant
0	let him , let him go wherever he pleases for now ; i know that he ’ s my prey and won ’ t get away from me !
0	he celebrated the triumph , no matter how short-lived , of a revolutionary ecstasy that could transform human life and human relationships
0	just let me hug you once more , enyushechka , arina vlasevna moaned
0	what , don ’ t you think that such wildly imaginative types can come from the common people ?
0	fathers and sons is not
0	you want to frighten me
0	he was always very patient with her , even courteous
0	have you ever seen any ?
0	asked pavel petrovich politely , but without the slightest smile
0	i see all too well that you ’ re fearless !
0	all other human feelings he reduces to the activity of the nervous system ; consequently , the enjoyment of the beauty of nature , of music , painting , poetry , the love of a woman do not seem to him to be any loftier or purer than the enjoyment of a copious dinner or a bottle of good wine
0	because it may be only an accident
0	you ’ re like a little child : asking to play with fire !
0	i needed to have something to cling to , some reason to delay , to see another person !
0	will you come to see me in prison when i have to spend time there ?
0	moreover , katerina ivanovna was not downtrodden : circumstances might defeat her entirely , but they could not crush her morally , that is , they could not intimidate her or overpower her will
0	twenty or thirty years from now who will remember all these storms in a teacup and my name , with or without a shadow cast upon it ?
0	allow me to state , sir : she said precisely that once i gave her this document , she ’ d extend as much credit to me as i required once again , and never , never , for her part—and these were her exact words—never would she use that letter before i myself paid my debt
0	our dust will eat out your eyes , our dirt will spoil your clothes , you have not risen to our level yet , you still ca not help admiring yourselves , you like castigating yourselves , and that bores us
0	he left , trembling from some wild hysterical feeling mixed together with unbearable pleasure—he was feeling gloomy , however , and horribly tired
0	has he been here long ?
0	you still love her !
0	what have you done , what have you done to yourself ?
0	well , i ’ d give only one for you !
0	finally , a large , ungainly sofa took up almost the entire wall and about half the width of the whole room ; at one time it had been covered in chintz , but now it was in tatters and served as raskolnikov ’ s bed
0	you know each other , don ’ t you ?
0	for the contemporary reader is not only pisarev , herzen , chernyshevsky , annenkov , strakhov , and company ; in view of the ambiguity at the heart of the adjective , the contemporary reader may be with equal justice construed as the reader of the late twentieth century , russian and non-russian alike
0	i wrote naively , as if i was struck myself by what came out
0	i also feel sorry for katya !
0	she clasped her hands together
0	you are looking at me incredulously and thinking : here 's an 'aristocrat ' speaking , all dressed up in lace , sitting on a velvet armchair
0	bazarov stopped talking to arkady about odintsova and even ceased mocking her aristocratic ways ; it 's true , he continued to praise katya as before , merely advising arkady to restrain her sentimental tendencies , but his praise was hurried , his advice , dry ; in general he talked with arkady much less than before as if avoiding him , feeling ashamed of something
0	are you really leaving ?
0	imagine his astonishment when he suddenly saw that not only was nastasya home this time , and in the kitchen , but that she was busy working : she was taking the laundry out of a basket and pinning it up to dry !
0	it is nevertheless the more positive sides of his character that must have impressed those who knew him well , concludes knowles in a more consoling spirit , for almost everyone liked him and children adored him
0	a cold smirk distorted bazarov 's lips
0	ah , good lord , my dear , it ’ s impossible to trouble you with anything !
0	perhaps i still don ’ t need to say anything , flashed through his mind
0	he said , as if he ’ d made up his mind
0	what ’ s wrong with him ?
0	we heard , rodya , that petr petrovich was kind enough to call on you today , pulkheriya aleksandrovna added with some timidity
0	he looked at the old woman and was in no rush to leave , just as if he wanted to say or do something else , but it seemed as if he himself didn ’ t know precisely what
0	after sitting her in an armchair , he gave his father another quick hug and then introduced arkady to him
0	marmeladov struck his fist on his forehead , clenched his teeth , closed his eyes , and placed his elbow firmly on the table
0	she might be of use to you if you were a bit more sensible
0	muttered the girl , waving her arm again
0	was it a joke ?
0	by force of habit he headed for the haymarket , the usual path of his previous walks
0	the meeting with her struck him as a particularly happy omen ; he was delighted to see her , as if she were family
0	zametov flinched , and although he did not exactly take offense , he was extremely surprised
0	you don ’ t believe that ’ s what she said ?
0	as i was comin ’ down the stairs and turnin ’ into the gateway at full speed , i run right into the caretaker with some other gentlemen , i don ’ t remember exactly how many , and the caretaker begins shoutin ’ at me , and the other gentleman also begins shoutin ’ ’ cause me and mitka are blockin ’ the way
0	it was all the same to me ; it wasn ’ t any of my business : was it logical or not for them to console themselves like that !
0	i was disturbed by the following fact : i did not even find a hint in any work of our literature of what i seemed to see everywhere ; against my will i was beset by doubts : was i not chasing a phantom ?
0	you should carry a whip in your hand !
0	so she really died ?
0	i ’ ll take him to see rodya and then bring him to you
0	what if there ’ s already been a search ?
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna intervened angrily
0	but it was strange : she didn ’ t even stir under the blows , as if she were made of wood
0	i ’ ve retained only the money that marfa petrovna gave me a year ago
0	then why not leave me in peace , raskolnikov muttered with a frown
0	romantic loves seeks events and obstacles , and imagines that real life is to be found in passion and struggle
0	are you both joking , or what ?
0	the fascination of a charming , virtuous , and educated woman could embellish his path to an astonishing degree , could attract others to him , create an aura
0	at least , that ’ s the way it seems
0	but , nothing , i have no specialty !
0	we know the type !
0	a forty-four-year-old man , a pater familias , living in such-and-such district—and plays the cello !
0	you say he 's unhappy : you ought to know ; but all his foolishness still has not gone out of him
0	ask kapernaumov ; she leaves her key with them
0	this whispering hadn ’ t ceased from the moment he had entered his room
0	i don ’ t wish to be mistaken in my choice , nor should i for you , i ’ d have to break off with my brother ; for my brother , i ’ d have to break off with you
0	the inattentive reader may come to the conclusion that bazarov has no internal substance and that his entire nihilism consists of an interweaving of daring phrases snatched from the air and not created by independent thought
0	but neither katya nor arkady even understood her
0	brought the standoffish gentleman up short ; he almost turned to face razumikhin , but managed to restrain himself in time and turned back to zosimov
0	i agree that perhaps in your eyes i ’ m overly concerned about these trifles ; but you can ’ t consider me an egoist or a greedy man
0	he was mistaken in his calculations : pulkheriya aleksandrovna threw herself at him , grabbed both his hands , and almost started kissing them
0	now , reminding dunya with bitterness that he had decided to take her despite those nasty rumors about her , petr petrovich was speaking in complete sincerity and even feeling deep disgust toward such black ingratitude
0	at length , one person was about to appear in his dressing gown because he didn ’ t own a suit , but this was so inappropriate that the combined efforts of amaliya ivanovna and the little pole succeeded in excluding him
0	clearly , he was concerned about making an impression and his vanity had overcome his good sense
0	he tries to lead his son away , but the boy breaks from his father ’ s arms ; beside himself , he runs toward the horse
0	when he ’ d paid his visit to raskolnikov , he had entered with the feeling of a benefactor preparing to reap the fruits and hear extremely gratifying compliments
0	and , assuming an air of indifference , pavel petrovich left the room at once
0	according to you , we stand outside humanity , beyond its laws
0	what is to be done ?
0	i have been looking all over for you but you have chosen an excellent spot and you are engaged in a splendid pursuit
0	well , this is splendid !
0	that 's the only thing i am proud of
0	old boy , rodion romanovich !
0	he rested his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head tight in his palms
0	only three men were sent to work there
0	it ’ s time , dunechka , it ’ s time !
0	i couldn ’ t recall this apartment because i ’ d never known about it
0	i drink to your health , eudoxie !
0	oh , god grant they will !
0	why has not evgeny come ?
0	anna sergeevna was so kind vasily ivanovich began
0	he raised his brooding glance to her face and suddenly noticed that he was sitting , while she was still standing in front of him
0	in drawing the character of bazarov i excluded everything artistic from his sympathies , i endowed him with harshness and an unceremonious tone—not out of a blind desire to insult the younger generation ( ! ! !
0	what a pretty girl !
0	if bazarov 's throwing open of odintseva 's window is a metaphor for his desire to rape her , it is also a metaphor for his political desires : his longing to break into the kingdom of order , that paternal realm over which odintseva presides
0	asked arkady , while the question , what use is it ?
0	raskolnikov went upstairs to the tavern
0	thus very clever people can be honorable through calculation and act openly where limited people would equivocate and lay snares
0	porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette
0	but let me ask you , what kind of tendentiousness in fathers and sons ?
0	said one woman , crossing herself
0	although bazarov is nothing to me , although i , perhaps , feel no sympathy for him , for the sake of abstract justice , i shall endeavor to answer this question and refute this silly doubt
0	perhaps you have never experienced this feeling ?
0	‡ a newspaper article published in attacked a woman in perm who read pushkin ’ s unfinished short story egyptian nights shamelessly and with provocative gestures
0	shall i open a window ?
0	but why are you so pale ?
0	did you notice that he was indifferent to everything , made no response to anything except for one point when he lost his self-control : the murder
0	what an efficient and
0	disregarding public opinion for your sake and restoring your reputation , of course i could very well have counted on some requital and even have claimed your gratitude
0	we ’ re to blame for embarking on this unseemly course of action ; i ’ m most at fault
0	people also gathered from the kapernaumovs ’ apartment , including kapernaumov himself , lame and blind in one eye , a strange-looking man with bristling hair and whiskers standing up straight ; his wife , who always had a frightened look ; and several of his children , their expressions fixed in constant astonishment and their mouths wide open
0	he was just blabbing , felt like wagging his tongue
0	he suddenly recalled sonya ’ s words : go to the crossroads , bow down before the people , kiss the earth because you ’ ve sinned before it , and say aloud to the whole world , i ’ m a murderer !
0	and was it worth it now , after all that had happened , to try to overcome these paltry new difficulties ?
0	that ’ s it , isn ’ t it ?
0	i don ’ t believe you !
0	but no , it should be explained more powerfully and imaginatively : looking at me at this very moment , it ’ s not a matter of can you , rather it ’ s dare you state positively that i am not a swine ?
0	raskolnikov didn ’ t sit down and didn ’ t want to walk away ; he stood in front of her in a quandary
0	some were in cases , others simply wrapped in newspaper , neatly and carefully , in double sheets , bound with ribbons
0	he tapped his forehead
0	he rushed at the axe ( it was an axe ) and pulled it out from under the bench , where it had been lying between two logs ; right there , before he left , he secured the axe in the loop , thrust both hands into his pockets , and left the lodge ; no one noticed him !
0	bazarov and arkady answered her with a silent bow , climbed back into their carriage , and , without stopping anywhere , headed home , to marino , where they arrived safely the following evening
0	shout several voices in the crowd
0	it vexes him to see a man , and a doctor besides , not daring to view the matter in its proper light
0	he was still preoccupied as he emerged from the gate
0	he uttered in a hoarse voice
0	bazarov , with his enormous sensitivity and vanity , feels out of place at the governor 's ball and at odintsov 's estate ( the wording of his request for vodka amazes the butler )
0	the tavern was dirty , dilapidated , and not even of average quality
0	on the first day after my arrival , i visited a number of foul places—well , after seven years , i threw myself into it
0	the most detailed portrait of a woman who actually participates in cyclical time is that of katya ; she enters the world of the novel carrying a basket full of fresh flowers , followed by a beautiful borzoi
0	dear madam , pulkheriya aleksandrovna ,
0	it was a twenty-kopeck piece
0	that odintseva fears , and shuns , an animal that is tame , is emblematic of her response to everything that lies beyond her manor walls
0	the tradesman squinted at him sullenly and examined him fixedly and carefully , without hurrying ; then he turned away slowly and , without saying a word , walked through the gate and into the street
0	he was very ashamed of his background and did not know whether to feel flattered or offended by bazarov 's unexpected familiarity in addressing him
0	) , instead of tying up the cabdriver , he clasped ze hands , und vept , und begt
0	that in truth it would have been easier for him if they had greeted him with abuse , because now it was all too confusing
0	oh , this happens very often !
0	she soon returned to her own room and reappeared only at breakfast
0	raskolnikov got as close as he could and finally saw the object of all this commotion and curiosity
0	but you have got no reason to get excited ; it does not matter to me
0	why do you keep asking ?
0	its effect , though , is to lock pavel petrovich into an eternal past , anna sergeevna into an eternal present , and bazarov into an eternal future
0	mädchen , was willst du mehr ? ¶¶
0	yet , knowing beforehand that he won ’ t , you still set off on your way and
0	here the narrator unequivocally attributes moral worth to ignorance of time 's passage , since such ignorance constitutes a psychic escape from the press of time 's chronological progression
0	sonya was silent for a long time , as if she could make no reply
0	raskolnikov hadn ’ t been to see him for the last four months or so , and razumikhin didn ’ t even know where his friend ’ s apartment was
0	he recalled how at that moment he had begun to feel sorry for her , as if his heart had contracted
0	he paused for a moment to catch his breath , to collect himself , in order to enter like a man
0	why don ’ t i serve , my dear sir ?
0	is the water ready ?
0	it happened in the morning , pulkheriya aleksandrovna continued hurriedly
0	i love you without limit
0	he took charge immediately , poured her tea , then poured another cup , forsook his own lunch , and sat down on the sofa again
0	was it a long time ago ?
0	was willst du mehr—the things he thinks of , the blockhead !
0	thus they must forgo pleasures that stronger selves can enjoy
0	he directed his sleepy gaze coldly at the approaching svidrigaylov
0	that turgenev retains the psychology of metamorphosis , the notion of a regression from the human to the animal , is suggested in his description of bazarov 's embrace and odintseva 's response : bazarov 's face is bestial , while odintseva 's own face is transformed by desire
0	i like it when they sing with an organ grinder on a cold , dark , damp autumn evening , absolutely on a damp evening , when all the passersby have pale green , sickly faces ; or , even better , when wet snow is falling straight down , without any wind , you know , and gaslights are shining through it
0	dunya believed blindly that he would fulfill all his intentions , and , in fact , she had to believe him : this man had an iron will
0	it ’ s hard to be effective ; it doesn ’ t just descend from the heavens
0	i don ’ t believe you !
0	perhaps there ’ s still time
0	i ’ ll go with you
0	no one , no one at all has ever seen them here before , and i ’ ve never seen them either ; why did they come , i ask you ?
0	all right , so be it ; but how would you decide ?
0	but that is the beginning of a new story , the story of the gradual renewal of a person , the story of his gradual rebirth , and gradual transition from one world to another , of his getting to know a new , hitherto completely unknown reality
0	i don ’ t believe it !
0	with all your heart and soul ?
0	i ’ m annoyed that i humiliated myself with zametov in the tavern yesterday
0	her expression was thoughtful , but not stern
0	she uttered with difficulty
0	so , you speak to me in french , i reply in latin
0	peter woke him at four o'clock ; he got dressed at once and left with him
0	oh , these high-strung people are too much !
0	you know , i am afraid he may not be comfortable sleeping on the sofa
0	if they stop him , all ’ s lost ; if they let him pass , all ’ s still lost : they ’ ll remember him
0	she looked at rodya
0	men have no time to waste on such trifles
0	razumikhin just told me that even now you ’ re accusing nikolai and you assured him of that
0	i ’ ve upset him with all my chatter !
0	svidrigaylov replied with a loud laugh
0	and again , 'while some accused me of
0	raskolnikov asked with a smirk
0	she ’ s so muddled ; she ’ s either agitated like a little girl , hoping that tomorrow everything will be right , the refreshments , and everything else
0	without understanding anything , right there in the hall , she threw herself at anna sergeevna 's feet and began kissing her dress like a madwoman
0	as far as petr petrovich is concerned , i was always certain of him , katerina ivanovna continued to raskolnikov
0	that is , on your voyage ’ ?
0	cried sonya , bending over her
0	there were eight items in all : two small boxes with earrings or something of that sort—he didn ’ t look very carefully—and four small morocco leather cases
0	he looked at sonya and felt how much love was directed at him ; strange to say , he suddenly felt oppressed and pained at being so loved
0	you could have lived by reason and spirit , but you ’ ll end up on the haymarket
0	he went out into the garden for a few moments , stood there like a statue as if overwhelmed by some inexplicable consternation ( a look of consternation never left his face the whole time ) , and returned to his son once again , trying to avoid his wife 's inquiries
0	if even one more scandal takes place in your respectable house , then i ’ ll have you hauled off to the slammer , as they say in the highest circles
0	under the influence of various vague emotions , an awareness of life passing by , a desire for novelty , she would forced herself to reach a certain point , to look beyond it—and there she glimpsed not even an abyss , but emptiness or formlessness
0	she stood there deep in thought
0	you ’ re doing all these things in your delirium !
0	he opened the door and listened : everything was absolutely still in the house
0	( a discreet private toast is proposed by the victorious and magnanimous katya to the memory of the erring and vanquished bazarov )
0	such an investigation may have profound significance
0	even if he had been convinced that all progressives were such fools , even then his uneasiness would not have been alleviated
0	why go to petrovsky park ?
0	i should ’ ve realized that
0	but in any case , it ’ s difficult for me as a man
0	it was completely different
0	both young men left right after supper
0	unfortunately , she 's still not very enlightened : she needs to become better acquainted with our evdoksiya
0	just wait 'til you see my little garden !
0	member of the previous generation who combines the manners of a parisian litterateur with an income derived from the labor of serfs
0	when do you plan to arrest me ?
0	how would you decide : which of them has to die ?
0	you are leaving us dear brother , you are leaving us , he began
0	he became flustered and fell silent
0	porfiry petrovich went to order the tea
0	do you know the details of that episode ?
0	furthermore , i recall , i develop the idea in my article , that all people
0	all of a sudden the door opened and avdotya romanovna walked in
0	he turned his back to the railing and looked around
0	he must be close by , however , in the courtyard , because the door ’ s wide open
0	raskolnikov put his cap down , maintained his silence , and listened seriously , with a scowl , to porfiry ’ s empty , disjointed chatter
0	we may remind them of pushkin 's lines :
0	i ’ ll follow you , i ’ ll follow you everywhere !
0	no matter how simpleminded andrey semyonovich was , little by little he still began to see that petr petrovich was deceiving him , that he secretly despised him , and that he was not the man he seemed to be
0	you can ’ t possibly imagine how demolished that fellow is now !
0	he remembered and thought about dunechka and his heart skipped a beat
0	if you like , i ’ ll take him abroad
0	i mean the prosaic set of values that center around the family and ordinary life , the life of fathers and sons ( or fathers and children , to translate the title literally )
0	you were bored there even when my wife was still alive ; now i think you would die of boredom
0	the person being reproached was sitting on a chair and had the look of a man who very much wanted to sneeze but was unable to do so
0	what nonsense , he thought
0	i live right here !
0	long luxuriant tresses and capacious crinolines , so obviously suggestive of fertility , were clearly parts of the feminine apparatus of erotic attraction
0	this creature not only didn ’ t think it fitting to appear , but didn ’ t even send a message of apology that she couldn ’ t come , as considered correct by the most ordinary rules of politeness in such circumstances !
0	well , go on , shoot !
0	thus anna sergeevna expressed herself , and thus bazarov expressed himself ; they both thought they were telling the truth
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna smiled slightly , while raskolnikov roared with loud laughter
0	but it ’ s time for me to go ; i ’ ll drop in again , perhaps , and hope to find you here
0	the ball of paper hit him in the eye and bounced onto the floor
0	yesterday , when i asked you to come with me , i didn ’ t know where myself
0	his indignation was so intense that it immediately curtailed his trembling ; he prepared to enter with a cold , insolent appearance and promised himself to maintain his silence for as long as he could , to watch carefully and listen attentively , so that this time , at least , no matter what happened , he would conquer his own morbidly agitated nature
0	do you have a rendezvous ?
0	he muttered , as if to himself ; then , all of a sudden , he noticed raskolnikov once more
0	wondered pavel petrovich when left alone
0	all his thoughts now revolved around one main point—he himself felt that it was really the main point , and that now , precisely at this moment , he was all alone , face-to-face with this main point—and that it was even happening for the very first time after these last two months
0	what did those words mean ?
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna immediately began thanking zosimov , in particular for his visit to their hotel room the evening before
0	he 's not home ; he usually gets up early and goes off somewhere
0	peter 's quavering voice croaked from behind
0	he cried in astonishment , but he kept smiling maliciously
0	he started walking along voznesensky prospect toward the neva ; but on the way , another idea suddenly occurred to him : why the neva ?
0	gentlemen , let 's talk about love , added evdoksiya , lowering her arm languorously onto the rumpled cushion of the sofa
0	he asked , his face assuming a most casual expression
0	i understand everything , everything !
0	there is no point in speaking of the many splendid details in that tale , and it is so absorbing that while reading it you think the first line stands next to the last one—the middle is swallowed up so quickly !
0	large tears were flowing down dunya ’ s cheeks
0	it had an indescribable effect on her
0	oh , you stupid children !
0	this is why it happened that a portion of the younger generation recognized itself in bazarov
0	rage overcame him : he began striking the old woman on the head with all his strength , but with each blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom sounded stronger and louder , and the old woman shook with mirth
0	avdotya romanovna began to reply irascibly , but immediately restrained herself
0	our road 's one of civilization , yes , sir , yes , my kind sir ; its fruits are dear to us
0	the head clerk was about to say solicitously , but he paused because he knew from his own experience that it was impossible to restrain the lieutenant except by force once he was so incensed
0	he was afraid of losing his self-control
0	how do you know ?
0	in poverty you can still preserve the nobility of your innate feelings , while in destitution you never do and no one does
0	only one of them , the goddess of silence , with her finger on her lips , had actually been delivered and set in place ; but that same day some boys from the estate had broken the statue 's nose , and even though a local plasterer had managed to provide her with a new one , twice as good as the previous nose , odintsov had ordered her removed
0	let me say that what you are arguing can be applied to all people in general
0	there you go , petr petrovich , always blaming rodion , yet you yourself told an untruth about him in your letter , pulkheriya aleksandrovna added , gathering her courage
0	so , what of it ?
0	it ’ s really a pity that there ’ s no one left !
0	he was terribly irate
0	kiss the master 's hand , you silly girl , arina said to her
0	well , sir , that ’ s enough !
0	anna sergeevna began , but after pausing a little , added : now he 's more confident and talks to me
0	i ca not listen with indifference when women are attacked , continued evdoksiya
0	well , even if he did not , he could have and should have , as a poet
0	he himself reported it all to her
0	( tsarstvoval ) , decorous ( prilichnyi ) , ministerial ( ministerskii ) : turgenev 's description of odintseva 's home conflates politics and decorum in the novel 's most extreme example of repression and constraint
0	it ’ s a stumbling block for anyone like you , and worst of all—you ridicule it before finding out what it ’ s all about !
0	it is not a question of satisfying one 's pride but in the assurance that you have not made a mistake and have not missed the mark , and that labor has not been wasted
0	sooner or later , of course , we end up asking where turgenev stands
0	i ’ m heading to the islands
0	at least let someone die in peace !
0	i discovered this would never happen , that people wouldn ’ t change , there ’ s no one to remake them , and it ’ s not worth the effort !
0	arkady 's glance disrobes odintseva—he sees her body beneath grey silk—but he will not admit to it , just as he finally will reproach bazarov on a matter of
0	he glanced at his brother and handed mitya to fenechka
0	he had hardly appeared in the kirsanov family when he immediately arouses irritation and hatred in pavel petrovich , respect mixed with fear in nikolai petrovich , the friendly disposition of fenichka , dunyasha , the servants ' children , even of the baby mitya , and the contempt of prokofich
0	kukshina—turgenev 's parody of a nihilist—
0	to hell with him !
0	if the feminists wanted to change pieces of the world , the nihilists wanted to change the world itself , though not necessarily through political action
0	let us leave for a moment the question of his emptiness ; i will return to it later
0	but now i see that i was foolish once again , because if you want to , you ’ ll achieve anything you desire with your intellect and talent
0	for example , he seemed a bit harsh to me at first ; but that could be precisely because he ’ s such a straightforward man , and it ’ s absolutely so
0	you turned here automatically , and without even knowing it , you came right to this address
0	he robbed them , that was the only reason
0	and that i did my sister an honor today when i sat her next to you
0	and he 's by no means stupid
0	his legs suddenly felt weak , and a chill ran up his spine ; for a moment , his heart skipped a beat , but then it started pounding , as if it had come loose
0	he began listening : someone was cursing and imploring the other person in tears , but only one voice could be heard
0	he made every effort to remember everything and forget nothing ; his heart was still pounding , thumping so hard that it became hard for him to breathe
0	it was given to me , she replied , as if reluctantly and without looking at him
0	the letter trembled in his hands : he didn ’ t want to open it in her presence : he wanted to be alone with the letter
0	it ’ s better to speak the whole truth
0	well , zosimov , believe it or not , that question was posed , in those exact words
0	that ’ s just why they ’ re going to exile me now , that ’ s what they need to do
0	and will you come to love me ?
0	they don ’ t even want to know you , and they want you to leave
0	and continued in a low voice to abuse the shafthorse for kickin ' with his headpiece ,
0	denounce him , if you like !
0	and she 's come as well
0	he suddenly roused himself , as if waking up
0	ah , katerina ivanovna , of course , you can ’ t miss her
0	the policeman also stood there , confused
0	but he was a kind and generous man who loved and respected his family ; his one fault was that out of kindness he used to trust all sorts of depraved creatures ; god knows who he used to drink with , people who weren ’ t even worth his shoe sole !
0	well , as far as the peasant commune 's concerned , he said , you really ought to talk to your brother
0	hey , goddammit , are you asleep or what ?
0	i ’ m sure that even now he could do something to himself that no one else could ever conceive of doing
0	this glorification of nihilism , he complained , was nothing but grovelling at the feet of the young radicals
0	it was not family feeling at all , but a simple sense of justice , arkady objected contentiously
0	she had probably done nothing generous in her life and will not do so again all her life
0	i do not care if you understand it
0	and she was already thinking about a pension , he-he-he !
0	when have you tried to destroy yourself ?
0	no , you must ’ ve gotten carried away somehow !
0	i merely didn ’ t want to pass a hungry mother , clutching a ruble in my pocket , while waiting for the common good
0	in that moment , an idea suddenly dawned upon him—as if it had been waiting to strike him forcefully
0	all the windows were open wide ; the tavern , judging by the movement of the figures in the windows , was packed full of people
0	then listen to the story : exactly three days after the murder , in the morning , they were still fussing over kokh and pestryakov , even though those two were able to account for their every step
0	when you finish that part—you ’ ll get another three rubles
0	it still does not prove anything
0	in a word , i ’ d like to
0	all of a sudden he stood up
0	people don ’ t rent apartments at night ; besides , you must come to see it with the caretaker
0	( aniska ’ s the seamstress in the country , a former serf , who learned to sew in moscow—she ’ s a pretty girl )
0	du calme , du calme , pavel petrovich would reply to this , while he himself would hum , frown , and tug at his mustache
0	she did not lose her head , however , and promptly summoned her mother 's sister , the princess avdotya stepanovna kh , a nasty , arrogant old woman , who , after taking up residence in her niece 's house , appropriated all the best rooms for herself , growled and grumbled from morning to night , and would not even go out for walks in the garden unless accompanied by her one servant , a gloomy footman in worn , pea-green livery with light blue braid , and a three-cornered hat
0	cried svidrigaylov , turning around
0	he ’ s at my place now , but he ’ s not drunk
0	you ’ re in quite a sentimental mood today , aren ’ t you ?
0	how did they wind up there ?
0	just the opposite : i ’ m so glad you finally decided to visit us
0	do you think it ’ s because we have no interest in social matters , or is it that we ’ re very honest and don ’ t wish to deceive one another ?
0	all at once her whole body shuddered
0	that ’ s not it at all !
0	even though you make fun of medicine , i am sure you can give me some useful advice
0	yes , i understand ; everyone will have the same spleen
0	raskolnikov stood there clutching his axe
0	but how can one destroy without even knowing why ?
0	water wears away a stone
0	perhaps i know more than you do
0	man ’ s a scoundrel : he can get used to anything !
0	they had to sit in the drawing room for rather a long time looking rather foolish
0	that ’ s what they consider the highest form of progress
0	but i find i have already spent too much time in spheres alien to my nature
0	bazarov had informed her of his impending departure with no intention of testing her or to see what might happen : he never fabricated
0	permit me to explain on my part that i ’ ve been living there for almost three years , from the time i first arrived from the provinces , and previously
0	dunya was too overwhelmed by svidrigaylov ’ s proposal
0	as he left the house , he pulled his cap down over his head with both hands , climbed into the dilapidated racing carriage left at the gate , and set off at a trot , not toward town
0	well , i thought , there ’ s a small detail at last !
0	so , ma ’ am , here i am again about the same sort of thing , raskolnikov continued , a little flustered and surprised by the old woman ’ s distrust
0	he did not manage to say good-bye to fenechka : he merely exchanged glances with her through the window
0	that , at least , is the latest news i received
0	the shout ended with a shriek ; the last sounds could be heard from outside in the courtyard ; then everything fell silent
0	there ’ s no way to deal with you ; you ’ re suffering from some sort of monomania
0	he raised himself up in a bad temper , feeling that he had been pummeled ; his bones ached
0	the errand boy at afanasy ivanovich ’ s shop is better dressed !
0	he dragged out his speech for no reason , avoided using the word papa ,
0	but this is all nonsense and beside the point
0	turgenev , no less than dostoevsky , was aware of the destabilizing forces in the individual and society , yet nothing was more nearly anathema to him in art and culture than maximalism
0	you see , she was taking some cure with her baths ; they have a cold spring , and she used to bathe in it every day , as soon as she entered the water , she suddenly had a stroke !
0	you could assist me in my agronomical work : you could give me some useful advice
0	he ’ s still a young man !
0	marmeladov cried suddenly , standing up , his arm outstretched , now genuinely inspired , as if he ’ d been waiting for those words
0	at least they ’ re not making any noise , only
0	when jesus therefore saw her weeping , the jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled , and said , where have ye laid him ?
0	they say that in consumption there are little tubercles that invade the brain ; it ’ s a pity that i don ’ t know anything about medicine
0	you will see he 's not the sort of man you think he is
0	why acacias of course
0	such an interesting young man
0	we lived very amicably , and she was always content with me
0	the shift away from turgenev was as noticeable in europe as in russia
0	i ’ m rodya ’ s friend , also a former student , and now i ’ m looking after him
0	and yet that love and falling in love are real and valuable human feelings
0	you ’ re stuck on your principles as if on loaded springs ; you don ’ t dare turn around on your own ; in my opinion , he ’ s a good man—that ’ s the principle , and i don ’ t want to hear anything else
0	he added suddenly in a loud voice and gave a brief laugh
0	so , in rejecting chivalric or tender attention from men , she often seemed blunt , for she deeply longed to be received as a human being , not simply as a woman
0	and really get to know each other well ?
0	he picked it up and examined it
0	he forgot to lock the door behind him , and he killed , he killed two people in accordance with a theory
0	one thing 's a nuisance—my mother 's so tenderhearted : if your belly does not swell and you do not eat ten times a day , she gets very upset
0	that ’ s also related , he concluded , as if talking to himself
0	many of our contemporary journalists and publicists will cry
0	raskolnikov frowned and stared directly at him
0	prosaics is one of the great anti-napoleonic arguments of russian literature
0	of course , nikolai petrovich observed , you were born here , so everything must seem special to you
0	you ’ re the murderer , sir
0	he does not follow us , but tranquilly gazes after us and describes our gait , telling us how we quicken our pace , how we jump across ditches , how now and then we stumble over rough places in the road
0	what else can she do ?
0	he spoke in a loud voice and stamped his feet , but his face looked haggard and he kept avoiding his son 's eyes
0	his father , a general who fought in , was a semiliterate , coarse russian , not in the least malicious , who worked hard all his life—
0	i ’ ll tell you later
0	although i agree with you that it ’ s unnecessary to recount
0	only , i believe , at the cost of ignoring its deepest layer of meaning and thus missing its consummate achievement
0	i had a feeling you ’ d ask me something like that , she said , regarding him inquisitively
0	her light-colored hair , sparse and with gray patches , smeared generously with grease as usual , was braided into a thin pigtail tucked under a comb of horn that stuck out at the nape of her neck
0	throughout , odintseva watches this veiled window—a window that stands as emblem of herself , of natural longing problematically hidden ; the epithets of the room—
0	so she comes to me , that one does , in the morning , says the elder to the younger , at the crack of dawn , all dressed up
0	have you seen a moth near a candle ?
0	rather than admit identity , the sudden collapse of barriers , odintseva insists that communication failed—an insistence that is itself an exemplary civil resolution
0	in life , in his relations to people , bazarov is not consistent ( with himself ) ; but in that very thing his vitality is disclosed
0	but she ’ d always had this
0	here , take this one , it ’ s cypress wood
0	upon reaching the corner , he crossed to the opposite side of the street , turned around , and saw that sonya was now following him , along the same street , not noticing anything
0	i have grown weak from all this heat
0	he kept having daydreams , and they were very strange , indeed : most often he imagined that he was somewhere in africa , in egypt , on some sort of oasis
0	the furniture , all very old and made of yellow wood , consisted of a sofa with an enormous carved wooden back , an oval table in front of it , a dressing table with a pier mirror standing between the windows , chairs along the walls , and two or three cheap pictures in yellow frames depicting young german ladies with birds in their hands—that ’ s all the furniture there was
0	both of them felt uncomfortable
0	insisted svidrigaylov with a mischievous smile
0	in a word , that i ’ m capable of being attracted and falling in love ( which , of course , doesn ’ t depend on our own will ) ; then everything can be explained in the most natural manner
0	such is the nature of this form of pseudo-objective underpinning : as befits a high official
0	he doesn ’ t want you to marry luzhin
0	it ’ s really true : you ’ re not a christian !
0	the first day , i arrived home from work in the morning and saw that katerina ivanovna had prepared two courses , soup and salted beef with horseradish , something we ’ d never even dreamt of before
0	all this flashed through his mind vaguely in one moment
0	porfiry cried in astonishment
0	and besides , what sort of father am i ?
0	cried razumikhin , banging his fist on the table
0	and why did he attack luzhin like that ?
0	where will i go ?
0	turgenev 's artistic method derives in part at least from his heightened awareness of the usually concealed relationship between surface manifestation and internal reality in the life and consciousness of people
0	polechka , how much did we collect ?
0	asked svidrigaylov , glancing at him inquisitively
0	thus , on the level of characterization , ottsy i deti proceeds in a manner entirely consistent with hegel 's dialectic : polarities and similarities shift and finally pass over into each other
0	petr petrovich ceremoniously escorted her to the door
0	how come you don ’ t work , huh , if you ’ re a civil servant ?
0	i do not see why it is not possible to say everything you have in mind
0	he is tempted , finally , by madame odintzov , the country-house delilah ; suddenly he finds his awkward callow tongue , admitting to her his inability to speak freely of everything in his heart
0	she is a caricature of the new woman , aspiring to play some role in history such as she imagines bazarov does
0	§ palmerston ( – ) was a british statesman and liberal prime minister
0	it 's hard to say now , but he will be famous
0	yet turgenev was absolutely correct in doubting that russia could or would overcome its historical ailments at least with respect to its near future
0	sonya was more embarrassed than before ; her face flushed with color once again
0	she buried her stepmother today : it ’ s not the sort of day to go visiting
0	whispered svidrigaylov in genuine horror
0	as for the items , some cuff links and chains—i buried those things and the purse the next morning in a courtyard on voznesensky prospect under a stone
0	well , for example take yesterday—as we were passing our bailiff , phillip 's cottage—and you said that russia will attain perfection when every last muzhik has such a place to live , and that every one of us ought to work to bring that about
0	all kinds of people trade here , replied the lad , taking raskolnikov ’ s measure condescendingly
0	don ’ t you earn some money every day ?
0	¶ an allusion to the views of the radical critic dmitry pisarev ( – )
0	nikolai petrovich cast a sidelong glance at his son ; the carriage traveled on for half a mile or so before their conversation resumed
0	raskolnikov asked with displeasure
0	have you already lost the strength to stop ?
0	raskolnikov had long since stopped listening
0	don ’ t torment me , sonya !
0	not for anything on earth !
0	at first when i came , he wasn ’ t there
0	conferred about it before , pulkheriya aleksandrovna began in her confusion
0	every last line in turgenev 's latest novel is deeply felt ; this feeling breaks through against the will and realization of the author himself and suffuses the objective narration , instead of merely expressing itself in lyric digressions
0	razumikhin asked , suddenly interrupting him
0	no , rodya , but he already knows about our arrival
0	apparently bazarov is a proud man , terribly egoistic and offending others by his egoism
0	raskolnikov spoke at last in a steady voice and stepped forward
0	he asked raskolnikov sternly , noticing his tattered clothes
0	to start preaching would mean to start going into abstractions , would mean calling logic and history to one 's aid , would mean to concern oneself with those things already admitted to be trifles in their very essence
0	turgenev hardly lost his interest in philosophers and philosophy , however
0	do make prokofich hurry , papa , and i will be right back
0	he ’ s just withdrawn a little , as if to roll a cigarette
0	yes , indeed , it was a mental imbalance that came upon me
0	no other russian writer evoked this ecstasy so powerfully
0	everyone would see them
0	now his mood resembled something like ecstasy and , at the same time , all the alcohol he ’ d consumed came rushing back to his head with redoubled force
0	the fiancée , however , had gone to bed much earlier , in a state of surprise and somewhat glum
0	bazarov bowed his head
0	how do you like that ?
0	suddenly her entire face turned red : she cried out and covered her face with her hands
0	the steps were heavy , even , unhurried
0	—some landowner just told me that this lady is— oh ho ho !
0	in what is to be done ?
0	the main thing is he ’ s a businesslike man ’ and seems to be kind ’ : what a joke that he took the conveyance of their baggage upon himself and that he ’ s shipping a large trunk at his own expense !
0	and you , gentlemen , he added with old-fashioned playfulness , allow a retired old veteran to invite you into his study
0	if only you would consider what it is you are supporting in russia with your vulgar maxim !
0	i gave the money yesterday to a consumptive woman , a devastated widow , not on the pretext of funeral expenses , but directly for the funeral , and not to the daughter—a young woman of notorious conduct ’ as he writes ( and whom i saw for the first time in my life yesterday ) , but to the widow herself
0	he was beginning to get angry and his face turned a particular rough coppery color
0	so much for the woman question
0	i ’ d very much like to see her once
0	is not that right , doctor ?
0	they are unhappy , distorted , and torment themselves with this very distortion as something completely inappropriate to their work
0	arkady , do you take your tea with cream or lemon ?
0	he took it out automatically
0	the peasant woman ’ s still cracking nuts and laughing
0	he thought very highly of himself ; his vanity knew no bounds , but he behaved simply , looked approvingly , listened indulgently , and laughed so generously that at first glance he might even be taken for a good fellow
0	she is beyond george sand ( a backward woman , knows nothing about education or embryology ) and correctly denounces proudhon , but in the same breath praises michelet 's l'amour !
0	he even liked this way out more than any other
0	do not stand on ceremony , arkady nikolaich , do have some
0	what if he or she is occupied at the moment with a natural necessity , he-he !
0	i ’ ll go see him
0	at each reading , people would line up who ’ d already heard the letter read several times in their own homes and in those of their other acquaintances
0	you get married , as soon as you can , and you build your nest , and you have lots of children
0	this observation of yours is even wittier than your last one
0	did you tell her ?
0	next he came to the apartment on the second floor where nikolashka and mitka had been working : it ’ s locked ; the door ’ s been freshly painted ; that means it ’ s for rent
0	as a remarkably intelligent man , he has never yet met his equal
0	he was probably lying
0	no , papa , i have not prepared anything
0	all of this business went smoothly
0	i won ’ t offer you coffee , sir , it ’ s not the place ; but why not sit here with a friend for five minutes or so for some amusement , porfiry chattered on without stopping , and you know , sir , all these official obligations
0	leave me , but don ’ t
0	one need only look at the face of our second
0	why do you say that ?
0	lizaveta replied slowly and pensively , as if unable to make up her mind
0	i must take care of these captives of mine
0	; and z a kamensky , russkaia ßosofia nachala xix veka i shelling ( moscow , )
0	she 's here i want to see her
0	how repulsive this all is !
0	i think bazarov constantly beats pavel petrovich and not the other way around
0	i don ’ t know from whom
0	instead of attacking them , you ought to read michelet 's de l'amour
0	that ’ s what it means to be in a certain mood
0	after his death she was left with three young children in a distant and dreadful provincial town , where i was also staying at the time ; she was living in such hopeless poverty—even though i ’ ve had many different experiences , i can ’ t even begin to describe her situation
0	he regarded his sister intently and intensely , but he hadn ’ t even heard or understood her words
0	this is not allowed on the streets , ma ’ am
0	only a few people in the whole world could be saved ; these were the pure and chosen , destined to found a new race of people and a new life , to renew and purify the earth ; but no one had ever seen these people , no one had ever heard their words or their voices
0	what ’ s the matter , you silly children ?
0	sonya repeated , crying hysterically and wringing her hands
0	her face still showed traces of illness ; it had grown thinner , paler , more pinched
0	katerina ivanovna , who was really distraught and very tired and already fed up with the funeral feast , immediately snapped at amaliya ivanovna and said that she was talking nonsense and didn ’ t understand a thing ; that die wäsche was the concern of the woman in charge of the linen , and not the director of a boarding school for noble young women ; and as far as reading novels was concerned , that was simply indecent , and she asked her to keep quiet
0	i am also something of a psychologist and physiognomist
0	this is a problem that occupies some of luc
0	you also said yesterday that you weren ’ t delirious , you even insisted on that !
0	she added that petr petrovich had specially ordered her to say that as soon as it became possible , he would come very soon to talk privately about business and to agree on what could be done and what to undertake in the future , etc , etc
0	raskolnikov kept silent , although he didn ’ t lift his anxious gaze from his friend ’ s face even for a moment
0	to have a requiem sung
0	i confess that i don ’ t understand him very well
0	you ’ ve begun to neglect your illness too much , sir
0	not only would the time to talk about everything never come , but there was nothing further for him to talk about with anyone , ever
0	he took from his pocket raskolnikov ’ s old , stiff boot , covered with dried mud and riddled with holes
0	asked razumikhin as soon as they got out to the street
0	i received a letter from kolyazin
0	by the way , how are the sunday schools getting on ?
0	it must be sacrificed for something more important , namely sophistication , aesthetic control , composure
0	until then , he didn ’ t want to meet anybody
0	how can we all descend on her at once ?
0	after seven in the evening
0	dunya must be protected from him
0	bazarov stood with his back to her
0	you , for instance , you wo not fight—yet you think you are a fine fellow—but we want to fight
0	he was pale , his eyes burning , all his limbs exhausted , but he suddenly seemed able to breathe more easily
0	i have gathered them now because it will soon be too hot and i wo not be able to go out
0	all during this scene , andrey semyonych stood next to the window or paced the room , not wishing to interrupt the conversation ; after sonya left , he suddenly approached petr petrovich and formally extended his hand
0	so , you would like to have an argument—by all means
0	you ’ ll have the account right away
0	and as he left , he quarreled with everyone
0	no he went out to the fields and i am not afraid of him but pavel petrovich
0	i know him , i do !
0	just think , it was he , he himself , who gave sofiya semyonovna that one-hundred-ruble note with his own hands—i saw it , i ’ m a witness , i ’ ll swear an oath !
0	the secretary of the english embassy sold them at the flea market last week ; he wore them only six days , but he really needed some cash
0	perhaps there ’ s no such thing as god , raskolnikov replied , even with some malicious delight
0	asked raskolnikov , as if alarmed
0	what time were you told to appear , kind sir ?
0	oh , god , what are we doing ?
0	well , if you were not such a fool , you ’ d be better off coming by my place today to spend the evening there than wearing out your new boots for nothing here
0	raskolnikov said with a laugh
0	is it the same mir that rests on three fishes ?
0	i myself will become one here !
0	that would really be better !
0	it is he , the polar opposite of the underground man , who holds up the extralinguistic proposition that x = as the ultimate argument for the truth of science
0	you can ’ t believe what that was like !
0	bazarov especially said almost nothing at all , but ate a great deal
0	but what have we said ?
0	well , of course , it did
0	arkady said nothing in reply to bazarov , and each of them lay down to sleep with his own thoughts
0	it would be better
0	he did sit down , but he didn ’ t let go of his cap
0	this was so strange !
0	as i ’ m telling him all this , i see him reach for his cap and get ready to bolt
0	razumikhin , positively embarrassed from having knocked over the table and broken the glass , regarded the fragments grimly , spit , and turned abruptly to the window and stood with his back to the others , his face wearing a terrible frown , looking out the window , but seeing nothing
0	is that pride , dunya ?
0	this doesn ’ t concern us
0	i understand , sir , everything you can say !
0	as if i couldn ’ t drop in on him now
0	tolstoy soon makes it crystal clear that the better love lies in the familiar and in the family , and not in brilliant happiness
0	by which he meant jerking his head
0	where do you live , may i ask ?
0	but i did not want to sugar-coat him , to use his own words , though through that i would have had the young on my side immediately
0	it was svidrigaylov , that same landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was working there as a governess
0	it would be better if you told me directly
0	the first bottle of champagne was followed by a second , then a third , even a fourth evdoksiya chattered without stopping ; sitnikov echoed her
0	i hope , however , that everything went without any particular difficulties
0	she cried rapidly , hurrying , gasping for breath , and coughing
0	nastasya , go away , for heaven ’ s sake ; here ’ s your three kopecks , only go away right now , for heaven ’ s sake !
0	this question of cesspools , in spite of all its vulgarity , had served several times as the cause of a dispute and disagreement between petr petrovich and his young friend
0	dunya immediately grabbed hold of his hand and squeezed it warmly , overjoyed and grateful
0	so you noticed that i told nikolai just now that he was using someone else ’ s words ’ ?
0	no , i didn ’ t see them , raskolnikov replied slowly , as if searching his memory , at the same time tensing his entire being , immobilized by the torment of trying to guess where the trap lay hidden , and hoping that he wouldn ’ t miss anything
0	polechka led the way , holding kolya and lyonya by the hand , both of whom were trembling and crying
0	now the crowd was dispersing from the stairway , everyone to their own apartments—exclaiming , arguing , calling to one another , first raising their voices to shout , then lowering them to whisper
0	he rushed to the door to ask for some water , but there in the corner , fortunately , was a carafe
0	know that too you have behaved sensibly ; you are not made for our bitter , tart , lonely existence
0	she embraced sonya and held her close , as if shielding her with her chest from everyone else
0	his writing is dense and substantial , yet it never marks time , always moves
0	katerina ivanovna remarked with contempt that her own background was known to everyone and that the same certificate of merit indicated in print that her father was a colonel ; while amaliya ivanovna ’ s father ( if she even had one ) was probably some poor petersburg finn who peddled milk ; that most likely she didn ’ t have a father at all , because even up to now amaliya ivanovna ’ s patronymic was still unknown : ivanovna or lyudvigovna
0	razumikhin was sitting here , too ; why didn ’ t it occur to him ?
0	are you crazy , or what ?
0	on the contrary , he became even more agonizingly , more intimately attached to this woman , in whom there remained , even when she surrendered herself to him entirely , something secret and inaccessible , which no one could penetrate
0	his attire was awful : all dirty , torn , and wrinkled , because he ’ d spent the previous night in the rain
0	raskolnikov turned pale and grew cold , hearing his own words to sonya
0	he ’ s a bit awkward ; that is , he ’ s a worldly man , but in another sense , i say he ’ s awkward
0	if you ’ re ashamed , then don ’ t talk about it !
0	und zat iz not proper in ein respectable haus , herr kapitän , und i ’ m shouting
0	why , you do not consider yourself useless
0	no need for what ?
0	he ’ s very impressionable , sir , and he forgot all about his elder and about everything else
0	nikolai petrovich looked after him and sank down on his chair in confusion
0	after all , it ’ s only a theory and my theory at that , sir , and what sort of authority am i ?
0	but at that moment , the door opened wide once more and in walked razumikhin , bending his head a bit because he was so tall
0	and he himself even tells me about it ?
0	fenechka , said pavel petrovich in a somber voice , i saw
0	he was so exhausted from his whole month of concentrated melancholy and gloomy agitation that he felt like taking a breath in another world , wherever it was , and in spite of the filth of his surroundings , he now remained in the tavern with pleasure
0	no one ’ s home out there , he said softly and unhurriedly
0	i confess that since that last time i ’ ve felt very sorry that we treated you the way we did
0	and here we have a man in tatters , an arrogant policeman , the beginnings of an illness , and such a suspicion !
0	what a swine i am !
0	i found my former wife
0	but the heat of midday passes , evening comes , then night , and the return to a quiet refuge where sweet sleep awaits all who are tired and tormented
0	the general character of the time is practicality : we all want to live by the rule that fine words butter no parsnips
0	pavel petrovich turned it over in his hands
0	the thought of dunya and his mother for some reason suddenly plunged him into some sort of panic
0	but didn ’ t you say she ’ s a freak ?
0	we ’ ll arrange everything
0	i won ’ t describe now what happened that evening with pulkheriya aleksandrovna , how razumikhin went back to them , how he tried to calm them down , how he swore that it was necessary to allow rodya to rest from his illness , swore that rodya would certainly come to see them , how he would come every day , that rodya was very , very upset , and that it was important not to irritate him ; how he , razumikhin , would look after him , find him a good doctor , the best , arrange for a consultation
0	we live in complete harmony , sonya said , suddenly agitated again and even irritated , just as if a canary or some other little bird had gotten angry
0	you can tell right away that in his own day he was a great latinist !
0	he cried , trying to convince pulkheriya aleksandrovna
0	it seems that the entire destitute family now depends on you alone
0	you ’ ve also stepped over
0	is of odintseva to herself—a revelation startling in its suggestion of her kinship with bazarov , a revelation from which she will flee to her familiar structures of order and repression
0	kokh began to stir
0	and his comparison of odintseva to ice cream—what is cold and solid melts—both attack surface stability
0	he leaned toward zametov , as close as he could get , and began moving his lips , uttering nothing at all ; he stayed like that for half a minute ; he knew what he was doing , but was unable to stop himself
0	we have to be merciful and forgive him a great many things
0	bazarov 's eyes glittered for an instant from under his dark brows
0	dunya recalled , moreover , her brother ’ s words to the effect that her mother had overheard her nighttime raving on the eve of that last fateful day , after the scene with svidrigaylov : had she perhaps found out something then ?
0	here , old boy , drink some , he whispered , rushing to him with the carafe
0	i ’ m all done in !
0	he told sofiya semyonovna all of this word for word ; she ’ s the only one who knows his secret , but she didn ’ t participate in the murder , neither in word nor in deed ; on the contrary , she was horrified , just as you are now
0	the parenthetical exclamation— how shapely her figure seemed to him , engulfed in the grey shimmer of black silk—is a glimpse into what that ritual of parting masks
0	she was about to grab the washbasin and hand it over to raskolnikov , as he had requested , but she almost stumbled with the heavy load
0	do you remember , mama , i was once in love and wanted to get married , he said suddenly , looking at his mother , who was struck by the unexpected manner and tone with which he had begun talking about it
0	i will introduce you to my sister ; she plays the piano very well
0	sonya was about to burst into tears : on the other hand , she considered herself unworthy of even looking at her
0	the devil only knows what sort of nonsense it all is !
0	the action of the novel takes place in the summer of
0	he stared steadfastly at the window
0	they gave it to him
0	he fell to his knees in the middle of the sidewalk , fortunately deserted this time
0	arkady 's glance at odintseva is parenthetical and hidden : bazarov approaches his friend and , in the spirit of male gossip , attempts to give expression to the hidden glance ; the words he uses are elemental , implicitly dismissive of attempts to dress up
0	thus the language and style of turgenev 's novels have the appearance of being single-languaged and pure
0	a quarter of an hour later both carriages stopped in front of the porch of a new wooden house painted gray and covered with a red iron roof
0	he was in an excellent frame of mind
0	have you thought up a lot of money ?
0	all her behavior presented a series of incongruities ; she wrote the only letters that could have aroused her husband 's justified suspicions to a man whom she hardly knew , and her love always retained a measure of sadness ; she no longer laughed or joked with the man she would chosen ; she listened to him and looked at him in bewilderment
0	what do you mean , what kind ?
0	you sybarite , muttered evdoksiya and began laughing
0	'no , friend , if you have decided to knock everything down , you must knock yourself down , too !
0	and i don ’ t think he values you very highly
0	amaliya ivanovna , for some reason , had also suddenly acquired unusual importance and unusual respect from katerina ivanovna , perhaps solely because the funeral feast was being prepared and amaliya ivanovna had resolved with all her heart to take part in all the work : she took it upon herself to set the table , procure the linen , crockery , and so forth , and to prepare the food in her kitchen
0	he added , his curiosity suddenly aroused
0	this is all nonsense , almost all idle talk !
0	after receiving a negative reply , he finally departed
0	( let it all come out in one clean sweep !
0	preaching would be that justification which , as we have seen , was superfluous for from n strakhov , kriticheskiya stat ' i , vol
0	no , you won ’ t run away
0	perhaps we could let some blood
0	your son deliberately exaggerated the meaning of my words to the point of absurdity , accusing me of evil intentions and , in my view , basing his allegations on your correspondence
0	yesterday i gave away all the money you sent me
0	whispered razumikhin , always inclined to exaggerate , turning forcefully in his chair
0	after twenty paces or so , you drop your head and clasp your hands behind your back
0	this , then , is a symbol that i ’ m taking up my cross , hee-hee !
0	in one she kept hold of the pledge
0	and he will forgive my sonya , he will ; i know that he will forgive her
0	† a community organized according to the plan of the french utopian socialist , charles fourier ( – )
0	but it was the devil that killed the old woman , not me
0	what does she say to you when she comes to visit ?
0	some console themselves by becoming professors and working for the future generation
0	he would not answer the question
0	she extended her hand to bazarov once again and responded to his handshake
0	it would be such a benefit that one would have to regard it as nothing other than a gift to us directly from the almighty
0	i will say this to console you , said bazarov
0	so you can ’ t guess ?
0	instead of a reply , raskolnikov stood up and went to the passageway , took hold of the bell chain , and yanked it
0	in any case , your items couldn ’ t possibly be lost , he continued calmly and coldly
0	i have already forgiven thee
0	wine , for example , i don ’ t drink at all
0	just you remember once and for all , you mighty gentlemen , that there are only four and a half of you , while there are millions of others who wo not let you trample their most sacred beliefs underfoot and who will crush you !
0	at such times he headed for the woods and walked with long strides , breaking any branches that got in his way , cursing both her and himself under his breath ; or else he took to the hayloft in the barn and , stubbornly closing his eyes , forced himself to sleep , which , naturally , he could not always do
0	i think he has a very good idea , he replied
0	beg for a loan of money without hope ?
0	we ’ ll totally disprove all this psychology , i ’ ll make all those suspicions against you disappear , so your crime will appear as the result of confusion , because , in all good conscience , that ’ s just what it was
0	don ’ t you see that ?
0	these very words are insincere in bazarov and childishly vulgar in his parody
0	he himself didn ’ t know ; as if grasping for straws , it suddenly seemed to him that he could live , there was still life ahead , and it hadn ’ t died along with that old woman
0	svidrigaylov pulled the trigger
0	well , then , sir , i ’ ll continue , sir : wit , in my opinion , is a majestic thing , sir ; it is , so to speak , the glory of nature and a consolation for life , and what tricks it can sometimes play , so that at times , it seems , it can bewilder even some poor little investigator , who ’ s distracted by his own fantasy , as always happens , because he ’ s also only human , sir !
0	the kirsanovs , father and son , have settled at marino
0	bazarov treats her with special respect ; it is evident that he is not indifferent to what she thinks of him , to the impression he is making ; contrary to his usual habit , he speaks quite a lot , tries to interest his listener , does not make cutting remarks and even , carefully avoiding topics of general concern , discusses botany , medicine , and other subjects he is well-versed in
0	i wasn ’ t quite well
0	what ’ s the matter with you ?
0	svidrigaylov provided drinks for her , for the organ grinder , the singers , and two clerks
0	from the distant opposite bank he could hear the sound of singing
0	i ’ m telling you this because i know for sure that you do love her , and i ’ m certain of the purity of your heart
0	and if you do question me , then only in the proper form , sir !
0	he calls this irony
0	bazarov , who for her embodies all that is unknown and unstable ahead , although mildly tempting , mostly fills anna sergeevna with horror
0	he asked whether she would chosen that sonata herself , or someone had recommended it to her
0	bazarov wanted to take it and leave
0	blood was still caked on her parched lips
0	but where are you going , avdotya romanovna ?
0	i came precisely to tell you everything and to bring this matter out into the open
0	you have talked with such clever women
0	for instance , after describing how fright-eningly quickly ten years had passed for pavel petrovich after an ill-fated love affair , the narrator then remarks , in no other country does time fly as fast as in russia ; in prison , they say , it flies faster still ( : ( p ] )
0	for some reason the singing and all that noise and commotion downstairs attracted him
0	you think i ’ m in a state !
0	perhaps everything will resurrect !
0	the silence lasted rather a long time
0	he must have heard the bells
0	holding his greasy dressing gown across his stomach with two fingers and smoking his pipe , he listened to bazarov with pleasure ; the more malicious his son 's quips , the more good-naturedly did he laugh , displaying every last one of his blackened teeth
0	his self-esteem , however , was quickly soothed and even flattered ; he realized that they really had been waiting for him as an oracle
0	he does not read anything in russian , but keeps a silver ashtray in the shape of a peasant 's bast sandal on his writing desk
0	you are crawling at bazarov 's feet !
0	do you really want to be a predator ?
0	before , you said , you used to teach children ; why don ’ t you do anything now ?
0	even if it ’ s the fourth , or the fifteenth , that ’ s all nonsense !
0	from all this it at least becomes apparent what a difficult task turgenev undertook in his latest novel and how successfully in our view he carried it out
0	i came home after dinner to have a little rest , and what do you think ?
0	you ’ re the moiderer , he insisted , even more distinctly and commandingly , with a grin of contemptuous triumph , and once more glanced directly at raskolnikov ’ s pale face and into his lifeless eyes
0	show me your finger
0	i didn ’ t take anything from you , sonya whispered in horror
0	my head aches very badly now
0	you do not believe in them ?
0	one has to be as inconspicuous as possible
0	yesterday evening , in the presence of my mother and my sister , and in his presence , i established the truth after proving that i had given the money to katerina ivanovna for the funeral , and not to sofiya semyonovna , and that two days ago i was still unacquainted with her and had not even once seen her face-to-face
0	like trained dogs dancing on their hind paws
0	it was apparent that this thought had already occurred to her many times before and that he had reminded her of it once again
0	now i am alone , completely alone !
0	this is the only time i can breathe
0	when dunya told him about you with such enthusiasm , he replied that one must first take a close look at anyone to form a judgment about him , and that he would reserve for himself the right to form his own opinion of you until he made your acquaintance
0	maybe we should ask the caretaker ?
0	the steps were very far off , at the bottom of the stairs , but he later recalled very clearly and distinctly that from the first sound , for some reason or other , he began to suspect that the footsteps were definitely coming here , that is , up to the fourth floor , to the old woman
0	he was afraid that he might have had a bilious attack during the night
0	if you only knew
0	who ’ s been just filling you full of champagne ?
0	arkady went out to join him
0	he ’ s dead , replied raskolnikov
0	they were definitely talking about me before we arrived !
0	i don ’ t want to speak against duty and conscience—but how are we to understand them ?
0	no matter what , he had to decide to do something , or else
0	apparently , this idea must have occurred to her already
0	i see the point of it : he simply wants to help me ; but last year i didn ’ t need it , and this year while i ’ d been waiting for him to arrive , i ’ d decided to take it
0	in the end , the image of their unfortunate brother stood out on its own , was drawn clearly and accurately ; there couldn ’ t be any mistakes , because all of it was based on true facts
0	she cried to the civil servant
0	raskolnikov made no reply ; he sat there pale and immobile , staring at porfiry ’ s face with the same strained attention
0	please , do not be offended : you probably recall my former opinion of katerina sergeevna
0	after he said this , raskolnikov felt inexpressible pleasure
0	she rushed around the room , pointing out luzhin to everyone
0	it ’ s consumption , sir ; the blood gushes and chokes the patient
0	the sun was burning behind a thin layer of solid whitish clouds
0	you know that at the time we even behaved in a dishonorable and ungentlemanly manner
0	i wasn ’ t asleep
0	in chapter he agrees to arkadi 's accusation of elitism : 'is it that you are a god while i am just one of the blockheads ?
0	what on earth can she do ?
0	why did zametov add that i spoke cleverly ?
0	the whole reason for the misunderstandings , the whole fault so to speak consisted in that the bazarov type created by me was not able to pass through gradual stages , as other literary types ordinarily do
0	i shall leave so as not to interfere with the further pleasantness of a family meeting and in the relaying of secrets
0	you become one yourself and take part in chivalric tournaments
0	there , in the immense steppe , flooded with sunlight , dark tents of some nomads were barely visible
0	of course , at first we were very surprised , since all this took place so swiftly and unexpectedly
0	but what am i saying ?
0	i might utter some stupid lie
0	do you need him right now , mama ?
0	insurmountable methodological hurdles often stand in the way of proving a philosopher 's influence on a poet or novelist , and hegel 's debt to fichte and schelling in the matter of the dialectic further exacerbates the difficulties in the present instance
0	this sudden , awful rupture now struck him like a clap of thunder
0	there ’ s someone with a hat
0	to hell with ya !
0	'technical beauties ' ) is exactly the sure way to 'human value ' , is exactly the business of the critic
0	he had in that moment been transformed ; his artificially arrogant and weakly challenging tone had disappeared
0	the stupid thing was that andrey semyonych was really angry
0	a young servant dressed in livery led the two friends into a large room , badly furnished , like all rooms
0	what should i do now ?
0	but nikolai suddenly sank to his knees
0	she ’ d have embraced this fate intentionally , and in the fourth or fifth century she ’ d have gone off to the desert in egypt and lived there for thirty years , nourishing herself on roots , ecstasies , and visions
0	perhaps i ’ m still a human being , not a louse , and i rushed to condemn myself
0	sooner or later everyone finds his niche , the late belinsky used to say
0	svidrigaylov struck his fist on the table with impatience
0	he really did say something to me yesterday about some dead man and about some young woman as we were going home , but i didn ’ t understand a word
0	if i ’ m to blame , forgive me ( although it ’ s impossible to forgive me if i am to blame )
0	he would only just come down to breakfast wearing a fashionable new outfit , this time not in the slavophile style ; the previous evening he would astonished the servant assigned to him by the amount of linen he would brought along
0	anna sergeevna lowered her eyes
0	but the aspect of secenov 's achievement i wish to stress has less to do with his specific work on the brain
0	anna sergeevna , who chatted mostly with bazarov , asked him whether he would like to play an old-fashioned game of preference with them
0	how can this be ?
0	petr petrovich began very imposingly , but rather tenderly
0	she would take off her last dress , sell it , go barefoot , and give it to you , if you needed it ; that ’ s the sort of person she is !
0	vasily ivanovich gave him his word not to disturb him , all the more so since arina vlasevna , from whom he would naturally concealed everything , had begun to pester him , wanting to know why he could not sleep and what was wrong with him
0	there are many young women just like her nowadays
0	what do we need all these abstractions for ?
0	dunechka paused on the threshold , not understanding why she was being invited to look , but svidrigaylov hastened to provide an explanation :
0	speaking of his blindness as a disease is a metaphor , but so is bazarov 's sickness in the novel : the great proponent of the concept that men are no more than the sum of the cells and chemicals of their physical bodies is himself brought down by an illness contracted from his dissection of a corpse , ie
0	what sort of strong opinion ?
0	it wasn ’ t the depravity
0	i ’ m willing to give you more time to reflect
0	what the hell , git in !
0	like a nervous woman or the plant touch-me not , turgenev shrinks from the slightest contact with the bouquet of bazarovism
0	the woman in the cap disappeared at once
0	last time i gave you two rubles for that ring , but you can buy a new one at the jeweler ’ s for a ruble and a half
0	it was conceived on sleepless nights and in a state of ecstasy , with much racing and pounding of the heart , with suppressed enthusiasm
0	in general , in russian society , those with the best manners are those who have been beaten—did you ever notice that ?
0	i ’ m sure that he was the cause of marfa petrovna ’ s death
0	no , i haven ’ t said a word to her , and i ’ m not even sure she ’ s home now
0	stop it , i beg you
0	but does he really , really not love us ?
0	they spoke about a doctor and a priest
0	well , yes , that ’ s it !
0	here are your rooms
0	as turgenev chose to present the matter it appears more as a social than political theme , but its motive force is just as operative
0	karmazinov chirruped still more sweetly
0	you have no facts
0	oh , yes , of course we do !
0	who in petersburg could she be receiving letters from ?
0	i ’ ll pay , i ’ ll be grateful , he muttered
0	cried dunya ; she turned deathly pale and rushed to the corner of the room , where she quickly shielded herself with the little table that was there
0	it 's hard to say why this was so , perhaps because she sensed bazarov 's lack of any aristocratic vestiges , any air of superiority that both attracts and repels
0	i will explain to her there 's nothing to be ashamed of in front of me
0	i was convinced of this by my own eyes , having seen him yesterday in the apartment of a certain drunkard , run over by horses , who died as a result , and whose daughter , a young woman of notorious conduct , he handed up to twenty-five rubles yesterday , on the pretext of funeral expenses , a fact that shocked me greatly , knowing the difficult circumstances under which you acquired that sum of money
0	would you believe that he intentionally staged that whole scene of a struggle with his friend and the laughter on the staircase , when those men were going upstairs , the caretaker and the two witnesses , precisely as a diversion
0	that ’ s not the point !
0	he remembered one voice proposing that he should be taken right to the police
0	it is only bazarov , in fact , who displays the slave owner 's mentality
0	young people today have become awfully sly , bazarov observed and also started laughing
0	he has a family , a wife , children , and one daughter
0	he ’ s wasted their lives and mine in a tavern !
0	he ’ s a terrible chatterbox !
0	is it an ideal simply through being balanced in an unbalanced age ?
0	upon hearing raskolnikov ’ s strange request with distrust , sonya moved hesitantly to the table
0	if i am infected , it 's already too late
0	well , wasn ’ t i telling the truth when i said that we were both cut from the same cloth ?
0	all chests have that kind of key
0	after reaching the chair , he sat down and regarded razumikhin suspiciously
0	then , puffing , he bent over and began peering into the keyhole ; but the key had been inserted from inside , and therefore nothing was visible
0	come forth , ye drunkards , come forth , ye weaklings , come forth , ye shameless ones !
0	boots , the finest calico shirtfronts , and a uniform : they threw it all together splendidly for eleven and a half rubles
0	when my sister sonya began speaking , mama also came up and said , hurry up , polyenka
0	on the stairs , he remembered that he was leaving all those things just as they were in the hole behind the wallpaper
0	after crossing the square , he found himself in a lane
0	bazarov glanced at her from under his brow
0	i very , very much hope that my name won ’ t be mentioned in connection with this gift
0	but i ’ m getting all tangled up
0	what new principles , what new constructive answers have they provided ?
0	one can even say that it ’ s the only thing they subsist on
0	i see that , her sister replied with a laugh
0	so much for turgenev the writer
0	you ’ re mistrustful , that ’ s why you weighed every word
0	in deep amazement , he listened intently to the frightened porfiry petrovich , who seemed affably solicitous of him
0	but no , that ’ s not right either !
0	of sublimated eroticism ; his duel with pavel sublimates violence in a highly conventionalized ritual
0	well , would someone ask about residence if he ’ d come with such an intention ?
0	bazarov spends his afternoon in dissecting frogs
0	good day , evgeny vasilevich , sir , the old fellow began with a broad grin , so that his whole face was covered in wrinkles
0	i couldn ’ t find the right way to say it
0	but when he reached the bridge , he stopped , suddenly turned onto the bridge , and went toward the haymarket
0	she came down to the last step and stopped right in front of him , one step higher
0	he seems , in fact , to play the role of a caricature of the narrator and to serve as the author 's honest attempt to concede what his own values often become in practice
0	suddenly , at that very moment , some light , hurried footsteps could be heard not far away on the stairs
0	i ’ ll look in first to see if he ’ s awake
0	meanwhile , he stood in the reception room while people who had no interest in him at all came and went
0	sonya ’ s breathing became labored
0	it was an old , three-story green house
0	field after field stretched as far as the horizon , first gently ascending , then descending ; here as a matter of fact , he 's free ( french )
0	but after feeding him a few spoons , razumikhin suddenly stopped and announced that they would have to consult zosimov about what to do next
0	the reader of his novel feels that behind the mirage of external actions and scenes there flows such a profound , such an inexhaustible current of life , that all these actions and scenes , all the characters and events are insignificant in comparison to that current
0	turgenev 's close look is focused on meaning in image and gesture , character and action
0	we ’ ll start small , grow larger , and at least we ’ ll be able to feed ourselves ; in any case , we ’ ll break even
0	after waiting a little while , he decided to advance into the next room
0	there are other reasons , completely different reasons !
0	just like today , i was passing by—and i thought , why not pay him a little visit ?
0	pavel petrovich grew pale
0	turgenev may have indeed modelled bazarov on a young provincial doctor , as he maintained in
0	in addition , i ask you not to forget that your beloved brother ’ s extremely curious secret lies completely in my hands
0	but life 's become a burden for him more than he suspects one need only catch a glimpse of him in the russian church , where , leaning against the wall on one side , he sinks deep into thought and remains motionless for some time , his teeth clenched in bitterness , then suddenly comes to his senses and begins crossing himself almost imperceptibly
0	i won ’ t ever forgive myself for not letting her do it !
0	why , why should we allow this opportunity to get away when one of the most important resources has turned up—our own money ?
0	paris , april ( ) , first of all , dear afanasy afanas'evich , thank you for your letter— and my thanks would be greater if you did not consider it necessary to put on kid gloves
0	he began again , suddenly raising his head as if struck and aroused again by an unexpected turn of thought
0	he assumes as true everything asserted of his subject , and then by its self-contradiction evolves the truth
0	razumikhin was in a state of extraordinary excitement
0	she ’ s mine ! † i can do what i want with ’ er !
0	well , if that ’ s so , replied svidrigaylov with some surprise , scrutinizing raskolnikov , if that ’ s so , then you yourself are a considerable cynic
0	it can be argued that one of the characteristics of great literature is that not everything can be made to fit any theoretical grid
0	folks come to me for advice—i ca not chase them away
0	i wouldn ’ t spit on it at all , but i would protest
0	he asked , barely audibly
0	order visibly reigned in the house : everything was clean , there was a kind of decorous scent everywhere , as in ministerial receiving rooms ( viii , [ p ] )
0	he answers in a bass voice and with such a pompous expression , as if the entire universe were observing him at that very moment
0	take me along , too , lads !
0	can one really talk the way she does ?
0	he was a bearded young man wearing a caftan who resembled a member of some guild
0	he has shown us how these forces are embodied in bazarov , in that same bazarov who denies them
0	he is broken , but not conquered
0	he followed from the opposite sidewalk without taking his eyes off her ; after covering about fifty paces , he crossed again to the side sonya was on , caught up with her , and followed her , staying about five paces back
0	about four years ago , i tried to read some geography and world history with her ; but since i myself was weak in those areas and we had no suitable textbooks , and the books we did have
0	on the contrary , i am sure i am right , arkady retorted
0	he needs to be restrained , said porfiry with a laugh
0	also in the house is nicolai kirsanov 's brother , paul , a retired army officer , a carefully dressed , vain , pompous , old-fashioned dandy , who had once been a minor lion in the salons of the capital , and is now living out his life in elegant and irritated boredom
0	and continue to recline , all clean , on velvet
0	she squeezed his hand
0	he lit the candle and examined his room more carefully
0	turgenev ends his novel by returning us to the world of pastoral , to the figures of baucis and philemon from ovid 's metamorphoses
0	day would come , and once again she was transformed into a society lady ; she would go out , laugh , chatter , and
0	and give me a napkin , a towel , something , quickly ; it ’ s still not clear where he ’ s been hurt
0	exactly so , ma ’ am , but mr svidrigaylov ’ s continual regime of persecutions and punishments compelled him or , more accurately , inclined him to his violent end
0	realizing that he had indeed come to , the landlady , who was peeking in from the doorway , closed it at once and hid
0	i said that you were afraid that he might
0	i have another one , a copper one ; it was lizaveta ’ s
0	you see how fine the weather is now ; let 's go for a ride and have a look at the town
0	worst of all , vanity , pride and vanity ; however , god only knows there might also be some good proclivities
0	is it that you ’ re following me and therefore you want me to know that ?
0	that world , after all , represents life 's mainstream
0	as far as bazarov 's concerned , please do not worry about it
0	he said , leaping in his direction
0	she had me invite you
0	they all clamber into mikolka ’ s cart with guffaws and wisecracks
0	they ’ ve brought in the prisoner , nikolai , someone ’ s voice was heard saying
0	i ’ ll grab zosimov , the doctor who ’ s treating him
0	that ’ s not completely true
0	why did you scream ?
0	have a tendency toward insanity
0	you boasted you were a philosopher , did not you ?
0	odintsov comes to say farewell to bazarov !
0	so , do you pray to god a great deal , sonya ?
0	what a thing to say !
0	tell them i will be there soon
0	after snatching the banknote from sonya , katerina ivanovna crumpled it in her hand and hurled it straight at luzhin ’ s face
0	so did you know that he , too , had left pledges there ?
0	she showed everyone dunechka ’ s handwritten letter to mr svidrigaylov , read it aloud , and even allowed people to make copies of it ( which , it seems to me , was going too far )
0	he thought once again about his late wife , not as he would known her through many years , not as a good , domestic housewife , but rather as a young girl with her slim figure , her innocent , inquisitive look , and her tightly knotted braid over her slender , childish neck
0	he invited kirsanov and bazarov to the ball and a few minutes later invited them again , taking them for brothers and referring to them as the kaisarovs
0	we ’ ve tormented you enough ; i don ’ t want to do so anymore !
0	but why are you being so underhanded now when you say , 'it 's a fine thing you do'—as if i did not know your views on marriage ?
0	the landlady was peering in from the half-opened door
0	take it to him tomorrow or
0	i ’ m too weak and will topple over any minute
0	and if they were to denounce him , then what for , exactly ?
0	why do you say very much ?
0	i can assure you that all this seriously interferes with my recovery , because it constantly irritates me
0	after an abrupt , fitful burst of laughter , raskolnikov suddenly became thoughtful and glum
0	that shows what i get for being tactful
0	there they are—our heirs !
0	he rushed to the little window
0	she was a small , dried-up miserable old woman , about sixty years old , with piercing , malicious little eyes , a small sharp nose , and her bare head
0	while all i know about myself is i am very unhappy
0	an exclusive military school in petersburg that enjoyed the tsar 's patronage
0	( several times during the last few days , raskolnikov had recalled fleetingly , in snatches , that scene with porfiry ; he couldn ’ t bear thinking about it as a whole )
0	exclaimed the student and burst into laughter
0	my board , raskolnikov stated loudly and distinctly
0	and how does it happen that you know my name ?
0	lives in a house that burns down every five years
0	he merely waited for a pretext to attack his enemy ; but for a long time no pretext presented itself
0	the hegelian dialectic explains the movement to overcome basic oppositions and dichotomies
0	all this is merely a phantom
0	father and son went onto the terrace under the awning ; next to the railing on the table , between large bouquets of lilacs , a samovar was already bubbling
0	he had never imagined that he would awake in such a state
0	that same morning , without tarrying , she set off right from our house to all the households in town , and in each one , shedding tears , she restored dunya ’ s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and behavior in the most flattering terms
0	anna sergeevna made an impatient movement
0	they were standing there waiting for something
0	and they were so pleased with him !
0	she was wearing her shabby old cape and her green shawl
0	arkady is capable of acting
0	it ’ s either me or luzhin
0	for a long time , sonya had grown accustomed to thinking the room was uninhabited
0	and really get to know each other well , agreed porfiry petrovich
0	later , after he 's grown used to me , arkady said indulgently , and the two friends left
0	he was not yet able to express it all , but he was trembling as if in a fever , as if a great weight had been lifted from his chest
0	where are you going ?
0	in any case i very much want there to be no misunderstandings about my intentions
0	i guess i thought it seemed too dark or too cold , hee-hee !
0	he himself said to me a while ago : take care of my sister
0	muttered porfiry , listening at the door
0	but the critics found it necessary to present me as a humiliated pamphleteer : leur siège était fait —and even this year i could read the following lines in appendix # to the cosmos ( p ) : finally everyone knows that the pedestal on which mr turgenev stood was destroyed chiefly by dobrolyubov and later ( p ) my bitterness is mentioned , which the critic , however , understands—
0	she said , sorting through the flowers with her fingers
0	of course , you know that already ; and i myself know that he came to see you afterward ; but what you supposed then didn ’ t really happen : i hadn ’ t sent for anybody and hadn ’ t made any arrangements at the time
0	why did he come here ?
0	for some people , it 's good ; for others , it 's not
0	let it depend on me
0	well , of course , he ’ s spinning an old wives ’ tale , lying like a dog , because i know this dushkin
0	ah , mama , how can he answer all these questions all of a sudden ?
0	time passes in strenuous efforts to puzzle out the vital enigma ; the intellect labors alongside the passions ; heavy , torturous sensations appear ; the whole romance of the relationship between a man and a woman takes on the strange character of a struggle
0	a ruble and a half !
0	dunechka ’ s eyes grew clear , and pulkheriya aleksandrovna even looked kindly at sonya
0	which way to your room ?
0	a reference to marie antoinette ( – ) , who was imprisoned in and executed the following year
0	the only sound was that of her intermittent sobbing
0	bazarov has emerged from this examination as a pure and a strong man
0	he was approaching the third floor
0	if you ’ re in complete control of your faculties , sir , i have thirty-five rubles to transfer to you , sir , since semyon semyonovich has received instructions from afanasy ivanovich , as he had previously , at your mother ’ s request
0	raskolnikov entered through the door again
0	and mama , why ’ s she splurging anyway ?
0	i ’ ve been here before , do you remember ?
0	go on , be witty !
0	as for wounded egoism , i will only note that dobrolyubov 's article about my last work before fathers and sons—
0	it 's true , there 's no shade , nikolai petrovich replied , wiping his brow
0	certain generalizations so reluctantly used by the adepts of our nihilism , which they flee and fear as the devil fears holy water , were nevertheless present at the conception of their theories
0	you really do have a poor opinion of russians
0	poison , pure poison , but i can ’ t stop !
0	that ’ s definitely the case
0	he quickly climbed the stairs , entered his unlocked room , and immediately fastened the door with the hook
0	the murderer was upstairs when kokh and pestryakov knocked , standing behind the locked door
0	i see that our shooting lessons in the country , which i had the honor of giving you , were not wasted
0	the body was there for so long
0	wrote chekhov on rereading the story called the dog
0	what will you say tomorrow ?
0	a painful feeling gripped his heart ; he stopped in the middle of the street and began looking around : what road was he on and how far had he come ?
0	razumikhin asked , suddenly turning to him
0	this is the final goal of our efforts !
0	it is at such moments , the narrator tells us , that odintseva thinks of life 's worthlessness and sorrow—but she is immediately checked in her thoughts by a cold draft from a half-open window
0	about certain extremely , extremely important matters
0	you , and you alone !
0	i did love you !
0	nastasya looked him over somewhat strangely
0	all last night your sister was talking in her sleep and kept mentioning you
0	odintseva and turgenev 's narrator manage , in this scene , both to observe propriety and to suggest its violation ; both point to an erotic imagination that was , in turgenev 's day , far more heavily veiled than in ours
0	along the way , one question troubled him especially : had svidrigaylov been to see porfiry ?
0	can ’ t i go with you ?
0	he apparently submits to every passing influence ; he is the most ordinary of mortals
0	well , good-bye for now
0	bazarov raised his eyes and looked at odintsova
0	running at full speed , she stumbled and fell
0	the author sees that bazarov loves no one , because around him all is petty , stupid , and flabby , while he himself is fresh , intelligent , and strong ; the author sees this and , in his mind , relieves his hero of the last undeserved reproach
0	that ’ s just what i was afraid of , that you wouldn ’ t need our reduction
0	she ’ s a good woman , very kind
0	does pavel petrovich believe or not ?
0	some sort of peculiar sadness had begun to manifest itself in him lately
0	turgenev did not grow fond of bazarov , but he acknowledged his strength and his superiority and offered him a full tribute of respect
0	that doesn ’ t matter , sir , replied porfiry petrovich , receiving this explanation of raskolnikov ’ s finances coldly
0	the troika of horses rushed on ahead , the driver whooping and whistling at them
0	passion that resembled malice and was perhaps even related to it
0	how could you keep from fainting ?
0	excuse me for being late to tea ; i will be right back
0	not for anything in the world would he have gone back now to the chest or even entered that room
0	but then , glancing into the kitchen and catching sight of a bucket half full of water sitting on a bench , he decided to rinse off his hands and the axe
0	vasily ivanovich accompanied italy 's struggle for independence from austria and for national unification was frequently discussed in the russian press during the s
0	she loves music , but does not believe in romantic love songs ( [ ] )
0	and just who are you ?
0	nor did his sense of multivalent truth and personal liberalism blind him to the indispensable role of conflict in the life of the individual and society
0	apparently bazarov , who so easily meets people , takes such lively interest in them , and so easily begins to feel rancor toward them , suffers more from that rancor than those for whom it is destined
0	i see you have made some changes in here , he added , casting a quick glance around , his eyes gliding past fenechka 's face
0	her slightly narrow shoulders she was constantly blushing and hastily catching her breath
0	some kind of insatiable compassion , if it ’ s possible to express it like that , was suddenly reflected in all the features of her face
0	everything went flying and splintering
0	it is not a difficult thing to write a novel with a progressive or reactionary tendency
0	one of the convicts , accompanied by a guard , went off to the fortress to fetch a certain tool ; another began to split firewood and load the kiln
0	i will be prepared to agree with you later , he said standing up , when you present me with a single institution of contemporary life , the kalmucks ( or kalmyks ) were an asian people and a branch of the mongols
0	( because some benefactors very much like to show off their charity ; i know this )
0	the weather that morning was rainy , so there was no possibility of an outing
0	raskolnikov was laughing so hard that it seemed he could scarcely restrain himself , so they entered porfiry petrovich ’ s apartment with laughter
0	raskolnikov was an active and bold advocate for sonya against luzhin , in spite of the fact that he carried so much of his own distress and suffering in his soul
0	suddenly , in her last letter , sonya wrote that he had fallen very ill and was in the convicts ’ ward in the hospital
0	he realized that this was the best tactic in his situation because then he wouldn ’ t say anything he ’ d regret later ; on the contrary , he ’ d irritate his foe with his silence and perhaps porfiry might even say something he ’ d come to regret later
0	what do you mean , why ?
0	you almost convinced him all over again of that hideous nonsense and then , all of a sudden—you stuck out your tongue at him : aha , you said , so there !
0	but go now and stay with our mother
0	in the present paper , i propose first of all to follow brown 's and thanet 's lead by examining ottsy i deti in light of the hegelian dialectic and then to speculate on the actual source and significance of the dialectic patterns to be observed in turgenev 's novel
0	how did i dare part with those twenty kopecks ?
0	she had approached almost silently and sat down alongside him
0	then again , the air here 's so fresh !
0	he goes to the country to see odintsov , with curiosity and without the slightest fear , because he wants to have a closer look at this pretty woman , wants to be with her and to spend a few days pleasantly
0	what a daring lady !
0	perhaps the difference between generations has never been as great as it is at the present , and therefore their relationship too appears to be particularly acute
0	it wo not be long before bazarov undertakes a second round of visits to the kirsanov estate at marino and odintsova 's manor house at nikolskoe , and then returns home in despair , to join his father in his palliative measures , in which pursuit the hero ultimately loses ( sacrifices ? )
0	squinting , he looked at him very seriously
0	what do you need them for , katerina ivanovna ?
0	now let 's go have tea
0	however , she probably is
0	when she appeared at their work sites , going to see raskolnikov , or when she happened to meet a group of convicts on their way to work , they all doffed their caps and bowed to her : little mother , sofiya semyonovna , you ’ re our mother , dear and tender little mother !
0	he didn ’ t have the slightest idea , and he didn ’ t want to think about it
0	what good 's that logic ?
0	perhaps you should thank god ; how do you know ?
0	do you know svidrigaylov ?
0	yes , covered in blood
0	you also have the sort of sister who would sell herself into slavery for her brother
0	and you , nastenka , look in on him more often in my absence , to see if he wants something more to drink or anything else
0	i ’ m so angry and annoyed that in explaining the system i mentioned to you prematurely these natural necessities !
0	there was a window on the first floor ; moonlight was shining through the glass mournfully and mysteriously ; here ’ s the second floor
0	take her , brother , take her
0	i should have gone into petrovsky park !
0	now i want to sleep
0	i myself told you recently that i was leaving , andrey semyonovich , while you were still trying to detain me ; now i ’ ll add simply that you ’ re a fool , sir
0	which one we are to value more highly remains entirely unclear
0	so much for your funeral feast !
0	i offered to assist as best i could with the young girl ’ s education , arranging french and dancing lessons
0	please—perhaps you ’ re in a hurry—be so kind as to give me a few moments of your time
0	it 's not what he says , but the way he looks at me
0	he made no reply
0	and arkady told him the story of his uncle
0	this woman 's kingdom participates in turgenev 's allegorical topography as a world submitted to an authority that is absolute even in absence of its central figure : a husband who was old enough to be odintseva 's father
0	the novel appeared exactly a century and a quarter ago , and it was appropriate that its contemporary readers should have taken as central what was most topical in it : nihilism ( defined in dahl 's dictionary as a monstrous and immoral teaching that rejects everything that can not be palpated ) , together with the revolutionary temperament of bazarov
0	he speaks , moreover , of the continuity of generations not only for the future but from the past ; in stanza he writes of the oak tree which will outlive his age as it has outlived those of his fathers
0	it was as if she still didn ’ t understand
0	you ’ re not amal-ivan , but amaliya lyudvigovna , and since i don ’ t belong to the group of your vile flatterers , like mr lebezya­tnikov , who ’ s now laughing behind the door—the sound of laughter was coming from behind the door , as well as shouts of they ’ re squabbling ! —then i will always call you amaliya lyudvigovna , though i really can ’ t understand why you don ’ t like that name
0	she was placed on the granite blocks of the stairs
0	i do not want you to draw the conclusion from that that i am a courageous fellow
0	bazarov would get up very early and head off two or three miles , not for a stroll—he could not stand strolls without a purpose— but to collect grasses and insects
0	there is not a single clear trait in him and the only good thing is that he is a man , though a very simple man
0	at the time , i didn ’ t tell marfa petrovna
0	pavel petrovich burned with impatience ; at last his wishes were fulfilled
0	you ’ ll do ’ er in !
0	of course , there are enthusiasms , inaccuracies , but one must be indulgent : enthusiasms bear witness to their fervor for action and to incorrect external circumstances in which the matter is placed
0	why did i consciously assume all these torments ?
0	now it ’ s the kingdom of reason and light , and
0	if that desire appears as rancor , that rancor only represents the reverse of love
0	but only a poet would exploit light imagery as bazarov does in his final speech : he says to odincova , be good to my parents , you will not find any like them in your world even if you look by daylight with a candle
0	that ’ s the degree to which some young women feel a passion for propaganda !
0	he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart , as if not thinking about his words or weighing them
0	sonya asked , feeling extremely frightened
0	and as for socks and the remaining items , i leave that to you ; we still have twenty-five rubles , and don ’ t you worry about paying pashenka the rent for the apartment ; i told her your credit was limitless
0	he felt so confused and bewildered that when he got there he threw himself on the sofa ; he sat for a quarter of an hour merely resting , trying somehow or other to collect his thoughts
0	of any sort of faith or conviction , even artistic conviction , among the younger french writers he was encountering in paris
0	sonya , i have a wicked heart , take note of that : that can explain a great deal
0	well , now he ’ s come around !
0	i am not at all surprised , pavel petrovich replied
0	do you know what i am thinking ?
0	there you have tendentiousness !
0	well , some of us who ’ ve just begun to practice medicine come to love our first patients as if they were our own children ; some of them almost fall in love with them
0	to some of his comrades it seemed that he regarded them , everyone , from on high , as children , as if he ’ d surpassed them in his development , knowledge , and convictions , and regarded their convictions and interests as beneath him
0	no , you can be honest with me ; don ’ t be shy ; speak as if we were alone !
0	nikolai 's great love , marya ( née pre-polovenskaya ) , in whose honor the estate at marino is named , was the julia kristeva , women 's time , in the kristeva reader , ed
0	i feel sorry for papa !
0	in addition , she knew about his vanity , arrogance , self-esteem , and lack of faith
0	no one saw him , replied razumikhin with annoyance
0	a piece of meat 's better than a piece of bread , even from the chemical point of view
0	bazarov 's voice rang out from the coach
0	everyone rejoiced , and within five minutes they were all laughing
0	mikolka ’ s so furious that he can ’ t finish her off with one blow
0	above all , one must do one 's duty so , you want the horses sent on ?
0	no , you wait ; i ’ ll pose a question to you
0	it wo not be easy
0	he lets it happen to other people
0	yet actually something of a demonic order does emerge in turgenev 's work , that is , a figure rich in force , though that force is not pure
0	the building ’ s as crowded as noah ’ s ark , the head clerk observed , overhearing the conversation from where he sat
0	then it turns out , once more , of course , that you have to keep yourself clean
0	and he starts to amass what he needs for his campaign
0	well , if you like , i ’ ll prove to you at once , he roared , that you have white eyelashes only as a result of the fact that ivan the great ’ s bell tower is two hundred and fifty feet tall , and i ’ ll prove it clearly , precisely , progressively , and even with a liberal cast
0	at first vasily ivanovich was overjoyed by this change , but his joy was short-lived
0	you can be as indignant as you please with people like bazarov , but you absolutely must acknowledge their sincerity
0	you ’ re not worth her little finger , all of you , all , all , all of you !
0	( he was , apparently , in an excellent mood and even a little bit overexcited )
0	it entails a shift from scenes and formulations essentially intellectual to others that are more ruminative , inwardly speculative , communicating psychological states and feelings rather than ideas
0	i was lying there at the time
0	well , and how was i behaving toward you just a little while ago ( that is , as the examining magistrate ) , when i prompted you and offered you all the means for your defense , providing all that psychology : illness , i said , delirium , insults ; melancholy and policemen , and all the rest ?
0	that ’ s really why i ’ ve come
0	besides that , you were interested in your sock , very much so !
0	in , the austrian army , commanded by general mack , surrendered to napoleon
0	precisely so , ma ’ am ; of course , not without some purpose , taking into account the hastiness of his departure and , in general , the previous circumstances
0	but it was only when i started to imagine that
0	but now—it ’ s insolent and careless !
0	allen calls the latter group realists ( in a narrow and specific sense ; as distinguished from realists in a broader sense )
0	anna sergeevna gave an involuntary shudder
0	dunya ’ s eyes shone with fury
0	let 's go see my sister ; she 's out in the garden ; she will be very glad to see you
0	and he had agreed with sonya at the time , agreed himself , agreed in his heart , that he could no longer go on living alone with this thing in his soul !
0	they determined to wait and endure
0	are they dead to the world or did someone strangle them ?
0	by the way , just about the same time , his brother became an officer in a guards regiment
0	that is , not to
0	he would sooner admit to only the heavy burden of instinct , which he was unable to breach and which he once more lacked the strength to surmount ( due to his weakness and insignificance )
0	svidrigaylov shouted in horror , raising his hand as if to strike her
0	we may have plenty of ideas , he said , turning to petr petrovich , and a desire for the good , though it ’ s childlike
0	who are you , and why did you come here ?
0	in fact , cyclical time is the only mode that the author credits—
0	that ’ s it , isn ’ t it ?
0	take that poor katya—did you see her ?
0	well , it ’ s not bad as a little theory ; une théorie comme une autre
0	why , i understand your spiritual state , that is , at that time
0	a young girl appeared , the one who would been the first to greet the travelers on the porch the night before
0	i ask you , really !
0	we are not karl v and do not wish to be buried alive
0	the characters surrounding bazarov unconsciously feel the living man in him
0	somewhere there , almost at the end of the prospect , he noticed , recently having passed by , a large wooden hotel , the name of which , as best he recalled , was something like the adrianople
0	trust me in this matter and believe that i can reach an unbiased conclusion
0	svidrigaylov sat down on the sofa , about eight paces away from dunya
0	i have already told you i am a future district doctor
0	tell me , sir , do you feel sorry or not ?
0	while there is only a limited amount of evidence to go on , it seems clear to me that marya participates in what kristeva calls cyclical time : she is connected to themes of nature through her garden and to gestation through the birth of her child
0	she ’ s a fool , he said aloud
0	when he read this note , his heart started beating violently and painfully
0	he muttered and rushed into the entrance hall
0	he told me all about you
0	to establish her identity , she needed a cause or a path , rather than just a man
0	he shouted , pushing to the front of the crowd
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna exchanged glances with dunechka and razumikhin
0	in any case , dunya clearly saw that pulkheriya aleksandrovna was not in her right mind
0	classical , replied arkady in the same tone of voice
0	that ’ s how rich we are !
0	at last everyone was seated
0	dunya went up to the table to take the key
0	but the sage replied , how in 'ell should i know—versts ai not counted 'ereabouts ,
0	you don ’ t even believe , she whispered quietly , almost gasping for breath
0	you said , 'russia will attain perfection when the poorest peasant has a house like that and each one of us should help bring that about
0	have they fed the children ?
0	it 's that signor , that nihilist who 's been stuffing his head full of these things
0	but turgenev hardly even skirts these failings , and he is never mediocre ; his texture is as distinguished as his temperament
0	there 's absolutely no need for you to insult me
0	you ’ re talking about that young woman !
0	but her loosened hair , her fair blond hair , was wet ; a garland of roses was on her head
0	so that ’ s how it is !
0	this gentleman was about thirty , stout , plump , hale and hearty , with pink lips , a little mustache , and very foppishly dressed
0	raskolnikov sat there , as if not paying any attention , in deep thought and with a strange smile on his pale lips
0	i ordered it now to fortify myself because i plan to go somewhere , and you see me in a peculiar frame of mind
0	but he knows everything
0	she sat next to her son as before ( she did not play cards ) , resting her cheek on her little fist as before , and stood up only to arrange for some new delicacy to be served
0	to be precise , bazarov had not gone home in three years
0	you ’ ve hardly had anything to eat or drink in the last three days
0	i especially wish you good health
0	remember how you used to argue with him all the time ?
0	i ’ m a neighbor , sir
0	i love it when they tell lies !
0	did you ever suspect it ?
0	is it physics you are studying ?
0	oh , enough of that !
0	it ’ s a fever , he replied abruptly
0	thus even where there is no comic element , no parody , no irony and so forth , where there is no narrator , no posited author or narrating character , speech diversity and language stratification still serve as the basis for style in the novel
0	it 's terrible for me to have to say this to you ; but it 's even more terrible to it 's forever , evgeny just think what that would be like
0	all around , of course , laughter resounded
0	they ’ d think i done it
0	she asked in a weak voice
0	to his question , would i seat sofiya semyonovna next to my sister ?
0	would you like something to eat ?
0	bazarov said , dragging out his words
0	svidrigaylov asked suddenly in alarm
0	i fainted then because it was stuffy and smelled of oil paint , said raskolnikov
0	i just have a foreboding , dunya
0	but there were also some people who were not drunk ; they came in from the other rooms and gathered together
0	agafokleya kuzminishna followed soon afterward : she could not get used to the dull life in the capital—she was consumed by the ennui of retirement
0	he praises turgenev as a great poet—time can never take away the beauty of his language and the poetry in his work—but finds his vision weak and narrow
0	in fact , shreds of the fringe he had cut off his trousers were lying there on the floor in the middle of the room , so that the first person who came in would notice them !
0	raskolnikov began to say
0	it ’ s separate , on its own , and doesn ’ t connect with any other rooms ; it ’ s three small furnished rooms , and the rent is modest
0	tell me the whole truth !
0	i do not doubt we are determined to annihilate each other ; but why not laugh and combine utile with dulci ?
0	yes , all my capital , he replied firmly , after a slight pause
0	she jumped up and , trembling , looked at him
0	but at that very moment he woke up
0	phew , the devil take him
0	the real cause of all this newness was the feeling in bazarov inspired by odintsova—a feeling that tormented and enraged him , one that he would have denied immediately with scornful laughter and cynical abuse , had anyone ever remotely suggested the possibility of what was actually taking place
0	you never said that !
0	we talked about this many times
0	let ’ s suppose that he , that is , this man , our special case , sir , this incognito , sir , will lie brilliantly , in the cleverest way ; this might seem to be a triumph , and he could enjoy the fruits of his wit , but , all of a sudden , bang , he falls into a faint in the most interesting and scandalous place
0	at the end of the novel , she is living in heidelberg , locked into an endless pursuit of some new telos , studying architecture , yet still hobnobbing with students , especially young russian devotees of the natural sciences ( just like bazarov )
0	i notice that you ’ ve begun listening very attentively
0	we ’ ll see if there ’ s truth to be had on this earth
0	it played this role not only because of its idyllic prophecies but because of its reply to the affirmation in fathers and sons of love and continuity between generations
0	it ’ s not a good idea to remind women about such little things
0	i ’ d consider myself fortunate if you , pulkheriya aleksandrovna , could convince me of the opposite view and thus set my mind at ease considerably
0	paris , march ( ) , dear fedor mikhailovich :
0	arkady nikolaich , vasily ivanych prompted her solemnly in a loud whisper
0	i am all they have
0	i ’ d be interested in knowing how you would now resolve one question , as lebezyatnikov says
0	it is not secenov as a kind of urfigur for bazarov , but rather secenov 's language of facts that is significant for understanding turgenev 's novelistic practice
0	kind we ourselves possess ?
0	so , what of it ?
0	how come he does not ask me why i am leaving , and just as suddenly as he is ?
0	this is only my third day in town
0	hello , fenechka , he muttered through his teeth
0	why did you come then ?
0	but you are free to
0	what , is it really starting , is this the punishment beginning ?
0	how old 's your father ?
0	amaliya ivanovna , when the glass had hit her amidst sounds of loud laughter from those present , had also been unable to stand being made a scapegoat
0	do you not yourself realize that he is the most sympathetic of all my characters ?
0	in honor of your arrival , my dear
0	he found arkady at the writing table with a book in his hands , his jacket buttoned up to his neck
0	she brought him some tea and bread
0	asked pulkheriya aleksandrovna , almost in tears
0	i could ’ ve reached that conclusion
0	you say that they ’ ve even invited me ?
0	so , you have decided to teach me a lesson , have you ?
0	she ’ s lost her mind !
0	as a matter of fact , at the same time they very often fail to notice the genuinely new people , § and even despise them as backward and incapable of higher thinking
0	while in ventnor , in august , we know that turgenev conceived his greatest hero , bazarov
0	much we need nihilists !
0	the constantly flustered and anxious-to-please sitnikov 's eyes are small and seemed squeezed in a fixed and uneasy look
0	pavel petrovich said , glancing around
0	no , she won ’ t endure it ; such people are unable to endure something like this !
0	ah , what a nitwit !
0	she ’ s wearing red calico , a headdress trimmed with beads , and fur slippers ; she ’ s cracking nuts and cackling
0	and it makes me feel guilty to shut myself away from him
0	he felt neither pain nor shame he would never even allow the possibility of comparison between his wife and fenechka , but regretted that she would come to look for him
0	said pulkheriya aleksandrovna , touched
0	you keep laughing ; allow me to observe that it ’ s not very appropriate
0	everyone saw : i ’ m just repeating what everyone else says
0	but how is it that arkady nikolaevich told us just now you do not acknowledge any authorities ?
0	sitting next to bazarov in the coach , arkady squeezed his hand warmly and for a long time said nothing
0	i could deny you that pleasure , but—so be it !
0	you see , sonya , i decided that perhaps it ’ d be more advantageous this way
0	even though this matter was conducted without your advice , you probably won ’ t bear any grudge either against me or your sister , since you yourself will see , from the facts , that it was impossible to delay or wait for your answer to arrive
0	the worst service that turgenev rendered bazarov consists in his having punished him with typhus because he did not know how to come to terms with him
0	a strange idea had emerged in his head , like a baby chick pecking its way out of its egg , and it interested him greatly
0	personality , my dear sir , that 's the main thing ; human personality must be solid as a rock because everything 's built upon it
0	did i tie the bandage too tight around your leg ?
0	but with unnatural strength he managed to lean on his arm
0	dmitry prokofich will help us prepare for the journey
0	but who ’ s to say that she hasn ’ t already lost her mind ?
0	i won ’ t allow you to torment me !
0	you could have dreamt all this raving in your sleep , and that ’ s all there is to it , sir !
0	this feeling , an involuntary antipathy toward this tenor of thought , he presented to the reading public in a specimen as ungraceful as possible
0	because as i stated to you before , i consider myself obligated to provide an explanation
0	that ’ s what dunya wants to arrange and i agree with her completely
0	lebezya­tnikov cried passionately , regarding him severely with his shortsighted little eyes
0	they would console her , humor her ( she herself , perhaps , clearly saw that they were humoring her and merely consoling her ) , but still she talked
0	and pangs of conscience ?
0	and yet silence on the first as on the second question has , it seems to me , its reason in realistic basis
0	i want you to !
0	it ’ s as if i ’ m looking at you from a thousand miles away
0	what was to become of fenechka ?
0	vasily ivanovich 's voice rang out at that very moment , and the old army doctor appeared before the young men , dressed in a homemade linen jacket , wearing a homemade straw hat
0	dostoevsky called kukshina that progressive louse which turgenev combed out of russian reality
0	buried beneath the ground has finally come to terms with permanent reality
0	i am very glad , he began , and grateful you have decided to visit us ; i hope that
0	when did you find time for that ?
0	but he recalled their last visit , the chilly reception , his previous awkwardness , and was overcome by timidity
0	but pavel is dead anyway , and we can say that this novel has two deaths
0	in general it 's not worth missing people , especially me
0	the old witch stays at home all year , mopes around , her feet ache , and now , all of a sudden , she picks up and goes out for a stroll !
0	but to what degree ?
0	she wasn ’ t in her right mind when she said it ; she was agitated , sick , and the children were crying because they hadn ’ t eaten , and she said it more as an insult than as what she really meant
0	i was one of the first to learn , and i even came to tell you that arkady ivanovich svidrigaylov , not long after his spouse ’ s funeral , set off at once for petersburg
0	he regarded raskolnikov out of the corner of his eye , in part with indignation : his apparel was too disgraceful and , in spite of all his wretchedness , his behavior didn ’ t fit his dress ; raskolnikov , with a lack of care , stared at him so directly and for so long that the officer felt offended
0	at long last , a firm knock on the door roused him
0	moreover , pushkin 's poetry is an important presence in fathers and sons : as a thematic element , as an emotional vector , as an emblem for the existence of beauty
0	i have just had a splendid idea
0	at least , that was the way he understood it
0	bazarov merely inhaled on his pipe
0	he silently opened the door of the carriage and unfastened the apron of the coach
0	showing it to father aleksei , he constantly repeated , just look at those roots !
0	the light wheels came closer and closer ; now he could even hear horses snorting vasily ivanovich jumped up and rushed to the small window
0	little lidochka cried out , rushed to polyenka , hugged her , and started trembling all over
0	arina vlasevna did not go to bed either ; leaving the door to the study slightly open , she kept going in to see how enyusha was breathing and to have a look at vasily ivanovich
0	what kind of woman can he love ?
0	are you a student ?
0	he asked in somewhat of a rude manner
0	everyone was suddenly quiet
0	after waiting a little while , he added , why would not you ?
0	and kept talking about a march across the alps
0	there 's a little village graveyard in one remote corner of russia
0	he said , looking at sonya and laughing
0	it all began with his expressing a desire through her that he wished to make our acquaintance ; he was received properly , had some coffee , and the next day sent a letter in which he very politely stated his proposal and asked for a swift and definitive answer
0	men will never penetrate deeper than that
0	now , one more thing : did anyone see nikolai at the time that kokh and pestryakov were heading upstairs ?
0	in an important essay entitled women 's time julia kristeva describes three concepts of temporality , the first two of which , she argues , are related to female subjectivity
0	petr petrovich immediately took heart
0	if a worker found pleasure in spending his free time lying on his back and gazing at the walls and ceiling of his workshop , then every sensible man would say to him : gaze on , dear friend , stare as much as you please , it wo not harm your health but do not you spend your working hours staring or you will make mistakes
0	i stopped by and your room was wide open ; i looked around , waited a bit , and didn ’ t even tell your servant—then i left
0	i can give you a ride
0	so there must also be blood in my pocket , because i shoved the damp purse into it !
0	we physiologists understand all that
0	that raskolnikov ’ s a rascal !
0	he shuddered with delight
0	at last he tore himself away
0	yet your search for bazarov—the real one—
0	continued porfiry petrovich , examining his room
0	he does not fall in love with her suddenly ; he does not yield to passion , as bazarov does , nor to a fascination with the mysterious and romantic , as pavel petrovich once yielded to his sphinx , the elusive princess r
0	she roared with laughter
0	back to the hospital
0	a guard managed to come between him and his would-be murderer just in time—or else blood would have been shed
0	he is not a hateful being who repels through his shortcomings ; on the contrary , his gloomy figure is grandiose and attractive
0	this is hardly surprising , since turgenev is in fact doing what seem to be contradictory things within the work
0	however , here ’ s what i ’ ll add : you can judge for yourself how base or honest i am !
0	i ’ m so grateful to you , sir , and these orphans , sir , and my late mother , sonya said hurriedly
0	do you know , rodion romanych , what the word suffering ’ means for some of these people ?
0	they do not pay their quitrent
0	that worthless general will lose his job , you ’ ll see !
0	he didn ’ t even know that a new life would not be granted to him for nothing , that he still had to pay a great deal for it , to purchase it with some great future deed
0	you have to have permission to play a barrel organ ; but you ’ re doing this on your own and gathering a crowd of people
0	are you really such a dissembler ?
0	anna sergeevna did not like visiting the place ever since she would seen a grass snake there ; but katya came often to sit on a large stone bench under one of the niches
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna started to say , giving razumikhin ’ s hands another squeeze , but raskolnikov interrupted her again
0	ah… he said , indicating her with unease
0	zat iss how it iss pleeze
0	the younger lad said enthusiastically
0	arkady cast a quick glance at his father
0	where had he gone ?
0	nevertheless , one must encourage it all—english washstands , that 's real progress !
0	since chekhov equally stresses both the existence-and-worth of the human potential and the inevitability of its non-realization , he can be sharply and equally distinguished on the diachronic axis from two groups of authors : ( a ) his predecessors ( and many contemporaries ) in literature and drama , who share with him only the high valuation of human potential , and ( b ) his successors ( notably the absurd playwrights and authors ) , who share with him only the sense of its inevitable non-realization
0	her image , an incomprehensible , almost meaningless , but enchanting image , had penetrated his soul too deeply
0	sometimes it ’ s even boring
0	arkady 's response to this comment , as to all that follows , is denial :
0	with a part in your hair , rings on your fingers—you ’ re a wealthy man !
0	nature isn ’ t taken into account ; nature ’ s banished ; nature ’ s not allowed !
0	but can he really be intervening on his brother 's behalf ?
0	and why were you ringing the doorbell ?
0	if he ’ d wanted to consider it for a while , then of course he ’ d be astounded at how he was able to speak to them that way just a minute ago , and even impose his own feelings on them
0	but he still resolved to remain silent and not utter one word until it was time
0	do you happen to know him ?
0	wait a bit , we will remake you
0	two months ago i had the pleasure of reading it in periodical discourses
0	thanks to the governing senate !
0	complete silence reigned in the room
0	he himself had even started to converse with them , and they ’ d replied to him politely
0	i have been certain of that since our first meeting
0	he offers you ten thousand , and he himself says that he ’ s not rich
0	some regard pleasure as a final goal ; others are compelled to acknowledge pleasure as a very important source of the strength necessary for work
0	it smells so good !
0	wouldn ’ t you like a drive ?
0	katerina ivanovna heard sonya out pretentiously and , with the same pretentiousness , inquired about petr petrovich ’ s health
0	for several long hours he kept imagining in fits that right now , without putting it off , he must go somewhere and throw it all away , get rid of it , at once , as soon as possible !
0	but i ’ m not a priest
0	you even blushed ; especially when they invited you to dinner , you blushed deeply
0	greater novelists are more uneven : they betray our belief with extravagances ; they bore or they fall into bathos ; they combine poetic vision with rubbish
0	evgeny vasilich , forgive me , but i did not ask you here to discuss textbooks
0	i won ’ t even mention those concerns , which you can guess
0	so what of it ?
0	only there should be a signed receipt , sir
0	but this proud , suppressed enthusiasm is dangerous in youth !
0	the magnanimous agitation of his young feelings , his nobility and purity are emphasized by the author with great finesse and are clearly depicted
0	because everyone has to have somewhere to go
0	i drink because i genuinely want to suffer !
0	i did it to hoodwink them
0	she became distracted , replied in an absentminded manner , and finally suggested they move into the main hall , where they found the princess and katya
0	what a task you ’ re setting , cried porfiry with an absolutely cheerful , crafty , and completely untroubled look
0	i have a different aim
0	do they know i went back to the apartment ?
0	knowing myself , having had a premonition about myself , how did i dare take an axe and get stained with blood ?
0	that means is well known—it ’ s flattery
0	the fact is that turgenev , evidently , looks with no great favor on his hero
0	don ’ t worry , rodion romanovich
0	why here ’ s her rodya , her precious rodya , her firstborn !
0	you ’ re in a government office , too , raskolnikov cried , and not only are you shouting , but you ’ re also smoking a cigarette and being impolite to all of us
0	perhaps a similar one also occurred between us at our first meeting ; but at that time
0	it ’ s the fever again !
0	a schiller , a russian schiller , an absolute schiller !
0	you don ’ t notice that , in your agitated state , you yourself blurt everything out to me and to others
0	could that be possible ?
0	his heart skipped a beat , his feet wouldn ’ t budge , and he felt rooted to the spot
0	svidrigaylov suddenly burst out laughing
0	i still hadn ’ t decided whether i would take the money or not , he said , once more as if in deep thought ; then , coming to his senses suddenly , he smiled quickly and briefly
0	and she can ’ t have changed that much now !
0	i am beginning to agree with my uncle , said arkady
0	one can even find integrity , in spite of all the swindlers who ’ ve turned up among us , but there ’ s still no efficacy !
0	let him die peacefully !
0	he 's looking well , sir , said the old man and grinned again , but knit his thick brows immediately
0	some people even reject the idea of children , like any other indication of family life
0	commendable ; well , sir , continue
0	and you , you can stop by , too , if you like
0	one can ’ t just
0	i ’ m not the one with absurd dreams
0	the fiery revolutionary agitator bakunin , who had just then escaped from siberia to london , was saying something of this kind : the entire rotten structure , the corrupt old world , must be razed to the ground , before something new can be built upon it ; what this is to be is not for us to say ; we are revolutionaries , our business is to demolish
0	his life , wasted by his pursuit of a mysterious woman , of course resembles that of so many turgenev heroes , if not of turgenev himself
0	pavel petrovich sees that bazarov does not allow him to predominate over himself and this arouses in him a feeling of vexation on which he seizes as a diversion amidst the profound boredom of country life
0	the police , for example ?
0	he looked at her with an indescribable expression
0	it is quite noteworthy that he is more russian , so to speak , than all the rest of the characters in the novel
0	she was very surprised that this time razumikhin was speaking about petr petrovich so cautiously , even with what seemed to be some respect
0	do you find it amusing ?
0	there must have been a great many of them ; almost the entire building had come running
0	it is perhaps the hardest subject of all to handle , as the reaction to the end of war and peace with its assertion of domestic permanence , and , in fathers and sons , the quick taming of arkady kirsanov prove : the world of struggle and aspiration is more interesting to contemplate than that of fixity and acceptance
0	everyone has to have somewhere to go
0	as for the flies in these sweet little houses—ugh !
0	he might have to give himself up to save her from taking some careless step
0	the protagonist is atypical , being far from already formed
0	raskolnikov loved these places primarily , just as he did all the nearest lanes , when he would walk the streets aimlessly
0	their love bursts forth like some sort of lightning , for a moment striking the reader
0	he tried to flee , but the entire entryway was filled with people , the door to the staircase was open , and on the landing , the staircase , and below—stood a crowd of people , side by side , everyone looking , but everyone quiet , all waiting , all silent !
0	yes , indeed , sitnikov replied quickly , emitting a shrill laugh
0	i ’ ll run to the reading room today and ask for that issue !
0	in her hands she held a basket filled with flowers
0	everyone 's well , i hope
0	two minutes later , nastasya returned with some soup and declared that tea would be ready shortly
0	even two of them , replied raskolnikov
0	marfa petrovna ’ s kind enough to visit me , he said , curling his mouth into a strange smile
0	but that 's not the point
0	gentlemen , we could answer , why should turgenev 's personal sensations concern you ?
0	this extra cleanliness costs money , do you understand ?
0	yes , that ’ s it , games !
0	raskolnikov went to the door , but she grabbed hold of him and , with a desperate glance , looked him in the eye
0	could it be that he was eavesdropping ?
0	why involve him in this ?
0	but enough , otherwise i too will become verbose
0	as soon as the door closed after her , the sick man tossed off his blanket and jumped out of bed like a madman
0	he was also trembling all over
0	ah , you are making fun she will treat us to a bottle of champagne
0	was run over by a careless cart as he lay sleeping in the middle of the road [ editor ]
0	i am to blame , she muttered aloud ,
0	and so , to hell with all of you , because there ’ s some sort of mystery here , some secret ; i don ’ t intend to rack my brains over your secrets
0	kitty learns this , and rapidly becomes wise in her prosaic love because she has absorbed these lessons from her own wonderful family , much as arkady achieves a wise happiness when he trusts the truths he absorbed from the rhythms of life at marino
0	do not you want to become a doctor ?
0	we stopped at the persian king cyrus the great¶ then , once she was older , she read some books of romantic content as well as several others , given to her by mr lebezyatnikov
0	therefore , porfiry had found out about the apartment only now , just now , and hadn ’ t even known about it before
0	he 's seen as far too generous by both sides
0	is it in russian ?
0	we ’ ll keep that in mind , young lady
0	bazarov , he adds , is what parents today see emerging in their sons and daughters , sisters in their brothers
0	she whispered hurriedly , dropping her eyes again
0	seeing that his attempt to accuse sonya had failed completely , he resorted directly to effrontery
0	everything , even his crime , even his sentence and exile , now seemed to him , on first impulse , as some sort of external , strange facts that hadn ’ t even happened to him
0	or is it a clever trick ?
0	namely , it ’ s my opinion that money must not be given directly to katerina ivanovna : it ’ s dangerous ; the evidence for that is the funeral feast planned for today
0	no , well , i did , only once , six years ago
0	raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had just stood up
0	but not today , please not today !
0	that ’ s why i wanted you to come with me yesterday , because you ’ re all i have left
0	there was about an hour left before breakfast ; the dewy morning had already been replaced by the hot day
0	oh , yes : she ’ s talking and shouting that since everyone ’ s deserted her now , she ’ ll take the children and go out onto the street with a barrel organ ; the children will sing and dance , and she will , too ; they ’ ll collect money and go to the general ’ s window to play every day
0	yes , sirs , allow me to pass !
0	matvei ilich received arkady with the generosity—we might even say , playfulness—
0	a journal , my friend , is full o ’ pictures , colored ones , and they come to the local tailor ’ s every saturday , in the mail , from abroad , and they show how to dress , both for men and the same for women
0	i have to find that out right away , from the moment i enter , to tell by his face ; o-ther-wise
0	until the right time comes , i don ’ t want to say anything to anyone ; i ’ m even a little sorry that i told you
0	what are you doing ?
0	sitnikov asked whether avdotya nikitishna was at home
0	in the first case , you ’ re a human being ; but in the second , you ’ re only a parrot !
0	if you like , we ’ ll go see them—but not now
0	it ’ s an item
0	of course , he was unable and didn ’ t even want to worry about his unhealthy condition
0	in essence , matvei ilich had not progressed much beyond those statesmen of alexander i , who , to prepare themselves for an evening at madame svechina's—living in petersburg at the time—would read energy is the primary quality of a statesman ( french )
0	bazarov's—appearance , the author treated him critically objectively
0	i ’ ve already met with them ; i ’ ve been wasting time here for the last two days ; i recognize them , and they seem to know me
0	perhaps , instead of a voyage , i ’ ll get married ; they ’ re trying to find me a bride
0	the consequence was that in writing about literature oftener than not
0	yes , the germans are our teachers in this regard , bazarov replied casually
0	nor am i used to luxury
0	bazarov goes home for six weeks to settle down to work
0	it ’ s all the same ; two days ago
0	i was tempted by his money , but i swear to you , brother—i never imagined that he was such an unworthy human being
0	and while katerina ivanovna is a generous woman , she ’ s unjust
0	it ’ s clear : she wouldn ’ t sell herself on her own , for her own comfort , even to save herself from death , but she would sell herself for someone else !
0	she merely lifted her free left arm ever so slightly , nowhere near her face , and slowly extended it toward him , as if pushing him away
0	every man ’ s entitled , i hope , to defend his own person
0	in reply to pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s anxious and timid question concerning certain suspicions regarding his sanity , he replied with a calm and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated ; that , of course , the patient had a certain idée fixe , something indicating monomania—he , zosimov , was now pursuing this extremely interesting branch of medicine—but it must be recalled that almost up until today the patient had been delirious and
0	how else could it be ?
0	joel blair , perhaps not realizing that he was describing a dialectical pattern , has noted that the principle of composition operating in the novel is the grouping and regrouping of characters : our understanding of the novel develops as we observe the initial groups of characters dissolve and perceive the formation of new pairs
0	no doubt , as in so many other instances , turgenev and herzen had discussed the question of don quixote before—and disagreed
0	i also know two similar items , a silver cross and a little icon
0	you ’ ve probably questioned my landlady already
0	but if you don ’ t find it , then , excuse me , my dear , you ’ ll have to answer for it !
0	all i said to him along the way was that he resembled romeo , and
0	this impulse was so strong that he ’ d already stood up to carry it out
0	that would be vile ; in a word , it ’ s not because i
0	hey , friend , nature can be rectified and directed ; without that , one would drown in prejudices
0	on the last occasion he made public avowal of his feelings in the matter , he insisted : ' i have always been and have remained to this day a gradualist , an old-style liberal in the dynastic english sense , a man who expects reform only from above and hostile in principle to all revolutions
0	in notes from underground ( zapiski iz podpolia ) ( begun as a review of the novel ) , he ended :
0	in any case , a son has no right to judge his father ,
0	now , having met you personally , i ’ m even sure of this
0	the most important matter lay ahead—stealing an axe from the kitchen
0	moreover , as if on purpose , at that very moment just before him a huge load of hay was entering the gate , completely shielding him while he was walking through the gateway ; just as the cart was passing into the courtyard , he managed to slip in to its right
0	it was as if something strange passed between them
0	at times he was overcome with painfully tormenting anxiety , which even grew into panic
0	but in the end , a great deal began to surprise him , and he , as if unintentionally , began to notice things that he hadn ’ t even suspected before
0	pyaemia , bazarov repeated sternly and distinctly
0	the guest looked at him intently and announced imposingly :
0	my father 's waiting for me ; it 's impossible for me to remain here any longer
0	i told you , did not i : she 's a remarkable person !
0	the traditional explanation for the perceived lack of correspondence between turgenev 's formal education in hegelian philosophy and his literary activity is that like many other men of the s , turgenev soon rejected german idealism
0	such an ideal victory over him is only possible if he is dpne all justice , if he is exalted to his appropriate grandeur
0	in this truncation we see not only a sign of what might be called turgenev 's novel manqué ( by comparison with the dostoevskian novel which he seemed to be approaching in fathers and sons ) , but also ( though in a less extreme form ) one feature a
0	well , we will see how he will take care of me
0	razumikhin bowed in farewell and shone with pleasure
0	the thought suddenly occurred to him , the estate belongs entirely to her sister !
0	and so sickly , and
0	cried sonya in alarm
0	most likely , that ’ s part of what happened ; it ’ s clear from the letter : he seemed a bit harsh , and naïve mama let her views slip out to dunya , while she , of course , got angry and replied somewhat annoyed
0	someone who ’ d just come in cried , then burst out laughing
0	in chapter , when he has acknowledged his passion to himself , this love tortured and possessed him , for he regarded such hjalmar boyeson records turgenev as saying ( originally in the galaxy [ ] : - ) : i was once out for a walk and thinking about death
0	happy , ordinary families resemble each other , because nothing dramatic happens to them and so they have no story ; but unhappy families all have a story , and each story is different
0	she knew absolutely no one in the entire neighborhood , and there was no one to turn to
0	the chapter in question contains a delicately managed series of interchanges , in which nikolai petrovich speaks warmly of his future work in running the estate together with arkady ; arkady switches the subject to the beauty of the day ; nikolai petrovich , agreeing , declaims pushkin ( an indirect lyrical confession ) — only to be interrupted by bazarov 's voice asking for a match ; arkady himself then lights up to show his solidarity with bazarov , thereby excluding his father and banishing ( by polluting ) the fresh spring atmosphere
0	i have no strength left !
0	they began to accuse one another , to fight and slaughter one another
0	however , i ’ m convinced that only your special friendship with my poor deceased husband inspired you to keep your word
0	at least he wo not be hanging around here any longer , he comforted himself
0	he blew it out
0	however , there ’ s no cause for alarm : the mass of humanity hardly ever recognizes this right ; it punishes these men or hangs them ( more or less ) , and does so with absolute justification , fulfilling its conservative function , although in succeeding generations this same mass of humanity places those very same people who were executed on a pedestal and worships them ( more or less )
0	the nobility , with its reforms and commitment to civilization , and the radicals , with their rejection of reform and tradition , are equally right and equally wrong
0	vasily ivanovich took out his handkerchief and blew his nose , bending over almost to the ground
0	that is , the funeral feast , in spite of your mama ’ s kind invitation
0	he also buys up promissory notes
0	it couldn ’ t be that he ’ s an egoist , right , dunechka ?
0	god will protect her , he will !
0	and what turgenev said of the renewal of interest in pushkin may also be said of the rediscovery of turgenev : under the influence of the old , but not yet obsolete master
0	all of a sudden , he felt a convulsion and his previous , hateful , almost haughty smile appeared on his lips
0	in a word , dear rodya , this letter was so nobly and poignantly written that i sobbed while reading it and to this day can ’ t do so without shedding tears
0	he wasn ’ t thinking about anything and didn ’ t want to think ; but images arose , one after another , disconnected fragments of thoughts flashed by without beginning or ending
0	bazarov picked up the child , who , to both fenechka 's and dunyasha 's surprise , offered not the least resistance and showed no fear
0	she played very well , although her rendition was a bit stiff and dry
0	no , i didn ’ t see them ; in fact , i didn ’ t even notice any open apartment
0	what are you doing ?
0	how we prayed that they ’ d publish it—but they didn ’ t !
0	svidrigaylov went on his own way
0	i won ’ t go back there ; i was already sick of all that
0	there was a large pool
0	under the influence of various vague emotions , an awareness of life passing by , a desire for novelty , she would forced herself to reach a certain point , to look beyond it—
0	i ’ ll tell you there
0	there are bookish dreams here , sir , a heart that ’ s irritated by theories ; one sees decisiveness at every step , but decisiveness of a special kind—he did resolve , but as if falling off a mountain or jumping from a bell tower , and he went out to commit the crime as if unwillingly
0	it wasn ’ t there before
0	yes , andrey semyonych lebezyatnikov , an office worker in the ministry
0	porfiry petrovich stood there for several moments , as if lost in thought , but suddenly came back to life and waved the uninvited witnesses away
0	he has the means and connections ; semyon zakharovich knew him as a child
0	i maintain that he was inept and inexperienced , and this was probably his first endeavor !
0	he might even put it on for his wedding
0	'there is concealed approval lurking here this fellow , bazarov , definitely dominates the others and does not encounter proper resistance , and he concluded that what turgenev had done was politically dangerous
0	i won ’ t allow it !
0	she 's gone through fire and water , they used to say about her ; and a well-known local wit would add , and through copper pipes as well
0	you ’ ll soon see what it is for yourself , and
0	lord , have mercy on us sinners , he continued his prayers in a low voice
0	to m n katkov
0	when he arrived at the kapernaumovs ’ apartment , he felt a sudden weakness and fear
0	it ’ s all nonsense , said svidrigaylov , wetting a towel and applying it to his head
0	and this , in its own way , i can tell you , sir , can be a mine of information !
0	in fact , this is how that conspiracy took place
0	raskolnikov asked , serious and pale , standing in front of him in anticipation
0	and these , in turn , point to the psychological and social verities that secure so high place for fathers and sons in modern literature
0	another time he awoke before dawn lying somewhere on the ground , in the midst of bushes , and he could hardly recall how he had wound up there
0	he knows how to sing and dance , and , they say , he tells stories so well that people come from afar to listen
0	and i could have had my reasons , although you won ’ t learn them
0	he wanted to say something
0	i wo not invite you to come to marino now , nikolai petrovich once said to him ( he would given that name to the village in honor of his late wife , marya )
0	he asked , inquiring further
0	from the ceiling on a long cord hung a cage containing a short-tailed siskin ; it chirped continuously , hopping around , its cage constantly shaking and rocking : hempseeds were being scattered on the floor with a light tapping sound
0	it could be fired once more
0	forgive me for bombarding you with letters , but i wanted to forewarn you that as a result of letters i received from annenkov and the remarks of botkin to whom i read my tale here , the revisions of fathers and sons will be more extensive than i had anticipated , and will occupy me approximately two weeks , during which time you will receive a careful list of all omissions and additions
0	however , he looked very pale
0	a dispassionate and dried-up person always acts according to logical calculations ; a timid and weak person tries to deceive himself with sophistry and assure himself of the tightness of his desires and actions ; but bazarov has no need for such trickery ; he says to himself straightforwardly : this is stupid , but nevertheless , i will do what i want , and i do not want to torment myself over it
0	then she surveyed her guests again with pride and dignity and suddenly , with special solicitude , inquired loudly across the table of the deaf old man whether he ’ d like some more roast and had he been served some lisbon wine ?
0	well , what if he does ?
0	if someone had come into his room then , he would have jumped up and started shouting
0	for one whole year i fulfilled my obligation devotedly and devoutly and never touched the bottle—he pointed to the bottle—because i do have feelings
0	well , that ’ s just what i was afraid of !
0	no , the russian people is not as you imagine it to be
0	i tell you : she has a delectable body !
0	that gentleman , what ’ s his name ?
0	bazarov was stubbornly and morosely silent
0	behind it , most likely , stood a bed
0	listen , why are you still standing next to the doorway ?
0	but the thing was that as of late , even though he was almost always alone , he could in no way feel that he was alone
0	but no one shared his merriment ; his taciturn companion even regarded all these outbursts with hostility and distrust
0	identifying love with romantic love , odintsova , and the newly passionate bazarov , never understand that arkady and katya have grown to love each other
0	as yurii mann observed twenty-one years ago in an unusually interesting article in novy mir
0	now it turns out i have been left behind while he 's moved ahead , and we ca not understand each other
0	pardon me , pardon me , vasily ivanovich objected with a kindly grimace
0	why , when you are young , you can do everything—come , and go , and fetch , and you do not have to ask anyone what could be better ?
0	the russian people , he wrote later to another correspondent , need helpers not herders
0	she asked , looking at him distrustfully across the table
0	i vouched for you , friend , do you hear ?
0	give it to me to read in the morning
0	what if she is ?
0	she cried through the door , calling to anyone who could hear ; she shook the door with her hands
0	by the same token , over the century that separates us from herzen , it has become quite legitimate to consider still other rooms as the best ; ie , to disagree not only with herzen 's analysis of the novel , but with the assumptions that underlie it
0	several ribs on the right side were broken
0	he found it unpleasant , very unpleasant to mingle with the common folk , but he went precisely where there was the biggest crowd
0	svidrigaylov alarmed him particularly ; one could even say that he seemed to be obsessed with him
0	if someone had begun talking to him , he felt , he might spit at them or bite them
0	but sitnikov stopped there
0	when i was at school
0	you have not had lunch yet , have you ?
0	he imagined with revulsion that it might be porfiry
0	do you have a book for him to write in ?
0	what was the most tormenting of all—was that it was more of a feeling than a conscious thought or perception , a spontaneous feeling , the most tormenting of all those feelings experienced by him in his life up to this point
0	raskolnikov placed his right elbow on the table , rested his chin on the fingers of his right hand , and stared intently at svidrigaylov
0	bazarov could find nothing to say in reply to this
0	there were hordes of people and no lack of dancing partners ; the civilians tended to crowd along the walls , but the military men danced enthusiastically , especially one who would spent six weeks in paris , where he would learned various devil-may-care exclamations such as , zut ,
0	why ’ s there a cloak here ?
0	and that woman , his landlady , does she consider that a room ?
0	what he fails to perceive , of course—what the whole movement of scientism failed to perceive—was that the extension of purely intrinsic scientific laws to extrinsic considerations such as ethics or politics— was itself a metaphoric move
0	nikolai petrovich turned away slightly
0	his entire theory consists in the direct demand for action
0	death 's an old story , but new for each person
0	turgenev was upset and bewildered by the reception of his book
0	and now , my friend , please let me change your linen , because some illness may still be lingering in that shirt of yours
0	here , sit down on this chair ; so sit down !
0	don ’ t forget , you promised
0	turgenev 's description of odintseva—his narrative of her childhood , her father 's dissipation and her own resolve not to sink , impoverished , into provincial banality— are interesting and important , because they give a sense of this woman who can say to bazarov : you know , vou are the same as i am ( viii , [ p ] )
0	lowe sees turgenev as one of the literary giants of the nineteenth century seemingly destined for a permanent position in the pantheon of literary greats , yet with each passing year turgenev 's literary stock slips a little lower
0	he finally asked timidly in a weak voice
0	the dead turgenev , surrounded by the singing of orthodox priests whom he hated and numerous delegations from groups in whose political solvency he did not believe , carried on unconsciously the cause of his whole life , the fulfilment of his 'hannibal 's oath '
0	it doesn ’ t matter that i ’ m drunk now and have consumed an entire glass of wine : i ’ m telling the truth
0	no other tree is as light and translucent against the sky as it is
0	he asked abruptly , with the feeling that he was throwing himself down from a bell tower
0	well , brother , never mind
0	anna sergeevna , bazarov hastened to say , first of all , let me set your mind at ease
0	hey , peter , do you hear ?
0	someone observed in a respectable voice
0	the staircase was dark and narrow , a back entrance , but he knew that already , having studied it , and he liked this whole setting : in such darkness even casting a curious glance wouldn ’ t be dangerous
0	to top it all , the peasants began quarreling among themselves : brothers demanded the redivision of their property because their wives could not coexist under the same roof ; a fight would suddenly break out , everyone would jump to their feet , as if at a given signal , and rush to the office steps , often in a drunken state , with bruised faces , asking to see the master , demanding justice and reprisals ; an uproar and clamor would ensue , the women 's shrill shrieking mingling with the men 's cursing
0	well , then , let ’ s suppose he did let it slip , even though he ’ s a rational man ( so perhaps he didn ’ t let it slip at all , but intended to spell it out as early as possible ) ; but dunya , what about dunya ?
0	where did he sleep last night ?
0	i ’ ll never forgive you for having deceived me , for hiding the fact that there exists another way of organizing society in the form of a commune
0	it was she who had just awakened him
0	he grabbed the bottle in which there was still about a glass left and swallowed it in one large gulp with pleasure , as if he were putting out a fire in his breast
0	after recognizing the spot , he stopped , looked around , and turned to a young lad in a red shirt , who was standing there yawning near the entrance to a flour shop
0	the one we heard about just before , who shot himself on the petersburg side ?
0	quite so , quite so
0	sometimes an outrageous scene takes shape , yet its setting and its entire course of development are so plausible and possess such subtle , unexpected details artistically corresponding to the total picture , that the dreamer couldn ’ t possibly conceive of them while awake , even if he were an artist like pushkin or turgenev
0	without even checking my pulse , i can tell you i have a fever
0	trembling with a feverish chill , he bent over to examine the bed—there was nothing there
0	have you noticed that she wants everyone to think she ’ s patronizing me and doing me an honor by coming ?
0	i tell you , i won ’ t have it
0	gradually a crimson flush covered her cheeks ; but her lips did not form a smile and her dark eyes expressed confusion and some other , still unnamed feeling
0	isn ’ t it enough that i ’ m ill with a fever , yet i came all the same ?
0	will you come tomorrow ?
0	previously , there were some acceptable ones ; they had their—well , there was schiller , also goethe my brother here 's especially fond of them but now all they have is chemists and materialists
0	i ’ ll show you now that i don ’ t regard myself as highly as you probably think
0	he asked himself in astonishment
0	from under this hat , which she was wearing with a boyish tilt to one side , there peeked a thin , pale , frightened little face with a gaping mouth and eyes fixed with a look of horror
0	they did not talk to each other in anna sergeyevna 's presence ; katya always shrank into herself under her sister 's sharp eyes ; while arkady , as befits a man in love , could pay attention to nothing else [ but odintsova ] when near the object of his passion ; but he was happy only with katya
0	time passes , children are born to them , and their concern for the future becomes personalized , for it is hard— and abstractly inhuman—to pit one 's own child 's welfare against humanity 's , and these are not always in self-evident accord
0	razumikhin placed the acknowledgment of debt on the table
0	if i ’ ve acted otherwise , then i ’ m not harboring any suspicions of you !
0	who will say something about you ?
0	quietly , on tiptoe , he went into the living room ; the entire room was brightly lit by moonlight
0	zosimov stirred slowly and might have replied , had not razumikhin , whom no one had addressed , forestalled him immediately :
0	afterward , remembering this moment , raskolnikov recalled it as follows
0	now i am at ease about the destiny of my tale : it has done its work and i have nothing to repent for
0	but i knew he came to see you , and i know why he came , raskolnikov replied sharply
0	once he stopped and counted his money : it turned out that he had about thirty kopecks
0	in that case , rodion romanovich , i myself will be forced to seek a private meeting with her , which would mean upsetting her
0	these , together with intensity of interest in g—fov , lyubov i nigilizm , rs ( jan ) -
0	no more than that of a louse , a cockroach—not even that much , because the old woman ’ s harmful
0	he said suddenly and—came to his senses
0	kind sirs , pull her out !
0	well , then , scold me or not , get angry with me or not , but i can ’ t hold back , porfiry petrovich declared again
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna was feeling particularly anxious ; everyone was anticipating something extraordinary
0	then , to his enormous astonishment , he suddenly recognized his landlady ’ s voice
0	she asked , slowly raising her enigmatic gaze to him
0	pavel petrovich took his place between katya and fenechka ; the husbands were seated next to their wives
0	i understand , i do
0	by the door in the entranceway to the room , in the corner against the wall , i step on a small box
0	but now , thank god , it seems i can send you some more ; in general , we can even boast of good fortune now about which i hasten to inform you
0	let 's go in , mother , really , said bazarov and led the weakened old woman into the house
0	and what do you think , if i told someone , he might have real doubts , the blockhead !
0	avdotya romanovna , luzhin said , unpleasantly surprised
0	at the time nobody regarded the incident from this point of view , yet it ’ s the genuinely humane one , it really is , sir
0	of course , arina and i did not expect this
0	porfiry petrovich also stood up
0	there ’ s one expression in the letter , you will have only yourself to blame , that puts it all very pointedly and clearly
0	sometimes this idea tormented him even in his dreams ; but now , as he made his way to svidrigaylov ’ s , it was the first time the idea had so clearly appeared in his consciousness
0	you don ’ t believe me ?
0	the princess loved the color yellow : she was also wearing a cap with bright yellow ribbons
0	what if i do ?
0	i thought that i might find zametov here
0	the staircase creaked under quick footsteps he pushed her away and let his head drop back on the pillow
0	i walked along the neva several times ; that i recall
0	perhaps the most suggestive insight ever made into fathers and sons was v e
0	how much do you know ?
0	razumikhin was in a particularly excited state as they walked to porfiry ’ s
0	because , my little friend , as far as i have observed , the only female freethinkers are ugly monsters
0	how much for this watch , alyona ivanovna ?
0	that just confirmed what they were all thinking !
0	he had just now been protesting against luzhin ’ s slander and had just acknowledged that he had seen this girl for the first time , when suddenly she herself showed up in his room
0	you are just as clever as she is ; and you have just as much character as she does , if not more
0	and apparently forever—the younger russian generation 's friendly disposition toward me
0	frequently they became members of the intelligentsia , usually after considerable privation
0	he , who had insisted more than anyone on luzhin ’ s dismissal , now seemed to be the least interested in what had occurred
0	his little feet were stretched out in front of him , squeezed tightly , heels together and toes turned outward
0	i ’ m even prepared to beg his pardon , if i ’ ve been impolite
0	in her own way she 's a highly moral phenomenon
0	it ’ s not joy i seek , only sorrow
0	at the canal , not far from the bridge , and not two houses away from where sonya lived , a crowd of people had gathered
0	mitka , too , from underneath , grabs me by the hair and starts punchin ’ me , and we ’ re fightin ’ not out of anger , but out of love , playin ’
0	in general and most of all , he was surprised by the terrible and insuperable abyss that separated him from all these common people
0	raskolnikov sat down and began searching through them : izler—izler—aztecs—aztecs—izler—bartola—massimo—aztecs—izler
0	sonya knew that this would pacify and reassure katerina ivanovna , flatter her , and—the main thing—her pride would be satisfied
0	what terrible suffering and torments some of them had endured , the tramps , for example !
0	the old dandy , paul kirsanov , protests against this : 'force ?
0	am i candid or not ?
0	observed the tavern keeper , with a yawn
0	then who fastened the hook ?
0	what a handsome man you have become !
0	hey , friend , how do you feel ?
0	so , you knew that old woman ?
0	nikolai petrovich 's coachman led out the horses
0	that day was particularly quiet and uneventful
0	he the spread of nineteenth-century popular culture among the people threatened to replace authentic folk culture
0	but she replied , even somewhat annoyed , that words are not the same as deeds , and of course that ’ s fair
0	as before she still hobnobs with students , especially young russians studying physics and chemistry , with whom heidelberg 's filled to the brim , and who , astonishing their naive german professors at first with their sober view of things , subsequently astonish those same professors with their total inactivity and absolute very distinguished ( french )
0	his father gave up on him and allowed him to enter the civil service
0	botkin , who is apparently getting better , also made several apt suggestions to me and differs with you in only one thing : he does not like anna sergeyevna much
0	she consumes other people ’ s lives : just the other day she bit lizaveta ’ s finger out of spite ; they almost had to amputate !
0	or , perhaps even three months
0	she was a terribly emaciated woman , thin , rather tall and elegant , with lovely dark brown hair still , and real red blotches on her cheeks
0	# a classical character of seventeenth-century commedia dell ’ arte that became a stock character in neapolitan puppetry
0	that i clearly remember
0	but truth above all
0	tanyushka , he said , turning to a barefoot girl of thirteen , wearing a bright red cotton dress , timidly peeking in at the door
0	it ’ s late ; it ’ s time
0	i am so glad to hear that
0	still , as bazarov makes clear , his prospects are very meager , and it leads to great bitterness
0	quoted from the russian in k biografii i s turgeneva , minuvshie gody ( ) : , in richard freeborn , turgenev , the novelist 's novelist ( glasgow : oxford university press , ) , p
0	it seems to me it 's you who have left me behind
0	a loud voice suddenly boomed from the doorway
0	his strength was aroused and now came on suddenly with the first stimulus , with the first irritating sensation , and that waned just as quickly as the sensation faded away
0	something ’ s not right about it
0	he felt as if his whole body had endured a beating ; his soul seemed confused and wretched
0	turning back to raskolnikov , she nodded again at the landlady and enjoyed her little attack
0	it was just the same yesterday
0	the new woman was anxious to be respected for her knowledge and not for the size of her bust or the plenitude of her skirts
0	you just said the word force , avdotya romanovna
0	cupboard doors , stared relentlessly at his son
0	she ’ d heard from amaliya ivanovna herself that the mother had been offended by the invitation and had posed a question : how could she possibly seat her own daughter next to that young woman ?
0	raskolnikov ’ s entire body jerked so violently that porfiry petrovich noticed it too well
0	least long enough to urge his brother to marry fenechka , a serf
0	with your heart , will you long for comfort ?
0	now i have only you , he added
0	she asks bazarov to open the window—but it seems her real desire is that he open her , that he disrobe her ( both literally and figuratively ) , that he forcefully cast off her chill restraint
0	lebezyatnikov took a step into the room
0	next to his grandmother ’ s grave , marked by a stone , was the small grave of his younger brother , who ’ d died at the age of six months , and whom he also hadn ’ t known and couldn ’ t remember ; but he ’ d been told that he ’ d had a younger brother , and every time he visited the cemetery , he crossed himself devoutly and respectfully over the grave , bowing and kissing it
0	and kokh , before he went to see the old woman , had been sitting downstairs with the silversmith for half an hour and at precisely quarter to eight went upstairs to see her
0	yes , i myself can see that i ’ m almost well , said raskolnikov , kissing his mother and sister affably , as a result of which pulkheriya aleksandrovna also beamed
0	as if she were unaware of what she was doing , she jumped up ; wringing her hands , she reached the middle of the room , but quickly returned and sat down next to him once again , her shoulder almost touching his
0	sofiya semyonovna and i have finally found them
0	he said very quickly
0	i have no mother , but my uncle visits me every year and almost every time doesn ’ t recognize me , even my appearance , and he ’ s a clever man
0	of course , they can sometimes be beaten for their fervor , so as to remind them of their rightful place , but nothing more
0	just see when that 's come to the surface , he thought
0	a bon entendeur , salut !
0	yes , it is , it is indeed , muttered sitnikov , once again emitting a shrill laugh
0	i reply to your letter immediately—not in order to defend myself , but to thank you , and at the same time to declare that in creating bazarov i was not only not angry with him , but felt an attraction , a sort of disease toward him , so that katkov was at first horrified and saw in him the apotheosis of the contemporary and as a result convinced me to delete not a few traits that would have mellowed him , which i now regret
0	the other men all turned on him in a fury
0	yes , i was with her all the while you and katya sergeevna were playing the piano
0	where will she get raspberry jam for you ?
0	he walked along the sidewalk like a drunk , without noticing the passersby , and bumping into them ; he came to his senses only at the next street
0	svidrigaylov sat there , deep in thought
0	there will be money for vodka !
0	raskolnikov shook her hand and left
0	can one reason the way she does in one ’ s right mind ?
0	it ’ s from yesterday and it ’ s good
0	to hell with it !
0	no , sir yes , sir i must go pour the tea
0	hey , rodion romanych , he added suddenly , everyone needs air , air , air , sir
0	that wo not make any difference to you , monsieur bazarov ; but it seems that you , monsieur kirsanov , love music ; besides my sister , i also have an old aunt living here with me , and a neighbor of ours sometimes comes over to play cards : that 's our entire society
0	sonechka hastened to jump up from her chair
0	where are you going ?
0	you offered to give me lessons in chemistry
0	in fact , she did possess some very amusing habits ; but i ’ ll tell you openly that i sincerely regret the numerous sorrows i caused her
0	that idea was not altogether unpleasant to him
0	that is why so many attachments turn upon him , far more than on any other character in the novel
0	there in the arbor
0	raskolnikov suddenly felt like saying something particularly pleasant to all assembled
0	he was even preoccupied at the time by some extraneous thoughts , but not for very long
0	it was stuffy in the room , the candle was burning dimly , the wind was howling outside , and somewhere in the corner a mouse was scratching ; in fact the whole room smelled of mice and some kind of leather
0	sometimes i say too much speaking right from the heart , so dunya corrects me
0	does it really matter what people think of you ?
0	at once he came straight to the point ; he stood up and picked up his cap
0	and even if you were right , if i ’ d really decided to commit such a vile act , isn ’ t it really heartless of you to talk to me like this ?
0	seven eight bazarov stopped
0	the main thing is ilya petrovich !
0	n-no , mumbled zosimov , yawning again , you may even distract him
0	they ’ ve carried them off !
0	zosimov himself will report everything to you an hour from now
0	i don ’ t know what i wrote to you , rodya
0	it was the right thing to do because the peasant 's a thief and a terrible drunkard ; but my father never expected i would be apprised of the facts , as they say
0	since at the higher level unity embraces contradiction , that is , both preserves and abolishes distinctions , hegel often uses the word versöhnung ( reconciliation ) to describe this phenomenon
0	yes , sir , they are , replied peter
0	and its progressive ideas about the liberation of women
0	in a word , we ’ ve cut ourselves off once and for all from the past , and in my opinion , that ’ s already an achievement , sir
0	what would i be without god ?
0	he knew , however , that he was unable to see very well ; perhaps there was something he hadn ’ t noticed that might strike someone
0	the result may not have given rise to any memorable portrayals , but virgin soil was the only major novel of the s to offer a sober and generally balanced appraisal of the populists and their revolutionary aspirations
0	( there turned out to be three hundred and seventeen silver rubles and three twenty-kopeck pieces ; because they had been under a stone for a long time , some of the largest banknotes at the top of the pile had deteriorated significantly )
0	dunya said , entreating him
0	he climbed up to razumikhin ’ s room on the fifth floor
0	but you ’ re right , sonya , he said softly at last
0	that ’ s the way it is and always will be
0	i ca not tell you how much i value his friendship
0	and now , if you irritate him , he ’ ll slip out again at night , and he might do something to himself
0	it was nearing six o ’ clock ; he had overslept !
0	she would loved her sinful , but kindhearted father very dearly , and he would adored her , joked with her in a friendly way as with an equal , and trusted her entirely , consulted her
0	and this present state , that is , being betrothed , might even be better than being married
0	she glanced at raskolnikov
0	the illness resumed its attacks
0	even his glum mood had passed ; there was no trace of the former energy he ’ d felt when he ’ d left home to end it all
0	he was crushed , even somehow humiliated
0	in her youth she would been very attractive , played the clavichord , and spoken a little french ; but over the course of considerable wandering with her husband , whom she would married against her will , she would put on weight and forgotten both her music and her french
0	now he was much calmer than when he ’ d first arrived , and he felt this
0	i will take on myself all this bother , that is , the arrangements for the funeral and so forth
0	raskolnikov asked the doctor to wait a little longer
0	why , you yourself say that it may be ’ it ’ s only an accident
0	who are you talking about ?
0	nowadays we make fun of medicine in general and do not bow down before anyone
0	we are told that she 's already been paired with a well-educated and decent , but foolish husband
0	that he could even conceive of such a thing ?
0	just as eccentric as your father , but in a different way
0	petr petrovich cast a sidelong glance at raskolnikov
0	let ’ s go , said zosimov , nodding to razumikhin
0	i ’ ll send him away immediately and i ’ ll get a passport , two of them
0	the idea that porfiry considered him an innocent man began to frighten him
0	better to lose the battle ( and apparently i have lost it ) than to win it through a trick
0	well , they might think i shaved especially
0	and , in fact , he looked completely mad
0	she interrupted him shrilly and angrily , pointing to the little ones
0	look at him , he ’ s asleep !
0	he had noticed it each time he ’ d walked past it ; now he picked it up and looked at it
0	no , i stopped by here—the devil knows why
0	and precisely in this interval , he ’ d managed to head down the stairs and somehow slip past them
0	i can ’ t judge the impression it made ; but in any case , it was advantageous for me
0	no , he ’ s a fool , a fool !
0	another person wouldn ’ t , but this fellow will come
0	) , and i ’ ll be in the kitchen : this is your chance to get to know her better !
0	katya called fifi and opened the door for her
0	i should ’ ve taken a proper statement from you , conducted a search , why perhaps i even should ’ ve arrested you
0	he could read this in her eyes , he could understand it in her emotional distress
0	why is this blockhead laughing ?
0	they both remained silent for a while
0	i put down my pen one more bit of advice to young writers and one last request
0	we made up a whole group , extremely respectable , some eight years ago ; we spent time together ; and , you know , we were people of refined manners , some poets , some capitalists
0	but where is it , permit me to ask you , and where are these pairs , believers and nonbelievers ?
0	by the way , we ’ ll mention in passing that petr petrovich , during this last week and a half , willingly accepted ( especially at first ) andrey semyonych ’ s even extremely strange words of praise , that is , he didn ’ t object , for example , and even remained silent , if andrey semyonych ascribed to him a willingness to assist with the future and speedy organization of a new commune somewhere on meshchan­skaya street or , for example , not to interfere with dunechka if , during the first month of their marriage , she were to decide to take a lover , or not to christen his future children , and so on and so forth—all in this same vein
0	raskolnikov regarded him gloomily and impressively
0	what are you preparing yourself for ?
0	even though pulkheriya aleksandrovna wasn ’ t completely convinced , she no longer resisted
0	razumikhin cried suddenly , as if coming to his senses and now understanding what was being said
0	odintseva here flirts not only with bazarov , but also with her own sensuality , a passional existence that her conventions so exquisitely cloak
0	i ’ ll find it somehow
0	they seem to have returned from the cemetery
0	he brought him to petersburg as soon as he turned eighteen and enrolled him in the university
0	it finally reached the point that evdoksiya , flushed from all the wine she would drunk , banging her blunt nails on the keys of an out-of-tune piano , began singing in a hoarse voice , first some gypsy songs , then seymour schiff 's romance
0	he wore a huge ring on his finger with a valuable stone
0	this coffin was lined with white silk and bordered with a thick white frill
0	sonya murmured , staring intently at petr petrovich
0	where are you going ?
0	turgenev 's novel ends by an evocation of transformation that draws on the latin lyricist and the traditions of pastoral , a transformation that implies harmony , resolution , and endurance
0	all at once he carefully stepped over the threshold , closed the door behind himself thoughtfully , walked over to the table , waited a minute—all this time not taking his eyes off raskolnikov—and quietly , without a sound , sat down on a chair next to the sofa
0	i will consider both of these , but first i consider it not out of place to turn my attention to other , secondary details
0	oh , lord , let it end soon !
0	but you have benefited from living among so many people , you know them so well : you have an eagle eye
0	well , all right , we ’ ll see !
0	you wanted to see your friend
0	tragically—during the june days , turgenev apparently witnessed their short-lived triumph and their bloody defeat at first hand ; but his first reaction to the revolutionary events of that summer , as he summarized them in his letter to pauline viardot , took the form of a question : 'what is history ?
0	are you so firmly convinced that i poisoned marfa petrovna ?
0	but your father 's a splendid fellow
0	a retired army doctor , voyla-too ; and now i have become an agronomist
0	eliot 's observations , reflecting a new orientation in english and american literary theory and criticism , were not followed in the west by intensive critical analyses of turgenev 's language and text
0	i observed this plainly
0	he did a good job laying it all out , thought raskolnikov
0	stop bemoaning your fate , bazarov said , interrupting him again
0	the farther we go in the novel , the nearer to the end of the drama , the more gloomy and tense does bazarov 's figure become , while the background becomes clearer and clearer
0	please understand , ma ’ am : if i were not so certain , with my experience , of course , i wouldn ’ t risk accusing you so openly ; for such a direct and open , but false , even erroneous accusation , i would , in a certain sense , be held responsible
0	normally , the problem of generations is resolved by time : the sons gradually move toward their permanent positions , give over being angry young men , and become husbands and fathers , angry or not
0	he is young , bold , intelligent , strong , he has thrown off the burden of the past , the melancholy impotence of the 'superfluous men ' beating vainly against the bars of the prison house of russian society
0	for the first time , he felt a sudden , strange serenity
0	if you like a woman , he used to say , try to the romantic hero of a literary ballad ( ) by the german writer friedrich von schiller ( - ) , entitled
0	brother , replied dunya firmly and also drily
0	one has to be twice as careful with such a lad
0	you said it well : simply , without embarrassment , without posturing
0	he was suddenly annoyed with himself for having been so expansive with this gentleman
0	and to do as you say would not be according to the form ; you don ’ t know what the proper procedure is , my dear
0	how could he have seen—is it possible ?
0	i just remembered something , he replied suddenly and started laughing
0	just before , when i came in and saw that you were lying there with your eyes closed , pretending to sleep—right then i said to myself , he ’ s the one !
0	he added in annoyance and fell silent , biting his nails and growing thoughtful once more
0	it happened that kolya and lyonya , absolutely terrified by the crowd on the street and by the antics of their deranged mother , having at last noticed the policeman who wanted to arrest them and take them away , suddenly , as if having agreed in advance , grabbed each other ’ s hand and set off running
0	they both stood in a corner ; sitnikov joined them there
0	but what time is it now ?
0	timofeich had set off to fetch odintsova
0	what on earth was that surprise ’ ?
0	on the contrary : what can be concluded from my words is even more injurious to me : it 's not that i have been too shrewd , but that i was not capable enough
0	can anything compare with such horror ?
0	sometimes , usually all of a sudden , this bewilderment would change into cold horror ; her face would assume a wild , deathly expression ; she would lock herself up in her bedroom , and her maid , putting her ear to the keyhole , could hear her smothered sobs
0	everything contributed to it , even the intense july heat , then at its most extreme
0	this might even be the source of his illness !
0	i served in your grandfather 's regiment , he said , turning once again to arkady
0	its lesson is perhaps summed up in that old yiddish curse : may you live in interesting times
0	one could even say aristocratic !
0	i did not want to wake my valet
0	these bookish words sounded strange to him , and once again it was something new : some sort of mysterious meetings with lizaveta , both of them—holy fools
0	how can we get her away from him ?
0	it seems to me there ’ s no particular reason for you or avdotya romanovna to be alarmed , of course , if you don ’ t wish to have anything to do with him
0	but have you tried ?
0	it ’ s a nasty , hussar-like , pushkinian expression even unthinkable in a future lexicon
0	this remarkable man embodied in my view that barely nascent still fermenting principle that was later called nihilism
0	are you ill , or what ?
0	how is it you ’ re so observant ?
0	came an answering cry from somewhere
0	what did i say ?
0	yes , sir ; he knocked and came in
0	to go on living merely to exist ?
0	i was about to have a memorial service said for him , but then i felt ashamed
0	conviction , that she requires a husband who will continue to provide the security she insists on , weds her to a loveless marriage of convenience and an endlessly tranquil but probably unfulfilling existence
0	he left the window , locked it , lit the candle , pulled on his jacket and coat , put on his hat , and walked out , carrying his candle , into the corridor to find the ragged fellow , asleep somewhere in a room among all sorts of trash and discarded candle ends , pay him for the room , and leave the hotel
0	however , one could attend merely to make fun of it
0	inner rebellion and personal identification were sufficient , and they avoided revolutionary circles out of fear , lack of awareness , or plain distaste
0	but i am still leaving
0	but what ’ s this all about ?
0	a certain percentage , they say , has to go away every year
0	suddenly , as if recalling , he rushed to the corner where there was a hole in the wallpaper and began to examine it ; he thrust his hand into the hole , felt around , but that wasn ’ t it , either
0	i merely hoped my advice would serve you and your mama , in light of his new , undoubtedly imminent attempts
0	she was wearing a light beige dress ; her hair was combed smooth behind her and lent a girlish expression to her clear , fresh face
0	father and son rejoiced equally in his appearance at this moment ; there are certain touching situations from which one nevertheless wants to escape as quickly as possible
0	it ’ s not enough they ’ ve slandered me godlessly—now this creature ’ s attacking me !
0	from time to time he merely muttered something to himself , from his penchant for monologues , which he immediately acknowledged to himself
0	gain your end ; if that 's impossible—well , never mind , turn your back on her—there 's plenty of fish in the sea
0	the young girl merely trembled ; as for the boy , on his bare little knees , he raised his little hand slowly , crossed himself , bowed down and touched his forehead to the floor , which , apparently , afforded him particular pleasure
0	rudin ( ) , explicitly concerned with the russian idealist of the s , is a profound study of the relation between language and reality , as jane costlow has recently demonstrated in the death of rhetoric in rudin
0	how can that be ?
0	what has he done in the past beyond studying in medical school ?
0	bazarov , someone once said , is the first bolshevik ; even though he is not a socialist , there is some truth in this
0	and yet the impression created by these incidents does not serve to harm bazarov
0	let ’ s go , repeated zosimov insistently , and then he walked out
0	according to his observations , the patient ’ s illness , besides the poor material circumstances of the last few months of his life , had several other moral causes : they were , so to speak , the result of complex moral and material influences , anxieties , apprehensions , problems , certain ideas
0	i ’ ll tell you sometime how i acted
0	so i asked whether he would ever studied medicine they reply , 'no , he has not ; he does it more out of philanthropy
0	he looked around in anger
0	there are different opinions about him as a result of a single cause : the author himself is somewhat constrained about him and does not know what to consider him—a productive force in the future or a stinking abscess of an empty culture , of which one should rid oneself quickly
0	your room will be ready for you in a little while , he exclaimed triumphantly
0	this has nothing to do with me
0	they both emerged onto the street feeling sullen and morose , and for a few steps didn ’ t exchange a word
0	the form of the novel is its idea
0	i knew that it was your sister sonya who sent you
0	asked arkady , rather too contemptuously
0	raskolnikov lay there pale , his upper lip quivering , breathing heavily
0	raskolnikov wondered , pausing in the middle of the street at the crossing and looking around , as if expecting the final word to come from someone
0	what survives at the end of this novel ?
0	let me give mitya a swing
0	all the same , i put it on !
0	the notion of polarities representing complementary aspects of a higher or broader unity underlies all kinds of systems of thought , whether one calls the various aspects of that integral vision two sides of the same coin ; the father , son , and holy ghost ; yin and yang ; or thesis , antithesis , and synthesis
0	he continued drinking his tea
0	in the morning bazarov tried to get up ; his head started spinning and his nose began bleeding ; he lay down again
0	at exactly eight o'clock in the morning everyone assembled for tea ; between tea and breakfast each person did as he wished ; the mistress herself was busy with the steward ( the estate was run on the quitrent system ) , with the butler , and the main housekeeper
0	i was awake all three times
0	that idiot would be so pleased if he could hear you !
0	what do you want here ?
0	the general sense of merriment was communicated to the servants as well
0	in a word , the pechorins have the will but not the knowledge , the rudins have the knowledge but not the will , the bazarovs have both the knowledge and the will
0	i have to talk to you
0	bazarov emerged from this school of labor and deprivation a strong and stern man ; the course of studies in natural and medical sciences which he pursued developed his innate intelligence and taught him never to accept any idea and conviction whatsoever on faith ; he became a pure empiricist ; experience became for him the sole source of knowledge , his own sensations—the sole and ultimate proof
0	afterward it became quiet and spacious
0	he wondered and opened his eyelids ever so slightly to take a look : the stranger stood on the same spot and was still staring at him
0	i know that you gave her your last kopecks before you ’ d seen anything
0	young lady , hey , young lady , the policeman began again , after taking the money
0	you were lying all the time !
0	however , there ’ s still time for you to reach an agreement
0	ah , what are you saying , dunya ?
0	besides , what right do you have to restrain me by force ?
0	therefore , let ’ s stop here
0	are you leaving again ?
0	so , from this point of view , fathers and sons turns out to be both atypical and typical with respect to turgenev 's novelistic poetics
0	no , they won ’ t accept them , not for anything , because they found the box and the man wanted to kill himself , which couldn ’ t happen , if he hadn ’ t felt that he was guilty !
0	still accustomed to view turgenev as the representative of literary russia , wrote the twenty-three-year-old german writer paul ernst in , but the russia which turgenev represented is dead ; the new young russia is represented by people like tolstoy and dostoevsky
0	her mother made her kneel down and placed her nearby
0	he said , sitting up under the tree and taking in a deep breath
0	but now she stopped restraining herself ; now it was laughter , palpable laughter ; something impudent and inviting shone forth in her very unchildlike face ; it was corruption , the face of a courtesan , the impudent face of a mercenary french harlot
0	she magnanimously kept the princess away from them ; the old woman had been reduced to a fit of tears by news of the impending marriage
0	i will cut the frogs open and look inside to see what 's going on ; since you and i are just like frogs , except that we walk on two legs , i will find out what 's going on inside us as well
0	readers attuned to the novel 's comedic implications , however , argue that turgenev 's novel exposes the limitations in bazarov 's character and worldview , and elevates nikolai and arkady to the status of heroes of the golden mean
0	her disappointment was too painful
0	it was as if fire had flared up in his lifeless eyes ; it was as though he was pleased that he was still able to feel proud
0	they discussed at length the question whether marriage was a prejudice or a crime ( [ ] )
0	he killed an old woman , a civil servant ’ s widow , a moneylender with whom he himself had pawned several things ; he also killed her sister , a trader named lizaveta , who came in accidentally when he was killing the pawnbroker
0	will you try it on ?
0	the reader is ready to attribute fictitious sympathies or fictitious antipathies to the author , only in order to escape from unpleasant vagueness
0	all of a sudden someone sat down at his table , opposite him
0	the mare strains with all her might , but not only can ’ t she gallop , she can barely take a step forward ; she merely scrapes her hooves , grunts , and cowers from the blows of the three whips raining down on her like hail
0	allow me to pose one more small question ( i ’ m still troubling you , i know ) ; i want to introduce one tiny little idea of mine , merely so as not to forget it
0	neither saw the other , even a step away , and they almost bumped heads
0	and everyone will understand
0	prosaic love thrives in a realm without drama , and therefore usually is , at best , the background to a novel 's great events
0	the buildings are in bad shape and the workers look like confirmed loafers ; the steward 's either a fool or a thief , i still ca not tell which
0	meanwhile he himself mumbled and chewed the amber mouthpiece of his pipe ; clutching his neck with his fingers , he twisted his head as if checking to see that it was attached properly and suddenly opened his broad mouth and laughed without ever emitting a sound
0	he does a little publishing and puts out booklets on the natural sciences—and do they sell !
0	my dear boy , it 's no disaster
0	well , after this i ’ m completely convinced that you came here also with my sister in mind , he said frankly to svidrigaylov , without concealing it , in order to irritate him even more
0	well , what do you want ?
0	would you like some tea now ?
0	however , katerina ivanovna ’ s in a complete frenzy
0	when that time came—
0	a few carts harnessed with unbridled horses were running swiftly along a narrow country lane
0	some form of service ?
0	the young man took it and was so angry that he was just about to leave ; but then he reconsidered , remembering that he had nowhere else to go , and that he ’ d come for a different reason
0	no , up to this point the thought of sin kept her from the canal , and the thought of them , the children
0	like the narrative of odintseva bathing and arkady 's glance , turgenev 's description disrobes the woman by alluding to what her clothes cover
0	he repeated to himself
0	as soon as he said this , once again a prior , familiar feeling all at once turned his soul to ice : he glanced at her and all of a sudden he seemed to see lizaveta ’ s face in hers
0	odintsova and bazarov are therefore shocked to learn that arkady and katya plan to marry
0	her hands were trembling , and her voice failed
0	it ’ s open till ten o ’ clock
0	papa , papa , the boy cries to his father
0	bazarov shuns life ; the author does not present him as a villain for it ; he only show 's us life in all its beauty
0	even kokh and pestryakov didn ’ t notice him as they were passing by , although their testimony doesn ’ t mean very much now
0	his student years , about which turgenev does not say a word , probably did not pass without some affair of the heart ; bazarov , as we shall see later on , proves to be an experienced man , but , in all probability , he has had to do with women who were completely uneducated and far from refined and , consequently , incapable of strongly interesting his intellect or stirring his nerves ; when he meets odintsov he sees that it is possible to speak to her as an equal and senses that she possesses the versatile mind and firm character which he is conscious of and likes in himself
0	paris , april ( ) , i hasten to answer your letter , for which i am very grateful to you , dear sluchevsky
0	he does not feel the need to look for sympathy and understanding in another person ; when some thought occurs to him , he simply expresses it , paying no attention whether his listeners agree with his opinion , or whether his ideas please them
0	you eat , drink , and know you are acting in the most proper , judicious manner
0	surrounded by fresh scents and shade , she used to read , work , or surrender herself to absolute silence , a feeling probably familiar to everyone , the charm of which consists in a scarcely conscious , quiet attentiveness to the broad wave of life constantly flowing in and around us
0	bazarov has the habit of expressing himself contemptuously : he calls his old coat
0	but why sit here chatting like this ?
0	the materialism you preach has been in fashion more than once before and has always turned out to be insubstantial
0	in a word , it was youth , that is , i want to state that the landlady afforded me a great deal of credit and , in part , i led a life of
0	even violent historical change , then , in turgenev 's cool assessment of it , had no specific aim , though he recognized that in the last resort , if a man is to achieve anything at all in his life , he must make that ultimate commitment to his ideals which demands of him the fullest sacrifice
0	you just go and get married as soon as you can ; fix up your nest and have lots and lots of children
0	cried the young man again
0	the requiem at the end , with the further moving toward the immortality of the soul is good , but dangerous : you will slip into mysticism that way
0	but the ultimate irony is that secenov was in fact modelled on bazarov
0	prizing the values of honor , valor , and civility that he associates with the upper classes of society as organized by earlier generations , he affects the dress , manners , and views of a bygone era
0	and the old woman handed him back the watch
0	did you really not know that ?
0	it can ’ t be like that !
0	so , you think i went on about the official apartment
0	the art of making money or curing hemorrhoids !
0	i ’ d let them down intentionally
0	he exclaimed triumphantly , after seeing it on raskolnikov ’ s head
0	it is , replied arkady
0	raskolnikov walked behind , carefully supporting marmeladov ’ s head and showing them the way
0	well , then i waited for you ; i looked around and god delivered you—you came on your own !
0	on the ground lay a man who had just been run over by the horses
0	i am sure we will be seeing each other again , anna sergeevna said with an unintentional movement
0	all his attention is concentrated on the general forces of life
0	his rude clashes with kirsanov and his uncle arise from his individual traits
0	no , it ’ s better to stay in one ’ s own country : here , at least , you can blame other people for everything and manage to justify yourself
0	that phrase in anticipation of better times ’ is the best thing you ’ ve said so far ; and the words about your mother ’ weren ’ t bad , either
0	even then bazarov remained as cold as ice ; he realized that pavel petrovich simply wanted to appear magnanimous
0	he was dressed in a large , light , fashionable coat and light-colored summer trousers
0	you don ’ t give a damn !
0	i didn ’ t know you also rent a room from lodgers
0	she stared at him intently
0	all of a sudden , she threw the revolver aside
0	as if surprised by this sensation and frightened by it , he suddenly raised his head and stared directly at her ; he met her anxious and painfully solicitous glance directed at him ; there was love reflected in it ; his hatred vanished like a shadow
0	razumikhin started to exclaim , but just at that moment the door opened and in walked a new person , unknown to everyone in the room
0	leaving nikolai petrovich in his study , he headed along the corridor dividing the front part of the house from the rear , and , when reaching a low door , paused to reflect , then tugged at his mustache , and knocked
0	there ’ s a complicating factor involved
0	the rhetoric of bazarov 's convictions—
0	he at least got up for work , while we , bazarov reflects ( [ ] )
0	it seems strange : petr petrovich wrote about her in such a way , yet he still introduced her to us , especially to you !
0	never mind , just so ; go on
0	the people who surround bazarov are insignificant intellectually and can in no way move him , thus he is either silent or speaks in abrupt aphorisms , or breaks off an argument he has begun because he recognizes its ludicrous uselessness
0	i left my uncle there to preside
0	raskolnikov suddenly wondered about this , but didn ’ t ask
0	but i am compelled to ask you to spare me five minutes of your time no more
0	raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the corridor
0	oh , how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself !
0	she cried in despair
0	as he said this , he trembled like a leaf
0	strange to say , he was not very surprised to see porfiry and was almost unafraid
0	the servants also grew accustomed to him , even though they made fun of him : they felt that he was almost one of them , not a master
0	terror passed through sonya ’ s heart
0	i was examining some views of saxony in your album , and you observed that such an activity could not interest me
0	even dunechka almost believed them , too—imagine that !
0	what business is it of yours ?
0	just as he was christened
0	and , it turns out , i didn ’ t even do that right
0	strakhov , for example , writes : bazarov 's credo , nihilism , i have adduced as an effort of thought to free itself from old concepts , as a coherent quest for a new path for life and mental activity
0	you don ’ t even need anyone to carry out the punishment : they ’ ll beat themselves up because they ’ re so well behaved
0	the landlord ’ s clock just chimed
0	i would like to talk to you before you leave
0	i knew beforehand , he said , you are above any prejudice
0	i ’ ll still pull him by the hair , because he should be drawn in and not pushed away
0	she ’ ll gallop , all right !
0	that ’ s the way it has to be , they say
0	he ’ d seen her yesterday for the first time , but at such a moment , in such circumstances , and in such clothes , that he remembered an entirely different face
0	in the noonday heat !
0	i didn ’ t even expect that
0	that ’ s how raskolnikov tortured and teased himself with these questions , even deriving some enjoyment from it
0	do you want me to introduce you ?
0	that background is so clear and sparkling that bazarov 's huge figure stands out clearly but at the same time gloomily against it
0	and so , in all : eighty kopecks for the cap , two rubles and twenty-five kopecks for the rest of the clothes , for a total of three rubles and five kopecks ; one ruble and fifty kopecks for the boots—because they ’ re very fine boots—for a total of four rubles and fifty-five kopecks , plus five rubles for all the linen—i paid the wholesale price—for a grand total of nine rubles and fifty-five kopecks
0	he was a portly , gray-haired man with short , pointy legs that looked as if they would been sharpened , and he was very polite and entertaining
0	the hegelian dialectic employs series of triads to describe evolution of thoughts or ideas as they move from a lower level of perception to a higher one
0	they really have such fine words : they ’ re so comforting and erudite
0	does not it make you happy ?
0	he also recalled that he hadn ’ t objected in any way to the phrase notorious conduct
0	she may be chaste to a morbid degree , in spite of her broad intelligence , and this will harm her )
0	for example , if you will allow me , i will tell you an interesting story about the plague in bessarabia
0	the murderer was definitely someone who pawned something !
0	i ’ ll be leaving here today or tomorrow , and therefore would like to tell her that
0	how did this affair proceed ?
0	the russian formalists , from whom one might have expected important critical studies , generally ignored turgenev
0	and besides , you yourself also assured her that your mother would pay up
0	she behaved in such a way so that everyone , without a moment 's hesitation , would express his opinions to her
0	i am certain that he earnestly regards himself as a worthwhile person because he reads galignani once a month and saves an occasional peasant from corporal punishment
0	their display of will and energy was more visible ; and their attitude toward mere charity was similar to that of thoreau—that it was better to be good than to do good
0	i ’ ve heard something about a mr razumikhin
0	he grabbed his hat and left , this time no longer afraid of meeting anyone on the staircase ; he ’ d forgotten all about that
0	do you know who comes here ?
0	but what was it i wanted to do ?
0	turgenev 's novel makes here its own image of universal conflagration : kukshina 's fires , however , unlike bazarov s dogs , will consume not the transgressor , but culture itself
0	the new doctor prescribed cooling drinks , meanwhile confirming bazarov 's diagnosis that there was no danger of any kind
0	i tell you , she was walking ahead of me , swaying , right here along the boulevard
0	in the last of his works to deal extensively with the experience of first love in an obviously autobiographical sense , he wrote :
0	she got up at seven o ’ clock , and her samovar was brought from the kitchen through the corridor
0	on the outside he resembled a wounded man or someone suffering from great physical pain : his brows were knit , his lips compressed , his gaze inflamed
0	her hind end sinks down completely , but she jerks and tugs , pulls with her last ounce of strength in different directions , trying to get away ; but six whips lash at her from all sides , and once again the shaft is swung and comes crashing down a third time , then a fourth , evenly , with all of the man ’ s might
0	nevertheless , you shouldn ’ t be afraid or ashamed of making a confession
0	nikolai petrovich led her up to the window and held her head in his hands
0	arkady continued to be surprised all that day
0	and there wasn ’ t any open apartment anywhere
0	both her lips and her chin suddenly began trembling , but she regained control , refrained from crying , and quickly lowered her eyes to the floor again
0	what are you doing ?
0	i love little houses like yours ; they are so old and cozy , and they have a special smell
0	what are you saying , rodya ?
0	what if dunechka somehow winds up in that percentage ?
0	he , a forty-four-year-old man , an agronomist and landowner , with tears welling up in his eyes , senseless tears ; this was a hundred times worse than playing the cello
0	but to reject poetry , he thought again , not to have a feeling for art , for nature and he cast about him , as if trying to understand how it was possible not to have a feeling for nature
0	it even seemed to him that in prison they loved , valued , and cherished it even more than when they had been free
0	that was the only way he acknowledged his crime : only that he had failed to see it through and had turned himself in
0	there was no reply
0	that ’ s what ’ s leading you all astray
0	some three days later bazarov entered his father 's room and asked if he had any strong caustic
0	perhaps this is the denouement !
0	miserable dunechka and i were yesterday !
0	he recently arrived here
0	why did they beat the landlady ?
0	a villain , a monster ! —i hear the exclamations of indignant readers on all sides
0	on the occasion of our quarrels , i remained silent for the most part and didn ’ t get irritated ; this gentlemanization ’ almost always achieved my goal ; it had an impact on her , and she even liked it ; there were incidents when she was even proud of me
0	this also explains why she cut or hid her pretty hair beneath a cap and covered her eyes with smoked lenses
0	he cried , suddenly delighted for some reason
0	that ’ s what i say !
0	if you only knew how you intrigue me !
0	the fact that i take upon myself the role of judge is as much a surprise to my brother as it is to you
0	it ’ s an ordinary social question , raskolnikov observed distractedly
0	you dare say , let me go !
0	at the end of the last century all german men were a little like werther , all german women like charlotte ; at the beginning of this century , the university werthers began to turn into robbers , schiller 's , not real ones
0	in addition , there ’ s the threat that if i attend the meeting , he ’ ll leave immediately
0	who can understand him ?
0	lit by the bright daylight , his handsome , emaciated head resting on the white pillow looked like the head of a dead man in effect , he was a dead man
0	i talk the way i know how besides , that 's despotism on your part
0	† let ’ s distinguish ( french )
0	sonya ’ s face suddenly changed terribly : a shudder ran across it
0	here 's what : to say , for example , 'enlightenment is useful ' is a commonplace ; but to say 'enlightenment is harmful ' is an inverted commonplace
0	on the contrary , grumbling resounded on all sides
0	sonya cried , clasping her hands
0	it ’ s a good deal
0	why , it 's enough to try the patience of a saint !
0	even his own awareness , perhaps a bit too self-satisfied , his own awareness of this pleasant change for the better could be forgiven on such an occasion , for petr petrovich was close to being a bridegroom
0	she lives only a little way from here
0	but i did think
0	so why should you follow me ?
0	the politics of hesitation +
0	raskolnikov didn ’ t even turn his head
0	i wanted to dare and so i killed
0	you want to know ?
0	not only does nikolai petrovich love her , but in part pavel petrovich falls in love with her as does bazarov himself
0	they were both pale and thin ; but in their sickly , pale faces already glimmered the dawn of a renewed future , of perfect resurrection to a new life
0	the door to the farthest rooms or cells , into which amaliya lippevekhsel ’ s apartment had been divided , stood slightly ajar
0	how it was and
0	he does not try to attach anyone to himself and does not force himself on them , and yet wherever he appears he arouses the greatest attention and becomes the main object of feelings and thoughts , love and hatred
0	if not by reason , then with the devil ’ s help , he thought , chuckling strangely
0	i really didn ’ t come here wishing to trouble you for long ; i wasn ’ t even expecting very much , although this morning your physiognomy impressed me
0	did you see him ?
0	fairly well ; they sometimes had tea or ate dinner out there
0	petr petrovich came in and rather politely , although with redoubled solemnity , exchanged bows with the ladies
0	a fever had seized him completely
0	bazarov is no longer a man in his first youth ; he has already acquired a certain reputation , has managed to present his mode of thought ; while arkady is still completely a youth
0	they want to entrap me with their guile and then , all of a sudden , throw me off guard , he continued muttering to himself as he headed out onto the stairs
0	it all has to do with that painter , that is , the housepainter
0	i must be stupid
0	how do you get along without it ?
0	a few days ago i looked over and he was reading pushkin , bazarov continued meanwhile
0	he stopped by on his way home to see his father
0	he had not been born a romantic , and his fastidiously dry and passionate soul , with its touch of french misanthropy , did not even know how to dream
0	i am certain you share my opinion
0	the second time was two days ago , en route , at dawn , at the malaya vishera station ; and the third time was two hours ago , at the apartment where i ’ m staying , in my room
0	in a week or a month they ’ ll take me away in one of those prison wagons , across this same bridge ; how will i glance at the canal then—will i remember it ?
0	she is devout , highly emotional , and believes in all sorts of bizarre omens , charms , dreams , and superstitions
0	he lay down in bed , but did not blow the candle out and , resting his head on his arm , thought long and hard
0	raskolnikov ’ s voice broke off , as if the words were unwilling to be uttered clearly
0	but arkady , who was not listening to him anymore , rushed away from the terrace
0	shouted and affirmed lebezyatnikov
0	there 's no need it was a momentary vertige help me sit up that 's fine
0	sonya understood that this gloomy catechism had become his faith and his law
0	burst forth from sonya in a tormented wail
0	the matter ends badly , however
0	yet to his friend the poet fet , a conservative landowner , he wrote that he did not himself know if he loved bazarov or hated him
0	arkady merely shrugged his shoulders but he too felt slightly embarrassed
0	where are these conflicts to be found ?
0	values you , was that what you said ?
0	papa , he said , let me introduce you to my friend bazarov , about whom i have written so often
0	what use do you have for me , unless it ’ s for some special purpose ?
0	yes , he was glad , he was very glad that no one was there , that he was all alone with his mother
0	arkady looked at his uncle with pity , and nikolai petrovich shrugged his shoulders on the sly
0	besides , avdotya romanovna can ’ t remain in the hotel alone without you !
0	on the contrary , a person to whom it happens is more deserving of pity
0	and it was this image of the physiologist as destroyer of human morality that was superimposed on secenov when , in the year following publication of fathers and sons , he sought to publish his reflexes of the brain in the contemporary and was refused by the censor ( who did clear it for an obscure professional journal called medicinskij vestnik )
0	singleton , ed , interpretation : theory and practice ( baltimore , ) , pp
0	is not it eight , fedosya nikolaevna ?
0	why , this disgrace , obviously , had affected her only mechanically ; not one drop of genuine disgrace had yet penetrated into her heart : he saw this ; she stood before him in reality
0	oh , what are you saying ?
0	finally , on his deathbed , bazarov abandons his hauteur and displays traits early associated with arkady—humility and the recognition of beauty
0	who ’ s supposed to defend us , poor widows and orphans ?
0	if you absolutely wish to know about that nonsense , i ’ ll tell you about it sometime , but for now
0	i derided it then , but that was in order to draw you out further
0	he ’ s very strange and has resolved to do something
0	you gentlemen , to the contrary , by a german process of thinking ( like the slavophiles ) , abstracting from the scarcely known and comprehensible substance of the people those principles on which you suppose that it bases its life , are wandering about in a fog and—which is more important—are in effect crying off from revolution ( otrekayetes ' ot revolyutsii ) , because the people before whom you bow down are conservatives par excellence
0	odintsova shrugged her shoulders slightly
0	i ’ ll sit and wait right here
0	yes , sir ; i ’ ll tell her , sir ; right away , sir
0	he began rattling the door violently
0	sonya spent the whole night in a fever and delirium
0	let ’ s suppose this thirst for enlightenment is excessive ; a man ’ s educated , and that ’ s sufficient
0	meanwhile life at marino had not been proceeding too smoothly ; things were going badly for poor nikolai petrovich
0	wait , i ’ ll pour it for you ; sit down at the table
0	lyrical that everything he touches turns into a kind of poetry ( which seems to be what mirsky is saying ) ?
0	i will keep silent
0	do you mean that i have to denounce myself ?
0	as if i ’ ve suffered very little up to now !
0	he opened his eyes and he saw razumikhin , who had opened the door wide and was standing on the threshold trying to decide whether to enter or not
0	anna sergeevna was a rather strange creature
0	# a popular french song about the duke of marlborough
0	she asked after a little while
0	evgeny , he asked , to the left ?
0	she ’ s a holy fool !
0	the woman who receives bazarov is a study in nakedness and enclosure ; as elsewhere , turgenev 's domestic details allude to a room 's inhabitant
0	the day after we ’ d received her parents ’ blessing , i brought her about fifteen hundred rubles ’ worth of things : a set of diamonds , one of pearls , and a lady ’ s silver dressing case—about so big , with all sorts of items in it , so that even this little madonna ’ s face flushed deeply
0	it was a winding road ; after about three hundred paces it curved to the right , toward the cemetery
0	but you remember everything , razumikhin said , interrupting him
0	matlaw , with the majority of non-soviet critics , sees turgenev as having drawn on the specific details and data of the debate between russian liberals and radicals for the portrayal of a not merely political but universal theme , the eternal conflict of generations
0	you are better , that 's what i see , that makes me happy , replied vasily ivanovich
0	from childhood he was distinguished by his good looks ; in addition , he was self-assured , somewhat sarcastic , and amusingly acrimonious—he could not help being liked
0	during all these days , another thought had kept constantly running through raskolnikov ’ s head and upsetting him terribly , although he ’ d tried to drive it away because he found it so painful !
0	avdotya romanovna was pale , and her hand trembled in her brother ’ s hand
0	hey , such depravity these days !
0	i know you well !
0	an uproar and commotion ensued ; the children began crying
0	reflect that confusion : her dark eyes had a look of perplexity
0	when katya spoke , she smiled very sweetly , both timidly and openly , and glanced up in an amusingly stern way
0	it ’ s an illness , rodion romanovich , an illness !
0	now all of these questions flooded into her mind
0	you know , it seems to me the air does not smell as good anywhere else in the world as it does right here !
0	the first thing she did was order the carriage to be harnessed !
0	turgenev 's pastoral resolutions evoke the possibility of an existence that does not violate society 's most fundamental boundaries : the epilogue 's double weddings are comedy 's convention for the restoration of order
0	why have you come ?
0	will there really be a bottle of champagne ?
0	and so , rodion romanych , why should you be surprised if i played a few tricks on you ?
0	both sets of values , the romantic and the prosaic , have shaped the development of the novel , as both tolstoy and turgenev knew
0	however , i see that i ’ m drunk ; i almost let the cat out of the bag again
0	suddenly he heard someone moving in the room where the old woman ’ s body lay
0	you have come to say good-bye to me ?
0	odintsova leaned forward in her chair
0	katya slowly raised her eyes to her sister ( elegantly , even exquisitely dressed , she was standing on the path and scratching fifi 's ears with the tip of her closed parasol ) , and said slowly , i am alone
0	he fell down before her , kissed her feet , and after embracing , both of them wept
0	for all the breadth of his vision and characteristic ambiguity of his artistic design ( in which , as the noted critic m gershenson noted , he resembles dostoevsky ) , there was nothing cool or detached about tur-genev 's relation to life or art
0	tell me , please , where did you find this out , and why are you so interested in it ?
0	she saith unto him— ’
0	yes , pavel petrovich continued , as if talking to himself , there 's an unmistakable resemblance
0	but this latest turn didn ’ t work to petr petrovich ’ s advantage
0	if you have some business , there ’ s nothing easier than inviting her here
0	this sensation usually began to torment him more during the evening hours
0	i know all the ins and outs !
0	their dialogue is interrupted by a description of the warm , sweet-smelling night that fills the room , of the night freshness that presses against the lowered curtain : the lamp burned dimly in the darkened , fragrant , solitary room ; through the occasionally swaying shades there flowed in the keen freshness of night , whose mysterious whispering was audible ( viii , [ p ] )
0	but i don ’ t owe anyone any money !
0	fenechka 's conscience hardly bothered her , but from time to time she was tormented by the real cause of the quarrel ; besides , pavel petrovich would look at her in such a strange way even when her back was turned toward him she still felt him staring at her
0	late that night , just before morning , he awoke in the bushes on krestovsky island , shivering and in a fever ; he headed for home and got there early in the morning
0	but mr lebezyatnikov , who ’ s a follower of the latest ideas , was explaining to me just the other day that in our era compassion has even been prohibited by science and that this is already being done in england , where they ’ ve developed political economy
0	however , i won ’ t argue
0	we will , we will , razumikhin hastened to say
0	it seems you ’ ve developed a taste for my approach and want to know how i ’ d behave in this case ?
0	as soon as the tinny sound of the bell jingled , it suddenly seemed to him that there was some movement inside the room
0	she is described as a progressive woman , émancipée in the true sense of the word
0	but the poor boy ’ s now beside himself
0	the film was never made , which is unfortunate because it might have helped to clear up a certain ambivalence that has grown up around turgenev 's reputation
0	odintsova was both afraid of him and felt sorry for him
0	brother , who was leaving to go to moscow on business
0	wait for me , even out on the street !
0	surely you must be convinced by now that everything—understand what i say—everything else has long since disappeared without trace
0	her face grew paler and paler
0	raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner , fully clothed , even carefully washed and groomed , something he hadn ’ t done for quite some time
0	having reached the khokhlovsky settlement , arkady waited until fedot , the proprietor of the coaching inn , had harnessed the fresh horses ; then , going up to the coach , he said to bazarov with his previous grin , evgeny , take me with you ; i want to visit your house
0	in the novel 's last chapter , we learn that in the small parish church two weddings had taken place quietly , and almost without witnesses—arkady and katya 's , and nikolai petrovich and fenichka 's ( [ ] )
0	but i concluded that it couldn ’ t possibly be the case
0	katerina ivanovna cried in desperation and threw herself on her husband
0	in the sands , † he says , near kolomna
0	he must have had something in mind ; there must have been some intention , but what ?
0	if i don ’ t come tomorrow , you will hear about it all yourself and then remember these words i ’ m saying to you now
0	i ’ ll bring you some ; there ’ s some left
0	you had a good sleep , my friend : it ’ s evening now , almost six o ’ clock
0	i will stare at his watch chain
0	could i really have told her then ?
0	she pressed her lips to his forehead
0	bazarov cuts his finger while dissecting a corpse and does not have the opportunity to cauterize the cut immediately with a caustic stone or iron
0	go get some water , friend , as fast as you can ; he will outlive us both
0	it seems to me that she participates in none of kristeva 's modalities : neither cyclical , monumental , nor linear
0	what are you doing here ?
0	i will permit myself to cite a small example
0	that is precisely what occurred with fathers and sons
0	the tavern keeper , it seemed , purposely came down from the upper room to hear this amusing fellow , and sat a ways off , yawning lazily but ostentatiously
0	well , i ’ m so very glad !
0	she must carry her keys in her right pocket
0	he asked , still not raising his eyes to her face
0	the new attitude was vividly reflected in her social behavior
0	but i won ’ t accept your sacrifice
0	why am i making such a big fuss ?
0	she seemed pale in the light of one lamp covered by a perforated paper shade
0	he was wearing a light coat and a terribly stained black satin vest without a tie , and his entire face seemed smeared with oil as if it were an iron lock
0	to hell with this new life !
0	pulkheriya aleksandrovna had never been able to imagine that she , too , would be so glad ; even that morning , a break with luzhin had seemed to be a terrible misfortune
0	his appearance was expressive—tall , thin , always badly shaven , and he had black hair
0	what are you so upset about ?
0	most important is that , despite his imitation of bazarov 's opinions , awe of his powers , and fear of his disapproval , despite , in short , arkadi 's schoolboy crush on bazarov , he never wavers in his defense of his uncle
0	both have an equal right to exist
0	go over there , to the head clerk , he said and directed him to the last room
0	having reached the landlady ’ s kitchen , its door wide open as usual , he carefully peeked in to have a look around beforehand : by any chance was the landlady herself in there during nastasya ’ s absence , and if not , was the door to her room firmly closed so that she couldn ’ t look out when he entered to take the axe ?
0	he had been called fool , donkey , reptile , judas , police agent
0	now , wait : there ’ s an apartment here , in this building , from the same landlords
0	we have to turn up the steam
0	no , do not bother him ; he 's become a jackdaw
0	the main thing is , all three of you can live here together , both of you and rodya
0	it was as if porfiry had guessed his thoughts
0	his genius for us is the slavic genius
0	we wanted to rush off in search of petr petrovich , so that at least with his help
0	could he , could he , flashed through his head , be lying even now ?
0	first love is like revolution ; the uniformly correct ordering of life is smashed and destroyed in an instant , youth takes to the barricades , its bright banner raised on high , and no matter what awaits it in the future—death or a new life—it sends to all things its ecstatic greeting
0	they finally lured him into some sort of pleasure garden , where he paid for their drinks and their entrance fees
0	you ’ ve said many interesting things about my brother ’ s character and
0	in some places people formed into groups , agreed on something together , and swore not to disband—but immediately they began to do something quite different from what they themselves had just proposed
0	the revolutionary events of in paris seem to have brought the two of them together and their relationship , particularly a decade later at the time of the emancipation of the serfs , seems to have been a determining factor in making turgenev arevolutionize ' the hero of his first novel
0	katerina ivanovna ’ s lost her mind , he blurted out suddenly to sonya , turning away from raskolnikov
0	and this man ’ s also a fine fellow !
0	we may be able to get her away from him , sir , replied the police officer thoughtfully
0	finally , the governing senate heard the case , and the unfortunate man was acquitted and provided with care
0	he also encountered luxurious carriages and men and women on horseback ; he followed them attentively with his eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from sight
0	that passion is destructive is both a psychological and political truth for turgenev : violation of the taboo—for both actaeon and bazarov— leads to their being literally consumed by the animal world
0	sonya made no reply ; she wept
0	she suddenly said aloud , stopped , and tossed back her curls she looked at herself in the mirror ; her head thrown back , a mysterious smile on her half-closed , half-open lips , and at that moment her eyes seemed to tell her something she found embarrassing
0	they both stared at each other with rapt attention
0	a right to crime ?
0	cried dunya in annoyance
0	they ’ re sitting properly , all in a row
0	you ’ re proving to her that all this shyness is nonsense ?
0	arina vlasevna paid no attention to arkady , failing to regale him with her hospitality
0	pursuit of mystery and the mystical , of drama and desire
0	other people here in the house ?
0	let me go , you drunken devil !
0	yes , indeed , he arrived here recently ; he ’ d lost his wife a while ago ; he was a dissolute man and he suddenly shot himself , and in such a scandalous manner , you can ’ t even imagine
0	( ) pavel petrovich sat down at the table
0	karlsruhe , january ( february ) , [ original in german ]
0	and as for the fact that he committed murder , he can still perform many good deeds , so that all that will be wiped away ; calm yourself
0	they told him and then asked what he should be fed
0	where have you got to ?
0	you ’ re all wrong , my dear !
0	she was simply seized by a cold , enervating terror ; the thought that she would not have felt like that if she would really loved him momentarily flashed through her mind
0	you slept for over six hours
0	shouldn ’ t i slip into some gateway and wait there in an unfamiliar staircase ?
0	ah , sonya , is that why i came to see you now ?
0	sonya wanted to say something , but she kept silent
0	he retired , in spite of entreaties by friends and pleas by superiors , and set out in search of the princess ; he spent four years in foreign parts , first pursuing her , then deliberately losing sight of her ; he was ashamed of himself , indignant at his own weakness but nothing helped
0	i ’ m glad that at least you can still blush !
0	yet that is not the fault of materialism but of those neuvazhay-korytos who understand it in a brutish way
0	dunechka , you ’ re also irascible
0	raskolnikov regarded everything with profound amazement and with slow-witted irrational terror
0	that explains why i did not meet him last winter
0	where could the old woman go ?
0	she seemed not to be afraid of svidrigaylov , but looked at him with dull wonder from her large black eyes ; from time to time she burst into sobs , like a child who has been crying for a long while but has already stopped and even been consoled , but not quite , and then suddenly bursts into sobs again
0	there is no irritation in the tone of his description ; he has simply grown tired of moving on ; the development of his own world view has come to an end , but his capacity to observe the movement of another person 's thought process , to understand and reproduce all its windings , has remained in all its fullness and freshness
0	two months later , dunechka married razumikhin
0	so , you ’ re reading newspapers ?
0	he didn ’ t have any other clothes ; but even if he had , perhaps he wouldn ’ t have put them on
0	i went out for some reason
0	we ’ re working for the emancipation of women , while you have only one thing on your mind
0	something suddenly happened to him , as though some thought had struck him
0	in what then , arkady nikolaich ?
0	who are you talking about ?
0	in life 's furrows by providence 's secret will generations are the fleeting harvest they rise , ripen and fall ; others come in their wake
0	they say that in sevastopol , right after the battle of the alma , § clever people were terrified that at any moment the enemy would attack with all its might and would soon capture the town ; but when they saw that the enemy preferred to stage a regular siege and was digging the first row of trenches , they say that these same clever people rejoiced and felt reassured , sir : if they were going to mount a regular siege , then the affair would drag on for at least two months !
0	the couple lived very happily and peacefully : they were hardly ever apart , read together , played pieces for four hands at the piano , sang duets ; she planted flowers and looked after the poultry ; every so often he went off hunting and busied himself with estate management , while arkady kept on growing—also happily and peacefully
0	you ought to put some sugar in your teacup , nastasya nikiforovna
0	needed or not—it 's not for us to decide
0	naturally , in a future society , there ’ ll be no need for such funds ; but her role will have a different meaning , organized harmoniously and rationally
0	thought nikolai petrovich , and just as his favorite lines of poetry were about to come to his lips , he remembered arkady and his stoff und kraft—and remained silent ; but he continued sitting there , giving way to melancholy and the comforting play of solitary reflection
0	all of a sudden he felt that it would be terribly unpleasant to pass that bench where he had sat and thought after the girl ’ s departure , and that it would also be terribly painful to encounter that policeman with the mustache to whom he had given his twenty kopecks at the time : to hell with him !
0	an hour and a half ago i finally finished my novel i do not know whether it will be successful
0	bazarov is the first strong character , the first whole character , to appear in russian literature from the sphere of so called educated society
0	the most embarrassing thing is that i did it very stupidly
0	pavel petrovich said at last
0	the reader involuntarily begins to think— books exist for distraction not for breaking one 's head ; and what would it have cost the author to say how i should think about a particular figure—what he himself thinks of him !
0	( could it be from luzhin ? )
0	he was amazed and even struck by her sudden enthusiasm
0	that 's a fair judgment
0	on what basis can you act ?
0	she blew her nose and , leaning her head first to the right , then to the left , carefully wiped one eye after the other
0	it was an old book , worn , bound in leather
0	the horses are young , easily startled ; they shied and he screamed—then it got worse
0	raskolnikov went up to katerina ivanovna
0	before he reached it , on the road , in front of a small shop , there stood a young , black-haired organ grinder playing a very sentimental song
0	stoff und kraft is written in a popular style
0	polnoe sobranie so-chineni ) , vol
0	but don ’ t start talking about love—she ’ s incredibly shy –show her that you can ’ t possibly leave her—well , that ’ s all there is to it
0	and you would not trade him for anyone else ?
0	government , the establishment , the die-hards , meaning in terms of his fiction the pavel kirsanovs , the ratmirovs , the sipyagins , could be said to be given a fair measure of verisimilitude and integrity as characterizations , just as the younger generation received perceptive , appreciative and critically just appraisals in such representative heroes as litvinov and nezhdanov or in such heroines as yelena and marianna
0	he soon realized what it was all about and even found this episode immediately to his liking
0	in a recent article on ottsy i deti , james woodward neatly sums up the two contrasting views of the novel that typify turgenev scholarship
0	to help your mother ?
0	without that , there wouldn ’ t be even one great man
0	you aristocrats can never get any further than noble submission or noble indignation , and all that 's nonsense
0	that ’ s why i have disturbed you , sofiya semyonovna , with my summons here
0	no , i ca not smoke , he added , tossing the cigar onto the dusty road
0	won ’ t twenty years of uninterrupted oppression finish him off ?
0	you ’ re a suspicious fellow !
0	it also has two funereal closings
0	he repeated persistently to himself
0	well , why am i going out now ?
0	do you know how i regard you ?
0	value us as comrades and fellow workers in life , she seemed to be saying to men ; as your equals with whom you can speak simply and plainly
0	you yourself can see that i didn ’ t come to chase you and catch you like a hare
0	he said , turning suddenly to razumikhin with a cunning smile
0	the people believe that when they hear thunder , it 's the prophet elijah riding across the sky in his chariot
0	what do you advise me to do ?
0	no , my dear rodion romanych , mikolka ’ s not involved in this affair at all !
0	you know , i always felt sorry , from the very beginning , that fate hadn ’ t allowed your sister to be born in the second or third century of our era , somewhere as the daughter of a ruling prince or some governor or proconsul in asia minor
0	like his purely artistic types , so his grave covered with innumerable wreaths were stepping stones by which , implacably and irresistibly , the russian revolution marched towards its goal
0	that ’ s when marfa petrovna happened to show up , bargained with him , and ransomed me for thirty thousand silver rubles
0	what do you think ?
0	a thought entered my head : why should not i express it ?
0	this question was debated among us , and i told her about it immediately
0	the main thing , sonya , was that i didn ’ t need the money when i killed ; it wasn ’ t the money , so much as it was something else
0	i know that i won ’ t ; but say only a few words : are you going far away ?
0	it ’ s because of your bad luck yesterday that you ’ re so mean and you ’ re pestering me , lebezyatnikov burst out at last ; generally speaking , in spite of all his independence and his protests , he was somehow afraid to oppose petr petrovich ; in general , he treated him with deference , as he had in previous years
0	she cried in a rage
0	i do not want to believe that you gentlemen really know the russian people and represent their needs and aspirations !
0	i know you don ’ t believe it—but don ’ t philosophize too cleverly ; give yourself up to life directly , without deliberating ; don ’ t worry—it ’ ll carry you over to the other shore and stand you on your feet
0	it 's summer now i will go over there right away and arrange things myself ; meanwhile , timofeich , you bring their things
0	we have only to climb this little hill and then the house will be visible
0	matvei ilich kolyazin , finding himself a member of the temporary opposition , graciously paid him a visit on his way to take the waters in bohemia ; meanwhile , the locals , with whom he has very little to do , practically grovel before him
0	that means you already had some reason for coming to that conclusion
0	well , what do you want , you fool ?
0	most likely he 's not thinking anything at all
0	a lesson is needed , ma ’ am
0	bah , a five-kopeck piece is still left in my pocket
0	you know , brother , since your party yesterday , my head ’ s
0	he still does as much good as he can and continues to make something of an impression : it 's not for nothing he was once a social lion
0	farewell listen you know , i did not kiss you then blow on the dying lamp and let it go out
0	clearly connected with these conditions is the intrusion of the raznochintsy into literature , until or so the exclusive purview of the gentry , who were all too eager to avoid the imputation of professionalism
0	i can ’ t endure it , i can ’ t !
0	besides sonya , raskolnikov and lebezyatnikov , the civil servant , and the policeman who had dispersed the crowd , others entered the room ; several people had accompanied them to the doorway
0	meanwhile , he began attending university lectures , again in order to complete his course
0	i ’ ve only managed to get dressed now
0	he took a step forward , and a shot rang out
0	( hmm , and i thought i ’ d have more to say )
0	it seems that i ’ ll have to see him again more than once , he said to dunya
0	i have broken off with them completely
0	under the window there really was some kind of garden , a pleasure garden , it seemed ; most likely during the daytime musicians sang there and tea was served on the little tables
0	good lord , what sort of truth is it ?
0	their affairs have begun to improve
0	there , on a broken chair , in a twisted copper candlestick , stood a candle
0	i think there was
0	your conscience is clear , is not it ?
0	kristeva maintains that this last type of temporality has traditionally been associated with masculine subjectivity and is alien to other attempts to conceptualize time from the perspective of motherhood and reproduction
0	yes , i can see you ’ re excited
0	at last several of them ( especially the psychologists ) even allowed for the possibility that perhaps he had not looked into the purse and , therefore , hadn ’ t known what was in it and , not knowing , had placed it under the stone ; but from this they concluded that the crime itself must have occurred during a period of temporary derangement of his mind , so to speak , accompanied by a morbid monomania of murder and robbery , without further aims or calculations of advantage
0	i even had some money a few days ago and could have bought myself a cap !
0	arkady related some petersburg news , but felt a certain awkwardness that usually overtakes a young man who 's just ceased being a child and who 's returned to the place where others are used to seeing and regarding him as such
0	we ’ ll see what tomorrow brings , but today he seems not bad at all : a significant change from yesterday
0	after many tearful scenes , something like an oral contract was concluded between us : first , i would never leave marfa petrovna and would always be her husband ; second , i would never absent myself without her permission ; third , i would never take a permanent lover ; fourth , in exchange , marfa petrovna would allow me to cast an eye at the servant girls from time to time , but not without her secret knowledge ; fifth , god help me if i were to fall in love with a woman of our own social class ; sixth , if by chance , god forbid , i were to conceive some sort of major , serious passion , i should disclose it to her
0	raskolnikov paused once again
0	we sense acutely the various distances between the author and various aspects of his language , which smack of the social universes and belief systems of others
0	you ’ re marrying luzhin on my account
0	believe me , all the clever women in the world are not worth your little elbow
0	arkady glanced at her and lowered his head in agreement
0	the estate belongs to my mother , not him ; if i remember correctly , they have fifteen serfs
0	she asked , turning cold in horror and regarding him wildly
0	but here the stumbling block , anna sergeyevna odintsov , is also met
0	and why are you blushing again ?
0	at long last odintsova entered
0	it is a selfconscious and highly sophisticated variant of the somatic sympathetic fallacy : instead of merely the landscape of nature reflecting inner psychological states ( spring/young love ) , the whole body becomes such a metaphor ( a lesson that will not be lost on tolstoj )
0	fearing that the old woman would get frightened that they would be all alone , and doubting that his appearance would reassure her , he grabbed the door and tugged it toward him so she wouldn ’ t feel the urge to pull it closed again
0	after all , he knows i won ’ t pay it back
0	raskolnikov left in an absolute confusion that kept growing more and more intense
0	but what had occurred that was so special that it had transformed him so ?
0	dunya understood it , grabbed the key , rushed to the door , unlocked it swiftly , and dashed out of the room
0	and so very insistent , with such obstinacy , especially insistent—could this possibly be so , could it ?
0	p barsukov , zhizri i trudy m p pogodina ( st petersburg , - ) , , p
0	you ’ re a vile , evil man !
0	but her face assumed a cordial expression when she heard arkady 's surname
0	it was ruled a suicide
0	in the second place , it was because he promptly and respectfully apologized to her that in spite of his strong desire , he had been unable to attend the funeral
0	i simply don ’ t understand it
0	he said decisively ; he moved away from the bridge and headed in the direction of the police station
0	asked another peasant , middle-aged and sullen , from a distance , standing on the threshold of his hut , who would overheard the conversation with bazarov
0	you may have already heard much about marfa petrovna that was amusing and absurd
0	was continually bursting into hearty resounding laughter , in which no one else took part , as befits a high official
0	he paused stubbornly on this thought
0	true , i thought you might tell me something new
0	ah , so that ’ s where you ’ ve got to !
0	svidrigaylov knew this girl ; there was no icon and no lit candle near the coffin , and no prayers could be heard
0	no one knew his name
0	the liberation of the serfs , february , , thus took place on march
0	he hurried to svidrigaylov ’ s
0	the answer was yes , because you have the sort of mother who , with her pension of one hundred and twenty-five rubles , even if she herself didn ’ t have anything to eat , would still send it to her rodenka
0	that stone , that stone , you remember , the stone under which all those items are hidden ?
0	she shifted restlessly from foot to foot and kept curtsying incessantly , biding her time impatiently until she could at last get a word in edgewise
0	the door flung open—and a happy , fresh , ruddy nikolai petrovich appeared
0	he couldn ’ t recall the face of the speaker , and even now he didn ’ t recognize him , but he did recall that he had turned toward him and had even made some reply at the time
0	if god wills it , we ’ ll see each other many times , sir !
0	i ’ m not mocking you ; i was simply fed up with talking like that
0	i ’ m in complete agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , seeing their complete likelihood
0	if i die , he thought , they will find out ; but i wo not die
0	who knows , perhaps we really are seeing each other for the last time , he added unexpectedly
0	this was not mere wounded amour propre
0	the late odintsov did not care for innovations , but he tolerated a certain play of ennobled taste ; consequently , in his garden , between the greenhouse and the pond , he built himself a structure resembling a greek portico made of russian bricks
0	she could still see him
0	sonya was still hesitating
0	i do not think that the great strength of your talent lies in tendenzschriften
0	they will be smart enough to be born at a better time than you and me
0	no , my friend , it is clever
0	i shall do as you wish , he added coolly
0	he saw how the tradesman walked about fifty paces , then turned around and looked at him , remaining motionless on the same spot
0	you don ’ t understand me , katerina ivanovna cried indignantly , waving her arm
0	both pieces of news brought pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s already disordered mind almost to a state of ecstasy
0	you ’ ve strayed from god , and god has struck you and given you over to the devil !
0	one need but glance at him in the russian church , when , leaning against the wall on one side , he sinks into thought , and remains long without stirring , bitterly compressing his lips , then suddenly recollects himself , and begins almost imperceptibly to cross himself
0	was this necessary or not ?
0	the most terrible thing of all was to have to meet this man once again : he hated him beyond all measure , without limit , and he was even afraid that this hatred would cause him to betray himself
0	he , too , began to laugh , forcing himself somewhat ; but when porfiry , seeing that he was also laughing , collapsed into such peals of laughter that he almost turned bright red , raskolnikov ’ s repulsion suddenly overtook his caution : he stopped laughing , frowned , and for a long time stared maliciously at porfiry without taking his eyes off him , all during the time of his long and , as it were , intentionally prolonged fit of laughter
0	phew , you ’ re such a strange fellow !
0	not those silly females , but women 's rights , which i have sworn to defend with my last drop of blood
0	to his good fortune , once again he managed to get through the gates successfully
0	once stated , a percentage , there ’ s nothing more to worry about
0	no , that ’ s not right , not right
0	go ahead , take a seat , porfiry petrovich , do sit down , raskolnikov said , seating his guest with such an apparently satisfied and amicable look that even he would have been surprised if he could have seen himself
0	well , sir , now let ’ s get to the boots—what do you think ?
0	that is , next to the bathhouse , vasily ivanovich added hurriedly
0	zametov , from the corner where he was sitting , suddenly snorted
0	what are you hinting at ?
0	at this moment raskolnikov burst into nervous laughter , right in his face
0	allow me to ask , will you leave on your travels soon ?
0	i have a mother and a sister in a certain province
0	he said in a very strange whisper
0	he was a dashing speculator and an inveterate gambler who lost everything and died early , leaving his two daughters to cope as best they could
0	is it really possible ?
0	he set off down the corridor
0	the entire scene was lit by only one candle stub
0	but avdotya romanovna herself took the first step—believe it or not !
0	raskolnikov seemed to take offense
0	amy sincere thanks , uttered karmazinov , obviously touched and pressing the other 's hands
0	his eyes were shining
0	if bazarov 's father stands above him , pointing , as a dog does in pursuit of prey , then bazarov is the prey , and the dogs have come to devour him
0	a pretty farce we have been through !
0	they will expand their nervous systems to the breaking point then , all equilibrium will be destroyed
0	he willingly agrees to visit odintsov with arkady and explains his pleasure to himself and to arkady by his hope of beginning a pleasant intrigue
0	and your wife 's a witch , the other retorted
0	amaliya ivanovna stood there , looking the most foolish of all , her mouth open wide and without a thought in her head
0	this is a strange conversation for us to have , is not it ?
0	without doubt , she ’ d have been one of those who suffered martyrdom , and , of course , she would ’ ve smiled when they singed her breast with red-hot pincers
0	the first peasant replied , and his voice no longer had any trace of that patriarchal singsong quality ; on the contrary , it contained a note of offhand severity
0	obviously it just slipped out in the heat of conversation , so that afterward he even tried to correct himself and soften it
0	but i prefer to keep silent on that score
0	she stayed at the ball later than everyone else ; at three o'clock in the morning she was still dancing a polka-mazurka in the parisian style with sitnikov
0	his dark face was a little flushed from the champagne
0	and is nature nonsense ?
0	i knew that two and a half years ago and have been thinking about it since then , precisely about this , that dunya can tolerate many things
0	cried sonya weakly , standing there as if rooted to the spot
0	if there was any danger to you , or anything of the sort , then of course
0	would you like some vodka , sir ?
0	as far as mikolka ’ s concerned , would you care to know what sort of fellow he is , in the sense that i understand him ?
0	his mother was frightened by his gaze
0	seems they are coming , sir , announced the servant , darting in from the gate
0	bazarov said after a short pause
0	now it 's time for tea : your mother 's calling us
0	in my opinion , this drunken quartermaster is much smarter than she is ; at least it ’ s apparent that the profligate drank away the last of his brains , but they ’ re all so prim and proper
0	their father returned home to his division and his spouse , and only upon occasion would he send his sons large quarto sheets of gray paper covered with a sweeping clerkly scrawl
0	lying facedown on a straw litter , the unfortunate man was dying ; dark spots already covered his body and he would long since lost consciousness
0	cried someone from the entryway
0	it 's merely an excuse
0	raskolnikov had begun getting up
0	marmeladov ’ s entire chest was mangled , crushed , and mutilated
0	in the final analysis , the monism that turgenev projects in ottsy i deti rests on man 's mortality
0	you heard ’ im , she ’ ll gallop !
0	in style and in tone a sharp shift may be observed , and no one better exemplifies this change in real life than belinsky or in literature than bazarov
0	but once again , it ’ s somehow strange to assume that if he had evil intentions concerning you , he ’ d go about it in such a foolish way
0	we ’ ll talk about children later , but for now , we ’ ll deal with a cuckold ’ s horns !
0	you do not understand but you must explain it to yourself somehow
0	even his recent test ( that is , his visit with the intention of definitively scoping out the place ) had been no more than an attempt at a test , far from the real thing , merely : let me go , he says , and attempt it ; why just dream about it ?
0	yes , a hat that ’ s too noticeable
0	his mood is such that he inevitably would come to grips with that action at the first convenient possibility
0	a long-unfamiliar feeling poured like a wave into his soul and instantly softened it
0	no , no ; never and nowhere !
0	he stood up from the chair and grabbed his cap
0	' a decent chemist ' , he tells his shaken host , 'is twenty times more use than any poet
0	then i will tell you ; i want one of those roses
0	what purpose does fenichka serve , and what conclusions can be drawn from her ?
0	this was a gentleman , no longer young , but standoffish , portly , and with a cautious , grumpy face , who began by pausing in the doorway and glancing around as though offended and with undisguised astonishment , as if asking , with the look in his eyes , where on earth have i come ?
0	no , i ’ m not delirious , raskolnikov said , standing up from the sofa
0	but it was too painful and unbearable to think about and ponder all of this !
0	svidrigaylov pounced on the tea to warm himself up ; he drank a glass , but as a result of his loss of appetite , he couldn ’ t eat even one bite of the veal
0	his aristocratic nature was disturbed by bazarov 's free-and-easy manner
0	he 's much sought after by our tourists
0	i am sure about that
0	why should i hang around here in her presence after he 's gone ?
0	i mean completely hopelessly , knowing in advance that nothing will come of it
0	he replied to several points extremely coherently ; obviously he ’ d received the necessary information and had prepared himself skillfully ; but he simply doesn ’ t know anything about certain other matters , and he waded in too deep ; he knows nothing , and he himself doesn ’ t even suspect that he doesn ’ t know !
0	porfiry paused opposite him , waited a bit , and then suddenly started laughing himself
0	an icy fear seized his soul , tormented him , and immobilized him
0	it all began with the views of the socialists
0	with two or three chemistry students who ca not distinguish oxygen from nitrogen , but who are filled with self-importance and a penchant for negation , and with the great elisevich , too , sitnikov , who 's also preparing himself for greatness , wanders around petersburg and , according to his own assurances , is carrying on bazarov 's work
0	a few days later there was a ball at the governor 's house
0	bazarov arrived at the grove , sat down in the shade at the edge , and only then explained to peter what was expected of him
0	she had the unfortunate trait of telling all our family secrets and complaining continuously to absolutely everyone about me ; how could she possibly miss the opportunity to talk about such a new and splendid friend ?
0	i am not disturbing you , am i ?
0	but turgenev had the pretension and daring to create a novel that had all possible tendencies
0	there were some thoughts or fragments of thoughts , some images , disordered and unconnected—faces of people he had seen way back in his childhood or encountered somewhere only once and couldn ’ t really even remember ; the bell tower of the voznesensky church ; the billiard table in a tavern with some officer standing next to it ; the smell of cigars in a basement tobacco shop ; a beer hall ; a back staircase , completely dark , splattered with dirty dishwater and strewn with eggshells ; and the sound of sunday church bells floating in from somewhere
0	hmmm you have just uttered an inverted commonplace
0	a man as busy as you , to whom time is so valuable , to occupy himself with the painstaking , nerve-irritating work of revision [ of the translation of fathers and sons into german ] !
0	in my opinion , avdotya romanovna is sacrificing herself in an extremely generous and improvident manner for
0	during the first year of his administration , he managed to quarrel not only with the marshal of the nobility , a retired captain of the horse guards who ran a stud farm and entertained frequently , but also with his own subordinates
0	i ’ ll still fight a while longer
0	in the process , he also remembered the tuchkov bridge , the little neva , and he felt cold again , as he had before when he was standing above the water
0	how very generous we are !
0	the bailiff grew lazy and even began gaining weight , as every russian does when he comes upon a bed of roses
0	give me your hand , give it to me
0	even if you tormented her , she ’ d never do anything unjust
0	in this way a man can sometimes feel inclined to throw himself out a window or jump from a bell tower ; the emotion can be very seductive
0	kolya and lyonya , still not understanding what had happened , but sensing something very terrible , took hold of one another by the shoulders and , staring at each other , all of a sudden , together , at the same instant , opened their mouths and began howling
0	he ’ s no match for avdotya romanovna
0	but at first all this was too painful
0	the most miserable dauber the pianist who taps on the keys in a restaurant they are more useful than you are , because they represent civilization and not brute mongol force
0	upon learning that the master was summoning her , fenechka grew very frightened , but followed her mother
0	they say he gave her a terrible beating !
0	i fulfill my duty as a citizen and a human being ; allow me to inquire , who is he ?
0	raskolnikov replied rudely and angrily , suddenly changing his tone
0	i ’ ll pawn the watch for you tomorrow and bring you the money ; the rest will all be arranged later
0	when she tells him she is sure they will meet again ( as of course they do , at bazarov 's deathbed ) , he answers : in this world , anything may happen !
0	vasily ivanovich could hardly speak
0	they have sonya , and i need the money myself
0	isn ’ t it true , sir ?
0	therefore , you ’ re demonstrating how little i mean to you
0	on the other hand , the fact that he had such an assistant made him ecstatic and filled him with pride
0	devil take it , this case is too much for my poor brain !
0	he also said something about sonya , promised to stop by to see raskolnikov shortly , and reminded him that he wished to confer with him , that he very much wanted to talk to him , that he had certain matters
0	with her young , dark , pleasant face , and her sweet , timid manner , she is a breath of fresh air , a fugitive from the natural world
0	i declare that all of you , to the last one , are blabberers and braggarts !
0	place—where people move about , clash , fight , and slay one another—it is lived where these tiny , tiny , infinitesimally small changes occur
0	but sit down , old boy , take a seat , for christ ’ s sake !
0	hey , anna sergeevna , let 's speak the truth
0	you must be more careful , razumikhin observed gloomily
0	i ’ m his friend ; consequently , i ’ m your friend , too
0	then let some blood
0	no , mama , no dunya , you can ’ t deceive me !
0	is she your sister ?
0	in other words , bazarov ( in yurii mann 's phrase ) had to die in order to remain bazarov
0	for some reason he knows about my letter to you and suspects something
0	were confused ( god only knows whether i loved him or hated him ! )
0	how does that follow ?
0	muttered nastasya and went out to fulfill the request
0	cried a familiar voice all of a sudden
0	in conclusion , i will say that in marrying mr luzhin , avdotya romanovna will be accepting the same money , only from a different source
0	he speaks of turgenev 's exquisite feeling for balance which is less and less prized in modern opinion , of his grace of beauty and his harmonious union of form and subject
0	do they live there , behind that door ?
0	they contained no statement of her own hopes , no guesses about the future , no descriptions of her own feelings
0	are you afraid to go to the police ?
0	yes , sir , i haven ’ t heard you out , sir , muttered sonya
0	arkady , after consulting bazarov , gently draws a volume of pushkin out of his father 's hands , and slips into them buchner 's kraft und stoff , the latest popular exposition of materialism
0	true , he hadn ’ t counted on having any items ; he ’ d thought there would be only cash , and therefore he hadn ’ t prepared a hiding place
0	i am proposing here that the effect of love on bazarov was not some sort of general demoralization coming from a recognition that his nature does not correspond with his ideology , but a specific effect , the one i have called pushkin 's malady : an obsession with the knowledge of his own mortality
0	what has the greatest influence on him now ?
0	i wanted to keep him there ; wait , mikolai , i say , won ’ t you drink up ?
0	these people can be honorable or dishonorable , civic stalwarts or inveterate swindlers , depending on circumstances and their personal
0	cried razumikhin , jumping up and waving his arm
0	that ’ s how it was
0	perhaps i ’ m a braggart
0	flying fish can survive in the air only for a short while ; soon they have got to flop down into the water
0	i sat her on my knees yesterday , and it must have been very unceremoniously—she flared up and little tears formed in her eyes , but she didn ’ t want to show me how excited she was
0	there was a great deal of noise and shouting
0	one must be fair , evgeny
0	they sat there and whispered until around two o ’ clock in the morning
0	razumikhin suddenly turned to ask zosimov
0	sonya quietly took two crosses out of a drawer , one cypress and the other copper ; she crossed herself , made the sign of the cross over him , and hung the cypress cross on his chest
0	just think , how many foreign and useless words !
0	he 's become perfectly numb from stupidity and self-importance and now pronounces every e as u—but he also married and received a considerable dowry with his bride , the daughter of the town vegetable-gardener , who turned down offers from two fine suitors because neither of them owned a watch , whereas peter owned not only a watch but also a pair of patent leather boots
0	just wait and see how she will comfort you !
0	however , he drove away any future thoughts more apprehensively and feared his own imagination
0	what sort of expenses ?
0	in a quarter of an hour , they were all engaged in the most animated conversation
0	she wrung her hands in despair
0	she began , stammering from joy
0	i have gone through a great deal , a very great deal in my time
0	the hell with evidence !
0	a i herzen to turgenev
0	not only do his father and mother remember him and pray for him with infinite and inexpressible tenderness ; in other characters too the memory of bazarov is accompanied by love ; in a moment of happiness katya and arkady drink to bazarov 's memory
0	this passage is arresting not merely because turgenev uses delirium in a manner similar to that in on the eve ( both positive heroes , insarov and bazarov , succumb to a language that will not cohere to their much-vaunted realms , the political and the scientific )
0	he added with complete conviction , almost in a whisper
0	she does not appreciate me !
0	one chain was simply wrapped up in newspaper
0	his heart was pounding dreadfully
0	but toward the end , he suddenly felt very distressed again ; it was as if pangs of conscience suddenly began to torment him : here i sit , listening to songs , as if this is what i should be doing !
0	the old-style , physical method
0	there ’ s that policeman again !
0	if they crush us , so be it , said bazarov
0	she saw something novel in him , something she would never encountered before , and was curious
0	polechka , stay here with the children ; i ’ ll come back
0	he was convinced that svidrigaylov was the most shallow and worthless villain in the world
0	i ’ ll get to him !
0	are not you in love with her ?
0	if you ’ re convinced , then you should
0	he 's asleep , she replied , barely audible
0	he was afraid of being followed , afraid that in half an hour , perhaps even a quarter of an hour , an order would be issued to have him followed ; therefore , no matter what happened , he had to hide all traces before then
0	well , zametov isn ’ t here ; you missed him
0	delighted to make your acquaintance , said vasily ivanovich
0	i ’ ve found out where these mothers live and in what circumstances
0	go to sleep , my dear ; god grant you good health
0	did you really come here just to torment me ?
0	fenechka inquired , sticking her head in the door : she would decided not to enter the living room as long as she heard voices arguing there
0	he set about rifling through everything inside
0	it says campany ’ ; well , i should remember that a , that letter a , and look at it in one month ’ s time , at that very same a : how will i see it then ?
0	but this very chance , this smattering of education , and all her previous life could have destroyed her at her very first step on this abominable path
0	you condemn my course , but whoever said it was accidental , that it was not occasioned by that same national spirit in whose name you protest ?
0	but all of these torments had rendered him so weak that he could scarcely move
0	so help me god , rodion romanych , it ’ ll be better for you !
0	will you do that ?
0	fenechka brought him a cup of tea and , after placing it on the little table , was just about to leave
0	with youthful enthusiasm and deep faith in the all-conquering power of science and reason he spoke not only of what had already been achieved , also of what was yet to be done [ he produced a large number of students and ] we may confidently assert that secenov is the initiator of the russian school of physiologists
0	if you wish , you can have bazarov marry odintsov ; i wo not protest !
0	everything was thrown about and in disarray , especially the children ’ s clothing
0	later , after you ’ d left , when he began replying to various points in an extremely coherent way , i myself was surprised , and didn ’ t believe him then , not in the least
0	but she immediately felt ashamed and quickly ran up the stairs
0	i called in to see about my tea
0	katerina ivanovna started shouting
0	last winter—well , are you listening ?
0	why , you just came now to console your mother , that i can see
0	the dirty water parted and swallowed its victim instantly , but in a minute the drowning woman surfaced and was carried along gently , her skirt puffed up above the water like a pillow
0	what do you mean ?
0	what are you afraid of ?
0	( de rougement , perhaps because he remembers the french tradition most , seems to forget this )
0	she looked at herself in the mirror , admired them , but she had no dresses , none at all , no pretty things for so many years !
0	all of a sudden , an officer entered , raucously strutting and swaggering in an extremely sprightly way , threw his cockaded cap on the table , and sat down in an armchair
0	no , it ’ s not nonsense !
0	he 's come to town to inspect the province
0	look at that screech owl !
0	do you really know who killed her ?
0	svidrigaylov smiled with proud candor
0	are things really so bad ?
0	burst forth from anna sergeevna 's lips
0	i haven ’ t asked you yet whether everything went blank or not
0	however , you had your own reasons for that
0	you were not to blame ?
0	well , get out , get out , let me give you a hug
0	what kind of ghosts ?
0	he thought elatedly , standing up and regarding the corner foolishly , looking at the hole where the wallpaper now bulged even more than before
0	weary , bored people are replaced by people yearning for action , life rejects them both as unfit and incomplete
0	he made a concerted effort to understand what all this meant
0	everyone thinks that he ’ s doing it out of servility , but it ’ s simply because he ’ s ashamed of the bird ’ s nest he has on his head : he ’ s easily ashamed !
0	what can i tell you ?
0	that ’ s still not everything , petr petrovich said , stopping her , smiling at her simplicity and her unfamiliarity with proper decorum
0	or sidor , for whom i am to be ready to jump out of my skin , and who wo not even thank me for it and what do i need his thanks for ?
0	in addition , i have extremely important work pertaining to legal matters in the senate
0	so how do you know about it ?
0	you ’ ve heard about it ?
0	well , how can i give it up ?
0	it sounds a bit like a french novel , somewhat unlikely
0	all three of the little poles were terribly angry and were shouting constantly : pan jest łajdak !
0	what does this mean ?
0	well , it does not matter
0	finally , i told her she could not understand me ; i said we belonged to two different generations
0	i see that you fancy her , too , don ’ t you ?
0	now she has to keep herself clean
0	why are you asking these questions ?
0	where the feminists may have seen complete liberation as a vague apparition , the nihilists saw it as an urgent and realizable task
0	baden-baden , december , ( january , )
0	i need you ; that ’ s why i came to see you
0	the boy runs along the horse ’ s side , rushes ahead , and sees how they ’ re beating her across the eyes , right across her eyes !
0	he started for home ; but when he reached petrovsky island , he paused in complete exhaustion , turned off the road , walked over to some bushes , dropped down on the grass , and immediately fell sound asleep
0	he ran into the bedroom at once
0	it ’ s certainly true that you ’ re a brave young woman
0	nevertheless , a change had occurred in both young men since the first days of their stay at nikolskoe
0	she ’ ll be jealous of avdotya romanovna on account of me , if you want to know , and on account of you , too
0	oh , hell , that ’ s all i needed , he muttered , grinding his teeth
0	as for the hero , he is represented as being brutally candid : that is good , very good ; he believes in telling the whole truth , however upsetting to the poor , gentle kirsanovs , father and son , with no respect for persons or circumstances : most admirable ; he attacks art , riches , luxurious living , yes , but in the name of what ?
0	he threw himself onto the sofa , put his hands behind his head , and sat there motionless , staring at the ceiling almost in despair
0	novels as if he were not a story-teller but a biographer
0	hey , alyona ivanovna , you old witch !
0	and i ask you directly , look around at everyone—are there really that many good men left ?
0	a strange scene occurred between us last time , rodion romanych
0	asked petr petrovich , who hadn ’ t caught what was said , but he received no reply
0	the little girl ’ s face was pale and exhausted ; she was numb from the cold
0	can ’ t i have a look at him after these last three years ?
0	he loved lidochka best of all of us , she continued very seriously and without a smile , now speaking just like a grown-up
0	a gospel lay under his pillow
0	svidrigaylov hadn ’ t been in petersburg a week , but everything around him was already on a patriarchal footing
0	i can ’ t stay ; it ’ s time ; i must go
0	but where would she wear them ?
0	when did you arrive ?
0	you seize hold of the most comical aspects
0	what has happened here , though , is that the grass snake is no longer outside the manor—in a garden portico—
0	unlike herzen , he was the first to give fictional lineaments to the revolutionary type in russian literature
0	she cried suddenly , looking at him sternly and angrily
0	and it was true that the longer pulkheriya aleksandrovna was silent , the more timid she really became
0	he looked around with a restless , suspicious glance , observing closely : was there a prison guard anywhere near him , or a mysterious gaze from someone designated to keep an eye on him so he wouldn ’ t leave ?
0	they ’ re drunk , misbehaving , those fools : let ’ s go
0	cruelly abused by svidrigaylov
0	so you come from that same house ?
0	as you well know , i ’ d borrowed those fifteen rubles i sent you four months ago from our local merchant afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , on the promise of my pension
0	can i really be capable of doing that ?
0	how is it he 's moved ahead ?
0	you know : a member of the gentry who served two years in the cavalry , then wandered around here in petersburg , married marfa petrovna , and lived in the country
0	as for the fact that there are some irregularities in his character , some old habits , even some disagreement in their views ( which can ’ t be avoided even in the happiest of marriages ) , on that count dunechka told me that she ’ s relying on herself and there ’ s no reason to be concerned , that she can tolerate a great deal on the condition that their future relations will be fair and honest
0	i won ’ t detain you
0	he simply wants to rest and travel
0	two kinds of love+
0	i don ’ t agree with him ; i understand completely how outraged you are at everything and how this indignation might leave its traces on you forever
0	it gives me the chills , fenechka complained once to dunyasha ; the latter sighed in reply and thought about another unfeeling man
0	svidrigaylov was , however , not so drunk at all ; it had affected his head just for a moment , but the effect was passing with every minute
0	her eyes were shining as if she had a fever , but her glance was sharp and steady , and her consumptive and agitated face made a morbid impression in the last light of the flickering candle end quivering on her face
0	thank heavens , it was only a dream !
0	how could you be afraid when you yourself felt you were not guilty ?
0	she ’ ll borrow some money from somewhere and go back to her town with me , and she ’ ll open a boarding school for noble young women ; she ’ ll take me on as a supervisor and we ’ ll start a splendid new life ; she kisses me , hugs me , comforts me , and believes all this !
0	but now i ’ m counting only on anatomy , so help me god !
0	that would seem to be the end
0	victor , you are a naughty boy
0	in one corner , in the rear wall—or , that is , the partition—there was a closed door : farther on , behind the partition , must have therefore been some other rooms
0	whoever she may be—simply a provincial lioness or 'an emancipated woman '
0	look , see how amazed i am !
0	peter glanced in the direction his master was pointing
0	bazarov leaves the room and with this their relationship comes to an end
0	have you ever seen such a fool ?
0	if they would at least lie , each in his own way , but
0	having decided for some reason that amaliya ivanovna was responsible for those who didn ’ t appear , she suddenly began to address her with excessive rudeness , which amaliya ivanovna noticed immediately , becoming extremely piqued
0	i took the purse from her neck , a leather one
0	anguish was perceptible on luzhin ’ s face
0	arkady is shocked by such talk ; but it is the voice of the new , hard-boiled , unashamed materialism
0	yet despite his earnest efforts garnett 's criticism was as flawed as that of his opponents
0	however , there are so many nihilists around these days ; it ’ s easy to understand why that ’ s so ; what times we live in , i ask you
0	katerina ivanovna entrusted everything to her and left her alone , while she herself set off for the cemetery
0	no one in sight , no one to interfere shall we begin ?
0	he could have had you put in jail if lebezyatnikov and i hadn ’ t happened to be there !
0	at least he could have been furious at his own stupidity , just as before he had been angry at the hideous and stupid actions that landed him in prison
0	do the germans tell you what it 's all about ?
0	and the wise men and the learned men will exclaim , lord !
0	that they think i ’ m mad ?
0	that ’ s how i understand this affair !
0	i ’ m very weak ; give me your arm
0	suddenly he shuddered , perhaps saved from another fainting spell by one riotous , hideous sight
0	it would be more accurate , benjamin writes , to say that a man who dies at will be remembered at every moment of his life as a man who will die at , and he concludes : the nature of a character in a novel can not be presented any better than this statement , which says that the ameaning ' of his life is revealed only in his death
0	it is to this novel that
0	he would ask himself , and his heart would ache
0	did zametov tell you all this ?
0	he bluntly accused raskolnikov of intentionally insulting petr petrovich , hardly using his illness as an excuse
0	that ’ s a sin , madam , a sin , the priest remarked , shaking his head
0	by nature she had a humorous , cheerful , and peace-loving character , but as a result of continual misfortunes and failures , she had begun furiously to desire and demand that everyone live in peace and joy and that they dare not live otherwise , that the least dissonance in life , the smallest failure , would drive her immediately into a frenzy , and in one moment , after the brightest aspirations and fantasies , she would begin to curse fate , tearing and smashing anything that came to hand and banging her head against the wall
0	nor did she know what to say to him : he was too young for her
0	bending down to the bench , she began sorting through her roses
0	that was not it ; he had mistaken one feeling for another
0	on the bottom of these sheets appeared the words piotr kirsanoff , major-general ,
0	you ought to be afraid of me , cher ami† in any case , what nonsense that is
0	now i am no longer a duelist , but a doctor
0	razumikhin frowned and regarded him uneasily
0	anna sergeevna requests that you come see her in half an hour , the butler informed them
0	is he a match for you ?
0	he repeated , sitting back down on the sofa
0	for many young women of the 's , embarrassed by the restrictions , real or imaginary , which russian society imposed upon them , and impatient with the pace of feminism , the philosophic posture and the social attitudes of the people who were called nihilists had an enormous attraction
0	what are you doing ?
0	anna sergeevna crossed the room quickly and sat down on an armchair next to the sofa where bazarov was lying
0	the next day sonya didn ’ t appear , nor did she the day after ; he realized that he was waiting anxiously for her
0	it resembles a dream
0	however , you did very well
0	the doctor just said that he was much better , that he ’ s completely well !
0	they increase the number of people incapable of practical action , consequently , this practical action itself or , more precisely , the forms which it usually takes at present , slowly but surely are lowered in the opinion of society
0	let ’ s go over there
0	she ran to semyon zakharych ’ s superior , but he wasn ’ t home ; he was having dinner with another general
0	evgeny vasilich , she said with a touch of unintended tenderness in her voice
0	so is my mother , too
0	the question of why he ’ d just set out for razumikhin ’ s agitated him more than he himself even realized ; he searched anxiously for some sinister meaning for himself in this seemingly most ordinary action
0	so much abuse and invective , so many curses have been heaped on my head that was consigned to all the spirits of hell ( vidocq , judas bought for money , fool , ass , adder , spittoon—that was the least that i was called ) that it would be a satisfaction for me to show that other nations see the matter in a different light
0	hey , it ’ s a pity !
0	in the middle of the room stood lizaveta , holding a large bundle ; she was staring in a stupor at her murdered sister , looking white as a sheet , as if lacking the strength to scream
0	this lasted for only a moment
0	but that won ’ t happen
0	i said that as a mean trick
0	her mind was both inquisitive and indifferent at the same time : her doubts never subsided into oblivion or expanded to anxiety
0	arkady threw himself on the neck of his former mentor and friend , and tears literally gushed from his eyes
0	well , let ’ s go visit my fiancée
0	don ’ t you dare
0	so that ’ s how it is !
0	previously , in recent times , we acknowledged that our civil servants take bribes , that we lack roads , commerce , true justice
0	if not , you ’ ll get even worse
0	the two clerks quarreled with some other clerks and almost came to blows
0	after having changed completely into his new clothes , he looked at the money left on the table , thought for a bit , and then put it into his pocket
0	she cried as if in a frenzy , without hearing his last remark ; she burst into sobs as if hysterical
0	but just at that moment someone grabbed him forcefully from behind : a policeman now stood between them
0	at last , hesitating and glancing constantly at dunya , she declared that now one circumstance concerned her greatly
0	i do not feel like it , so i am not eating
0	arkady to his room and wished him the same kind of refreshing repose i enjoyed when i was your tender age
0	it seems you said something about today ?
0	we will understand the importance of this novel 's ending , and of the pastoral for turgenev , only if we accept the essential identity of his sexual and social insights
0	but then it passed ; your friend arkady arrived and once again i returned to my old routine , resumed my usual role
0	don ’ t worry , that ’ s fine , said porfiry petrovich , as if hurrying to go somewhere , and only after saying this did he take the paper and glance at it
0	arkady unexpectedly realized that he wanted to see katya as much as he did anna sergeevna herself
0	anna patiently endured all her aunt 's whims , gradually assumed responsibility for her sister 's education , and , it seemed , had already reconciled herself to the idea of wasting away in the remote countryside
0	you might have gotten yourself into trouble ; besides , dunya wouldn ’ t allow it
0	arkady asks whether , in that case , honesty is only a sensation
0	you ’ re still lying , he said slowly and weakly , his lips distorted into a sickly smile
0	you don ’ t have any evidence , and the man i saw yesterday doesn ’ t really exist !
0	in spite of their inborn inclination to obey , by a certain playfulness of nature , not denied even to a cow , an extremely large number of them like to imagine themselves advanced people , destroyers , and they aspire to utter a new word
0	who ’ s that person who emerged from under the earth ?
0	but what should he do , what sort of work ?
0	good lord , beat me !
0	one gentleman here just told me she 's quite a woman— ooh là là ; then again , that gentleman seems to be a bit of a fool
0	bazarov pulled his cap down over his forehead
0	good lord , pavel petrovich , why are you tormenting me ?
0	would you like some tea ?
0	raskolnikov fell silent and turned to his tea
0	in the nineteenth century the julian calendar was days behind the gregorian , and in the twentieth it was days behind
0	it ’ s right here , only three houses away , he pleaded , kozel ’ s house , a german , a wealthy man
0	but have them bring my suitcase up , if you would , and this coat of mine , he added , taking off his loose-fitting garment
0	you ’ re a fine fellow , but in addition to all your bad qualities , you ’ re a lecher , that i know , and one of the filthiest
0	and now that he ’ s confessed , you start to pick him to pieces again : you ’ re lying , you tell him , you ’ re not the murderer !
0	seeing him come running out of the bedroom , she began trembling like a leaf , a gentle trembling , and shudders ran across her entire face ; she raised one arm , was about to open her mouth , but still didn ’ t cry out ; she began slowly backing away from him into the corner , eyes fixed on him , but still not screaming , as if she didn ’ t have enough breath to scream
0	forces , unknown even to her ; they toyed with her as they wished ; her limited intellect could not withstand their whims
0	yes , ma ’ am , he had his hair pulled , ma ’ am , more than once , ma ’ am , roared the quartermaster again and poured another glass of vodka down his gullet
0	people like her never endure it
0	i wanted to end it all there , but
0	i will also rescue her from the muck and mire , because she ’ s a fine girl , isn ’ t she ?
0	so it 's better to be young ?
0	soon i ’ ll bring zosimov
0	asked dunya , sternly and imposingly
0	kozel ’ s house was only about thirty steps away
0	nihilists , arkady replied clearly
0	yes , odintsova repeated with some apprehension that she did not quite comprehend
0	it 's so absurd , but i am talking like a country landowner
0	they detained dushkin and searched his place , mitrei ’ s , too ; they scoured the men in kolomna as well—suddenly , two days ago , they bring in mikolai himself : he ’ d been detained near the gate of an inn
0	' i do not share anyone 's ideas : i have my own , and when i meet a man who can hold his own beside me , then i will change my opinion of myself , his deliberately offensive manners , his sponging on and abuse of kukshin and sitnikov , his trifling with fenichka and his jejune declaration to odintsov
0	he was waiting for sonya ; he saw that they were saying their good-byes and that she was heading straight home
0	he cried suddenly and impatiently ; abandoning his lookout ; he , too , headed down , hastening , his boots pounding on the stairs
0	you leave your house with your head held high
0	of course , it ’ s odd !
0	besides , i want to have a little chat with you
0	that ’ s just what dunya did
0	lebezyatnikov would have gone on , but sonya , who had been listening to him , hardly daring to breathe , suddenly grabbed her cloak and hat and ran out of the room , dressing as she went
0	( and perhaps the digestive process too ?
0	arrest me , search me , but be so good as to act in accordance with the proper forms ; don ’ t play with me , sir !
0	bazarov , who would shrugged his shoulders contemptuously , who thought he knew how to talk to peasants ( so he would boasted in that argument with pavel petrovich ) , that same self-confident bazarov did not even suspect that in their eyes he was still something of a laughingstock
0	not only did he fail to notice this , he drew them even closer to him
0	would you believe that marfa petrovna went so far as even to be angry at me at first because of my constant silence about your sister , that i was so indifferent to her incessant and adoring tributes to avdotya romanovna ?
0	you see , he ’ s come to !
0	dunya lowered the revolver and looked at svidrigaylov not exactly in fear , but in some sort of wild bewilderment
0	he was run over on the street !
0	how is it amusing , sir ?
0	i would have gone in last night to cover him with kisses , as i did just now
0	she loved and ancient name of the russian state
0	then he yawned and , in so doing , opened his mouth unusually wide and kept it that way for an unusually long time
0	you know that yourself
0	ah , what a generous gentleman !
0	i sincerely regret that i ’ ve conversed so little with you , but you won ’ t get away from me
0	i say to tease her : marfa petrovna , i want to get married
0	† jean-jacques rousseau ’ s confessions ( – ) was one of the most famous autobiographies
0	did he mean to praise or denigrate him ?
0	tell him , if you would , that it 's of no use
0	our friends were met in the hall by two tall footmen in livery ; one ran off to fetch the butler immediately
0	he had a manly soldier ’ s face , with a gray mustache , sideburns , and an intelligent expression
0	please after this quadrille
0	i ’ ll try to reassure my mother and sister so they won ’ t be frightened
0	rodion romanych , i have a few words i wish to say to you , said svidrigaylov , approaching
0	he said suddenly and headed for the door
0	they were hanging new paper on the walls , white with lilac flowers , instead of the previous yellow , worn-out , faded wallpaper
0	she was a tall , awkward , timid , humble unmarried woman , almost feebleminded , thirty-five years old , living as a complete slave in her sister ’ s house , working for her day and night , trembling in her presence , even enduring beatings from her
0	and i hate so many , bazarov replies :
0	i confided to her heart much of what later turned out so monstrously
0	oh , how near , how young , fresh , pure
0	do you realize , dunya , that sonechka ’ s fate is no worse than yours would be with mr luzhin ?
0	because even our folk songs warn about unequal matches
0	# a parody of an idea expressed in chernyshevsky ’ s novel
0	i used to spend winters in moscow but now my lawful spouse , monsieur kukshin , resides there
0	what a splendid day it is !
0	yes , but one thing does not prevent the other
0	he , too , has had nothing from me except insults and worries
0	of course , in that case , many benefactors of humanity , those who didn ’ t inherit their power but who seized it for themselves , should have been punished when they took their very first steps
0	the children are crying
0	i was here about a month ago , the young man hastened to mumble with a slight bow , recalling that he should be more courteous
0	he covered himself with it ; sleep and delirium overcame him at once
0	katkov , in an unsigned review in his own journal ( in which the novel had appeared ) , went a good deal further
0	do you remember mikolka ?
0	pavel petrovich had not gotten undressed ; he would only exchanged his patent leather shoes for some red chinese slippers without heels
0	just as turgenev 's narrator never resolves the quarrel between nihilism and the novel , so he never decisively chooses between the prosaic and the aesthetic ideals
0	a large group of women had collected near the door ; some were sitting on the steps , others were gathered on the sidewalk , and still others were standing and chatting
0	petr petrovich regarded him for several seconds , his pale face distorted by malice , then turned and walked out ; of course , rarely had anyone carried away such vicious hatred in his heart as this man felt toward raskolnikov
0	why had he gone to seek her tears ?
0	she drew her handkerchief from her pocket , untied the knot , pulled out a ten-ruble note , and extended her hand to luzhin
0	my dear sir , luzhin cried maliciously and irritably , flushed and flustered , my dear sir
0	i must warn you , i love to argue
0	and , of course , you ’ re right , sir
0	what ’ s to be done , ma ’ am ; our national roads are extremely long
0	the kirsanovs and their wives are limited , but limitlessly happy and fruitful ; bazarov is dramatic , intense , and barren
0	her room , which is described through pavel 's eyes , contains jars of
0	nikolai petrovich would notice the delicate profile of her fair face in the parish church , sitting somewhere off on one side
0	the caretaker was also a bit perplexed , but not too ; he thought a little longer , turned around , and went back into his room
0	we do not need such references beyond the text of this novel , though , to recognize that pavel petrovich resembles its author
0	there is practically no need to explain why bazarov turned out and had to turn out a theoretician
0	raskolnikov must have appeared a bit strange to the policeman : he was in tatters , yet was giving away his own money !
0	i delighted this lady when i provided money for the upkeep of all three of katerina ivanovna ’ s fledglings , in addition to contributing more money for the institutions ; then i told her sofiya semyonovna ’ s history in great detail , without concealing a thing
0	and arina vlasevna , glory be to god
0	no crowd of servants came pouring onto the porch to meet the masters ; only one twelve-year-old girl appeared , and after her a young fellow emerged from the house who resembled peter ; dressed in gray livery with white buttons bearing a coat of arms , he was pavel petrovich kirsanov 's servant
0	sonya sat down again , once more glanced hurriedly , timidly , uncomfortably at the two women , and suddenly lowered her eyes
0	or , in the end , immerse herself in depravity , stupefying her mind and hardening her heart
0	asked luzhin , staring at her intently
0	listen , raskolnikov hastened to say
0	i mentioned this tavern to you myself , and it ’ s no miracle that you came here directly ; i myself explained the way here , said where it was , and named the time when i could be found here
0	but his face expressed surprise
0	bending down and peering at her once more , he saw clearly that her skull was broken and even dislodged slightly to one side
0	katerina ivanovna rushed to the window ; there , on a broken chair in the corner , stood a large clay washbasin with water , readied for washing the children ’ s and her husband ’ s clothes that night
0	now i hope , arina vlasevna , having satisfied your maternal heart , you will begin to worry about satisfying the appetites of your dear guests because , as you know , even nightingales ca not live on fairy tales alone
0	why does she say such things ?
0	meanwhile , perhaps the clock was chiming six o ’ clock
0	so what was the name of that book ?
0	a reviewing of the notion of tradition may serve the same end ; it is precisely with this point that the title of my paper is connected
0	they were chatting about something or other
0	he began reading , more and more in english ; in general he arranged his entire life on the english model , rarely saw his neighbors , and came out only for the elections , where , for the most part , he remained silent , only occasionally teasing and frightening landowners of the old school with his liberal witticisms ; nor did he associate with representatives of the younger generation
0	he knows very well that the majority of his readers will say of bazarov that he is badly brought up and that it would be impossible to have him in a respectable drawing room ; they will go no further or deeper ; but speaking with such people , a talented artist and honorable man must be extremely careful out of respect for himself and the idea which he is upholding or refuting
0	get in , bazarov replied through his teeth
0	raskolnikov raised himself and sat up on the sofa
0	if i were concerned only for my own advantage , i wouldn ’ t have spoken so openly ; i ’ m not such a fool after all
0	mejerchol would 's interpretation of the novel refuses to take bazarov 's nihilism seriously : bazarov a nihilist ?
0	at that moment , the door opened quietly and a young woman entered the room , glancing around timidly
0	a man who is profoundly imbued with certain convictions , who is their complete embodiment , must without fail also turn out natural and therefore close to his native traditions and at the same time a strong man
0	raskolnikov made no reply and held the paper in his hands without opening it
0	russian critics set the stage for the downgrading of turgenev in the s and s
0	he does not want to admit to himself that he can be angered by a provincial aristocrat , yet his passionate nature outs , frequently he
0	he was not himself yesterday , razumikhin said pensively
0	i wo not understand a thing
0	true , razumikhin was standing guard ; but he didn ’ t know anything
0	but a warm stream of life courses beneath all these external forms
0	it was strange : perhaps no one would believe it , but he seemed to care only slightly , absentmindedly about his present , impending fate
0	to a a fet
0	get auss of zis apartment !
0	hello , alyona ivanovna , he began as casually as possible , but his voice didn ’ t obey , broke off , and began trembling
0	well , what will happen now ?
0	in her delirium , words escaped her from which one could conclude that she suspected a great deal more about her son ’ s terrible fate than they had supposed
0	bazarov took his place in the coach
0	they include a review of vronchenko 's translation of faust ( ) , an article about ostrovsky 's play bednaia nevesta ( ) , the classic essay
0	my mother sent me that money through a certain merchant ; i received it when i was ill , the same day i gave it away
0	and who might that be ?
0	then he left his room , this time even leaving the door wide open
0	here ’ s nastasya with the tea
0	you don ’ t understand a thing !
0	his legs suddenly grew heavy , and he began to feel a strong urge to sleep
0	we ’ ll , we ’ ll protect her !
0	bazarov 's plebeian manners rouse the indignation of the outdated dandy ; his self-confidence and unceremoniousness irritate pavel petrovich as a lack of respect for his elegant person
0	a fine duchess she is , arkady retorted
0	he asked suddenly , also with anger
0	i do not share anyone 's opinion : i have my own
0	and now , my friend , would you like something to eat ?
0	you have caught a cold
0	my brother says we are right , he thought ,
0	i want to receive you as a guest
0	and you know me too little , dearest sofiya semyonovna , if you thought i ’ d disturb you personally to summon a person such as you for such an unimportant reason concerning me alone
0	in general , in these last days he himself seemed to be trying to escape a clear and complete understanding of his predicament : he found especially oppressive certain urgent facts demanding immediate clarification ; he would have been so glad to be free of them and escape certain worries , although to do so would have threatened him with total and inevitable ruin
0	that ’ s not what i ’ m afraid of
0	you could not have said that seriously
0	the fire flashing in her eyes as she raised the gun seemed to set him on fire , and his heart contracted in pain
0	and you , aren ’ t you ashamed ?
0	and what were they all now , all the torments of the past !
0	of course , pavel petrovich is not as truly sophisticated as he thinks he is , and he lacks the narrator 's real insight into people
0	perhaps , he says , in the depths of his soul bazarov acknowledges much of what he repudiates aloud and perhaps it is precisely what he thus acknowledges which secretly saves him from moral degradation and moral worthlessness
0	because of her strangeness
0	it ’ s better for me to know !
0	he found his commanding poetic in the life of nature : a quiet and slow animation , a leisureliness and restraint of feelings and forces , an equilibrium of health in every individual creature—that is nature 's very foundation , its unalterable law , that is what maintains it and keeps it going
0	he ’ s mistrustful , a skeptic , a cynic
0	arkady thought ; it was then and only for a moment that the broad expanse of bazarov 's conceit was revealed to him
0	his clothes were warm and adapted to his way of life
0	she spoke and criticized calmly and seriously
0	clear off , that ’ s what !
0	if he put his hand into his side pocket , he could grasp the handle to make sure it didn ’ t swing ; and since the coat was very loose , a genuine sack , the fact that he was keeping hold of it with the hand in his pocket wouldn ’ t be noticed from outside
0	do you happen to know his excellency , ivan afanasevich ?
0	but we do not recognize ourselves at all in the kirsanovs ; just as we do not recognize ourselves in the manilovs and sobakeviches , although the manilovs and sobakeviches existed right up to the time of our youth and exist today
0	he wept and embraced her knees
0	meanwhile the mazurka was coming to an end
0	asked bazarov , as if lost in thought
0	that ’ s all fair , zosimov hastened to insert
0	i would , raskolnikov replied
0	i ’ m an unhappy fool ; i ’ m unworthy of you , i ’ m drunk , and i ’ m ashamed
0	i ’ d like to have a word with her , sir , with that person , sir
0	raskolnikov cried in great excitement
0	i will pray for you for the rest of my life , the little girl said passionately and suddenly began laughing again
0	sonya began trembling in fright
0	i ca not acknowledge you as russian
0	you ought to go swimming more often , nikolai petrovich said to her
0	he cried , turning to pulkheriya aleksandrovna , who was mortified , and ran out of the room
0	he ’ s been summoning people who pawned various items with her ; i also had some pledges there , some trifles : my sister ’ s ring , which she gave me as a keepsake when i came here , and my father ’ s silver watch
0	so today , just before vespers , they ’ ll take it to the cemetery and it ’ ll be in the chapel until tomorrow
0	meanwhile her young son mitya is growing apace , and can be seen running around the house , talking nonstop
0	he stood up , looked around in astonishment , as if wondering why he had come here , and set off for tuchkov bridge
0	calm down , my dear , said dunya , caressing her mother
0	he stood up and bowed down a second time
0	it was very foolish
0	but this neither undermined nor encouraged petr petrovich ’ s views
0	no , she pinched my cheek : you ’ re such a sweetie !
0	katerina ivanovna would very much like it this way
0	but as soon as he put it on , he tore it off in disgust and horror
0	his thoughts were scattered
0	he is a man of theory , and theory created him , created him imperceptibly , without events , without anything that one might have related , created him with a single intellectual turnabout
0	zametov looked at him in fright and turned pale as a ghost
0	but now all they have to say is , 'everything on earth 's nonsense !
0	she suddenly began to fix her gaze on petr petrovich ’ s golden lorgnette , which he held in his left hand , and on a large , massive , very beautiful ring with a yellow stone on the middle finger of that hand—but suddenly she averted her eyes from that , too , and not knowing where to look , wound up staring once again directly into petr petrovich ’ s eyes
0	at last everything became still ; there wasn ’ t a soul
0	then he quietly unlocked the door , walked out of the room , descended the staircase , and peeked into the open door of the kitchen : nastasya was standing with her back to him , stooping to fan the fire in the landlady ’ s samovar
0	at least , something of the sort occurred
0	pisarev 's adversaries were frightened by his imprudence ; they repudiated turgenev 's bazarov as a caricature and even more vehemently rejected his transfigured double ; they were displeased that pisarev had made a fool of himself , but this does not mean that he had misunderstood bazarov
0	here ’ s what : i have no lessons
0	it ’ s definitely been decided that dunya and i will leave for petersburg , i don ’ t know exactly when , but , in any case , very , very soon , perhaps even in a week
0	at last he picked up his cap and quietly left the room
0	he said it as if to himself , but uttered it aloud and for some time looked at his sister , as if he was puzzled
0	 by strast noe , greshnoe ,
0	i am drunk , but not from alcohol
0	it did not mean anything then and it
0	they all wept as they parted
0	why are you frightened like a little child ?
0	your letter evoked in my heart a mixed feeling of pity , gratefulness , and adoration !
0	during the morning service
0	add to this irascibility from hunger , from cramped quarters , from ragged clothes , from the clear consciousness of the beauty of his social position , together with that of his sister and his mother
0	his illness then , all his strange actions , even before , when he was still at the university , when he was so morose and gloomy
0	and if so , then might you yourself have decided—well , in view of some unfortunate worldly circumstances and constraints , or for the advancement of all mankind in some way—to step over those obstacles ?
0	ah , what are you saying , why say that ?
0	why did you leave me out ?
0	all this time , for some reason , he maintained his silence with sonya
0	suddenly , approaching the door , they heard voices inside the room
0	on this , see also pg
0	with potatoes and rice ?
0	what rapturous youths call an ideal does not exist for bazarov ; he calls all this
0	you ’ re all trying to look like generals ’ daughters , yet you have snub noses !
0	never , never before had she felt anything like this
0	but i ’ m certain he ’ ll say the same thing tomorrow
0	they ’ re drunk , acting up ; it ’ s none of our business
0	i will most likely be seeing him , replied bazarov ; every sort of explanation and
0	we have become acquainted , father !
0	be careful , for heaven 's sake
0	she is right , observed arkady , but as for my father
0	when time came for preserves , arkady , who did not care for sweets , thought it his duty to sample four different kinds , all freshly made , all the more so since bazarov flatly refused and promptly lit up a cigar
0	but i ’ ll find out !
0	and just who the hell are you ?
0	he 's given me some very useful advice especially especially concerning relations with women
0	i was enough of a swine and sufficiently honest to declare openly that i couldn ’ t be completely faithful to her
0	his feeling of disgust , especially , grew with every passing moment
0	yes , indeed , it was so : her lips were parting into a smile ; the ends of her lips were quivering , as if still restrained
0	kokh was a fool and went downstairs
0	this occurred at the beginning of , at the same time nikolai petrovich , having lost his wife , was setting off for petersburg
0	you still don ’ t know , you don ’ t know , what sort of girl she is , what a heart she has !
0	together in the carriage , are renewing their acquaintance with affectionate sympathy when bazarov , from the other coach , interrupts to give arkadi a cigar
0	katerina ivanovna was in her old dress , her green shawl , and her tattered straw hat with its brim bent awkwardly to one side ; she really was in a genuine frenzy
0	or , it ’ s simpler and more understandable to say
0	why did i come ?
0	wherever i go , no matter what happens to me—you must remain their divine caretaker
0	the less pisarev kept to the mold in which the from alexander herzen , sobranie sochineniy , vol
0	let that worthless general see
0	she never took her eyes off her son and sighed constantly ; she desperately wanted to know how long he was going to stay , but was afraid to ask
0	but with some strange , almost animal cunning , it suddenly occurred to him to hide his strength for the time being , to conceal himself , if necessary , to pretend that he didn ’ t understand everything completely
0	suddenly his expression changed and , turning to arkady , he said as if with some embarrassment ,
0	‡ allow me , young man , can you
0	are you going to defend those silly females ?
0	one thin three-year-old fir tree and three bushes stood in this garden
0	and that wretched general just sat there and ate his grouse
0	before this trip that i may undertake , i wish to conclude my business with mr luzhin
0	one of the boys asked
0	this man was very angry
0	what can you do with kopecks ?
0	he thought a bit , stuffed the gun in his pocket , took his hat , and left
0	he ’ s a practical , busy man , just about to leave for petersburg , so he values every minute
0	you didn ’ t hear the truth ; it ’ s just gossip !
0	should i turn around now and go right to the police superintendent ’ s apartment ?
0	he talks sense , but it ’ s as if
0	go look for your thief !
0	svidrigaylov stood at the window for another few minutes ; at last he turned slowly , looked around , and quietly passed his palm over his forehead
0	that 's all splendid , anna sergeevna , but you must forgive me in general i am not accustomed to such frank pronouncements and there 's such a distance separating you and me
0	he couldn ’ t even remain standing in the same place for a minute , couldn ’ t focus his attention even on one object ; his thoughts kept jumping ahead , one over the other ; his speech was rambling ; his hands trembled slightly
0	i can hardly figure out how i wrote him
0	baden-baden , december , { january , )
0	in addition , he had in view and at times felt terribly agitated about his forthcoming meeting with sonya : he felt obligated to tell her who ’ d killed lizaveta ; he foresaw terrible suffering for himself , which he tried to push away
0	jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave
0	fenechka jumped up from the table where she would been sitting with her child and , handing him to the girl , who carried him right out of the room , hurriedly adjusted her kerchief
0	he muttered in confusion
0	references to time begin and end fathers and sons ; the nature of time is a subject of discussion within the narrative ; the central protagonists define their identities in connection with different temporal phases ; recurrent changes of tense provide reminders of temporal relativity
0	there ’ s no need to take him to the hospital when there ’ s probably a doctor in his building !
0	the former , becoming carried away by sentimental feelings , will reproach bazarov for callousness ; the latter , becoming carried away by their attachment to the bazarov type , will reproach turgenev for injustice to his hero and for a desire to show him in a disadvantageous light
0	or should his failure and roughness on the contrary teach the bazarovs not to fall into the errors and extremes of the real bazarov ?
0	fenechka turned red to her ears and the roots of her hair
0	it was a somewhat strange face that seemed to resemble a mask : white , ruddy , with rosy , scarlet lips , a light blond beard , and a head of rather thick blond hair
0	in the opposite case , i will be forced to take very serious measures , and then
0	more noble , more magnanimous ’ —that ’ s all nonsense , foolishness , old prejudicial words that i reject !
0	then right to the hospital : that ’ s always how it is with those girls who live with their virtuous mothers and who fool around on the sly ; well , and then to the hospital again
0	arkady turns out to be a competent estate manager : he has learned something from bazarov 's gospel of utility and practicality
0	well , here we are
0	opposite alyona ivanovna ’ s
0	i can ’ t stand it , and i won ’ t !
0	i don ’ t know your aims , but you keep lying
0	they lifted her up again
0	it worked out according to your theory !
0	just think , these are the flowers : the real fruit lies ahead !
0	interpretations of any genuinely artistic text—for , as frank kermode has written recently , any such text may be considered as a system of signifiers which always shows a surplus after meeting any particular restricted reading
0	that is , from all of it , not just one thing ; yesterday zametov
0	he began laughing and glanced at her
0	but you were really quite correct , sir , porfiry resumed again , cheerfully , regarding raskolnikov with unusual sincerity ( as a result of which raskolnikov even shuddered and promptly prepared himself ) , really correct , sir , when you were so witty at the expense of our legal forms , ha-ha !
0	i am rodion romanych raskolnikov , a former student
0	the old woman stood before him silently , regarding him inquisitively
0	avdotya romanovna rang the bell , and a filthy urchin appeared ; he was told to bring tea , which was finally served , but it was so dirty and crude that the ladies were ashamed
0	was it worth even the slightest concern in its turn , even the least bit of attention ?
0	well , sir , it ’ s too long a story
0	mama , i ’ m also inviting him
0	he was able to understand everything in that one look
0	perhaps there would still be a struggle with him , too
0	no , some sort of struggle would be better than this !
0	you do not know your own mother , evgeny
0	you don ’ t have any money ?
0	it ’ s a long story , avdotya romanovna
0	good-bye , squeezed her hand so hard she almost cried , and left the room
0	five minutes later they opened their eyes and regarded each other in silence
0	a romantic would say , ' i feel our paths are beginning to diverge ' ; while i merely say , we are fed up with each other
0	i brought you some tea
0	yes , answered gieroglifov , for reason does not negate feeling ; but the nihilist must recognize love 's relationship to nature
0	you see , rodya , i blurted out something to you yesterday when i was intoxicated , as we were going home
0	i ’ m absolutely prepared to sympathize , if , so to speak , it was poverty that incited sofiya semyonovna
0	just look at what happens to them , to our brilliant young people !
0	but she was becoming more and more agitated and anxious ; she also foresaw that the feast would not end serenely ; with apprehension she observed katerina ivanovna ’ s growing irritation
0	odintsova repeated and sighed
0	you can count hundreds of similar things
0	he was intentionally speaking in a loud voice to conceal his growing excitement ; but dunya hadn ’ t managed to observe this peculiar excitement ; she was too irritated by his remark about her childish fear and how terrible she thought he was
0	at last he stood up , took his cap , thought for a bit , and headed for the door
0	why are his cheeks so red ?
0	he had not expected this , and arkady even blushed from delight
0	but once again the caretaker wasn ’ t there , and he managed to return it to its previous place under the bench ; he even covered it with a log as before
0	he muttered weakly , sitting down on his bed once more
0	on the contrary , your wife will merely prove to you that she respects you , considering you incapable of opposing her happiness , and so advanced in your thinking that you won ’ t take revenge on her for her new husband
0	well , that ’ s praiseworthy ; it ’ s better for you
0	he stood up and quickly walked away , as if frightened by the words that had just escaped his lips
0	he still felt it was beyond his power to resolve this question
0	what a rude , vile , mean idea on my part !
0	‡ both nikolai dobrolyubov ( – ) and vissarion belinksy ( – ) were important radical critics in the mid-nineteenth century
0	how could it be ?
0	cried razumikhin , suddenly seizing him by the shoulder
0	i planted each and every tree myself
0	if you have the power , take it
0	he took it with great interest
0	perhaps those who were the involuntary cause of his death will agree to compensate you , at least for the loss of income
0	i realized very well from the first that this was not good , and—what do you think ? —i was even ready not to look at her
0	there was no one on the staircase !
0	well , let ’ s say we reason like this ( help me out here !
0	i have fallen beneath the wheel
0	you think he ’ ll be able to hold out ?
0	as the young men take their leave , odintsov invites them to visit her in the country
0	it was only today that i was able to imagine how you must have suffered here yesterday in anticipation of my return
0	raskolnikov sat there , watching without moving , and couldn ’ t tear himself away ; his thoughts wandered into daydreams , into contemplation ; he wasn ’ t thinking about anything , but some longing troubled and tormented him
0	as a matter of fact , a policeman was making his way through the crowd
0	i didn ’ t tell her that you love her , because she knows that herself
0	phew , such stupid thoughts occur to me
0	this time , razumikhin stood up to let him pass
0	they were forging banknotes
0	the young people in marino regretted their departure ; dunyasha even shed a few tears but the old folks breathed a sigh of relief
0	he went out ; he was staggering
0	they were about to meet ; only one floor separated them—then , all of sudden , deliverance !
0	tell me : did you kill them ?
0	raskolnikov didn ’ t recognize her at first
0	your question is a broad one
0	that ’ s a rather accurate observation , he replied
0	then , in deep thought , he stood up , approached his mother , kissed her , returned to his seat , and sat down
0	in the first place , you ’ re three times smarter than he is ; in the second place , if you ’ re not mad , why should you give a damn about what sort of crazy ideas he has ; and in the third place , that hunk of meat is a surgeon by specialty , and now he ’ s meddling in mental diseases
0	en vrai chevalier français , and constantly broke into a strong , sonorous , solitary laugh , appropriate for a dignitary
0	i did hear that , sir
0	i was looking for it at the time !
0	she walked in and went straight up to katerina ivanovna and silently put thirty silver rubles down on the table in front of her
0	he said , bustling about the room like a man who imagines himself delighted and wishes to show that he is
0	zametov had been seated on a chair in the corner
0	you know , i ’ m not married , not sophisticated , and not well known ; in addition , i ’ m all washed up , finished , sir , gone to seed and
0	and after that , dunechka and i will happily travel in a third-class railway car
0	you have the right , sir
0	he threw himself at bazarov
0	can ’ t you save up ?
0	everyone gradually fell somehow silent at his appearance
0	he merely looked at me
0	please don ’ t consider it too familiar
0	he sat down on his sofa in exhaustion , and right away an unbearable chill took hold of him again
0	as a result of our sensations
0	the first time she came ( you know , i was tired : the funeral service , the hymns , then the litany , and the meal—at last i remained alone in my study ; i lit up a cigar and was lost in thought ) , she entered in through the door
0	a euphemism for brothels
0	and the fact that he didn ’ t stand firm and he ’ s confessed makes me believe him all the more
0	i have to cauterize a cut
0	all the better ; you told me you sent for a doctor you did that to comfort yourself now comfort me : send someone to fetch
0	when asked why she wanted to go to heidelberg , her answer was the hilarious how can you ask !
0	i really don ’ t know why i felt attracted to her ; perhaps it was because she was always sickly
0	and right away he couldn ’ t stand it , spat in disgust , and ran away , furious with himself
0	i see , my friend , he said a minute later , that i ’ ve made a fool of myself once again
0	he knew her habits in part
0	his head was beginning to spin again
0	he didn ’ t want to think
0	still , you do agree it would be unpleasant to arouse any suspicion of murder ?
0	nastasyushka , don ’ t be embarrassed , help me ; that ’ s right !
0	a long time ago
0	answer : of course , some people may have gone by , but we didn ’ t notice who
0	my thoughts are getting all mixed up
0	how dare he put you in such rooms ?
0	mr razumikhin had to be deflected : two ’ s company , but three ’ s a crowd
0	arkady made no reply and turned away , while katya looked in her basket for a few more crumbs and began tossing them to the sparrows ; but the swing of her hand was too strong , and the birds flew away before they could peck at the food
0	and you ’ ll need it
0	all right , i ’ ll come , said lizaveta ivanovna , still pondering , and slowly started on her way
0	raskolnikov turned to leave
0	and he was about to leave
0	let us note , by the way , one peculiarity regarding all his definitive decisions already reached in this affair
0	i conveyed them as i myself understood them
0	she 's lovely , simply lovely , squeaked sitnikov
0	isn ’ t it really terrible !
0	do not betray him for anyone in the world , do not listen to anyone else !
0	you still don ’ t know him !
0	the language used by characters in the novel , how they speak , is verbally and semantically autonomous ; each character 's speech possesses its own belief system , since each is the speech of another in another 's language ; thus it may also refract authorial intentions and consequently may to a certain degree constitute a second language for the author
0	he ’ s wounded , but he ’ s not been killed , rest assured
0	if you wish , she said and looked at arkady , not exactly as a superior , but as married sisters regard their much younger brothers
0	then he would say , well , eight take away ten , what 's left ?
0	slight convulsions passed suddenly across his entire face
0	he stood over her
0	this man always had his own intentions and schemes
0	i really should have served in the military , sir
0	but , uncle , it 's not because of byronism that i
0	( he pointed at the dandy )
0	but enough of this
0	society—she turns to give him one last glance , he bows slightly—but turgenev modifies this ritual by telling us something else : what arkady is really perceiving in that moment
0	she still didn ’ t know anything about it , neither why , nor how , nor what for
0	do you feel sorry for me now , sir , or not ?
0	he leaned over with his candle and noticed that it was a child—a little girl aged five , no more , in a soaking-wet dress , damp as a dishrag , shivering and crying
0	principally , though , it was the youth of the heroine that lent poignancy to the characterization
0	matvei went off with the bay , he cries from the cart , and as for this ol ’ mare here , lads , she ’ s only breakin ’ my heart : i don ’ t give a damn if it kills ’ er ; she ain ’ t worth her salt
0	suddenly he felt terribly , inexpressibly carefree
0	dunyasha , a very stern young woman inside the house , but a real giggler outside , merely snorted in reply
0	the visitor did not seem surprised at all by this exclamation
0	it seemed to him that he was shoved by some caretaker with a book in his hand , as he was climbing the stairs up to the office ; that a dog burst out barking somewhere on a lower floor and that some woman hurled a rolling pin at it and shouted something
0	no , not much , svidrigaylov replied calmly
0	well , just as you ’ ve decided , added pulkheriya aleksandrovna , that ’ s how it will be
0	avdotya romanovna even extended her own hand to him , and he left extremely satisfied with his visit , all the more so with himself
0	look at me , fenechka [ it was the first time he called her that
0	he had kissed her foot and said
0	and the nerves , sir , the nerves , you ’ ve forgotten all about them , sir !
0	hey , i ’ ve slipped up !
0	dunya greeted her brother
0	he gasped for breath
0	the socialist leader lavrov reports that he bitterly complained to him of the injustice of the radicals ' change of attitude towards him
0	everything lies in a man ’ s hands , and still he lets it slip by , solely out of cowardice
0	i ’ ll speak with pashenka myself and tell her what ’ s needed
0	since i got an advance on the whole thing , for the first and the second parts , it would come to three rubles for your share
0	[ fenechka used formal address
0	sonya thought in her turn
0	he could not answer his own question satisfactorily , and his heart filled with bitterness
0	but bazarov soon stopped locking himself in : the fever to work had deserted him and been replaced by dreary boredom and vague restlessness
0	i myself feel better
0	of course it was a coincidence , but he couldn ’ t shake off the extremely extraordinary impression , and now it seemed that someone was trying to nudge him in that direction : the student suddenly began telling his comrade various details about this alyona ivanovna
0	dunechka replied abruptly and scornfully
0	you said that because you assume i have no feeling for art whatsoever—yes , in fact i lack such feeling ; but these views could have interested me from a geological point of view , for example , the formation of mountains
0	they demand it , so you go
0	bazarov continued sitting there without moving
0	he seems half mad !
0	who would that be , may i ask ?
0	the following method , among many others , is rather popular , quite a favorite , as the english would say : the high official suddenly ceases to understand even the simplest words , feigning total deafness
0	it ’ s a good thing we left now , pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to add , interrupting her
0	but for what reason did porfiry try to dupe him like that ?
0	then why the devil are you taking us to see her ?
0	a moment of silence passed
0	her imagination even exceeded the boundaries of what 's considered permissible according to the laws of conventional morality ; but even then her blood flowed as quietly as ever in her charmingly graceful and tranquil body
0	in fact , turgenev tells us that the two new mistresses ( fenechka and katya ) spend considerable time together
0	remnants of your satirical inclination showing through [ remnants !
0	would one take offense at such an expression like luzhin ’ s , if he—indicating razumikhin—had written it , or zosimov , or one of us ?
0	in his day turgenev was regarded as a leader of opinion on social problems
0	raskolnikov took the paper and cast a fleeting glance at his article
0	before you stands a mortal who 's long since come to his senses and hopes that others have also forgotten his indiscretions
0	is it all a mirage , or do they know ?
0	'et toc , et toc , et tin-tin-tin !
0	) ; i decided to offer her all my money ( i could raise around thirty thousand rubles at that time ) if she ’ d run away with me , even here to petersburg
0	but he would ’ ve told you immediately that the workmen couldn ’ t have been there two days before ; consequently , you were there precisely on the day of the murder , after seven o ’ clock
0	i assure you , it doesn ’ t take much
0	my mother would ’ ve sent money for the required fees , and i could ’ ve earned enough for boots , clothes , and bread—most likely !
0	i intend to fulfill honestly all that he expects of me ; consequently , i ’ m not deceiving him
0	katerina ivanovna was terribly glad to see him , in the first place because he was the only educated guest out of all those present and , as is well known , he was preparing to occupy a professor ’ s chair at the local university two years hence
0	a man 's first duty is to develop his own powers , to be strong and rational , to create a society in which other rational men can breathe and live and learn
0	from this it follows that neither the author 's own interpretation nor his announced intentions are necessarily to be taken as authoritative— a point we find made by turgenev himself in connection with fathers and sons
0	not exactly dishonorable , nevertheless , there they were !
0	the child began laughing again , stared at the trunk , and suddenly grabbed hold of his mother 's nose and mouth with his whole hand
0	behind the bar stood a lad about fourteen years old , and there was another , younger boy who served food if anyone ordered something
0	the concluding words [ the flowers ] tell us , too , of eternal reconciliation and of life without end do not at all tend toward mysticism , as herzen claimed and turgenev denied , but affirm that the passionate , sinning , and rebellious heart
0	well , what if he says only two days , she thought , and her heart almost stopped
0	it bad actuality [ editor ]
0	what does he want ?
0	he rushed at her with the axe ; her lips became so desperately distorted , just like those of little children when they begin to feel frightened of someone , staring at the thing that frightens them , getting ready to cry
0	but then why do you abuse others , even those very denouncers ?
0	pierre sapozhnikov do you know him ?
0	the light soon faded , but the torment remained , and zosimov , observing and studying his patient with all the youthful fervor of a doctor just beginning his practice , was surprised to notice instead of joy at the arrival of his family , some painful hidden resolve to endure unavoidable torment for another hour or two
0	but he didn ’ t trust even one of his words , although he felt some strange inclination to believe him
0	i know that a local artist took a liking to him : he started visiting mikolka , and then this incident occurred !
0	they despised him and mocked him ; those whose crimes were far worse than his made fun of his crime
0	he motioned weakly to razumikhin to end his nonstop stream of incoherent and passionate words of consolation addressed to his mother and sister , took them both by the hand , and for a few moments stared in silence , first at one , then at the other
0	nikodim fomich addressed ilya petrovich politely and amicably
0	razumikhin said , interrupting her thoughts , having guessed them as he took his enormous strides along the sidewalk so that both women could hardly keep up , which , by the way , he didn ’ t even notice
0	on the contrary , i am sure you and i are far more in the right than these young fellows , although perhaps we express ourselves in rather archaic language , viell i , and lack that arrogant self-assurance the haughtiness of these young people nowadays !
0	from the large room came the sound of songs , the music of a clarinet , a violin , and the beat of a turkish drum
0	she ’ s well known , he said
0	i do , raskolnikov continued , with a look that seemed to show that he was not talking about street singers at all
0	another woman muttered in a low voice
0	so i go runnin ’ after him , yellin ’ my head off
0	what are you doing here ?
0	he felt that he was becoming confused , almost frightened , so frightened that if she kept staring at him like that without saying anything for another minute or so , he ’ d run away from her
0	if i ’ d known this , i ’ d have sent a guard to bring him here !
0	he ’ s some kind of rogue
0	i tell you , he ’ s been meddling in mental illness
0	katerina ivanovna shouted to him ; he heard her cry and fell silent
0	norton critical edition page numbers appear in brackets
0	wait a minute , you madman , wait !
0	he takes far too many risks , father aleksei intoned , as if with sympathy , and stroked his fine beard
0	odintseva withdraws from an encounter she obscurely desires , but fears ; it is a retreat turgenev clearly endorses—a retreat that may in fact stand as emblematic of his own narrative distance from bazarov , an alien hero who he became intimate with , but expelled
0	the mention of mortality leads to the third level of attempted reconciliation , the metaphysical
0	such a completely comprehensible moment of consciousness , considered ideal by bazarov and ideal by nihilism too , has a completely legitimate place in the general process of human consciousness , —and therefore though i laugh wholeheartedly at the facts , that is , at one foolish representative or another of so-called nihilism , i do not permit myself to laugh at the general stream , at the general spirit christened with that name—whether successfully or not —and am still less capable of denying the organic-historical necessity of that eructation of materialism in new forms
0	how then , how could you give away your last kopecks , but you killed to rob her !
0	you look and listen , but it ’ s as if you don ’ t understand
0	no , thank you very much , there 's no reason
0	yes , that meant a way out had been found !
0	they have a small estate
0	svidrigaylov , someone replied from the next room in a hoarse and indifferent voice
0	pavel petrovich soon recovered , but had to stay in bed for almost a week
0	same for ringing doorbells
0	arkady quieted down and bazarov told him about his duel with pavel petrovich
0	i ’ m not a monster , sir
0	what can you promise them in return to have such a right ?
0	in any case , you wo not be bored for long
0	he was apparently unconscious , very badly dressed , but in what had once been respectable clothes ; he was covered in blood
0	they heard slippers shuffling , and vasily ivanovich appeared once again
0	she ’ s a strong young woman , sensible , patient , and generous , although she has an impassioned heart , as i ’ ve come to know well
0	in war and peace , it appears in countless forms
0	but i myself was foolish and impatient and spoiled the whole affair
0	he looked down : in his right hand he held the torn scraps of lining , the sock , and the tatters of his torn-out pocket
0	i must speak now , but i don ’ t know how to begin
0	then , quickly and almost out loud , she whispered to raskolnikov that it really would be strange if a respected and solid man like petr petrovich would find himself in such unusual company , in spite of all his devotion to her family and his former friendship with her papa
0	in the corner he could see clearly outlined the place where the icon case had stood
0	he described to the last detail the whole process of the murder : he explained the mystery of the pledge ( the piece of wood with the metal strip ) , which had turned up in the dead woman ’ s hands ; he narrated in detail how he took the dead woman ’ s keys ; he described these keys , described the chest and its contents ; he even enumerated several of the objects contained within it ; he explained the riddle of lizaveta ’ s murder ; he described how kokh had arrived and knocked at the door , followed by the student , and conveyed everything said between them ; then how he , the murderer , ran down the stairs afterward , heard the shrieks of mikolka and mitka ; how he hid in the empty apartment , then arrived back home ; and , in conclusion , he showed them the stone in the courtyard on voznesensky prospect , under the gates , where they found the pawnbroker ’ s things and her purse
0	sometimes he even felt good
0	but even at that moment he had a distant premonition that all his assurance of better times was also morbid
0	in my letter i enlarged on your qualities and actions solely in fulfillment of your mother ’ s and sister ’ s request to describe to them the condition in which i found you and what sort of impression you made on me
0	they were hostile or unresponsive
0	the former student razumikhin unearthed from somewhere information , which he presented as evidence , that the criminal raskolnikov , during his time at the university , was , with his last resources , helping a poor and consumptive fellow student and that he ’ d continued to support him for almost half a year
0	no , sir , she herself believed the whole thing ; she was consoling herself using her own imagination , so help me god !
0	but if it wasn ’ t you , who could it have been ?
0	of course , said arkady
0	he feels at home here , yet he ’ s here for the first time
0	but in short and coherent terms , raskolnikov clearly and accurately explained his business and was satisfied that he had even managed to take a good look at porfiry
0	cough , cough , cough , cough !
0	i know that you went to rent an apartment , toward nighttime , when it was growing dark ; you began ringing the bell , asking about the blood , and got the workmen and the caretakers all upset
0	at the start of their happiness , at certain moments , they were both ready to regard those seven years as seven days
0	to kozel ’ s house , in the courtyard
0	your excellency , i said , protect these orphans , because you knew , i said , the late semyon zakharych so well , and since the meanest of scoundrels slandered his own daughter the day he died
0	he raised himself up with effort
0	so you won ’ t desert me , sonya ?
0	the now-familiar thesis , first elaborated by chernyshevsky ( in his sketches of the gogol period in russian literature ) , that literature played a special role in nineteenth-century russia by comparison with its role in the other countries of europe turned quickly , in the minds of the intelligentsia , into a conviction that literature was important to the extent that it contained ideas of a sort that could not be discussed in print in any other form
0	as a matter of fact , it 's my brother , mine—even if he 's not a genius—how could it be possible ?
0	in short , is the novel written for the young generation or against it ?
0	because suffering , rodion romanych , is a great thing ; pay no attention to the fact that i ’ ve grown fat , there ’ s no need ; on the other hand , don ’ t laugh at this , but i know that suffering contains an idea
0	they have seven children
0	you ’ re lying , you clown , you damned punchinello ! # he cried , and rushed at porfiry , who retreated toward the door but didn ’ t flinch in the least
0	when raskolnikov looked at it without saying a word and then turned toward the wall , even razumikhin was a little annoyed
0	note , rodya , this is the second time someone ’ s come from that office , only the last time it wasn ’ t this man , but another one ; he and i had a little talk
0	amaliya ivanovna , feeling that she had accomplished her task extremely well , even greeted those returning with a certain pride ; she had changed her clothes and was wearing a black dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons
0	go on in , if you ’ re here !
0	moscow , you know , burned down from a candle that cost only one copeck ,
0	the court will not be as blind
0	and she said it amicably
0	she didn ’ t hear a thing
0	the children also embraced sonya from all sides with their little arms , while polechka—who didn ’ t quite understand what it was all about—seemed to be drowning in tears , shaking with sobs , burying her pretty little face , now swollen from her crying , into sonya ’ s shoulder
0	she loved to eat , but maintained strict fasts ; she slept ten hours out of every twenty-four and did not go to bed at all if vasily ivanovich had a headache ; she would never read a single book , except for alexis , or the cottage in the forest , and she wrote only one—at most two—letters a year ; but she certainly knew how to run a household , dry produce , and make preserves , even though she never touched anything with her own hands and in general preferred to remain seated in one place
0	as soon as i turned up here , i immediately learned about all your affairs ; i know it all , my friend , everything ; nastasya witnessed it all
0	bazarov , on his side , counted ten paces from the barrier and stopped
0	he wants to catch his breath , cries out , and wakes up
0	he was a boy of about seven and was walking along with his father outside town late one holiday afternoon
0	i came to show you my little bogatyr ; he missed seeing his uncle
0	in addition , a vauxhall had been built , in reality a tavern , but there one could also order tea ; moreover , there were several green tables and chairs
0	when bazarov becomes ill , when he rots alive and inexorably undergoes the cruel battle with illness , life around him becomes more tense and clear in proportion to his becoming gloomier
0	how could porfiry believe , even for a moment , that mikolka was guilty , after what had taken place between them then , after that scene , face-to-face , before mikolka arrived ?
0	let ’ s at least go out onto the landing
0	today i deserted my family , he said , my mother and my sister
0	he lay his head down on his meager , worn-out pillow , and he thought ; he thought for a long time
0	but she woke up anyway
0	a few days ago she tried to hang herself , but they cut her down
0	to help by repaying a debt to my late friend
0	a thick-legged table , piled high with papers black from dust , looking as if they would been smoked , occupied all the space between the two windows ; on the walls hung turkish guns , whips and sabers , two maps , some anatomical drawings , a portrait of hufeland , a monogram made of hair in a black frame , and a mounted diploma ; a leather sofa , worn and torn in places , stood between two enormous cupboards of karelian birchwood ; the shelves were crowded with books , boxes , stuffed birds , jars , and vials in disarray ; in one corner stood some broken electric gadget
0	now that all the danger ’ s passed , i ’ m saying this directly to you !
0	look at me , say one word i love i love you please believe me !
0	could he really be a thief ?
0	contrary to his normal behavior , he spoke a great deal and made an obvious effort to interest his interlocutor , which also surprised arkady
0	throughout this time , razumikhin had the air of someone firmly resolved
0	god , god won ’ t allow such a terrible thing !
0	avdotya romanovna , what ’ s the matter ?
0	impudent people in skullcaps were stretching their heads forward , laughing and smoking cigarettes or pipes
0	the weather was magnificent ; true , there was a distant threat of cholera , but the inhabitants of the province had managed to accustom themselves to its visitations
0	they love you very much !
0	arkady ivanovich told her directly that he was obliged to leave petersburg for an extremely important reason , and therefore he had brought her fifteen thousand silver rubles , in bills of various denominations , asking her to accept them from him in the form of a gift , since he had long been planning to give her this trifling sum before their wedding
0	i caused you a great deal of suffering , rodion romanych
0	catching his breath and pressing his hand against his pounding heart , feeling and adjusting the axe again , he began climbing the stairs cautiously and quietly , constantly listening for any sounds
0	made it worse , he replied with an offhand laugh
0	i certainly didn ’ t expect it from you , petr petrovich , all the more so given your understanding of things—oh !
0	the older papers and tea were brought
0	never mind the hair pulling , but it might even be useful to sweep out some of those fools
0	your drunken husband a horse trumpled
0	if we take the novel 's comedic structure out of context , we conclude that life is triumphant , rewarding , and meaningful
0	of course , he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-disparagement , of course , it ’ s impossible to paint over or smooth out all these mean tricks
0	i am not surprised ,
0	no , that ’ s not right either : i ’ m making a statement , and you take it down , that ’ s what !
0	but now she suddenly turned on him almost in a rage
0	is this all right , is this the right thing to do ?
0	both mother and sister regarded razumikhin with tender emotion and gratitude , as if he had been sent by providence
0	katerina sergeevna gave birth to a son , kolya , while mitya 's already running around and talking spiritedly
0	as i walked past , i was even quite astonished : such preparations are under way—wines !
0	some sort of sharp , continuous knocking sound could be heard in the courtyard ; something somewhere was being hammered , some sort of nail
0	he doesn ’ t like it
0	did you know lizaveta , the market woman ?
0	i understand ( however , don ’ t trouble yourself : you don ’ t have to say much , if you don ’ t want to ) , i understand what sort of current questions you ’ re thinking about : moral issues , right ?
0	nikolai petrovich looked at his son in embarrassment
0	an unusual , feverish , bewildering burst of activity suddenly overtook him , replacing his sleep and stupor
0	in two or three years—she ’ ll be a cripple , and all in all she ’ ll get to live only to eighteen or nineteen
0	in other words , they ’ re home , just not opening the door
0	she walked away from him , but after proceeding some fifty paces , she turned around to glance at him once more
0	the squabbles arising from this situation finally grew to such proportions that the ministry in petersburg found it necessary to dispatch a trusted personage to investigate the entire matter on the spot
0	he didn ’ t think about anything
0	both brothers watched him in silence , while arkady glanced stealthily first at his father , then at his uncle
0	not everyone will tell you that , and , in fact , i wo not tell you so another time
0	the educated valet was scared to death ; bazarov calmed him with the assurance that all he had to do was stand at a distance and watch
0	ah , what scoundrels , scoundrels !
0	razumikhin was silent for a minute
0	once—it was morning—pavel petrovich was feeling better and had been moved from his bed to the sofa ; after inquiring about his health , nikolai petrovich set off for the barn
0	well , now there ’ s a painter involved in it
0	turgenev himself will never be a bazarov , but he has pondered this type and gained an understanding of it so true that not one of our young realists has yet achieved it
0	if you wish to fulfill my request , do so quickly , so that i could add a translation of the most important parts of the review to my literary reminiscences , which are to appear soon
0	that is , if you are a god , i must be a dolt ?
0	it ’ s a formality ; it ’ s not the main thing
0	and in that i probably did not succeed ; but i only want to fend off the reproach that i was exasperated with him
0	i don ’ t know what to wish you in return , replied raskolnikov , already heading down the stairs , but suddenly turning again to porfiry
0	you know the saying , 'the grass is always greener , replied bazarov
0	are you really that weak in natural history or have you forgotten that the jackdaw 's the most respectable family bird ?
0	while they were knocking and talking , the idea occurred to him several times of ending it all and calling out to them from his side of the door
0	but i think there 's no need to hurry
0	yes , i understand you , and i hear you , sir !
0	raskolnikov stopped near a large group of women
0	enough of that , evgeny vasilich
0	don ’ t worry about her ; i ’ ll calm her down ; but don ’ t torment her—come just once ; remember , she ’ s your mother !
0	you are so modest but i would like to find out something about you , your family , your father—for whom you are forsaking us
0	i ’ ll talk to her
0	in that case , we will
0	remember that our entire future depends on whether you can clear all this up and be reconciled as quickly as possible , or not
0	we write in some hazy , distant spot for everyone and for posterity and hence for no one
0	so the days passed
0	with him , he said in a broken voice , indicating razumikhin
0	question : when you were working with mitrei , did you see anyone on the staircase , at such and such an hour ?
0	his face had turned red
0	but we ’ ll talk about it later
0	why , you despise all of us
0	don ’ t you see that ?
0	go on , brother , pull !
0	in his role as the general 's son , nikolai petrovich—not only was he undistinguished by bravery , but he would even earned a reputation as something of a coward—was required , just like his brother , pavel , to enter military service ; but he managed to break his leg the very day he received news of his commission , and , after spending two months in bed , retained a slight limp for the rest of his life
0	they brought her to sonya ’ s room almost dead and laid her on the bed
0	this occurred at ten o ’ clock in the morning
0	he cried to the mother and sister
0	why , you , of course , aren ’ t a nihilist , are you ?
0	you forgot , you remembered , you forgot ’ —what ’ s all that about ?
0	did he personally have anything to fear or not ?
0	odintseva 's response to bazarov 's embrace is similar to arkady 's repulsion of his friend 's masculine intimacies : she claims misunderstanding
0	and it ’ s in the last month i ’ ve learned to prattle , lying for days and nights in my corner , thinking about
0	i don ’ t judge you , nor dare i , for having deserted us ; forgive me for having reproached you previously
0	raskolnikov asked himself in astonishment , lifting his head and staring intently at porfiry
0	he cried in despair a moment later , regarding her with endless suffering
0	you know the saying , 'the russian peasant would devour god himself
0	and as a matter of fact , at that moment some noise could be heard in the other room , right behind the door
0	you sleep on a feather bed ( a doctor , even !
0	now we ’ ll match strengths !
0	but all of a sudden he stopped like someone rooted to the ground
0	he began to untie the bundle , which apparently interested him greatly
0	i now see that you ’ re also an intelligent man
0	in our educated russian society there are no sacred traditions , avdotya romanovna : someone may compile them from books for himself
0	give it to me !
0	most likely , you yourself , mademoiselle , won ’ t refuse to confirm and declare that i asked you to come , through andrey semyonych , solely in order to talk about the orphaned and desperate situation of your relative katerina ivanovna ( whose funeral dinner i was unable to attend ) , and about how it might be useful to organize something like a subscription , a lottery , or something similar , for her benefit
0	characteristic of an enlightened higher official
0	i must have caught a cold
0	fathers and sons was translated into german several times
0	a while ago i chose you to tell ; back when your father spoke about you and when lizaveta was alive , i thought of this
0	his first essay to depict such a woman is his unfinished play , the temptation of saint anthony ( ) , which is an explicit imitation of merimée 's la femme est un diable
0	and you , could you bear it ?
0	raskolnikov fixed his eyes on him , as if seizing on and weighing every word
0	these were arkady 's thoughts and while he pondered , spring was making itself felt
0	he turned to everyone present
0	what can i do with it now ?
0	how to render the tight little work of art that turgenev has made of the dog , narrated by an ex-hussar , with his colloquialisms , his pungent sayings , his terseness and his droll turns ?
0	what ’ s the matter with you ?
0	at that moment you arrived ( at my request ) ; all the while you were extremely agitated , so that three times in the middle of our conversation you even stood up and prepared to leave for some reason , even though the conversation had not yet ended
0	two weeks later arina sa-vishna ( that was the new housekeeper 's name ) arrived at marino together with her daughter and settled in the lodge
0	they ’ re talking such nonsense
0	such a character zone is the field of action for a character 's voice , encroaching in one way or another upon the author 's voice
0	it only meant that the moment had come
0	we have heard it , we have heard it by the way , why are not you wearing it ?
0	i have a grandmother who was eighty-five—what a martyr she was !
0	what affair with anna sergeevna ?
0	sonya looked at him wildly and began trembling
0	how old is he ?
0	we will see how you will fare in a void , a vacuum ; and now , brother , nikolai petrovich , please ring for the servants because it 's time for me to drink my cocoa
0	the retired quartermaster cried suddenly , draining his twelfth glass of vodka
0	for a moment a storm flares up in his father 's soul
0	last year he assured us for some reason that he was going to become a monk : for two months he insisted on it !
0	what about the earrings ?
0	that means you still believe in life ; thank god , rodya , thank god !
0	he 's always silent—it would be better if he would berate us ; he 's growing thin and his color is poor
0	he was not mistaken in his recollections : this out-of-the-way hotel was so conspicuous that it was impossible to miss even in the darkness
0	oh , if i were alone and no one loved me , and if i myself never loved anyone ?
0	the evidence was unmistakable !
0	we sense those values above all in the voice that tells the story , with its cultivated taste and its refined sensibility
0	raskolnikov went as far as sadovaya and then turned the corner
0	i ’ m not particularly interested in anyone ’ s opinion , svidrigaylov replied matter-of-factly , even with a hint of arrogance
0	i ’ ll find out , no matter what !
0	raskolnikov sat and listened without moving , without turning , his elbows on the table , looking to one side
0	she 's so fresh , unspoiled , timid , taciturn , anything you like
0	what has happened here ?
0	no , what ’ s so annoying is that they ’ re lying and believe their own lies
0	my illness seems to have passed
0	in the first place , i am not kind at all ; in the second , i have lost all importance for you , and you tell me i am a kind person that 's just like placing a wreath of flowers on a corpse 's head
0	that voice was about to begin again but stopped short
0	not in vain did schiller say
0	but as soon as the chick starts to approach , you run like hell !
0	batyuto , who has also devoted considerable attention to the examination of turgenev 's use of philosophy , sees even less evidence of hegelianism in turgenev 's oeuvre than does chizhevsky
0	but he judged himself severely , and his embittered conscience could find no particularly terrible guilt in his past , aside from his simple blunder , which could have happened to anyone
0	a tearful woman ’ s voice called out from nearby
0	you ’ ll see that you can get along with me
0	such are the wonders of love
0	tell me , please , what do you have in common or does he have—zosimov nodded at raskolnikov—with this zametov ?
0	what can i say ?
0	i managed to understand a little bit of what you were saying then
0	on the contrary : you wouldn ’ t have seen anything , even if you really had seen it !
0	the shout rings out : pull !
0	happiness—real , prosaic happiness—is never brilliant
0	over life to almost pathological extremes ( order is needed in everything , she repeats )
0	and reproach her for the favors you ’ d bestowed on her ?
0	after mikolka , on that same day , came the scene at sonya ’ s ; he had conducted it and concluded it not at all , not in the least as he had imagined it all before
0	seeking the happiness of your hand in marriage , at the same time i can not assume any obligations incompatible with
0	she ’ s quite a phenomenon !
0	the tradition of all dead generations weighs down the brain of the living
0	he decided to take the ring ; after locating the old woman , right from the first glance , without knowing anything in particular about her , he conceived an insurmountable loathing for her ; he received two small notes from her and on his way home dropped by a shabby little tavern
0	wait a moment , i want to smell it with you , bazarov said
0	please arrange for the horses
0	will you take it or not ?
0	the unwelcome guest was already standing at the door , too
0	there 's so much strength in you , youth in full bloom , ability , talent !
0	shortly after , when arkadi comments on odintsova 's beauty , bazarov agrees : a splendid body !
0	it was still very early ; the morning chill had not yet passed
0	my friends , never justify yourself no matter how you may be slandered ; do not try to clear up misunderstandings , do not try either to say the final word or to listen to it
0	it was all conducted in accord with absolute order and complete accuracy ; the medical investigation determined that it was apoplexy resulting from bathing too soon after consuming a heavy meal , including almost a full bottle of wine ; they couldn ’ t come to any other conclusion
0	i would , zametov replied firmly and seriously ; he began speaking and staring a bit too intensely
0	what are you doing to our mother ?
0	i have accurate information
0	very much , replied dunya
0	she did not appear until dinner and kept pacing her room , arms behind her back , stopping from time to time in front of the window or the mirror , slowly wiping her handkerchief over her neck where she still seemed to feel a burning spot
0	there , behind a partition , two of the landlord ’ s servants were attending to two large samovars next to bottles , plates , and dishes with pies and snacks brought up from the landlord ’ s kitchen
0	it was clear to raskolnikov that this man was someone whose mind was firmly set on something and who was also very crafty
0	do not talk like that , she began , as if you have experienced it all
0	he 's happy , too , the old dog , i can tell
0	razumikhin frequently paused along the way , impelled by the heat of the conversation , confused and agitated solely by the fact that it was the first time they had spoken plainly about that
0	you weren ’ t yourself , sir
0	can this really be the continuation of my dream ?
0	nikolai petrovich turned around quickly and , advancing toward a tall man in a long , loose garment with tassels who had just climbed out of the coach , warmly shook his bare , ruddy hand , which had not been immediately extended
0	( she had the habit , like many of our provincial and moscow ladies , of calling men by their surname from the moment she met them )
0	the old man didn ’ t reply and for a long time was unable to understand what he was being asked , even though his neighbors began shaking him to amuse themselves
0	well , go on then , little housewife , get busy , do not disgrace us ; meanwhile , gentlemen , i invite you to follow me
0	first he would prove to my sister and my mother that he was almost right in his suspicions ; that he had been justified in getting angry at me for having placed my sister on a level with sofiya semyonovna ; that by attacking me , he was therefore defending and preserving the honor of my sister and his fiancée
0	it wound up in periodical discourses
0	a burden had been lifted from his shoulders
0	will that really and truly occur ?
0	if we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life , wrote george eliot , it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel 's heart beat , and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence
0	we understood everything from the moment he walked in ; he ’ s not a man of our circle
0	before he used to avoid me
0	don ’ t be in such a hurry to talk about mitka
0	odintseva 's flirtation with the forbidden will be repeated dramatically in her encounter with bazarov ; the narrator 's own ambiguous position—between decorum and erotic curiosity—is played out in an earlier dialogue between arkady and bazarov , when they first meet odintseva
0	and you sit here , he said to razumikhin , placing him in the corner zosimov had occupied
0	yes , who are you ?
0	she adhered to it very strictly and forced others to submit as well
0	well , who was that ?
0	the price was one ruble and fifty kopecks
0	well , how can i be a victim ?
0	raspberry jam , my dear , she can get in a shop
0	i don ’ t believe you !
0	praskovya pavlovna wants to complain to the police about you , she said
0	people dealt too severely with that madman
0	she ’ s somewhat talkative and loves to go on about family matters , especially complaining about her husband to each and every person , which is not a good thing ; so she spread the whole story in a very short time , not only in town , but throughout the district
0	repeated svidrigaylov , still without moving or turning around
0	i warn you—i ’ m proud of these trousers !
0	at that , amaliya ivanovna was even more offended and objected , saying that her vater from berlin vas a very , very important mann , and alvayz valked mit ze hends in ze pockets
0	all of a sudden raskolnikov felt paralyzed , as if he were asleep , dreaming that he was being chased ; they were getting closer , wanting to kill him , while he was rooted to the spot and unable even to move his arms
0	like katya , fenechka brings the natural world into the kirsanovs ' manor house
0	i am , if you please , vrazumikhin , not razumikhin , as they all call me , but vrazumikhin , a student , the son of a gentleman , and this fellow is my friend
0	this would be a good place to hide the stuff and get away , he thought suddenly
0	haven ’ t you heard it in church ?
0	that ’ s the first thing
0	besides , i confess , your question is extremely complicated for me , and i find it difficult to answer
0	didn ’ t i just now experience real life ?
0	the thing is—i once posed this question to myself : what would happen , for example , if napoleon were in my place , and if , to begin his career , there was no toulon , no egypt , and no crossing mont blanc ; † instead of all these beautiful and monumental things , there was merely some ridiculous old woman , a civil servant ’ s widow , who , moreover , must be killed so he could steal money from her trunk ( for his career , do you understand ?
0	good for mikolka , that he ’ s confessed
0	i mean , how did we create it , tell me please !
0	what do you suppose that fellow 's thinking about us now ?
0	his sharp voice , his persuasive tone , and his stern face produced an extraordinary effect on everyone
0	i ’ ve learned all this psychology in my legal practice , sir
0	forsaking society of that sort is just like splashing yourself with cold water on a hot day
0	he took her hand at once and lifted himself up
0	you ’ re known to be like gunpowder : you can ’ t tolerate any insults
0	he cried , gathering all the powers of his reason to discern the point of porfiry ’ s game
0	there is an apocalyptic tendency in the crisis of culture
0	upon entering the building , he downed a shot of vodka and ate a little pie with some sort of filling
0	but i ca not turn back now !
0	i became ill partly as a result
0	in a word , there were hundreds of questions before him
0	i went to ask her for some money to buy a drink so i could get rid of my hangover !
0	who , tell me , who out of all the people accused of crimes , even if they ’ re absolute muzhiks , ‡ who doesn ’ t know , for example , that at first they begin to lull you with irrelevant questions ( in your own fortuitous expression ) and then all of a sudden hit you over the head , with an axe , sir , ha-ha-ha , over your head , in your fortuitous phrase , ha-ha !
0	i will leave you now ; you must get some rest
0	the door to the apartment was wide open , there were people inside , and voices could be heard : he hadn ’ t expected that at all
0	i ’ ve been having dinner here like this for the last three days , my friend rodya , he muttered , as best he could with his mouth filled with beef , and it ’ s all thanks to your nice landlady , pashenka , who does me the honor of feeding me
0	excuse me , muttered the gentleman , frightened by both raskolnikov ’ s question and his strange look , and crossed to the other side of the street
0	i am made in the image of a beast , but my wife , katerina ivanovna , is an educated person , born the daughter of a field officer
0	my mother also says that it resembles a coffin
0	the street and the crowd frightened her terribly
0	well , perhaps , perhaps—i do not want to argue
0	then , you watch out !
0	at first pavel petrovich uttered disconnected words ; then he suddenly opened his eyes and , seeing his brother next to his bed , bending over him solicitously , he asked , nikolai , do not you think fenechka has something in common with nellie ?
0	sometimes he got into brawls , and he was reputed to be a very strong man
0	let him , she says , let him see how the well-born children of their father who was a civil servant now go begging in the streets !
0	you say she 's cold
0	he whispered , once again glancing warily at dunya
0	a haughty grin appeared on his lips
0	they were both drawing up plans for the future ; they were both counting firmly on settling in siberia after five years
0	lifetime , and to their considerable dismay , had managed to fall in love with the daughter of a certain prepolovensky , a low-ranking civil servant and the previous owner of their apartment
0	moreover , the character speech almost always influences authorial speech ( and sometimes powerfully so ) , sprinkling it with another 's words ( that is , the speech of a character perceived as the concealed speech of another ) and in this way introducing into it stratification and speech diversity
0	i wanted to say that i really do not understand why you have settled down in the country
0	he shouted , probably astonished that such a ragged fellow hadn ’ t considered effacing himself when confronted with his scorching gaze
0	is this my delirium continuing or is this real ?
0	yesterday someone said to me that a man needs air , air , air !
0	but on every page he writes , 'to battle , to battle !
0	do you have a cross ?
0	eventually , those characters who seemed most unalike are aligned ; their similarities become more important than their initial differences
0	all right , muttered raskolnikov
0	enyusha 's breaking my heart , he complained to his wife in secret
0	lida , she said , addressing her younger daughter , you ’ ll go to sleep tonight without your shirt ; somehow
0	for the honor of russia !
0	raskolnikov interrupted , momentarily starting to remember
0	forgive me for speaking so crudely
0	except that i will always be here for you , as you will for me
0	i wouldn ’ t have allowed that conversation yesterday
0	the day was once again clear and warm
0	the difference in the two brothers ' situations was too great
0	† a collection of articles translated from french and german and published in petersburg in
0	your mother , it seems , has entirely forgotten that i decided to accept you , so to speak , after the gossip in town concerning your reputation had spread throughout the entire district
0	you overlook one of a million details—and there ’ s evidence the size of an egyptian pyramid !
0	he asked suddenly , turning to him
0	where could i stash the sock , the fringe , the lining ?
0	he felt that his mouth was dry , his heart was pounding , and foam was forming on his lips
0	don ’ t get so upset
0	both his mother and his sister were terribly frightened ; razumikhin , too
0	it ’ s no good , he muttered to himself
0	from the outset arkadi is glad to be hugged and kissed by his father and hugs and kisses him in return , calling him daddy ( papasha ) ; even bazarov 's presence is only faintly inhibiting
0	mr razumikhin ’ s not the one , sir ; he ’ s an outsider ; he came running to me completely pale
0	he had his own aims
0	the workmen looked at him in confusion
0	that ’ s just katerina ivanovna telling tales because she didn ’ t understand a thing
0	he felt like sitting or lying down somewhere in the street
0	he was dressed in an old , completely worn-out tailcoat , missing most of its buttons
0	it ’ s indecent here with this crowd
0	sonya ’ s room seemed to resemble a barn ; it had an irregular quadrilateral shape that suggested something deformed
0	in this letter she reproached him in the most impassioned way and with total indignation for his dishonorable treatment of marfa petrovna
0	and , indeed , there were conservatives who congratulated turgenev for exposing the horrors of the new , destructive nihilism , and thereby rendering a public service for which all men of decent feeling must be grateful
0	cried razumikhin , apparently overjoyed that he ’ d received an answer
0	that poor ol ’ horse must be twenty if she ’ s a day , lads !
0	and why in secret ?
0	however , if so , then let it be so
0	he ’ ll create some sort of scandal in the french manner in a disreputable establishment over a glass of champagne or sparkling wine—that ’ s who your zametov is !
0	and commands the involuntary respect of every reader
0	i am not like that
0	sonya , perhaps i don ’ t want to go to prison yet , he said
0	timofeich muttered ( recalling the strict orders he would received from his master before departure )
0	it ’ s not that it ’ s very illiterate , and it ’ s not that it ’ s very literary ; it ’ s just businesslike
0	i thought i would find him here and propose he take a walk with me
0	nikodim fomich asked him rather harshly
0	the expression of his eyes , somewhat strangely , didn ’ t match his whole figure , which had something womanish about it , and lent it something far more serious than one might expect at first sight
1	natasha lit the candles and sat down
1	his horse had been shot from under him , and his arm had been slightly grazed by a bullet
1	his face was tender , pitiful
1	m d akhrosimov and denisov are exceptional characters to whom i involuntarily and thoughtlessly gave names that closely resemble those of two particularly distinctive and dear real persons of the society of that time
1	he came to the grandmother 's almost every summer , usually very sick , to rest and recuperate
1	he at once took prince shch
1	and she left the room
1	and how angry she was with me when i explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was just as eager as i poor marfa petrovna was awfully weak on the side of flattery , and if i had only cared to , i might have had all her property settled on me during her lifetime
1	more than two thousand people had watched , like a performance , the four friends ' successful fanfaronnade , a fanfaronnade of which they were far from suspecting the real motive
1	i , too , went over—and i do not understand why i also found this young man likable , as it were ; maybe by his all-too-spectacular violation of conventional and banalized proprieties ; in short , i failed to discern the fool in him ; anyhow , we were on familiar terms there and then , and as we got off the train , i chapter five learned from him that he would be coming to tverskoy boulevard that evening after eight
1	pierre wanted to write down all the money he had on the list of alms , but was afraid of showing pride and wrote down the same amount as the others did
1	and besides , it would have been one thing if stepanov had suffered ; but he had been vindicated by all the officers without that
1	he was lying , lying , by god !
1	then don ’ t tell it
1	ah , don ’ t let it slip away !
1	you did not warn me , and today i demanded my month 's salary from him
1	and there was something else here as well , too awful and disturbing
1	so your orders are to take the big sterlet ?
1	of simonov 's two guests , one was ferfichkin , from russian-german stock – short , monkey-faced , a fool who comically mimicked everyone , my bitterest enemy even in the lower grades — a mean , impudent little fanfaron who played at being most ticklishly ambitious , though of course he was a coward at heart
1	what are you grinning at : that i ’ ve disgraced myself with you ?
1	he promised we would dine in a private room with athenian women , and he served up the pockmarked one instead of the women , and , besides that , i did not finish eating and froze in the cold a sure eighteen roubles ' worth
1	god rest her soul , exclaimed pulcheria alexandrovna
1	no , that 's loathsome water it 's not good enough , he muttered to himself
1	the second day of september was warm and still , but gray
1	oui , oui , je comprends , j'ai compris au commencement prince , anna andreevna raised her voice , you insult me and allow me to be insulted !
1	one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would come from such a description of the duel that took place
1	we convey this anecdote to the public , vouching for its veracity
1	raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion
1	oh , with what happiness i shall press you to my heart !
1	i do not know how to say it ; but highly developed people , it seems to me , can not have triumphant and victoriously happy faces
1	but nothing would have turned him back : his decision was taken
1	i was not vouchsafed a personal interview at nine o'clock precisely razumihin reached the lodgings at bakaleyev 's house
1	be that as it may , only stepan kuzmich left you a deed of gift for that very estate i have been talking about
1	he will say , 'come forth ye drunkards , come forth , ye weak ones , come forth , ye children of shame !
1	having snapped out these last words in soldierly fashion and waved his arms as if throwing something on the ground , the drummer , a lean and handsome soldier of about forty , sternly looked the soldier-singers over and narrowed his eyes
1	always wakes you up
1	pierre 's subjection consisted in his not daring , not only to flirt , but even to talk smilingly with another woman , not daring to go to clubs or dinners just to pass the time , not daring to spend money on whims , not daring to leave for long periods of time except on business , in which his wife also included his intellectual pursuits , of which she understood nothing , but to which she ascribed great importance
1	ah , pla he began , and did not finish
1	that 's why i speak
1	all day sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety
1	kindly do as you are ordered
1	i will be especially grateful to you ; and i am very glad that this incident has afforded me the pleasure of making your acquaintance
1	but your ideal is too low , they will say with scorn
1	only here it would call for a deacon , or at least a subdeacon
1	so 'he took his suffering
1	when rumors of this reached kiev and the theologian khalyava heard , finally , that such had been the lot of the philosopher khoma , he fell to thinking for a whole hour
1	you lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly
1	as she was putting on a tacked together and still sleeveless bodice , turning her head to see in the mirror how the back fitted , she heard animated voices from the drawing room , one her father 's and the other a woman 's voice which made her blush
1	a swishing is often heard in the carpathians , the sound as of a thousand mill wheels turning in the water
1	i just stood there
1	kolya , lida , where are you going ?
1	well , who told you i am not meeting a lover ?
1	good-bye , dear heart , said tushin , you good soul !
1	i somehow did not dare to start comforting her , though i often came precisely with that intention ; but in her presence i somehow had difficulty approaching her , and i could not come up with the right words to begin speaking about it
1	he drank several glasses of lafite with pleasure , then pulled the blanket over his head ; his consciousness went dim , and he fell asleep
1	with a sinking heart and a nervous tremor , he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal , and on the other into the street
1	alpatych named for him some muzhiks whom he knew and from whom he ordered the carts to be taken
1	he ca not do anything , ca not speak , but i understand everything he wishes with his dear eyes
1	i do not wash it , and rent it out to lambert unwashed as it is , for crushing other people 's heads on occasions that lambert finds ticklish
1	but rostov had noticed his first reaction
1	but , we hasten to say , the young man 's sadness came less from regret for his lost happiness than from the fear he felt lest some misfortune befall the poor woman
1	i will tell you about myself , count
1	where are you going ?
1	strange to say , he seemed immediately to have become perfectly calm ; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic fear that had haunted him of late
1	felton stepped ashore , climbed the little crest that led to the top of the cliff , saluted milady a last time , and set out for the town
1	it was past two o'clock and no one was asleep yet when the quartermaster appeared with orders to set out for the little village of ostrovna
1	i am always ready to have a talk with you ; the sooner the better , even
1	in the bell tower there was also scurrying and shouting
1	he crossed over to him , but at once the man turned and walked away with his head hanging , as though he had made no sign to him
1	he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise
1	boundless spite came over ganya , and his rage exploded without restraint
1	i have , too , a very important legal affair in the senate , not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture
1	is everything all right with you there ?
1	well , replied the latter , blushing , what must i do ?
1	he came in already knowing all the rumors spread among the public and having perhaps even contributed to them himself
1	only please don ’ t be triumphant , dear boy , she ’ s not yours ; i won ’ t believe it , and it will never be !
1	ippolit stopped , looked at him intently and with relish , shifted his gaze to varya , grinned , bowed , and left without adding a single word
1	the whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten their morning conversation , that his decision remained in force , and that it was only owing to the presence of the guests that he did not tell her so now
1	only he was forced to keep silent , having no understanding of the language being spoken around him
1	oh , how low i have sunk !
1	porfiry could not sit still
1	know , then , that if i hate anyone here , he screamed , wheezing , shrieking , spraying from his mouth , and i hate all of you , all of you ! —but you , you jesuitical , treacly little soul , idiot , millionairebenefactor , i hate you more than anyone or anything in the world !
1	i gave a start , and understanding immediately came back to me part two in full force
1	cried lizaveta prokofyevna , but she seized one herself and sat down facing ippolit
1	besides , kitty would not want to live on the rue aux ours , would you , kitty ?
1	he pointed to the bottle
1	as before , they still never spoke of him , so as not to violate with words , as it seemed to them , that lofty feeling that was in them , and this silence about him had the effect that little by little , without believing it , they began to forget him
1	there were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash lasted while one could count five
1	i quickly left the house
1	[ ] and still less comprehensible remains the ceasing of this movement once a reasonable , holy purpose for the campaign—the deliverance of jerusalem—had been set by the historical actors
1	this politic of louis xiii made richelieu smile
1	they say he 's accessible to eveghrybody , thank god
1	no , and you , porthos ?
1	natasha listened with concentrated attention , trying to understand the meaning of his words , and not understanding
1	well , to you , to you alone i ’ ll tell the truth , because you can see through a man : words , deeds , lies , truth—they ’ re all there together in me and completely sincere
1	lizaveta prokofyevna did not say a word to him all the way , but he seemed not to notice it
1	he was sooner troubled by another thought that tormented him
1	marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man
1	and did you see the princess ?
1	and do you know the man who committed this ravishment ?
1	and darya frantsovna , a woman of evil character and very well known to the police , had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady
1	pensez , il y va du salut de son âme ah !
1	had he really been expecting something or not ?
1	i find his faces even more expressive than titian 's
1	i can imagine nothing more awful !
1	katerina ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl , wearing a torn straw hat , crushed in a hideous way on one side , was really frantic
1	not a single layman to sixty head of clergy , and this is a horrible thought , a historical thought , a statistical thought , finally , and it is from such facts that the knowing man constructs history ; for it is asserted with numerical exactitude that the clergy lived at least sixty times more happily and freely than the rest of mankind at that time
1	a big thing if a sow goes out in the street !
1	then i told you that at andronikov 's everybody read a lot , and the young ladies knew many poems by heart and played scenes from woe from wit among themselves , and that last week we all read a hunters sketches aloud together , and that i loved krylov 's fables most of all and knew them by heart
1	my father had always seen talent in him and was particularly well-disposed toward him for that
1	hearing this answer , velchaninov , who was pacing the room , suddenly stopped almost solemnly in front of pavel pavlovich :
1	he was terribly worried
1	sounds like the clink of money , said the inspector , hearing something thud on the floor and unable to see it for the quickness of chartkov 's movement as he rushed to pick it up
1	the waiter with the platter bellowed , kneeling down
1	i keep creating the scene in the cathedral , just so , imagining it in my head
1	if he had been sentenced to be burnt at that moment , he would not have stirred , would hardly have heard the sentence to the end
1	the girls cooed plaintively , at the same time glancing at him with bitterness
1	i spent whole hours looking out my windows at the sky , the birds , the avenues , read everything that came in the mail , slept
1	but are not you suffering , too ?
1	the prince was very glad to be left alone at last ; he went down from the terrace , crossed the road , and entered the park ; he wanted to think over and decide about a certain step
1	kolya stopped , was about to say something , but lebedev pulled him after him
1	why , there could not be a kinder soul than hers !
1	seeing denisov , this man hastily flung something into the bushes and , taking off his soaked hat with its drooping brim , went up to his commander
1	well , all right , speak the truth , he said heavily , obviously after a great struggle
1	at the present moment she 's in paris
1	yes , yes , we must flee , mme bonacieux repeated , but without being able to take a step : terror nailed her to the spot
1	the dreadful news of the battle of borodino , of our losses in dead and wounded , and the still more dreadful news about the loss of moscow , were received in voronezh in the middle of september
1	prince andrei regained consciousness in the morning
1	there 's no way to tell
1	raskolnikov asked , as though startled
1	but , precisely because of that rage , he was blind ; otherwise he would long since have paid attention to the fact that this idiot , whom he mistreated so , was sometimes capable of understanding everything all too quickly and subtly , and of giving an extremely satisfactory account of it
1	that muzhik was telling , the one there at mozhaisk where the battle was , it took ten villages to cart them off , and they were twenty days at it , and there were still some dead left
1	right after his wife , the general put in his own little word :
1	he arrived at s in the morning and took the best room in the hotel , where the whole floor was covered with gray army flannel and there was an inkstand on the table , gray with dust , with a horseback rider , who held his hat in his raised hand , but whose head was broken off
1	give up the old things , forget them as if they would never been , as if it was only a dream , and start a new life
1	nastasya from a distance could not have noticed , thank god !
1	he was fat as could be
1	a poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart
1	only the recognition of that feeling in him made the people choose him in such a strange way—him , an old man in disgrace—against the will of the tsar , as representative of the national war
1	i could not bear it
1	the dream was at once conveyed triumphantly to lizaveta prokofyevna by her two laughing sisters ; but the mother again became angry and called all three of them fools
1	and vile is he who calls him vile for that , he added a moment later
1	the french columns that had moved out of the village went back , but , as if in punishment for this failure , the enemy set up ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at tushin
1	one ran each side
1	in this vice at least there is something permanent , founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy , something present in the blood like an ever‐burning ember , for ever setting one on fire and , maybe , not to be quickly extinguished , even with years
1	only no , dearie , you are obsolete !
1	si jeune et accablé de cette richesse , que de tentations n'aura-t-il pas a subir !
1	is it for this that i named you captain of my musketeers , that they should murder a man , stir up a whole quarter , and try to burn down paris without your saying a word ?
1	she exclaimed , raising her hand to her face and as if trying to cover herself with it
1	and do you think i enjoy talking about them ?
1	he was being shown out by the landlady ( the landlord had not come home from work yet )
1	it 's a good place
1	what did you do with her , if you do not have her anymore ?
1	it was a long and narrow closet ; at the height of my shoulder , not more , the angle between the wall and the roof began , the top of which i could touch with my palm
1	it communicates with my mistress 's bedroom by that door
1	they all seemed fully immersed in these occupations
1	there 's only one partition between my room and milady 's ; in the one you hear everything that 's said in the other
1	he obviously listened only because he had ears , which , despite the fact that one of them was stopped up with hemp , could not help listening ; but it was obvious not only that he could not be surprised or interested in anything the general on duty could tell him , but that he knew beforehand everything he was being told and listened to it only because he had to listen , as one has to listen to the singing of a prayer service
1	so we can just as well founder four horses as one
1	going into his little room , andrei handed the letter to his wife and said :
1	he himself would have been unable to say how long he had been sitting there
1	you know , marie , he said , today ilya mitrofanych ( this was the business manager ) came from the tambov estate and told me that they are now offering eighty thousand for the timber , and with an animated face , nikolai began talking about the possibility of buying back otradnoe in a very short time
1	good gracious , ivan ivanovich !
1	life in kolomna is terribly solitary : there is rarely a carriage , except maybe the kind actors go around in , which with its rumbling , jingling , and clanking is all that disturbs the universal silence
1	i just ran to fetch some water , said mishka
1	shivers kept running down his spine
1	raskolnikov cried , with positive anger
1	you are all bought , bought outright , and why try to obtain love if everything is possible without love ?
1	and he talked so strangely ; it seemed somehow comprehensible , but yet but how , how !
1	sonia flew at him again
1	lord de winter asked in his mocking and contemptuous voice
1	i ask you to carry out my will , afanasy ivanovich , said pulkheria ivanovna
1	raskolnikov thought with repulsion
1	perhaps every fiancee feels the same way before her wedding
1	the french , finding no owners , settled everywhere not as in quarters in a town , but as in a camp located in a town
1	in the middle stood the black coffin
1	well , god be with you
1	raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance , though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon , but even perhaps could have walked about
1	it 's even hard to believe he 's no longer in the world !
1	let me try it on
1	leave again this very moment
1	and he therefore gave gapka orders to keep an eye out at all times everywhere for dry straw stuck someplace or other
1	and much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days !
1	for a whole month , and a drunk man can not only be married off but can even be seduced into a different faith
1	can this be another attempt at vengeance from that woman ?
1	what 's the good of these theaters ?
1	denisov was dressed in a cossack coat , wore a beard and an icon of st nicholas the wonderworker on his chest , and in his manner of speaking , in all his ways , expressed the singularity of his position
1	he said , shaking his head—why , she is quite a child !
1	i ’ ve told you everything
1	he knew sonya would pass that way
1	she seemed not to understand
1	young girls with a whole mercer 's shop of ribbons wound round their heads , and with beads , crosses , and coin necklaces on their necks , tried to make their way still closer to the iconostasis
1	but is not he dead ?
1	involuntarily , general events group themselves around some specific occurrence
1	vereshchagin was tried and sentenced to death , thought rastopchin ( though the senate had only sentenced vereshchagin to hard labor )
1	do you suppose—— pulcheria alexandrovna continued warmly
1	i am not saying i regret ; no , i will never utter that phrase , which would not be orthodox the jesuit raised his arms to heaven , and the curate did the same
1	no , replied pierre , laughing and looking over his big , fat body
1	i did it just like that … to test you
1	but now that the prince had begun to speak , they became still more worried
1	are you ill , eh ?
1	fortunately , mikhail averyanych got bored sitting in the hotel room , and after dinner he went out for a stroll
1	at the very beginning of the campaign , our armies are cut in two , and the one goal we aim at consists in reuniting them , though for retreating and luring the enemy into the depths of the country , uniting the armies is not advantageous
1	between them , a little to the side , was a small , round table
1	in the study there were four gentlemen from the diplomatic corps
1	another two or three months of going a bit hungry—and akaky akakievich had , indeed , about eighty roubles
1	but at the critical moment , the courier who brought the news of our victory at pultusk brings us from petersburg our nomination as commander in chief , and the first enemy , buxhöwden , is sunk : we can think about the second , bonaparte
1	nothing but lovely childishness , sir !
1	it 's seductively clear and you mus not think about it
1	it 's a shame , pyotr petrovich !
1	so it was with the help of his mother 's memory , plus a few books of local history and old ukrainian epic songs , that gogol set about creating the little russia of evenings on a farm near dikanka and mirgorod
1	roared razumihin ; but raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer
1	how did it happen ?
1	nobody liked the idea
1	on such occasions she usually stopped talking and merely looked at her brother silently , mockingly , not taking her eyes off him
1	and if anyone had added that aglaya ’ s note was a love letter , setting up a lovers ’ tryst , he would have burned with shame for that man and might have challenged him to a duel
1	aglaya suddenly boiled over and raised her head
1	a man was ushered in , of rather simple bearing and with the air of a bourgeois
1	no , i did not dream that father had killed my mother , and i saw nothing of the dead men
1	katerina quietly sighed and began to rock the cradle
1	where were you all night ?
1	vi : the new fantasy of an idle man
1	prompting you and giving you every means for your defence ; illness , i said , delirium , injury , melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it ?
1	but such reasoning no longer helped
1	he didn ’ t say anything about the theft
1	nikolay is a brick , for confessing and how clear it all is now !
1	i saved it for you yesterday , but you came in late
1	but why did the man attack porthos rather than anyone else ?
1	no one could reproach them with haughtiness or presumption , and yet it was known that they were proud and knew their own worth
1	and , first of all , in my opinion , a baby is too small , that is , not of large size , so that for a given period of time he would need three or five times the number of lay babies as of clergymen , so that the sin , while diminishing on the one hand , would in the final end be increased on the other , if not in quality , then in quantity
1	but katerina nikolaevna would not do that for anything ; —so at least they maintained afterwards
1	prince andrei went to her , stroked her head , and asked whether she had rested from the journey
1	there are no more doubts here , nor any hopes : she has announced it all by the portrait … and what , did he show it to you himself ?
1	berg smiled meekly , kissed the count on the shoulder , and said that he was very grateful , but that he was quite unable to settle into the new life now without receiving thirty thousand in cash
1	sitting on a branch just by the window , holding on to the tree with his arm , he looks : there is no candle in the room , yet it is light
1	not for nothing has age-old popular experience taught us that against poverty and prison there is no guarantee
1	you would not believe how stupid they are !
1	and my father can not bear that
1	was there a childhood love ?
1	the princess left towards evening the next day , and pierre 's head steward arrived with news that it was impossible to get hold of the money needed to equip a regiment unless one of the estates was sold
1	as soon as the curtain rose , the boxes and parterre all fell silent , and all the men , old and young , in uniforms and tailcoats , all the women , in precious stones on bare bodies , with greedy curiosity turned their attention to the stage
1	her husband did not like entertainment of any sort and stayed at home on sundays , and so did she
1	they could not understand that i do not have what it takes , do not have the sort of good-natured and bustling banality needed for it
1	i love you madly
1	send at once and fetch it
1	some of yesterday 's , answered nastasya , who was still standing there
1	her voice was a dense and sonorous contralto , but she always spoke calmly and softly , always lowering her long lashes slightly , and with a smile barely flitting over her pale face
1	she came home , however , still keeping hold of herself , but she could not help telling mama
1	he was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the x prospect , when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw svidrigaïlov , sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth
1	i sighed still more deeply and hastened to take my leave , because i was traveling on important business , and got into my kibitka
1	what is there to explain ?
1	it was also a photograph , of an incomparably smaller size , in a slender oval wooden border—the face of a girl , thin and consumptive and , for all that , beautiful ; pensive and at the same time strangely devoid of thought
1	an error , maybe , the old commander in chief thought
1	here we have an embarras de richessee maybe i should tell about that same theft again , to convince afanasy ivanovich that one can steal without being a thief
1	that seems beats everything !
1	ivan ivanovich went on
1	there 's an ache in my head and an ache in my heart
1	you know , terebyeva ( who is in the community now ) was blamed because when she left her family and devoted herself , she wrote to her father and mother that she would not go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh , that she might have spared them and have written more kindly
1	'your excellency , i said , 'protect the orphans , for you knew my late husband , semyon zaharovitch , and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his only daughter
1	he brought us in nothing but misery
1	it must be snow—this spot ; a spot—une tache , thought rostov
1	she was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him
1	you could see it for yourself ; and how could i ?
1	kovrin began to read further , but understood nothing and dropped it
1	silence is always beautiful , and a silent person is always more beautiful than one who talks
1	could it be simply to conceal it from me , knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours and that i do not approve of private benevolence , which effects no radical cure ?
1	he handed alpatych a paper
1	once i reached for the bottle of red wine ; the pockmarked one suddenly took a bottle of sherry and handed it to me , having not said a word to me till then
1	the adults began talking about bonaparte
1	and how can you judge what would have been better !
1	when mikhail ivanych came in , his eyes were filled with tears of remembrance of the time when he had been writing what he was now reading
1	to inform kutuzov of their intention , they sent him an envelope containing , instead of a message , a blank sheet of paper
1	and where is it now ?
1	then he remembered that self-satisfied bonaparte with his white little hand , who was now an emperor , whom the emperor alexander liked and respected
1	mon cher , vous êtes un héros , said bilibin
1	they have no real evidence
1	you treat me like a sick person or a child
1	varka does it out of vanity , out of boastfulness , so as not to lag behind her mother
1	and so it happened
1	the three musketeers she did
1	you can find lodgings for five roubles a month , even with morning coffee
1	she vomited up every curse there is against you
1	some madman , or fool , or villain in a mad state , gives a slap in the face , and the man is dishonored for the rest of his life and can ’ t wash it off except with blood , or if the other one begs forgiveness on his knees
1	she hardly ever left the house , and of those who came to see them , she was glad only of pierre
1	d'artagnan said to himself
1	would you like to go to the study ?
1	the prince stopped ; from under his thick , beetling brows , his lively , bright , stern eyes looked around at everyone and rested on the young princess
1	i did not ask the one carrying me about anything , i waited and was proud
1	he smiled at the memory of that time and of his love for natasha , and went on at once to what now concerned him passionately and exclusively
1	the curtains were drawn , but it was not totally dark , because a weak light was coming from the other room , where there were no such curtains
1	it can not be , muttered dounia , with white lips
1	the cossack stuck himself out from under the wagon to have a closer look at petya
1	besides , we have got to try out our weapons
1	i wo not lose sight of him
1	as naturally , and simply , and gradually as kutuzov had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to raise a militia , and then to the army , precisely when he was needed , so now , just as naturally , gradually , and simply , when kutuzov 's role had been played , there appeared in his place the new leader required
1	what the devil could this handkerchief mean ?
1	versilov once said that othello killed desdemona and then himself not because he was jealous , but because his ideal was taken from him
1	athos spoke of the discretion of grimaud , who only spoke when his master unstitched his lips ; porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton , who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary constitution ; aramis , confident of bazin 's cleverness , the three musketeers made a pompous speech in praise of his candidate ; finally , d'artagnan had complete faith in planchet 's bravery , and recalled the way he had behaved himself in the thorny business at boulogne
1	because of the self-assurance with which he spoke , no one could make out whether what he had said was very clever or very stupid
1	other young misses observed , passing by
1	however , when the king 's name sometimes suddenly came up unexpectedly in the midst of all these cardinalesque gibes , a sort of gag stopped all these mocking mouths ; the men glanced around hesitantly and seemed to fear the indiscretion of m de tréville 's office wall ; but soon some allusion brought the conversation back to his eminence , and then the laughter picked up again even more , and none of his actions was spared the light
1	( sonia looked wildly at him , and started )
1	i did not want to go anywhere else
1	darkness and gloom , pierre repeated , yes , yes , i understand that
1	well , what of it ?
1	she 's singing , and with me here !
1	they are all perplexed
1	don ’ t blush , prince , or i ’ ll feel sorry for you
1	at least they would have withdrawn on their own ; for they had no water for their men and horses
1	but is he a pure man ?
1	then , oblivious for a moment , she gazed at korostelev and thought : is not it boring to be a
1	he knew that all the intelligentsia of petersburg was gathered there , and , like a child in a toy shop , he looked everywhere at once
1	she turned bright red and said abashedly that i was exaggerating
1	in general , such heroism as the russian troops displayed is impossible to imagine and praise worthily !
1	but how to set about it , if all attempts so far had proved unsuccessful ?
1	he muttered going out
1	he tittered , quite confused , and suddenly went into such a fit of coughing that for some two minutes he was unable to go on
1	so you are here ?
1	all these movements were performed for him in mechanical fashion
1	let it be a dream , but let them not take this dream away from us
1	the man who devastated france , alone , without conspiracy , without soldiers , comes back to france
1	she despised the public just as he did , for its ignorance and indifference to art ; she interfered at rehearsals , corrected the actors , looked after the conduct of the musicians , and when the local newspaper spoke disapprovingly of the theater , she wept , and then went to the editorial offices for an explanation
1	i know it for a fact , it was repeated to me exactly !
1	and all that he has done for rodya ah
1	bring my carriage , he said
1	it even seemed to him that something was moving on that white spot
1	he wanted to tell me even then what he told me on the day of his death , she thought
1	please do not think it too familiar here , on the sofa
1	it was clear that the officer could control his face at will : the moment kutuzov turned around , the officer managed to make a scowl and then assume a most serious , deferential , and innocent expression
1	i know that you do not believe it , but indeed , life will bring you through
1	the king profited from that first the three musketeers moment of reversal to tell her that he was intending to give a fête in the near future
1	all the old methods , which had invariably been crowned with success-concentrating the batteries on a single point , attacking with the reserves to break the line , attacking with les hommes de fer [ ] of the cavalry—all these methods had already been employed , and not only was there no victory , but from all sides the same news came of killed and wounded generals , of the need for reinforcements , of the impossibility of dislodging the russians , and of disarray among the troops
1	i understand precisely nothing
1	but that ’ s what makes it so outrageous , that there was nothing serious in it !
1	he 's a bear cub himself , and here he 's teaching us about polish
1	this humility towards me from such a man , from such a worldly and independent man , who had so much of his own , at once resurrected in my heart all my tenderness for him and all my trust in him
1	yesterday morning , when we were shouting in my study before nashchokin 's arrival
1	but by the significance of this significant gaze it was impossible to tell whether he agreed or disagreed , was satisfied or dissatisfied with the disposition
1	it 's only in that sense i speak of their right to crime in my article ( you remember it began with the legal question )
1	i was so used to thinking and imagining everything from books , and to picturing everything in the world to myself as i had devised it beforehand in my dreams , that at first i did not even understand this strange circumstance
1	half an hour later he was arguing loudly with his lawyer , but that evening and night he was again in the vilest and most fantastic anguish
1	d'artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly
1	what a lot of red camellias i cut !
1	cutting through the upper left of this amphitheater , the smolensk high road wound its way through a village with a white church that lay five hundred paces from the barrow and below it ( this was borodino )
1	i wo not drink anything , said raskolnikov
1	then he sank into dreary musing again
1	i will note that my position in the regiment made this risky ; for such a letter before an encounter , i would be subjecting myself to public opinion you understand ?
1	a woman branded by the justice of the land , a woman who married one man in france and another in england , a woman who poisoned her second husband and who tried to poison me !
1	i know , gentlemen , that many people consider me an idiot , and chebarov , going by my reputation for giving money away easily , thought it would be very easy to deceive me , counting precisely on my feelings for pavlishchev
1	and my circumstances are so bad , anna mikhailovna went on sadly , lowering her voice , so bad that i am now in a most terrible position
1	evgeny pavlovich even stepped back in surprise
1	he quickly inquired about the details , primarily the time , the place , and the degree of reliability
1	some of them seemingly had no need at all to ask ; who the devil could have had any need of it , i would like to know ?
1	the englishmen were all men of the highest quality
1	i murmured something in reply and held out both hands to him ; he joyfully shook them in his
1	they kissed pierre , and he kissed the beautiful hélène 's hand several times
1	but this retort did not benefit pyotr petrovitch
1	my goodness , how he sleeps !
1	had been so struck by all this terror that they were even afraid to mention certain things in conversation with evgeny pavlovich , though they knew that even without that , he was well acquainted with the story of aglaya ivanovna ’ s latest passions
1	and that shoulder was rising and falling convulsively and regularly
1	is not it true that he 's not like him at all ?
1	did milord lose them , or does he think they were stolen from him ?
1	thump him on the back !
1	i will be back in an instant , and if you will wait half a minute for me , as soon as i am finished with that friend , i will come to fetch you , and , as it 's beginning to get late , i will bring you back to the louvre
1	the confidence with which d'artagnan spoke convinced patrick—that was the name of this minister 's minister
1	raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign to him
1	sonia sat down hurriedly
1	i ’ m going out of passion , out of inclination , because i have a major goal
1	and anya 's brothers , petya and andryusha , both high-school students , pulled him from behind by the tailcoat and whispered in embarrassment :
1	better let us have the whole truth pyotr petrovitch may be angry or not , now !
1	and you ca not possibly do otherwise , you have hit on the right thing
1	that same year everybody abandoned their dugout homes and moved to the village ; but there was no peace from the accursed basavriuk there either
1	and yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it excuse me , i have very little wit myself , razumihin cut in sharply , and so let us drop it
1	i brought some along , i have got them here , he pointed to the bags , a hundred flints
1	pah , what a vile room , ganya observed , looking around disdainfully , dark and windows on the courtyard
1	but let me warn you that i do not believe you !
1	but what did you prove by it ?
1	after a moment he thought better of it and , in shame , drove away his absurd notion
1	among plans that would later be realized , we find a heading all in capitals , a thought ( poem ) / theme with the title : 'the emperor , followed by two pages of notes for a story based on the strange life of the russian emperor ivan vi , better known as ivan antonovich , who lived from to
1	the question it poses hangs over the whole novel : what if christ was only a man ?
1	however , that 's all not worth as he spoke , he somehow stared into space , began phrases and broke them off
1	berg returned , and over a bottle of wine the conversation of these three officers became animated
1	all this only seemed strange then to pierre
1	all the while matvei savvich was telling his story , kuzka sat on a stone by the gate , his head propped in his hands , looking at the sky
1	no one had looked , then !
1	pyotr petrovitch asked of zossimov
1	d'artagnan and planchet did not need to hear it twice
1	we stopped at cyrus of persia
1	he had mixed up incidents and had explained events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination
1	i never revealed anything about that meeting with my brother to anyone , not even to marya ivanovna , or to liza in petersburg ; that meeting was the same as receiving a shameful slap in the face
1	and what 's the point ?
1	that 's what she accuses me of
1	a moment later , the jingling of spurs came from the stairway , then footsteps approached , then the door opened , and a man appeared
1	then he was an author ?
1	the old countess , waiting for her son and husband , was playing patience with an old gentlewoman who lived in their house
1	a coward and a fool !
1	the sun came out completely , appeared on the horizon , and vanished into the long , narrow cloud that stood above it
1	here , at the extreme left flank , bennigsen spoke a great deal and vehemently , and , as it seemed to pierre , gave instructions that were important in a military respect
1	only , of course , that ’ s not the worst thing you ’ ve done , darya alexeevna said with loathing
1	pierre decided to himself , and i know this is the last time we will see each other
1	he stood up , paced a little , and sat down
1	earlier she was clowning like an actress , frightening us for the fun of it …
1	that the matter was becoming more and more embroiled
1	a silver crescent gleams in the sky
1	he was wearing gloves , a white waistcoat , and held his hat in his hand
1	afterwards , when varya was already married , nina alexandrovna and ganya moved with her to ptitsyn ’ s , in the ismailovsky quarter ; as for general ivolgin , a quite unforeseen circumstance occurred with him at almost that same time : he went to debtors ’ prison
1	velchaninov had not visited in far too long , and the children were wild with joy : he was loved
1	if the pendants have not left for france already , they will not arrive before you do
1	lxiii : a drop of water first of all , said milady , it may be that i am mistaken and that d'artagnan and his friends really are coming to your rescue
1	the duc d'orléans was visiting the posts
1	each to his own place , mother
1	ach , hang it , only ten minutes left !
1	then sophie , if she 's a girl with a heart , what sort of life will it be for her ?
1	countess marya heard him out , made her comments , and in turn began to think her thoughts aloud
1	morel , pointing to his shoulders , tried to bring it home to the soldiers that this was an officer and that he needed to get warm
1	the guests were all acquaintances of the prince , but it was strange that they had all gathered at once , as if they had been invited , though the prince had not invited anyone , and he himself had only just chanced to remember about his birthday
1	she sat down facing me , on a chair by the wall , smiling and not saying a word
1	i want to sing carols , that 's all !
1	and i tell you once and for all , my dear boy , he said , into the fire with all these things
1	there 's a fop with a fiddle who comes here and scrapes away ; i know tanya wo not marry him , i know it very well , but i hate the sight of him !
1	i should like to make certain myself
1	when everyone had gone down to the garden again , pavel pavlovich suddenly rushed over to velchaninov and tugged him by the sleeve
1	a doctor and priest wore spoken of
1	let me tell you , he is already being watched ; they are already on his track
1	what the result of this courtship might be , anatole could not reflect upon or know , as he never knew what the result of any of his actions would be
1	she particularly liked pinching and dealing out swats to her sister 's children , peaching on them for stolen sugar or bread , which caused an endless and unquenchable quarrel between her and her elder sister
1	this was prince bolkonsky
1	sonia did not think it at all funny
1	i sometimes wake up at night ; so i will go in and look at him
1	men 's actions are subject to general , immutable laws expressed by statistics
1	aglaya noticed it and trembled with hatred
1	it was a hot july day
1	yes , said d'artagnan , until she gets out
1	shouting their ladies ’ names ,
1	bennigsen turned to a general who came up to him and started explaining the disposition of our troops
1	pavel pavlovich forgot his handkerchief !
1	a bit nippy , choub replied
1	but things were becoming urgent
1	ah , the spring , probably , he thought , looking about
1	it can not be said that pulkheria ivanovna loved her all that much , she was simply attached to her , being used to seeing her all the time
1	whether all the enemy forces were six miles away from us , as we supposed , or were there in that fog , no one knew until past eight o'clock
1	raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat
1	see how the devil fights !
1	please don ’ t stand on ceremony
1	it would all come to the same thing— he would spend it on drink , so the thing had better be with me
1	he loves you very much
1	that will be his punishment—as well as the prison
1	so it must be !
1	asked the regimental commander
1	the man looked at him , startled and wondering
1	well , maybe he really doesn ’ t understand , heh , heh !
1	i thus have the greatest veneration for m le cardinal , he went on , and the most profound respect for his acts
1	then , when he had seen his adversary well wearied , he had sent his sword flying with a vigorous quarte thrust
1	another soldier shook his head
1	yes , i am an illegitimate son , and maybe i did indeed want to take revenge for being an illegitimate son , and maybe indeed on some devil ivanovich , because the devil himself wo not find who 's to blame here ; but remember that i rejected an alliance with the scoundrels and overcame my passions !
1	st nicholas or st vlas , it 's all the same
1	it was not that he understood , but he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more appeal to these people in the police‐office with sentimental effusions like his recent outburst , or with anything whatever ; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers , it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life
1	she said , as if afraid to touch the money
1	you know how to present things so that you are always right
1	ippolit suddenly jumped up from his chair as if he had been pulled from it
1	the greater the assembly of people aiming their activity at a single goal , the more sharply set off is the category of people who take a less direct part in the common activity , the more their activity is aimed at giving orders
1	people were passing by , pushing me , i did not feel it
1	lower it , lower its head , he said to a soldier who was holding the french eagle and had inadvertently inclined it before the preobrazhensky standards
1	i just knew you would have it ready for me !
1	the old professor of a boring story , who knows that he has only six months to live , finds something strange happening to him , despite his faith in science and indifference to questions about the darkness beyond the grave
1	now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy , and all that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect
1	he 's a retrograde , the collaborator said gloomily , drinking his glass
1	with good news , i hope ?
1	his study was a room neither large nor small , furnished with a large writing‐table , that stood before a sofa , upholstered in checked material , a bureau , a bookcase in the corner and several chairs—all government furniture , of polished yellow wood
1	we can talk before we sleep and tomorrow ; but on condition that you never open these pages again
1	i humbly thank you , i will go by myself now , said prince andrei , wishing to rid himself of the staff officer , do not trouble yourself , please
1	a peasant called dushkin , who keeps a dram-shop facing the house , brought to the police office a jeweller 's case containing some gold ear‐rings , and told a long rigamarole
1	but you have got four men against you ; end it , i order you
1	suppose , for example , that it , too , is offended ( and it is almost always offended ) , and it , too , wishes to take revenge
1	a cruel wind was blowing , and winter was indeed coming back , and it did not seem that in two days it would be easter
1	le cabinet de berlin ne peut pas exprimer un sentiment d'alliance , ippolit began , looking around significantly at them all , sans exprimer comme dans sa dernière note vous comprenez vous comprenez et puis si sa majesté l'empereur ne déroge pas au principe de notre alliance
1	and so his eyes were fixed with anxiety on the door through which the king would enter
1	rostov saw the cossacks go past him , the first and second squadrons of hussars , the infantry battalions with the artillery , and then generals bagration and dolgorukov rode past with their adjutants
1	afanasy ivanovich spoke long and eloquently , having appended , in passing so to speak , the very curious piece of information that he was now mentioning the seventy-five thousand for the first time and that no one knew of it , not even ivan fyodorovich himself , who was sitting right there ; in short , no one knew
1	is it true that he kissed the portrait ?
1	it was svidrigaïlov , that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was their governess
1	you have been drinking with him , too !
1	if sofya semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes , i will send her to you , to‐day if you like
1	he stopped to think for a moment , but , following the russian rule , resolved to go ahead
1	a little stairway leads up to the scaffold ; there , facing the stairway , he suddenly burst into tears , and yet he was a strong and manly fellow and was said to be a great villain
1	and even my sole heir , is not that so ?
1	may i go in and look ?
1	inform , if you want to !
1	let 's go , let 's go !
1	do not worry , do not worry , i wo not drink more than a mug !
1	if there was none of this magnanimity in war , we would go to it only when it was worth going to certain death , as now
1	alpatych told him how he had been sent and how he had barely been able to leave
1	the first time the young foreign person allowed himself to reproach her , she proudly raised her beautiful head and , half turning to him , said firmly :
1	then , slowly and attentively , he began reading , and read it through twice
1	but his eyes were accustomed now , so that he could make out the whole bed ; someone was sleeping there , a completely motionless sleep ; not the slightest rustle , not the slightest breath could be heard
1	i would not be able to find a punishment fit for him !
1	that dazzling beauty was even unbearable , the beauty of the pale face , the nearly hollow cheeks and burning eyes—strange beauty !
1	we will learn that luther had a hot temper and said such-and-such things ; we will learn that rousseau was mistrustful and wrote such-and-such books ; but we will not learn why , after the reformation , the peoples slaughtered each other and why , during the french revolution , they executed each other
1	he noticed the impression these words made on his daughter
1	her crimson lips were hot and glowing ; but what was this ?
1	muttered the unknown gentleman , and mounted the stairs behind her
1	while the couples were being placed and the musicians were tuning up , pierre sat with his little partner
1	in two words , sir , pavel pavlovich hurried , i am getting married and am presently going to my fiancee , right now
1	he stood up at once
1	and it would have ended with her understanding everything
1	no , said d'artagnan , it 's a gift from my beautiful englishwoman , or rather my beautiful frenchwoman : for , though i have never asked her , i am convinced she was born in france
1	but as soon as the conversation concerned him personally , he began to speak expansively and with obvious pleasure
1	since death has come , there 's no use
1	the carriage door opened almost at once , the young man jumped down lightly and offered his hand to milady , who leaned on it and descended in her turn with a certain calm
1	the house , unplastered , with timber walls , was not very clean inside—one could see that the aim of those living in it did not consist in keeping it spotless—but there were also no signs of neglect
1	the doctor said that the anxiousness he showed meant nothing , that it had physical causes ; but princess marya thought ( and the fact that her presence always increased his anxiousness confirmed her supposition ) that he wanted to tell her something
1	for nastasya filippovna it was even strange to see aglaya like this ; she looked at her and could not believe her eyes , and was decidedly at a loss for the first moment
1	you must have gone clean out of your mind , man
1	the staff officer said in a tone of reproach , like a man who has already repeated the same thing several times
1	no , my esteemed mikhail averyanych , i do not believe in it and have no grounds for doing so
1	i myself began to feel what i was saying , and became excited
1	he had always suspected , however , that this opinion might contain an error ; he felt it now , too
1	silent and smiling , tushin shifted from one bare foot to the other , and looked question-ingly with his large , intelligent and kindly eyes first at prince andrei , then at the staff officer
1	petya was standing on the porch , handing out weapons to the servants who were leaving moscow
1	i admired , rereading the noteand all because i am a developed and educated man !
1	what you just said
1	instead of answering raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell
1	i say : expand the circle of the society ; let the mot d'ordre [ ] be not only virtue , but independence and activity
1	the story had been everywhere contradicted by marfa petrovna , and was by then disbelieved by all the townspeople , who were warm in dounia ' a defence
1	when did it begin , when did it all happen ?
1	that moment , when nikolai saw the dogs swarming over the wolf in the ditch , saw under them the wolf 's gray fur , his outstretched hind leg , and his frightened and gasping head with its ears laid back ( karai had him by the throat ) —the moment when nikolai saw that was the happiest moment of his life
1	finally , in the evening , ivan fyodorovich managed with great difficulty to say good-bye ; and , despite his tractability and their attempts to force him to stay the night , he held to his intention to leave , and left
1	natasha took the first note , her throat expanded , her chest straightened , her eyes acquired a serious expression
1	the scriveners did not dare to say anything against that , and one of them sent to call the superintendent
1	at last the escort traversed paris on the night of the twenty-third
1	besides , who wants to be a card‐sharper ?
1	je l'ai instruit de la chose
1	there was a great outcry and uproar , the children began crying
1	will you make it ?
1	his eyes fastened themselves on the eyes of the queen , and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips : the queen was not wearing her diamond pendants
1	for the limited usual man , for instance , there is nothing easier than to imagine himself an unusual and original man and to revel in it without any hesitation
1	bonacieux picked up , offended by the slight interest he wife showed in him
1	yes , i noticed him , i noticed him well
1	the regiment was also a home , and a home as unchangingly dear and precious as his parental home
1	and she threw a loaf of bread on the table
1	my memory 's quite gone , or i should have thought of something
1	i see that aglaya ivanovna was making fun of me , the prince replied sadly
1	i do not say anything only out of politeness
1	it ’ s as if my heart was pierced through forever
1	and despite all inquiries … could still be heard in the corridor
1	but the real geniuses , asked razumihin frowning , those who have the right to murder ?
1	show me this minute !
1	and i ’ m convinced that her fate is no ordinary one
1	yes , that was how he was
1	the predatory type is the one , he suddenly stopped in fury , is the man who would rather poison bagautov in a glass , while wouldrinking champagne ' with him in the name of a pleasant encounter with him , as you drank with me yesterday—and would not go accompanying his coffin to the cemetery , as you did today , devil knows out of which of your hidden , underground , nasty strivings and clownings which besmirch only you yourself !
1	she felt herself , on the contrary , hardly worthy to look at dounia
1	then marfa petrovna turned up ; she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces ( i owed seventy thousand )
1	ah , i see you think i am in such a condition !
1	how could i not know !
1	and he had hardly thought it when , somewhere near , a clock on the wall , ticking away hurriedly , struck three
1	do not leave it for those devils !
1	dear heart , forgive a useless woman ; i will leave now and go away she suddenly got up and began to hurry
1	though , i confess , i wouldn ’ t stay even then , not that there ’ s any reason , but just … by character
1	however , i remember he was already unpardonably gray then , which meant he was just as gray when he married her that might have had an influence
1	he was a picard whom the vainglorious musketeer had hired that same day and for this occasion on the pont de la tournelle , while he was spitting into the water to make rings
1	i went out , and i liked it very much , liked it right then , even at the very moment when he was leading me out ; but for a long time afterwards , in my memory , his words made the painful impression of a sort of strange , contemptuous pity for him , which i did not want to feel at all
1	that was a strange thought
1	what i mean , in fact , is that earlier , in your presence and after you left , ganya said in answer to my question about you : he knows everything , no need for ceremony !
1	but he knew he was not looking thoroughly , that there might be something quite noticeable that he was overlooking
1	after that he shut himself in his room and ardently took up his brush
1	can the process already have begun ?
1	but pulkheria ivanovna would not say anything
1	as if a woman should not work !
1	he saw that the little old man sitting in front of him in the first row of the stalls was carefully wiping his bald head and neck with his glove and muttering something
1	versilov had meant to joke playfully and amicably , but somehow it did not come off , and he only frightened mama still more , who naturally understood nothing in the comparison of her with a newspaper , and she looked around in perplexity
1	his presentiment came true
1	nothing at all no one 's services no one 's sympathy
1	versilov left without noticing me
1	you have got to go mentioning the devil
1	it has its content and even , if you wish , its subject in itself— this prose which steps forth in the free image of speech about facts not worth mentioning , speech in a pure sense about nothing
1	if you like but i warn you it will be perfectly useless
1	but dounia was vexed , and answered that 'words are not deeds , and that , of course , is perfectly true
1	your mug ’ s all bloody !
1	the debate went on for a long time , and the longer it went on , the more heated the argument became , reaching the point of shouting and personal remarks , and the less possible it was to draw any general conclusion from all that had been said
1	placed where he was , d'artagnan could not see aramis 's face—we say aramis , because the young man had no doubt that it was his friend who was carrying on a dialogue from inside with the lady outside
1	but enough , not another word on this subject which you find so extremely interesting
1	now , why go scaring them !
1	when a thinking man reaches maturity and attains to adult consciousness , he involuntarily feels as if he is in a trap from which there is no escape
1	my intention was to warn m de la porte through my husband , so that m de la porte could tell us precisely what has gone on at the louvre over the past three days , and whether it 's dangerous for me to appear there
1	the cossack choub was saying as he came out the door of his cottage to a tall , lean muzhik in a short sheepskin jacket with a stubbly chin that showed it had not been touched in over two weeks by the broken piece of scythe a muzhik usually shaves with for lack of a razor
1	do you know the details of the case ?
1	thank you , rodya , for speaking to me like that we will , we will guard her
1	the elder workman looked at him askance
1	the strangeness and comicality of these answers come from the fact that modern history is like a deaf man , answering questions that no one has asked him
1	i am a ruined man , lost , destroyed !
1	'—anyone will show you
1	the right of pardon applies only to the guilty , said tréville , who wanted to have the last word , and my musketeer is innocent
1	marya grigorievna is a very modest and well-behaved girl !
1	it would be curious to know , precisely what about me struck him ?
1	behind the walls , noise and talk could be heard , which suddenly became clear and loud as the door opened and a lackey came out with a tray laden with empty glasses , a pitcher of cream , and a basket of rusks
1	they are three superb beasts !
1	he said to raskolnikov , as they went out into the street
1	d'artagnan went back to milady 's the next day and the day after that , and each time milady gave him a more gracious welcome
1	he also feeds his neighbor on the left , a paralytic , with a spoon
1	the general , though in disgrace and aware that it was his own fault , pouted for a long time all the same ; he was sorry to lose afanasy ivanovich : such a fortune , and such a dexterous man !
1	i am often vexed by my students ' sins , but this vexation is nothing compared with the joy i have experienced for thirty years , when i talk with my students , lecture to them , study their relations , and compare them with people in other circles
1	the same crowd of people as at cut-rate sales filled all the passes and passageways of the shopping arcade
1	i thought i was scorned , betrayed
1	( she referred to her son that way )
1	his mouth and nose were askew
1	and what if they take me to the police ?
1	he comes to devastate our beloved fatherland , sonya read diligently in her high little voice
1	the day was hot , the air dry and flowing in streams
1	excuse me , captain , he began easily , suddenly addressing nikodim fomitch , will you enter into my position ?
1	and with that—bye-bye , bonzhur
1	shall i go there or not ?
1	it was evident that his intentions were friendly
1	however , it seems nobody noticed , rostov thought to himself
1	velchaninov thought , frowning and feeling for the case in his coat pocket
1	had not he smashed an icon before my eyes ?
1	m le comte de wardes was announced
1	consider , monsieur , the thing is materially impossible
1	i naturally didn ’ t spy and didn ’ t want to ask questions ; however , they received me well , better than i expected , but not a word about you , prince !
1	do not grieve over the baby
1	pyotr petrovitch , go away , she turned to him , white with anger
1	the lord of the land on which the curate 's church was located saw this supposed sister and fell in love with her , so much in love that he proposed marriage to her
1	listen , arkady , you allowed yourself that outburst downstairs , pointing the finger at me in front of your mother
1	yegor announces that a student has appeared
1	just see if i do not get promoted sublieutenant
1	yes , he 's a very , very kind man , when he 's under the influence , not of bad people , but of such people as i , the princess said to herself
1	thank you , prince , for your genuine concern ; it is only too flattering for me , but … i found the money , sir , a long time ago
1	the three musketeers no , madame , but those who look for bargains must allow others to look for more generous friends
1	but then , seeing her father and especially little coco , her intention would weaken , she would weep in quiet and feel she was a sinful woman : she loved her father and her nephew more than god
1	he was appallingly dressed : his clothes torn and dirty , soaked with a night 's rain
1	at first people did not understand the meaning of this bombardment
1	i must confess i do not quite understand him
1	when he was better , he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious
1	he also owed money to the tradeswoman belov
1	however , i do not admit of any genuine madness , the less so as he is not mad at all now
1	liberry instead of library , your excellency
1	he stood there for a minute and—strangely—it suddenly seemed to him that the edge of one blind was raised and rogozhin ’ s face flashed , flashed and disappeared in the same instant
1	at dinner modest alexeich ate a great deal and talked about politics , about appointments , transfers , and bonuses , and that one had to work , that family life was not a pleasure but a duty , that a penny saved was a penny earned ,
1	in the administrative respect , the establishment of the municipality did not put an end to the looting and proved useful only to certain persons who took part in it and who , under the pretext of maintaining order , were themselves looting moscow or saving their own property from being looted
1	but now , now , when the term of the sentence has been read out to me ?
1	she blushed , pressed her hands to her knees , and all at once , obviously making an effort with herself , raised her head and began speaking quickly :
1	first , it would be proved to the insolent prince that there were still people of our estate who understood honor , and , second , versilov would be shamed and learn a lesson
1	yes , yes , i remember
1	the cossack was summoned , questioned ; the cossack commanders wanted to use the occasion to capture some horses , but one of their superiors , who had acquaintances among the upper ranks of the army , reported this fact to a staff general
1	in the beginning , arkady says of versilov : i absolutely had to find out the whole truth in the very shortest time , for i had come to judge this man
1	bakhtin goes so far as to say that dostoevsky 's mode of artistic thinking could not imagine anything in the slightest way humanly significant that did not have certain elements of eccentricity ( in all its diverse manifestations )
1	under the apple tree a fire was forever burning , and the iron tripod was never ukrainian tales without a cauldron or copper pot on it , for preserves , jellies , fruit pastes made with honey , sugar , and i do not remember what else
1	you want to hear a man ’ s nastiest deed and with that you ask him to shine !
1	princess marya threw on her shawl and ran to meet the arrivals
1	when germans start being accurate , there 's no end to it !
1	all right , all right , with me they will be safe
1	valuev told confidentially that uvarov had been sent from petersburg to find out the opinion of the muscovites about austerlitz
1	the princess pretended that she saw nothing more extraordinary in this news than if he had seen some anna semyonovna
1	under such interrogation , ivan fyodorovich involuntarily got up from his seat and stood at attention , something he ordinarily did when his colonel asked him a question
1	a man in a greatcoat lay face downwards ; dead drunk , across the pavement
1	the general , who had listened to the story with extreme attention , became alarmed again and glanced searchingly at ganya
1	was it all put into words , or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds , so that there was no need to speak of it aloud , and better not to speak of it
1	the officer rode beyond the line to yechkino
1	it kept seeming to her that she was just on the point of understanding , of penetrating , that terrible , overwhelming question at which her inner gaze was directed
1	and you , nastasya , look in pretty often while i am away , to see whether he wants a drink or anything else
1	if we allow that human life can be governed by reason , the possibility of life is annihilated
1	never mind , you have another charge there
1	as i have told you , we can trust him
1	this time there was no more doubt ; it was at the croix-du-trahoir that they executed inferior criminals
1	my bathing house is nice , as you see , my father built it , but i somehow never have time to bathe
1	but the main thing is that i am ashamed
1	anatole kissed the old man , then looked at him curiously and with perfect calm , expecting him to come out with something eccentric , as his father had promised
1	within half an hour adjutants had been sent out in various directions with orders demonstrating that the russian troops , so far inactive , would soon also have to meet the enemy
1	give it to the countess
1	why should he go now when he knew that it would be so ?
1	no , it ’ s not that the russian soul is murky , but the murkiness was in his own soul , if he could imagine such a horror
1	n‐no , mumbled zossimov ; you may amuse him
1	he almost believed in milady 's tenderness ; he almost believed in de wardes 's crime
1	why , in the next room
1	when she heard that , maman nearly fainted
1	said master danilo , peering at him from behind the bush
1	besides the cause of a general yearning that bound the crowds of the french into a single whole and endowed them with a certain energy , there was yet another cause that bound them together
1	this story is still to come ; what happened that evening was just a prelude : i sat for the whole two hours at the corner of the table , and next to me all the while , on the left , was some rotten little fop—a yid , i think ; he participates somewhere , however , even writes something and gets it published
1	will you pay me back ?
1	what 's to be done ?
1	when he got out of bed , pyotr petrovitch immediately looked in the looking‐glass
1	lebeziatnikov strode into the room
1	the trinity—the three basic elements of things—sulfur , mercury , and salt
1	and for the first time in her life she felt bitter towards the people who had been her benefactors only so as to torment her the more ; she felt envy of natasha , who had never experienced anything like that , who had never needed to sacrifice herself , but made others sacrifice themselves for her , and was loved even so , and for the first time sonya felt her quiet , pure love for nicolas suddenly begin to grow into a passionate feeling , which stood above the rules , and virtue , and religion ; and , under the influence of that feeling , sonya , having been taught by her life of dependence to be secretive , involuntarily answered the countess in general , indefinite terms , avoided talking further with her , and decided to wait for her meeting with nikolai , not in order to free him at that meeting , but , on the contrary , to bind him to her forever
1	now thousands of feet and bayonets moved with flying standards and , at the officers ' command , halted , turned , and lined up at intervals , circling around other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms ; now there came the sounds of the measured thudding and clanking of the dressed-up cavalry , in blue , red , and green embroidered uniforms , with embroidered musicians in front , on black , chestnut , or gray horses ; now , stretching out with the brazen noise of polished , shining cannon shaking on their carriages , and with their smell of linstocks , the artillery crawled between the infantry and cavalry and settled in their appointed places
1	i have known you a long time and love you like a brother , she said
1	he was all so thin , small , and pitiful
1	for some reason , summer and winter alike , he goes about in a fur coat and only on very hot days does not go out but sits at home
1	because she told me you had undertaken to get her one
1	with a word both sure and ardent
1	and you will become inestimably richer than before ; for not only in food , nor in costly clothing , nor in pride nor envy will you be happy , but in immeasurably multiplied love
1	at least you did not deceive yourself for long , you went straight to the furthest point at one bound
1	rostov rode to the tavern ; near the porch he saw telyanin 's horse
1	the portrait showed a woman of extraordinary beauty indeed
1	whatever goods you find in my chest , they all go to the church !
1	the soldiers carried it clumsily and hastily behind the post and began to push it down into the pit
1	vile , nasty in my own home , mean girl , hussy i am only sorry for her father !
1	eight stacks of wheat always stood in front of his house
1	and athos rushed back into the bastion , climbed up to the platform , and removed the flag
1	it must be that my tears are not hot , they can not warm you !
1	i wo not dispute that makar ivanovich might have taken that shoulder as an added mockery , if he had been more clever ; but his honesty then stood in the way of his perspicacity
1	we are not on duty , and we thought that , not being on duty , we could dispose of our time as we saw fit
1	i will go , i thought , and see how things are there
1	and what , tell me , what , what do i care about you and whether you are perishing there or not ?
1	then raskolnikov repeated ( rather dryly ) his conversation with svidrigaïlov , omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of marfa petrovna , wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk
1	she was singing in a half voice , and suddenly , after rising , the voice broke off— such a poor little voice , and it broke off so pitifully ; she coughed and again softly , softly , barely , barely began to sing
1	you can find peace within yourself under any circumstances
1	he was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman on the head with all his force , but at every blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth
1	what mainly made me explode was part three that here again some secrets and stupidities emerged , and that these people apparently could not do without secrets and slyness
1	yes , yes ; i have not taken the loop off the armhole !
1	all were looking at her with such awful , stern , ironical , hostile eyes
1	he waved his hand energetically
1	excuse me , allow me to assure you that the report which has reached you , or rather , let me say , has been conveyed to you , has no foundation in truth , and i suspect who in a word this arrow in a word , your mamma she seemed to me in other things , with all her excellent qualities , of a somewhat high‐flown and romantic way of thinking but i was a thousand miles from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a way and indeed indeed i tell you what , cried raskolnikov , raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing , glittering eyes upon him , i tell you what
1	well , goodbye , matryosha , said anatole , kissing her
1	i assure you , gentlemen , the prince cried , you published your article on the assumption that i would never agree to satisfy mr burdovsky , and so you wanted to frighten me for that and be revenged somehow
1	at thirty-five , as he then was , he rightly passed for the most handsome gentleman and the most elegant cavalier in france and england
1	i merely wanted to observe that from this case it ’ s possible to jump over directly to the right of force , that is , to the right of the singular fist and personal wanting , as , incidentally , has happened very often in this world
1	however , they thought that it ought to be so , since the thing had been done on athos 's orders
1	he remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the police-station
1	if you need anything , lipynka , just ask , he said
1	i have heard porthos speak of her , that 's all
1	yes , i respect it and justify it
1	but if she ’ s been hurt , why , then , do you yourselves bring her out in front of that same society in your newspapers and demand that it not hurt her ?
1	so i thought : they must be holy people
1	as for what it was that had nearly made milady lose her credit with the cardinal , kitty knew no more about that ; but this time d'artagnan was ahead of her : as he had seen milady on a detained ship the moment he himself was leaving england , he suspected that this time it was a question of the diamond pendants
1	i left rather in pride than in repentance , and , believe me , quite far from thinking it was time to end my life as a humble bootmaker
1	as the king my father used to say
1	stepan nikiforovich obviously did not wish to expand further
1	listen , said the novice , one must have firm hope in heaven , you see ; a moment always comes when the good one has done pleads one 's case before god , and , you know , perhaps it 's fortunate for you that you should have met me , humble and powerless as i am , for if i leave here , well , then i will have some powerful friends who , after working on my behalf , may also work on yours
1	he had a bit of money , not much , of course , but he did have it ; how much there was in reality—of this no one knew anything , neither his wife , nor his elder daughter , nor his relations
1	nobody told us anything
1	let 's have breakfast , katya , i say
1	he felt for the latch and opened it
1	he was of average height , but that height was so admirably borne and so well proportioned that more than once , in his contests with porthos , whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers , he had forced the giant to yield
1	there was no other , all were occupied
1	we all have our secrets
1	she looked at piskarev with imploring eyes and motioned to him to stay where he was and wait for her to come back , but he , in a fit of impatience , was unable to obey any orders , even from her lips
1	danilo 's voice seemed to fill the whole woods , emerge , and spread far across the field
1	all that is mine is yours , she said , looking at the faces that stood before her
1	he crossed himself several times
1	this afanasy usually stood by the door , his arms crossed , and always muttered one and the same thing with a deep sigh :
1	well , it 's pretty plain
1	when someone came to give her a handkerchief on the part of her seamstress and then ?
1	and now i have become a trite , trashy woman , whom anyone can despise
1	it suddenly seemed to him that one of them , placed just by the window , was—pavel pavlovich , and that he had also seen him and was peeking curiously at him through the window
1	you , for example , want to make man unlearn his old habits , and to correct his will in conformity with the demands of science and common sense
1	let us note parenthetically that gavrila ardalionovich was never even mentioned in the epanchins ’ house—as if there had been no such person in the world , let alone in their house
1	he insisted especially seriously on his genius , as if some extraordinary benefit could be derived from it at that moment
1	his grandfather goes into indescribable raptures , dissolves in merry laughter , and shouts :
1	i even felt sorry for him
1	all i had lying there was nine roubles
1	if the members of the council at first thought kutuzov was pretending to sleep , the sounds his nose produced during the reading that followed proved that for the commander in chief at that moment the point of the matter was something far more important than a wish to show his contempt for the disposition or for anything at all : the point of the matter was to satisfy the irresistible human need for sleep
1	i went home only to sleep
1	there must have been very grave grounds for it , if he is so furious at the word , porfiry laughed
1	i will make you a new overcoat , i will do it up famously , that i will
1	you will be bound , finally , to look at your work as a science ; it will take in the whole of your life and maybe fill the whole of it
1	there , the impatient lizaveta prokofyevna picked up , turning to her daughters , he ’ s begun
1	well , then , when the time is right , i do not say no
1	fanariotov , her grandmother , as her ward , of course ( versilov gave nothing to provide for them ) —but in a far different role from that in which wards are usually described in the houses of aristocratic ladies , for instance , the old countess 's ward in pushkin 's queen of spades
1	in the big town acquaintances turned up ; strangers hastened to make the acquaintance and greet cordially the newly arrived rich man , the biggest proprietor in the province
1	can ’ t you cut pages with a garden knife ?
1	but here the incident becomes totally shrouded in mist , and of what happened further decidedly nothing is known
1	within a year , no one could recognize the woman who so recently had shone and attracted crowds of obedient admirers
1	the jew got angry and also shouted :
1	all this , i repeat , i remember perfectly well
1	why , it is a piano they have got , i declare how they push !
1	you will find me ready to follow you
1	you despise generals and generalship , he sometimes said to him jokingly , but look , all of them ’ will end up as generals in their turn ; if you live long enough , you ’ ll see it
1	she questioned him quickly , spoke rapidly , but seemed to get confused at times and often did not finish ; she kept hurrying to warn him about something ; generally she was extraordinarily anxious , and though she looked at him very bravely and with a sort of defiance , she was perhaps also a little frightened
1	and he had finally returned to petersburg , perhaps , only because he , too , had been discarded like a worn-out old shoe
1	do you know that i am going to get married ?
1	she 's taking care of me
1	but she was indeed no longer lying but sitting up in the coffin
1	the chessmen are set up , the game starts tomorrow
1	as you like , sir , only i wo not read !
1	say rather that you served as an instrument of that cursed woman
1	your man , you say ?
1	well , are you going to argue now ?
1	the forest fastness around the castle hid them
1	but they would ransack the stove first of all
1	a look of terror appeared on the governor 's face
1	of all that happened during that sleep , and of how much time passed while it lasted , i have no memory
1	excuse me , i do not understand what you are talking about
1	i do not like women , because they are rude , because they are awkward , because they are not independent , and because they wear indecent clothes , i concluded my lengthy tirade incoherently
1	he felt that he had , anyway , made these two poor women miserable , that he was , anyway , the cause
1	i could not even have said how tall you were
1	while sitting in the anteroom , pierre looked around with weary eyes at the various officials , old and young , military and civilian , significant and insignificant , who were in the room
1	what do you say to that ?
1	but if i review an act i committed a month ago , i involuntarily recognize , being in different conditions , that if that act had not been committed , many useful , agreeable , and even necessary things which resulted from that act would not have taken place
1	it 's all right , everything worked out very well , nadya told him hurriedly
1	you ’ ve really changed little externally , though i saw you as a child of about ten or eleven
1	by heaven , i do not quite know , he hurt my shoulder
1	if she rebels , i ’ ll drop her at once and take the money with me
1	for his work , petrovich took twelve roubles—it simply could not have been less : decidedly everything was sewn with silk , in small double seams , and afterwards petrovich went along each seam with his own teeth , imprinting it with various designs
1	no , do not trouble yourself , demyan demyanovich
1	then marfa petrovna turned up ; she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces ( i owed seventy thousand )
1	supposing that she would come out to him , princess marya thought up the words he would say to her and she to him ; and these words seemed to her now undeservedly cold , now too fraught with significance
1	pulcheria alexandrovna put in hastily
1	i have come to say good-bye
1	sonya was in the reception room , seeing to the packing of the crystal and china
1	true , maybe he was unnecessarily quick to take advantage of his dismissal
1	he shouted , that 's true , he shouted three times , another voice declared
1	on his way home , boris noticed rostov standing by the corner of a house
1	so it was m d'artagnan the stranger was after ?
1	by jove , there he 's blushing again
1	let 's agree once and for all : we can talk about actors , about actresses , or writers , but we will leave art alone
1	he was furnishing a flat foo !
1	not a little patriot at all , but just natasha replied touchily
1	it 's it 's a stern and lovely face , a face out of an english keepsake
1	natasha , what is it ?
1	oh , i forgave her much during that minute when i gradually came to grasp the matter
1	take note , i tell you this about your sister as a fact
1	luzhin stood still , waiting with a defiant and offended face
1	one saw only a strong , beautiful , and fruitful female
1	if he 's stooped to lambert , he will do her in !
1	nikolai and his wife got along so well that even sonya and the old countess , who , out of jealousy , wished for some disagreement between them , could find no pretext for reproach ; but there were also moments of hostility between them
1	there were many reminiscences about the deceased ; tatyana pavlovna told many stories about him that had been quite unknown to me before
1	when it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not ( praskovya pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband ) , the question was angrily answered in the negative
1	and yet this letter in which he recommends you to me ?
1	on both sides of the bridge a number of vehicles crowded , waiting ; people also stopped
1	a peine passe-t-il de notre côté de la rivière , que nous repassons de l'autre , en la fin notre ennemi boukshevden nous attrappe et s'attaque à nous
1	he stood up and took his hat
1	wait what is it ?
1	he gave a start and opened his eyes
1	he began untying the bundle , which evidently interested him
1	tell me , tell me , tell me !
1	the fleeing men returned , the battalions formed up , and the french , who had divided the troops of the left flank in two , were momentarily pressed back
1	kutuzov , without glancing at wolzogen , ordered the order to be written , which , on very good grounds , to avoid personal responsibility , the former commander in chief wished to have
1	i see this is all a childish and empty matter ; tomorrow i will make inquiries of the most esteemed fedosei semyonovich , but now i beg you to spare me , sir
1	we cure and prepare hides , we take work home most of all i was vexed and the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came clearly before raskolnikov 's mind ; he recollected that there had been several people there besides the porters , women among them
1	i do understand that
1	for the historian ( we continue the example of a battle ) , the main source is the reports of individual commanders and the commander in chief
1	i hope , d'artagnan said seriously , half dead with fright , that you made no mention of my diamond ?
1	through anna andre-evna , i am now looking after his baby
1	but he kept failing and felt awkward about starting this talk
1	she could not bear even a moment of hesitation in him , covered her face with her hands , cried : oh , my god ! —and rushed out of the room , rogozhin going after her to unlock the street door
1	yes , monseigneur , replied the faithful servant of anne d'autriche , but too late , perhaps
1	and it 's all because we want to ape those stupid moscow raptures , said prince vassily , becoming confused for a moment and forgetting that at hélène 's one had to make fun of the moscow raptures , but at anna pavlovna 's to admire them
1	her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall
1	he was a man about fifty , rather tall and thickly set , with broad high shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little
1	princess marya knew only too well this mood of quiet and preoccupied grumbling , which usually resolved itself in an outburst of rage , and she went about all morning as if under a loaded and cocked gun , awaiting the inevitable shot
1	i … i ’ ll soon die in my sleep ; i thought last night that i was going to die in my sleep
1	klochkov was the sixth
1	darya alexeevna sat in expectation as if on pins and needles
1	there , he said , sitting down beside anya
1	the steps were heavy , even and unhurried
1	raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty , yellow paper he picked out one clumsy , white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it , how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them
1	filled with rending pity , he sat by a guttering candle
1	mama , my own , can you possibly stay here ?
1	yet the exact nature of their brotherhood remains a mystery
1	what does she write to me ?
1	we have both lived up to now only because each of us thought the other dead , and a memory is less disturbing than a live creature , though a memory can sometimes be a devouring thing !
1	am i right , am i right ?
1	but the song grows stronger , more passionate , more impetuous ; the notes get higher : there are tears in it , anguish , tireless , hopeless , and , finally , despair : 'there is no forgiveness , gretchen , there is no forgiveness for you here !
1	did i thwart you ?
1	that 's how he will keep circling and circling round me
1	pierre could not and did not want to break that silence
1	she also told me to tell you that she always loved you
1	every time i look at my watch and see the hand approaching ten , i hear the bells start to ring in the neighboring church , yet from the fact that the bells start to ring every time the hand reaches ten , i have no right to conclude that the position of the hand is the cause of the movement of the bells
1	the prince turned quickly and looked at the two
1	of all that he , too , later called suffering , but which at the time he hardly felt , the main thing was his bare feet , covered with sores and scabs
1	looking at them , master danilo recalled his battles as if by banners
1	he cried in a sudden spasm of agony , let me be !
1	exactly so , sir , and there 's light in your papa 's study
1	i bet you never thought of that
1	greetings , uncle , we are coming , too , cried petya
1	but go on , my dear , you did very well this time to recall it in such detail i stood , looked at you , and suddenly cried , ah , how good , the real chatsky !
1	it was that feeling on account of which a volunteer recruit drinks up his last kopeck , a man on a drunken binge smashes mirrors and windows without any apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him his last penny ; that feeling on account of which a man does ( in the banal sense ) insane things , as if testing his personal power and strength , claiming the presence of a higher judgment over life , which stands outside human conventions
1	no , it 's too much for me he thought
1	don ’ t believe him , lizaveta prokofyevna
1	the men get a glass of vodka each from me , he added loudly , so that the soldiers could hear
1	he came to milady 's twice
1	it means there was something stronger than fire and flame and even than a twenty-year habit !
1	it is totally unknown how it was saved from the flood
1	your heart is not pounding yet , but somehow hesitates and thrills slightly—a sensation not without pleasure
1	he 's got a screw loose !
1	his face , despite its small , round wrinkles , had an expression of innocence and youth ; his voice was pleasant and melodious
1	eh , soon i will thr-r-row them out on their ears !
1	calm yourself , get up !
1	the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen the count said through happy tears , and he embraced his wife , who was glad to hide her ashamed face on his chest
1	when i came in , this gentleman , who had come in just before me and was unwrapping his provisions , was talking rapidly and heatedly with his wife ; she , though she had not yet finished swaddling the baby , had already begun to whimper ; the news must have been bad , as usual
1	why , on that 'journey ' ; you spoke of it yourself
1	well , sir , in any case i am gla-a-ad to rene-e-ew
1	the queen would be ruined just as well by too great a discretion as by too great a confidence
1	and yet every day she had stoked the stove , cooked and baked , fetched water , chopped wood , slept in the same bed with him , and when he came home drunk from weddings , she reverently hung his fiddle on the wall each time and put him to bed , and all that in silence , with a timid , solicitous look
1	at the door to the chapel , d'artagnan felt his courage abandoning him again
1	he looked around intently and was surprised that he had come there
1	besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that his own happiness will be the more secure , the happier dounia is with him
1	it was learned later , through mme de chevreuse , who told it to two or three of her lovers , that he had taken holy orders in a monastery in nancy
1	the old man still did not understand and smiled still more good-naturedly in anticipation
1	yes , yes , i know
1	milady thus continued on her way , and the same day that planchet embarked for france at portsmouth , his eminence 's messenger triumphantly entered port
1	i cried to him
1	if you want , you may also stay with him , said the prince , there will be room enough
1	the steps sounded very far off , at the very bottom of the stairs , but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming there , to the fourth floor , to the old woman
1	he saw a water nymph swim from behind the sedge ; her back and leg flashed , round , lithe , made all of a shining and quivering
1	he touched up his horse and , calling to him the column leader miloradovich , gave him the order to advance
1	let me not have any happiness either in this world or in the next !
1	he 's an intelligent man , though ; he has this bon sens , a sober , practical understanding of things
1	once they had passed , there again came the same soldiers , with the same talk , and finally everybody stopped
1	d'artagnan profited from the lamp burning in the ferryman 's hut to reread mme bonacieux 's note once again and assure himself that he was not mistaken , that the rendezvous was indeed at saint-cloud and not somewhere else , in front of m d'estrées 's pavilion and not in some other street
1	in that case , general , you saw nothing in the same spirit , dumas refers to the manuscript of the memoirs of m le comte de la fère , which he claims in his preface to be reproducing in the three musketeers
1	boulogne , the evening of the th
1	see where god granted us to meet again , said the small man
1	he would glance away , then look at me again , and suddenly he began to smile at me
1	how he beat her , how he dragged her !
1	the young man in the fox fur coat stood in a submissive pose , stooping slightly , his hands clasped together over his stomach
1	remember , he spent the night with us at otradnoe
1	you wo not understand it , but i swear to god that i could not control myself any longer , something was happening to me , i could not restrain myself , i told my husband i was ill and came here
1	the ship , too , has a senseless and cruel expression
1	it was indeed hot and stifling , and it would have done no harm to go for a swim
1	she spoke it in a quick patter , blushing , and wanted to leave quickly , because she also awfully disliked smearing feelings around , and in this respect was just like me , that is , shy and chaste ; besides , naturally , she would not have wanted to start on the theme of makar ivanovich with me ; what we could say by exchanging looks was enough
1	but we shall meet again
1	you know that yourself
1	for you will soon have to be off
1	what beauty will save the world ?
1	in translators ' notes a notebook entry for september , dostoevsky settled the problem of the lapse between the events and the time of writing
1	however , you are falling asleep , and it 's time i did , too
1	i have served for twenty-three years , never did any wrong ; release me , for god 's sake
1	well , it 's all one and without adding another sound , he turned , walked out , and went down the stairs without even deigning to look at the landlady , who was obviously waiting for explanations and news
1	they accused one another , fought and killed each other
1	that evening weyrother had gone twice to inspect the enemy lines in person and twice to the emperors , russian and austrian , to report and explain , and then to his office , where he had dictated the german disposition
1	but isn ’ t the sense of self-preservation enough ?
1	please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible
1	and i will tell you this , prince andrei interrupted him with calm power in his voice
1	on the contrary , you will have to answer , gentlemen , for violently obstructing the course of justice
1	and and you ca not ?
1	in his situation , he ought first of all to address himself to the office of public order , not because it was related directly to the police , but because its procedures were likely to be much quicker than elsewhere ; to seek satisfaction from the authorities in the place where the nose claimed to work would be unreasonable , because it could be seen from the nose 's own replies that nothing was sacred for this man , and he could be lying in this case just as he lied when he insisted that he never saw him before
1	such a state unsettled his health , and his most terrible torment was that sleep finally began to desert him entirely
1	several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway
1	but this time do not say a word to alyona ivanovna , her husband interrupted ; that 's my advice , but come round to us without asking
1	and there was something else here as well , too awful and disturbing
1	compassionate and , so to say , commiserating these people , i am ready to overlook it even now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me !
1	i say , but i am drunk , assez causé , he said
1	the fences were sturdy and new ; under a shed stood two fire hoses and a barrel painted green ; the paths were straight , the bridges strong , with handrails
1	no , such luck is not to be , thought rostov , and yet what would it cost ?
1	well , hang it , brother , what stuff i am talking , it 's bedtime !
1	svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant
1	province , on the estate of the landowner belokurov , a young man who got up very early , went about in a vest , drank beer in the evenings , and kept complaining to me that he met with no sympathy anywhere or from anyone
1	that 's my farewell message
1	excuse me , are you mr
1	a right to crime ?
1	he surprised me , asking whether i remembered the triple goal of the order : ( ) keeping and knowing the mystery ; ( ) purifying and correcting oneself for the receiving of it ; and ( ) correcting the human race through striving for this purification
1	he turned to look at his wife
1	oh , i at once understood , even then , that in many ways i would never understand them ; to me , a modern russian progressive and vile petersburger , it seemed insoluble , for instance , that they , while knowing so much , did not have our science
1	of course , the funeral !
1	he had not told her of it , because princess marya would have asked their father to give his consent , and without achieving that goal , would have irritated their father and brought upon herself the whole burden of his displeasure
1	yes , it 's time , said dyudya , getting up
1	which means that kolya is either there or in pavlovsk with the epanchins
1	it 's an expensive gun
1	she asked versilov 's advice at first , but soon she chose vasin as her adviser and helper , as i was surprised to learn later she went to see vasin every day , also went to the courts , to the prince 's superiors , went to the lawyers , the prosecutor , in the end she spent almost whole days away from home
1	what ’ s more , poor ivan fyodorovich , who happened to be present at the interrogation , spoiled things completely with his answer
1	princess marya sat alone in her room , vainly trying to overcome her inner excitement
1	seeing natasha , he waved his arms desperately and broke into painfully convulsive gasps , which disfigured his round , soft face
1	so the third fell on you from the sky ?
1	prince andrei looked at her sternly
1	d'artagnan shouted to him
1	i had never expected that
1	she turned away and then , as if fearing that rostov might take her words for a wish to move him to pity her , gave him a questioningly frightened glance
1	the prisoner said that the troops that had just entered fominskoe were the vanguard of the whole big army , that napoleon was there , that the whole army had already left moscow five days ago
1	again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart , and again for an instant softened it
1	yes , i was well , then it is a precedent for you for the future— though do not suppose i should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime !
1	i also got up
1	you will see it 's as good as any other
1	my father , however , was a second lieutenant in the army , from the junkers
1	the room was dark , especially on the sofa where they were sitting , but the silver light of the full moon fell on the floor through the big windows
1	but indirectly , only indirectly !
1	she had only one day left : lord de winter had announced that she would be embarking on the twenty-third , and they had just reached the morning of the twenty-second
1	on the contrary , sire , m de tréville replied calmly , i have come to ask you for justice
1	then explain immediately what you think about it
1	d'artagnan , stranger as he still was to court manners , found a certain coolness in this reception
1	anatole went to kiss the little princess 's hand
1	that 's not at all the thing
1	the tip of the sock was soaked with blood ; he must have unwarily stepped into that pool but what am i to do with this now ?
1	cried milady , throwing herself at his feet
1	natasha put it into her braid
1	sometimes i see him in my dreams : he takes part in my doings , we are both very interested , and yet i remember and am fully aware , throughout the whole dream , that my brother is dead and buried
1	i ate dinner , even ate too much , so as to have the right to stay as long as possible , and sat there , i think , for some four hours
1	there 's no use , he said , he 's dead
1	he slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming
1	but you are young , and i give you my blessing
1	a professor who had once taken part in such battles himself , on entering the classroom , would know at once from his students ' flushed faces that it had been a fine battle , and while he gave the rhetorics a knuckle-rapping , in another class another professor would be applying the wooden slats to the hands of philosophy
1	word of honor , as i am a gentleman !
1	that evening marya dmitrievna went to the arkharovs and suggested that the girls come with her
1	and yet i am certain that man will never renounce real suffering , that is , destruction and chaos
1	pierre did not take his eyes off him , not missing the slightest movement
1	he takes it so lightly , thought pierre
1	said natasha , when they came out on the high road
1	but pseldonymov obviously could not imagine anything
1	young collegiate registrars , provincial and collegiate secretaries stroll about for a very long time ; but the old collegiate registrars , titular councillors , and court councillors mostly stay home , either because they are married folk or because their food is very well prepared by their live-in german cooks
1	if you do not love me , you would better kill me !
1	that 's the veritable truth , he said
1	ganya again gave him a mocking look
1	he seemed not to use his own strength in this
1	even raskolnikov listened attentively for some time , though he did not talk
1	a far cry from social usefulness and humane endeavors !
1	let me look at you
1	in the month and a half since anna pavlovna 's soirée , followed by the sleepless , agitated night in which he decided that marriage to hélène would be a misfortune and that he must avoid her and go away , pierre , after this decision , did not move out of prince vassily 's house , and felt with horror that in people 's eyes he was becoming more and more bound to her every day , that he simply could not go back to his former view of her , nor could he tear himself away from her , that it would be terrible , but that he would have to bind his fate to hers
1	please consider , it 's nothing to me ; but governmental considerations , governmental considerations require it : you have violated the rules of proper order !
1	he closed his eyes , bowed , and , à la française , without saying good-bye , trying not to be noticed , left the room
1	suddenly on the road going up the opposite heights appeared troops in blue coats and artillery
1	do not trouble , please , it 's only that he is on his travels again
1	i accepted the challenge at once , but i decided that before our encounter i would send him a letter in which i would explain my view of my act , and all my regret for this terrible mistake because it was only a mistake—an unfortunate , fatal mistake !
1	but my own , my own !
1	i am not saying that french books are talented , and intelligent , and noble
1	do not weep , mother , dry your eyes !
1	he stopped and did not finish his speech
1	besides , the doctor might declare that the illness was feigned , and milady , having lost the first hand , did not want to lose the second
1	children of the sun , children of their sun—oh , how beautiful they were !
1	'if i said something unnecessary , still there 's the fact that i am a merchant of the first guild , superior to you—you ought to keep quiet
1	oh , if you knew what an intrigue they have got there now !
1	she found her very plain , affected , and dry
1	well , brother , to make a long story short , i was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality , but pashenka won the day
1	good … well , good day !
1	the matter ’ s clear , it speaks for itself !
1	for if a man is guilty , you must be able to get something substantial out of him ; one may reckon upon most surprising results indeed
1	otherwise , for all the insensitive caricature of the whole , some sharp impulse would have burst through in them
1	and you , sasha , write to us from moscow !
1	came from a third place , abruptly , sharply , as if in vexation ,
1	and the travelers continued on their way
1	without wiping her tears , she turned her eyes , tear-flooded , spiteful , crossed with anger , on the old man ; her face and neck were red and strained , because she was shouting with all her might
1	i know you disliked me from the first and indeed you have no reason to like me
1	is it true , is it true that you were found unconscious in the freezing cold ?
1	the door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor , consumptive woman
1	all was regular and in order ; the medical inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner and a bottle of wine , and indeed it could have proved nothing else
1	it 's a rich man 's life
1	and by the way , not long ago you spoke of katerina nikolaevna quite hostilely
1	the enemy could already be seen ahead
1	'and how was that ?
1	well , well , all right !
1	only now , at the sight of his dread superiors , did tushin realize in all its horror his guilt and disgrace at having remained alive while losing two guns
1	well , of course , you were young then , inexperienced , but now everything might go differently
1	danilo whistled softly , and at his whistle the trusty lad came running
1	you know , we love each other !
1	why are you hiding your hand from me ?
1	once again he looked at the address on the sealed letter : oh , there was no doubt or anxiety for him here , because he trusted her ; something else troubled him in this letter : he did not trust gavrila ardalionovich
1	he mistook the impulsiveness of his desires for their strength
1	my goal is to conquer this many-headed hydra
1	i tell you this simply to warn you , because i sincerely wish for your good dounia did not reply
1	this third time velchaninov was ready to swear that the gentleman in the mourning hat recognized him and strained toward him , drawn back and pushed by the crowd ; it seemed he even dared to reach out his hand to him ; perhaps he even cried out and called him by name
1	maybe i will come here leave me , but do not leave them
1	what if they know it and are only pretending , mocking me while i am laid up , and then they will come in and tell me that it 's been discovered long ago and that they have only what am i to do now ?
1	he muttered unintelligibly , suddenly laughing somehow strangely
1	but why not now ?
1	the old woman recovered herself , and her visitor 's resolute tone evidently restored her confidence
1	but you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything
1	and how could i have imagined her different ?
1	the comte de rochefort !
1	no , i only meant to say that a handsome mule sometimes looks as good as a horse , and it seems to me that in procuring you a handsome mule for mousqueton let it be a handsome mule , said porthos
1	bagration shouted to him from above not to go beyond the brook , but rostov pretended not to hear his words , and , without stopping , rode further and further on , constantly making mistakes , taking bushes for trees and hollows for people , and constantly explaining his mistakes to himself
1	his desire for murder flared up in him again and invaded him like a burning fever : he stood up in his turn , brought his hand to his belt , drew a pistol , and cocked it
1	he is without any religion , but is almost ready to die for something indefinite , which he can not even name , but which he passionately believes in , after the manner of a multitude of russian-european civilizers of the petersburg period of russian history
1	and before him stood the danube , bright noonday , bullrushes , the russian camp , and he , a young general , without a wrinkle on his face , brisk , cheerful , red-cheeked , goes into potemkin 's decorated tent , and a burning feeling of envy of the favorite , as strong now as it was then , stirs him
1	he recalled the strange way in which this woman had been involved in his destiny up to then
1	but now they are not here and
1	je trouve que c'est charmant , [ ] he said of a diplomatic paper sent to vienna together with the austrian standards taken by wittgenstein , le hero de pétropol [ ] ( as he was known in petersburg )
1	semyon , an old man of about sixty , lean and toothless , but broad-shouldered and still healthy-looking , was drunk ; he would have gone to bed long ago , but he had a bottle in his pocket , and he was afraid the fellows in the hut might ask him for vodka
1	i sometimes speak too much from the heart , so that dounia finds fault with me but , dear me , what a cupboard he lives in !
1	the adjutant of the emperor of russia is a officers are nothing when they have no power : this one has none the austrians let themselves be fooled in the crossing of the bridge of vienna , you are letting yourself be fooled by one of the emperor 's adjutants
1	you feel you are a human being
1	yes , here you sit
1	no one looked at the subject from that point of view then , but that 's the truly humane point of view , i assure you
1	and indeed gogol 's art , despite its romantic ghosts and folkloric trappings , is strikingly modern in two ways : first , his works are free verbal creations , based on their own premises rather than on the conventions of ninteenth-century fiction ; and , second , they are highly theatrical in presentation , concentrated on figures and gestures , constructed in a way that , while admitting any amount of digression , precludes the social and psychological analysis of classical realism
1	besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that his own happiness will be the more secure , the happier dounia is with him
1	only ilya andreich was pleased with pierre 's speech , as he had been pleased with the speech of the naval officer , the senator , and generally always with the speech he had heard last
1	i order you to advance and account to me for what you are doing here at this hour
1	his tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone
1	i gave away all the money you sent me to his wife for the funeral
1	let them , it 's nothing !
1	as soon as she got the money , she would turn and leave at once
1	ah well , then stay , of course do not worry , mama , i am not going to be rude to andrei petrovich anymore , i said abruptly ah , lord , how magnanimous on his part !
1	take yourself up there
1	perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his conclusions , but he did not think of that
1	he slept in a warm room , in a soft bed , covered by a fine , fresh sheet and a blanket , but for some reason he did not feel comfortable ; perhaps it was because the doctor and von taunitz spent a long time talking in the neighboring room , and above the ceiling and in the stove the blizzard made the same noise as in the zemstvo cottage , and howled just as pitifully :
1	it 's in the corner to the left , toward the door , in the cupboard , light a candle
1	maybe … maybe we should tie her up ?
1	and since even to this day i hold the conviction that in games of chance , given a complete calmness of character , which preserves all the subtlety of intelligence and calculation , it is impossible not to overcome the crudeness of blind luck and win—so , naturally , i had to grow more and more vexed , seeing that at every moment i failed to sustain my character and got carried away like a perfect little brat
1	does he have even a drop of respect for you ?
1	i have come to say good-bye to him forever
1	i confess , even many years later i suffered from remorse : why , for what reason , had i given him this blow ?
1	because , since i am her father , after all
1	protect me , she cried to the official
1	there he drank a bottle of champagne , which till then he had also known more from hearsay
1	well , we ’ ve yet to see whether we understand or not , ganya muttered mysteriously , only all the same i wouldn ’ t want her to find out about the old man
1	and princess marya tried and was unable to be cordial with the new guest
1	everyone laughed not at marya dmitrievna 's reply , but at the inconceivable boldness and adroitness of this girl , who was both smart and pert enough to treat marya dmitrievna that way
1	what were the causes ?
1	i ’ m unaccustomed to it
1	how could he not understand ?
1	thank you , dear heart , you rescued me , tushin said to him
1	you know those women 's gloves ( he meant the masonic gloves which were given to a newly initiated brother to be presented to a beloved woman )
1	anisim bowed to the ground in front of varvara
1	once when it was already quite dark , we began to pester a girl who was walking quickly and timidly down the boulevard , a very young girl , maybe only sixteen or even less , dressed very neatly and modestly , who maybe lived by her own labor and was going home from work to her old mother , a poor widow with children ; however , there 's no need to fall into sentimentality
1	but the evening was not to end without its curiosity , and versilov did manage to astonish me greatly
1	rare is the bird that flies to the middle of the dnieper !
1	ah , by heaven , athos picked up , you are asking too much , d'artagnan !
1	pierre had left his house only so as to be rid of the complicated tangle of life 's demands which had taken hold of him , and which he , in the state he was in then , had been unable to disentangle
1	to comfort her , the pink coverlet and the pillows in pink cases were moved to the drawing room
1	later , it 's true , his wife would come , lamenting that her husband had been drunk and had asked too little ; but a ten-kopeck piece would be added , and the deal was in the hat
1	i was like an outcast and had been placed with other people almost from birth
1	with this formal , heartless attitude towards the person , a judge needs only one thing to deprive an innocent man of all his property rights and sentence him to hard labor : time
1	you do not want to serve me ?
1	[ ] having repeated these words , the captain rubbed his eyes and shook himself , as if to drive away the weakness that came over him at this touching memory
1	we wo not hold out , stepan nikiforovich said suddenly , after slight reflection
1	the latter was at home in his garret , busily writing at the moment , and he opened the door himself
1	they both went up to the window , and through a slat in the blind they saw m bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak
1	the first preserve the world and people it , the second move the world and lead it to its goal
1	you can rest easy , he said brusquely while sealing a letter
1	i see that village now as in a dream , i even forget my nanny
1	he also wrote separate works on a number of figures , including isabel of bavaria ( ) and the countess of salisbury ( )
1	then you will not leave here , he said
1	the post turned out to be in the house of old prince sokolsky
1	with sad and timid eyes he looked for her ; she returned and stood by his pillow
1	by my will alone i have unquestionably just raised and lowered my arm
1	my god , help me and strengthen me so that i may walk in thy paths
1	princess marya looked at him with astonishment
1	hand it in , since it seems he did not finish and smiled a painfully false smile
1	you may laugh at me , but my mother is here , he turned suddenly to porfiry , and if she knew , he turned again hurriedly to razumihin , carefully making his voice tremble , that the watch was lost , she would be in despair !
1	but that is what the scoffers do not understand : he had a dream , they say , a delirium , a hallucination
1	the unknown man saw then that things had gone beyond raillery , drew his sword , saluted his adversary , and put himself gravely on guard
1	but what do i want with her ?
1	gruel with gravy is also good
1	he went into that room—the fourth in order ; it was a small room and packed full of people , rather better dressed than in the outer rooms
1	really , perhaps i am
1	have you produced many famous scientists ?
1	just what you need !
1	maybe because in general i dined with them rarely , certain special additions had even been made : sardines appeared as an entrée , and so on
1	it is the desolate time of holy saturday , when christ is buried , the disciples are scattered and — worse than that — abandoned
1	he quickly asked her something and , not waiting for an answer , led the prince further through the rooms
1	nor my own children …
1	lizaveta prokofyevna , how can you , for pity ’ s sake ?
1	he bent down with the candle and saw a little girl , not more than five years old , shivering and crying , with her clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel
1	suddenly he stopped as if rooted outside the doors of one house ; before his eyes an inexplicable phenomenon occurred : a carriage stopped at the entrance ; the door opened ; a gentleman in a uniform jumped out , hunching over , and ran up the stairs
1	it 's you , it 's you !
1	i ask you , sir , not to be clever and try to dodge with me !
1	he stopped in front of me
1	what 's it all about ?
1	something twitched in her face
1	hah … very odd , sir !
1	it was growing dark and cool
1	i likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to‐morrow morning by business in the senate that does not admit of delay , and also that i may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son , and avdotya romanovna her brother
1	and so it goes till dawn
1	people with kulichi and bundles huddled together among the tombstones and crosses
1	while the skiff advanced with all the strength of its four rowers , felton untied the rope and then the handkerchief that bound milady 's hands
1	if his eminence will cite me some examples of these events in history , said milady , perhaps i will be able share his confidence in the future
1	( a century later , in his little book on gogol , vladimir nabokov , though no disciple of belinsky , offered a similarly rationalizing reduction of gogol 's work , rejecting all the fantastic tales as juvenilia and allowing as the real gogol only the overcoat , the inspector general , and the first part of dead souls
1	five minutes is all , i was only five minutes late !
1	who knows , i may need to leave by a back door
1	bound hand and foot with graveclothes ; and his face was bound about with a napkin
1	where she 's gone and when she will be back
1	in manner he was slow and , as it were , nonchalant , and at the same time studiously free and easy ; he made efforts to conceal his self‐importance , but it was apparent at every instant
1	of course i did reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and blurts out his whole story
1	the girl was not totally silent , however ; she did let slip in her vague replies that she used to love her father more than her mama , because formerly her father had always loved her more , and her mama formerly had loved her less ; but that when her mama was dying , she had kissed her a lot and wept , when everyone left the room and the two of them remained alone
1	he was visibly triumphant , he looked at me merrily , as if he had found me out and caught me at something in the slyest manner
1	have not you noticed it ?
1	oh stupid , ungrateful children !
1	i did it on purpose , and she , i thought , had to be given time
1	and i knew that thou hearest me always ; but because of the people which stand by i said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me
1	but let us also leave that for a moment
1	ivan fyodorovich , if you please , centaury or caraway flavored , which do you prefer ?
1	the old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys , and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room
1	only the money we would reckoned was not enough , not nearly enough
1	she was a piteous and unseemly spectacle , as she ran , weeping and panting for breath
1	this livtsov—he even sincerely started a friendship with golubenko , was reconciled with him completely , and moreover , sir—got himself invited to be best man , held the crown , and once they came back from church , went up to congratulate and kiss golubenko , and in front of the whole noble company , in front of the governor , in a tailcoat and curled hair himself , sir—he up and stabbed him in the gut with a knife—golubenko went
1	his future i can picture clearly
1	the chum was dumbfounded
1	neither army falls apart , but immediately after the confrontation , the russian army retreats of necessity , just as a ball rebounds of necessity after colliding with another ball coming towards it at a greater speed ; and also of necessity ( though losing all its force in the collision ) the swiftly rolling ball of the invasion rolls on for a certain distance
1	when he had happened to imagine all this beforehand , he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid
1	mother , you are quite pale , do not distress yourself , darling , said dounia caressing her , then with flashing eyes she added : he ought to be happy at seeing you , and you are tormenting yourself so
1	the then still-living chief l -- -- -- -ko himself had summoned him specially to poltava to paint the wooden fence around his house
1	his malice was aimed at himself ; with shame and contempt he recollected his cowardice
1	and if they do not strike one as sharply as attila or stenka razin , it is precisely because they occur too frequently , they are too ordinary , too familiar a sight
1	there is misery enough without that
1	now i do not have visitors every day
1	he asked for a samovar and some hay for the horses and , having had his tea , went to bed
1	ganya muttered , noisily shutting the window
1	what made you put it secretly in her pocket ?
1	strange that he had almost forgotten that face and remembered it only now
1	one would have thought the cellar was home to one of those scraggy ogres , gigantic heroes of popular legend , whose cave no one could force with impunity
1	the three musketeers but the wine , asked d'artagnan , who furnishes the wine ?
1	he bent his back , the tomfool , grabbed her bare legs with both hands , and went galloping like a horse all over the fields
1	he had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering
1	what do you think about the story chalais 's equerry tells ?
1	alpatych came to yaroslavl with business reports , and with suggestions and advice to move to moscow , to the house on vzdvizhenka , which had remained intact and only needed minor repairs
1	i say , balaga , said anatole , placing his hands on the man 's shoulders , do you love me , or not ?
1	i would even ask you to , you see but the possibility , above all—the possibility alone of supposing that you love katerina nikolaevna !
1	the general frowned , turned away , and walked on
1	but the next day no news came from the army , and the general voice became anxious
1	it is obvious that the explanations of power by these historians , mutually refuting each other in this fashion , can be fit only for children of the most tender age
1	because they multiply like rabbits
1	i have always respected education when in conjunction with genuine sentiments , and i am besides a titular counsellor in rank
1	he has only one day left to live , and tomorrow he will bid the world farewell
1	he was clearly upset that pierre had no parents , especially no mother
1	she whispered rapidly , forcibly , glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes , and squeezing his hand
1	michaud , who had never seen moscow before the campaign and who did not know russian , all the same felt deeply moved when he appeared before notre très gracieux souverain ( as he wrote ) with news of the moscow fire , dont les flammes éclairaient sa route
1	having let in the light and forgetting the burning candle on the table , he began pacing back and forth still with some heavy and sick feeling
1	you must admit that , if on the very same day and hour ear‐rings from the old woman 's box have come into nikolay 's hands , they must have come there somehow
1	remember how we and nikolenka , the three of us , talked in the sitting room—remember , after supper ?
1	he understood what she was weeping about , but in his soul he could not suddenly agree with her that something he had lived with since childhood and considered most ordinary—was bad
1	i was waiting for a chapter two certain person , on whose arrival in petersburg i could definitively learn the truth ; in that lay my last hope
1	no , i did not know ; who is marfa petrovna ?
1	that morning , that is , when i got out of bed after the relapse of my illness , he came to see me , and then i learned from him for the first time about their agreement concerning mama and makar ivanovich ; he also observed that , though the old man felt better , the doctor would not answer positively for him
1	the so-coveted coffer contained eight hundred thousand livres
1	the doctor was very offended ( proving what he was by that alone ) , yet he continued to visit
1	and i put a new tire on the front wheel of your kibitka then !
1	it sometimes happens that i spend whole hours sitting silently , making gambling calculations in my mind and dreaming of how it will all go , how i will stake and win
1	their whole destiny is involved ; it 's sixty or eighty thousand
1	it was probably she , as the most educated person in the house , who had been charged with meeting and receiving the doctor , because she at once began hastily explaining the causes of the illness in minute , nagging detail , but without saying who was ill or what was the matter
1	they laid upon me the duty of rhetor
1	all his things , and whatever else there was—easel , canvases , paintings—were transported to the magnificent apartment that same evening
1	they really do not like it !
1	the wind plays in the rigging , the propeller thuds , the waves splash , the cots creak , but the ear is long accustomed to it all , and it seems as if everything around is asleep and still
1	sasha started going to school
1	seeing pierre , he angrily muttered something and went to the corridor
1	as for the key , it had disappeared
1	a sword , sir , is honor , came the general 's cry , but that was the last i heard of him
1	the assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he could only splutter inarticulately
1	trouble , trouble , mon cher , he said to pierre , these girls are trouble when their mother 's not around
1	oh , but i , said felton , i do not fear him , and i will not spare him !
1	my dear d'artagnan , said athos , you will never be more than a very bad author !
1	not only since the previous day 's meeting with kutuzov on pok-lonnaya hill , but ever since the battle of borodino , when all the generals who came to moscow said with one voice that it was still impossible to offer battle , and when , with the count 's permission , government property was being evacuated every night and half the inhabitants had left , count rastopchin had known that moscow would be abandoned
1	the flat underneath the old woman 's was apparently empty also ; the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off— they had gone away !
1	other ideas crept into his mind
1	be that as it may , it is at least certain that the clerk lived in a better part of town-—meaning not very near to akaky akakievich
1	did you really think i was such a scoundrel ?
1	yes , is there a family without its grief ?
1	pierre walked the whole length of the corridor to the stairway and , wincing and rubbing his forehead with both hands , went down to the first-floor landing
1	he drew attention to the bullets that constantly shrieked , sang , and whistled around them
1	she added , quite unaware of the naïvety of the question
1	i wanted to have a talk with him , and i know for certain that in ten minutes he would have started asking my forgiveness ; but i reasoned that it was better not to touch him
1	je suis tout à vous
1	beside him on a little table , within his reach , lay three or four books and a pair of silver spectacles
1	but if he 's an ignoble man ?
1	now and then he glanced at the familiar crowd around him , then again at his feet
1	i will make peace only when not a single armed enemy remains on my soil , he said
1	generally , she lives in grand style : she has rented an expensive separate summer house with a big garden and moved all her town furniture into it ; keeps two maids , a coachman i often ask her :
1	the old count 's hospitality and good-nature , which struck one especially nicely in petersburg , was such that prince andrei could not refuse to stay for dinner
1	at every step he was pulled up short by want of knowledge of the most basic elements ; a simple , insignificant mechanism chilled his whole impulse and stood as an insuperable threshold for his imagination
1	but a small blue flame still clung from below to one corner of the lower log
1	they would guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat , while they were going upstairs
1	dymov , with a naive and good-natured smile , gave ryabovsky his hand and said :
1	andrei yefimych was touched by this genuine concern and by the tears that suddenly glistened on the postmaster 's cheeks
1	i met with sincerity in you
1	if it 's a sin , it 's a sin , but i would rather be struck down by lightning than live such a life
1	and mother wants to teach me french , for it 's time my education began
1	neither the sleepy , lackluster eyes nor the falsely profound look was there : his round , firm , hawk 's eyes looked straight ahead with rapture and a certain disdain , apparently not resting on anything , though his movements were as slow and measured as before
1	he went on , taking the clay mug from the cossack
1	was a bit glum and as if preoccupied as they all went out for a walk
1	but then he did push to the front and looked at his clothes , wishing to straighten them properly
1	zossimov watched him intently
1	the latter slightly shook his head
1	but i always loved mama , loved her then , too , and did not really hate her , but it was what always happens : the one you love most is the first one you insult
1	as he went out , svidrigaïlov ran up against razumihin in the doorway
1	i had already thought that up when i was in the sixth class in high school , and though i quickly became convinced beyond doubt that it was stupid , all the same i did not stop being stupid at once
1	flew out of his mouth
1	what then is sin , the concept of which follows from the consciousness of man 's freedom ?
1	the messenger , without a single word of response , bowed , took the letter and the order for two hundred pistoles , and left
1	and i ran after katerina nikolaevna
1	for carts that deliver bread to all mankind , without any moral foundations for their action , may quite cold-bloodedly exclude a considerable part of mankind from enjoying what they deliver , as has already happened …
1	besides , certain men were writing books at that time
1	there was love among them , and children were born , but i never observed in them any impulses of that cruel sensuality that overtakes almost everyone on our earth , each and every one , and is the only source of almost all the sins of our mankind
1	it was obvious to him that all this did not concern him , that he was not called upon and therefore could not judge about all that
1	wait , let 's do better , montaran , let 's each take a half
1	le roi de prusse !
1	she ran to the attic
1	he had made nearly sixty leagues in twelve hours
1	some fools to want that !
1	are you ill or not ?
1	she and i already talked about it
1	i have brought you a study
1	anna mikhailovna came to the countess 's room on tiptoe with the letter and paused
1	see , he dumps money on the table , the boor !
1	they noticed ( though i did not ) that after his fit a sort of special inclination developed in him to get married quickly , and that he supposedly set about this idea more than once in that year and a half
1	neither for the french nor for the russians did it make the slightest sense
1	he wo not be worth much if he does , answered dounia , sharply and contemptuously
1	good lord , what a misfortune !
1	velchaninov studied him with loathing and uneasiness
1	so you see , berg said to his comrade , whom he called his friend only because he knew that all people had friends
1	and open up the sky before him on the other side over the church , and have all the angels in the heavenly light come flying to meet him
1	besides , i ’ m a very vindictive man , and that ’ s also because i ’ m not witty
1	i have heard from depraved people that very often , when a man comes together with a woman , he starts in complete silence , which , of course , is the height of monstrosity and nausea ; nevertheless , versilov , even if he had wanted to , would have been unable to start in any other way with my mother
1	he thought he was being dragged into one of those fantastic intrigues such as are fulfilled in dreams
1	remember my words , you will see !
1	she did not say a single word , but only handed me the paper and ran back
1	she spent the night weeping over him and in the morning she brought the child
1	i summoned you precisely to invite you to accompany me on the march to nastasya filippovna , or , better , on the march against nastasya filippovna !
1	a few moments later , crowds of wounded and stretchers came back from there
1	then she threw herself on her knees and began to pray
1	to run away from home !
1	one can tell it by your tone
1	everything in him was stirred , and he could think of nothing but oksana
1	the general is always at lebedev ’ s ; he also left just now … lebedev may come to see you presently ; he ’ s been looking for you , i don ’ t know why , he asked twice
1	a few minutes later , the governor received alpatych and hurriedly said to him :
1	when i heard all that i did not say a word to anyone'— that 's dushkin 's tale—'but i found out what i could about the murder , and went home feeling as suspicious as ever
1	she said softly and turned away to hide her tears
1	yes , he is a swindler
1	but for you i will add eggs , and that is a grave infraction of the rule , for eggs are meat , since they engender the chicken
1	there , in that huge , brightly lit hall , where duport , with bare legs and a sparkling jacket , had leaped over the wet boards to the music , and girls , and old men , and the bare hélène , with her calm and proud smile , had rapturously shouted bravo—there , in the shadow of this hélène , everything had been clear and simple ; but now , alone with herself , it was incomprehensible
1	the prince noticed ( he now noticed everything quickly and greedily , perhaps even what was not there at all ) that evgeny pavlovich ’ s civilian dress produced a general and extraordinarily strong impression , so much so that all other impressions were forgotten for a time and wiped away
1	the gates creaked and they went into the yard
1	she thought in moments of total darkening
1	the three musketeers m bonacieux lived on quite peacefully , perfectly unaware of what had become of his wife and hardly worrying about it
1	a couple of words , prince , i forgot to tell you , what with all these … doings
1	take it , said milady , putting a pouch full of gold into felton 's hand
1	observed zametov , yes , that 's quite possible
1	the moon makes her face look pale , stern , and fantastic , as if made of marble
1	he was in a woman 's dress , with tousled hair and a happy smile that was new for sonya
1	judging by his calm , intelligent eyes , which have a bright and cheerful look , he keeps his own counsel and has some very important and pleasant secret
1	and after that they cry that they are humiliated and demand equality ; what kind of equality is it , if she tramples me down or stuffs my mouth full of sand !
1	her daughter-in-law , nadya 's mother , nina ivanovna , blond , tightly corseted , in a pince-nez , and with diamonds on every finger ; and father andrei , an old man , lean , toothless , and with a look as if he were about to say something very funny ; and his son , andrei andreich , nadya 's fiancé , stout and handsome , with wavy hair , resembling an actor or an artist—all three were talking about hypnotism
1	yet one event shook him deeply and awakened all his living constitution
1	her dark eyes flashed , two red spots appeared on her pale cheeks
1	anatole was always content with his position , with himself , and with others
1	one adds a sort of blustery colonel blimp humor that xi a note on the translation corresponds to nothing in the french ; another has the habit of saying elaborately twice what dumas says simply once
1	he lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes
1	what ’ s the law : is it a blasphemy ?
1	however , he by no means lost any of his dignity : wore a high-waisted tailcoat after the fashion of military uniforms , spurs on his boots , and a mustache under his nose , because otherwise the noblemen might have thought he had served in the infantry , which he sometimes scornfully called infantury and sometimes infantary
1	he could never understand and explain to himself why , when he was tired and worn out , when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way , he had returned by the hay market where he had no need to go
1	and a very fine one at that , he said , i saw it yesterday , your friend 's valet was holding it
1	as for the other one , he knows me , he fears me , and he knows what to expect of me if i ever escape from his hands
1	however , we are wrong to have begun talking about civil servants ; in fact , we wanted to talk about practical people
1	by the end of the year , having made sure that i was able to endure any fast you like , i began to eat as they did and went back to having dinner with them
1	there is as much to be had again if you are back here in six days and if you have properly carried out my commission
1	these facts made an impression in his favour
1	well , if someone said to me right now , this minute : do you want to remain the way you were before captivity , or live through it all over again ?
1	he glanced at the paper once more
1	just look at me , the pretty little coquette went on , how smooth my step is ; my shirt is embroidered with red silk
1	danilo put on his astrakhan hat , closed the window , latched the door , locked it , and quietly went out through the yard , between his sleeping cossacks , into the hills
1	where did you come from ?
1	then her hair , under her knowing hands , took on successively the waves she believed would contribute to the charms of her face
1	the spina scapulae in the back
1	i know i am not well , without your telling me , though i do not know what 's wrong ; i believe i am five times as strong as you are
1	everything kept collapsing , and there 's horror to come ( nb
1	but i was terribly struck that this son should so easily , that is , i mean to say , so publicly reveal the secret of his birth and , above all , disgrace his mother
1	suddenly she heard a tapping on the windowpane , and , in a flash of lightning , she saw a man 's face appear beyond the bars
1	only the distant noise of a carriage was heard , and paramon 's coughing , and nevyrazimov 's sadness and spite grew stronger and more unbearable
1	the birds were chirruping under the window , and in the middle of the room , on a table covered with a white satin shroud , stood a coffin
1	the thought of dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his heart
1	the queen rushed to a little table where she found ink , paper , and pens
1	there is no answer , of course
1	shall i tell them or not ?
1	the affair between pierre and dolokhov was hushed up , and , despite the sovereign 's severity concerning duels , neither the two adversaries nor their seconds suffered
1	she called , shaking the door
1	a knife , which she would hand back to me through the peephole a minute after receiving it , replied felton
1	silence was now setting in , and several sleepers could be heard snoring ; the others turned and warmed themselves , occasionally exchanging words
1	well , that 's exactly how it was with me : though i was pretending , i wept quite sincerely
1	i at once began to make peace between them , went to see the tenant , a very coarse , pockmarked fool , an extremely vain clerk who served in a bank , chervyakov , whom i myself disliked very much , but with whom , anyhow , i got along well , because i often had the baseness to join him in teasing pyotr ippolitovich
1	now it 's time the illness ended , she said
1	the happy state of mind of the officers after the review passed itself on to the soldiers
1	the blonde greeted him as an acquaintance
1	yes , yes , definitely , cried petya , blushing almost to the point of tears and glancing at denisov
1	he was now riding beside ilyin between the birches , occasionally pulling leaves off the branches that happened in his way , occasionally touching the horse 's flank with his foot , occasionally handing his finished pipe , without turning around , to the hussar behind him— all with such a calm and carefree air as though he was just out for a ride
1	sweat streamed from ivan ivanovich and ivan nikiforovich
1	anna mikhailovna sat down beside him , took her handkerchief , wiped the tears from his eyes , the letter stained by them , and her own tears , read the letter , reassured the count , and decided that she would prepare the countess over dinner and before tea , and after tea would announce everything , with god 's help
1	indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with razumihin
1	she called the deaf man
1	fields spread out to the left from the edge of the village ; they were visible as far as the horizon , and across the whole breadth of those fields , flooded with moonlight , there was also no movement or sound
1	i ca not prove anything to you
1	when kolya finished , he quickly handed the newspaper to the prince and , without saying a word , rushed to a corner , huddled tightly into it , and covered his face with his hands
1	abroad there , once , in a joking moment , she indeed told the prince amaybe , in the future ; but what could it have signified besides just a light word ?
1	i naturally let him know that his manners were no longer to my liking , but the main thing here came out because of the assistant section chief : this gentleman decided to peach on me for supposedly 'being rude ' to him , though i only told him he was undeveloped
1	the priest bowed his head and said nothing
1	well , what is it to him , pray tell me !
1	what makes me a titular councillor , and why on earth am i a titular councillor ?
1	allow me to observe , he answered dryly , that i do not consider myself a mahomet or a napoleon , nor any personage of that kind , and not being one of them i can not tell you how i should act
1	papa , your dinner is ready , varvara ardalionovna announced , coming into the room
1	i hastened to cry in defiance
1	i know , i know , i understand
1	yes , honor before all !
1	now , some insist that this is indeed the dearest of all things for man ; wanting may , of course , converge with reason , if it wants , especially if this is not abused but is done with moderation ; it is both useful and sometimes even praiseworthy
1	he started some sort of gavotte , knowing that german women need gradualness
1	and her glance—the sun , by god , the sun !
1	i shall be keeping an eye on you , for i shall be there , the cardinal went on , pointing out to d'artagnan the magnificent suit of armor he was to wear , and on our return , we shall make our reckoning !
1	one word from me , one movement of my hand , and this ancient capital des czars is destroyed
1	did not he go to your mother in kônigsberg to ask her permission to marry mme
1	a roast boar with cabbage and plums was served
1	they have , and as your excellency may have seen , his horse is under the main gate , all fitted out for departure
1	and were , perhaps , at least sixty times fatter than the rest of mankind …
1	you try to keep the artists from noticing it , though it 's impossible to hide it and they have all known for a long time
1	at the time of the last supper , you remember , peter said to jesus : ' i am ready to go with you , both into prison and to death
1	i absolutely , absolutely want him to get it back today , the same day—and lump it
1	anna andreevna and mme
1	said the lady , rushing across the room to the wall and aiming her lorgnette at the sketches , set pieces , perspectives , and portraits standing on the floor
1	and athos , like the spectre of vengeance , leaped into the room
1	so king stepan announced that if some brave man could be found who would bring him this pasha dead or alive , he would pay him alone as much as he paid his whole army
1	when the governor 's wife went to mrs malvintsev 's the day after her soirée and , having talked over her plans with the aunt ( mentioning that , though under the circumstances it was impossible even to think of a formal engagement , still the young people could be brought together and given a chance to know each other ) and when , having obtained the aunt 's approval , the governor 's wife spoke of rostov in princess marya 's presence , praising him and telling how he had blushed at the mention of the princess—princess marya experienced not a joyful but a painful feeling : her inner harmony no longer existed , and again there arose desires , doubts , reproaches , and hopes
1	i thought you would just let me stay like that—that 's what she had said then on tuesday !
1	how much gold we brought home then !
1	darya alexeevna even became wrathful
1	morsels do not tempt me : can positions or honors be worth the place i am worth ?
1	on the faces of the french general , officers , and soldiers the former expression of cheerfulness and calm was replaced all at once , as if on command , by the stubborn , concentrated expression of a readiness to fight and suffer
1	rent it to me , the prince suddenly suggested
1	seeing that for such direct accusation before witnesses , if false or even mistaken , i should myself in a certain sense be made responsible , i am aware of that
1	we only put on steam
1	it was clear that the one being greeted was riding quickly
1	as soon as boris left , the flushed sonya came from the other door , whispering something spitefully through her tears
1	as if all that was stored up and suppressed in me had only been waiting for this moment to break out
1	a small thing , to cut off a person 's head for no reason at all , and an innocent child 's at that !
1	well , make your choice !
1	i thank you all , gentlemen ( every word rostov heard was like a sound from heaven ) , with all my heart
1	with that i was really and truly branded !
1	and he thought of sonia
1	yes , at first i was thinking , here we are driving along and we think we are driving home , but god knows where we are going in this darkness , and suddenly we will arrive and see that we are not in otradnoe , but in a magic kingdom
1	the doctor wanted to stop her
1	from the windows he saw people coming to be caught ; then , as he had removed some tiles from the floor and dug through the subflooring , and only the simple ceiling separated him from the room the three musketeers below where the interrogations took place , he heard everything that went on between the inquisitors and the accused
1	and , say , have the horses been watered yet ?
1	something must finally be decided on !
1	you would not go to a tavern , of course ?
1	dounia , goodness knows whether he will come !
1	do not call him bad , said natasha
1	but , not to speak only of her , this early and terrible death , despite all our grieving , had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother
1	the fact is , d'artagnan ventured timidly , that i did not see the handkerchief come from m aramis 's pocket
1	we have the poetry in life
1	the countess pressed her friend 's hand
1	i naturally went after her , but she had stopped right at the front door
1	now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering , so that his teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking
1	before i reached home i was summoned to the major ’ s , then i had to pass by my company , so that i got home quite late
1	he sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner ; ordered some beer , and eagerly drank off the first glassful
1	on saturdays and sundays he went to church
1	versilov explained it to me later in more detail
1	cried m de tréville , gazing at d'artagnan
1	it was a fatum
1	what is the difficulty ?
1	ah , my god , he 's choking on a bone !
1	evgeny pavlovich stood on the steps as if thunderstruck
1	he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the body of his mistress
1	it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way , though not much so
1	planchet , d'artagnan said to his servant , who just then stuck his head through the half-open door to try to catch some shreds of the conversation , go downstairs to the landlord , m bonacieux , and tell him to send us a half dozen bottles of beaugency—it 's my favorite wine
1	she knew that if she said a word about it , if she asked petya not to go to this battle ( she knew he was glad of this impending battle ) , he would say something about men , honor , the fatherland—something senseless , masculine , obstinate , against which it would be impossible to object— and the matter would be spoiled , and therefore , hoping to arrange everything so as to leave before then and take petya along as a defender and protector , she said nothing to petya , but summoned the count after dinner and tearfully implored him to take her away quickly , that same night if possible
1	in notes from underground the same evolution is reflected in the mind of one man : the polemicist of the first part grew out of the defeated dreamer of the second
1	i don ’ t think it ’ s nice , however , and , you know , keller , i reproach myself most of all for it
1	i have fallen in love with your brother once and for all , and whatever happens to him , or to me , i will never stop loving him—all my life
1	there was no one to be seen there during the day but beggars eating and children playing
1	indeed , he did stand them to three bottles of his own
1	i heard that too
1	that is , you see , if i had told her directly in so many words : yes , i am taking revenge on society , and she had burst out laughing , as she did that morning , it would in fact have come out ridiculous
1	the maid served tea to the attending doctors and kept running to the pharmacy , and there was no one to put the rooms in order
1	and , pulling down his earflaps , he walked out of the house
1	the other side of the wall was a street
1	i kept telling her i would take her to boulogne to swim in the sea , now , at once , in two weeks , that she had such a cracked little voice , i would heard it that day ; that i would close the shop , sell it to dobronravov , that everything would begin anew , and , above all , to boulogne , to boulogne !
1	i will note another feature : despite the gentleness and simpleheartedness , this face never showed mirth ; even when the prince laughed with all his heart , you still felt as if there was never any genuine , bright , easy mirth in his heart
1	this last consideration gave him pause
1	it was when i was wandering about yesterday , rather delirious , i chanced upon a man who had been run over a clerk delirious ?
1	but the contradictions are not only in arkady 's perception , but in versilov himself
1	he cried , nastasya filippovna !
1	mme bonacieux had the most charming smile in the world
1	i bless you and your destiny let us always be pure in heart , like today kind and beautiful , as far as possible let us love all that 's beautiful in all its various forms well , enfin enfin rendons grace et je te bénis !
1	after the engagement of prince andrei and natasha , pierre , without any obvious reason , suddenly felt the impossibility of going on with his former life
1	and how thin you have grown , how changed
1	the relations of the rostovs and bolkonskys sometimes descended on bald hills by whole families , with their sixteen horses , with dozens of servants , and stayed for months
1	what an odd man you are !
1	pierre tried to get to the wing , but the heat was so intense that he involuntarily swerved around the wing and ended up by the main house , which was burning only on one side of the roof and around which a crowd of frenchmen swarmed
1	i ask about country estates—same answer
1	he had told a lie then , and raskolnikov knew he was lying
1	let me try it on
1	one adjutant , closer to the door , in a persian dressing gown , was sitting at a table and writing
1	i shall read it
1	and , with that good sentiment , he went up to aramis , who was going away without paying any further attention to him , and said : monsieur , you will excuse me , i hope
1	ah , he 's a deep one !
1	having insignificant capital and in view of my growing family , you must agree that an honest percentage …
1	the aunt asked on their way
1	and olga ivanovna listened now to ryabovsky 's voice , now to the silence of the night , and thought she was immortal and would never die
1	and you call that trifles !
1	he had hardly gone ten steps when his ears started ringing , dizziness came over him , a bloody mist passed before his eyes , and he fell down in the middle of the road , still shouting : coward !
1	vasin looked at me questioningly
1	perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family 's arriving ?
1	looking at the self-assured and elegant expressions on the faces gathered here , he kept expecting something especially intelligent
1	but i want to be a brother to her
1	said tanya , and again she wanted to laugh , but the laughter did not come out , and red spots appeared on her face
1	your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier , said prince andrei
1	prince andrei was standing directly in front of kutuzov ; but from the expression in the commander in chief 's one good eye , it was clear that his thoughts and concerns occupied him so greatly that it was as if they interfered with his vision
1	i ’ ll wear it , and you can wear mine , i ’ ll give it to you
1	a ninny , who has lord de winter 's life in his hands and does not kill him , and who costs me three hundred thousand livres in income !
1	they had not yet been sitting for five minutes when suddenly another guest was announced and , as if on purpose , also of a compromising sort
1	d'artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times
1	ivan ivanovich had already managed to visit the farmstead and the mowers outside town to inquire of the muzhiks and women whence , whither , and why , got mighty tired and lay down to rest
1	juicy green leaves without branches broke through the stiff , hundred-year-old bark , and it was impossible to believe that this old fellow had produced them
1	lxiii : a drop of water now , this point was settled : mme bonacieux would follow her unsuspectingly
1	a true graveyard silence fell
1	it seems our grandpa 's gone completely loony , said khobotov , leaving the annex
1	you just called me perfection ; a fine perfection , if just for the sake of boasting that i ’ ve trampled on a million and a princely title , i go off to a thieves ’ den !
1	he did this for many years , till his own death ; it reached the point where he was known over the whole of russia and the whole of siberia , that is , to all the criminals
1	he recalls that she was born while he was still working as a servant for the master of verkhnie zaprudy
1	she stood a moment , looked at him uneasily , and went out troubled
1	did europe resurrect me ?
1	asked nastasya and again received no answer
1	c'est la bataille de poultousk qui est sensée être une grande victoire , mais qui à mon avis ne l'est pas du tout
1	back at athos 's , aramis and porthos asked about the causes of this strange rendezvous ; but d'artagnan contented himself with telling them that m de richelieu had invited him in order to propose that he join his guards with the rank of ensign , and that he had refused
1	he immediately sent in his resignation and , without waiting to be discharged , took a leave and went to moscow
1	you wait , he said behind him , i am not joking , i mean it , come here , come here
1	the three musketeers are above history and above personal involvements
1	one of these parasites , approaching old age , announced on his own and without being forced , that in the course of a long and meager life he had personally killed and eaten in deepest secrecy sixty monks and several lay babies—about six , not more , that is , remarkably few compared with the quantity of clergy he had eaten
1	i do not judge you ; it is not by reason that i have come to consider you perfection ; i simply believe it
1	there 's only one thing left—to go away , but where will i go ?
1	when i dream , i am visited by phantoms
1	and mr lambert confirmed the same thing to them
1	i think it ’ s still in the general ’ s office , on the desk
1	his hair was soaked with sweat , his quivering lips were parched , his eyes were fixed on the ceiling
1	you mean to say he 's deceiving me , you mean to say he 's betraying me ?
1	but at the door she stopped , as if feeling a pang of remorse that , in her gladness , she had left the baby too quickly , and turned to look
1	i am for those who preserve the state , bonacieux said emphatically
1	the only movement in the air was the slow movement from above to below of descending microscopic drops of mist or fog
1	see see what they have brought us to !
1	they were not bought , they were his own gooseberries , the first picked since the bushes were planted
1	but to tell the superintendent to stop stealing , or to dismiss him , or to abolish the useless , parasitic post altogether—is
1	perhaps the cold , or the dampness , or the dark , or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic
1	the number of lights had been intentionally diminished , and yet the young woman could not manage to conceal the traces of the fever that had devoured her for two days
1	i ca not stand that
1	you do not know , liza , what this hangman is for me
1	napoleon gave a start , reflected , and said to me : you have reminded me of the third heart that loves me ; thank you , my friend !
1	follow you at this hour ?
1	the three friends came running and found d'artagnan , not unwell , but dashing for his horse
1	the princess was also preparing provisions for pierre 's trip
1	he 's a special man
1	and he ran out of the room with his hat
1	the officer in the sash got off his horse , called the drummer , and went into the arcade with him
1	history proves that at every step
1	we drove out of town to shoot , and on our way met a birdcatcher with his cages ; lambert bought a canary from him
1	naturally , the carriage was in the foreground , but something else had certainly happened there , something unknown to him and the prince
1	the whole pack changes direction and takes off after a brocket
1	sonya got up , the kitten revived , its eyes sparkled , and it seemed ready to raise its tail any moment , spring up on its soft paws , and play with a ball of yarn , as a kitten ought to do
1	one worthy colonel left home earlier specifically for that and made his way through the crowd with great difficulty ; but to his great indignation , he saw in the shop window , instead of the nose , an ordinary woolen jacket and a lithograph portraying a girl straightening a stocking and a fop with a turned-back waistcoat and a small beard peeping at her from behind a tree—a picture the nose that had been hanging in the same place for over ten years
1	said the joker-singer whom morel was embracing
1	well , would you believe it , my friend , those who have the greatest love of idleness are from the eternally laboring people !
1	well , but if you ca not , then kill me straight out , only do not threaten me and do not torture yourself before me , she concluded , looking at him in strange expectation , as if she really supposed he might kill her
1	what have you done , i ask you ?
1	it was i began raskolnikov
1	maybe the napkin isn ’ t necessary … do they tie a napkin around your neck when you eat , prince ?
1	i suppose you find this uninteresting ?
1	without staying for supper , the rostovs left
1	why has she been setting everyone riddles for three days ?
1	i said to him , 'for my freedom will be your dishonor !
1	why do not they come forward directly and openly , and why is it so necessary that i should go and foist myself on them ?
1	i will read the third
1	as long as histories of separate persons are written—be they caesars , alexanders , or luthers and voltaires—and not the history of all the people , all without a single exception , who participate in an event , it is absolutely impossible to describe the movement of mankind without the concept of a force that makes people direct their activity towards a single goal
1	planchet picked up , astonished
1	quite so , answered razumihin
1	these actions consist in the fact that , instead of a crowd opposing a crowd , people scatter , attack singly , and flee as soon as large forces attack them , then attack again as soon as the opportunity arises
1	afanasy ivanovich , however , often poked fun at this attachment : i do not know what you find in a cat , pulkheria ivanovna
1	at times , finding himself in a solitary and remote part of the town , in some wretched eating‐house , sitting alone lost in thought , hardly knowing how he had come there , he suddenly thought of svidrigaïlov
1	pierre took the filled glass and drank it
1	i believe i have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you ?
1	what can he do to harm avdotya romanovna ?
1	he said just as flatly and slowly , and with an obvious effort of recollection
1	why , i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies
1	outside , weeping and shouting could be heard somewhere in the distance , and fire could be seen through the cracks in the shed , but inside the shed it was quiet and dark
1	sonya implored her fearfully
1	by god , i would take the lot of them and give them a good birching !
1	only in our self-confident time of the popularization of knowledge , thanks to that most powerful tool of ignorance—the spread of printing—has the question of freedom of will been reduced to grounds on which the question itself can not exist
1	that ’ s the real truth !
1	and you are what—a doctor ?
1	yet the prince remained dissatisfied with what he had said to rogozhin ; and only now , at this moment of her unexpected appearance , did he understand , perhaps through immediate sensation , what had been lacking in his words to rogozhin
1	when such a one gets violent , even if she leaps beyond all measure , you can still see that she 's only breaking herself , is egging herself on , and that she herself will be the first to be unable to manage her own sense of integrity and shame
1	i have a friend whose last name is samorodov
1	and since you ’ re a completely uneducated man , you ’ d start saving money , and you ’ d sit like your father in this house with his castrates ; perhaps you ’ d adopt their beliefs in the end , and you ’ d love your money so much that you ’ d save up not two but ten million , and you ’ d starve to death on your moneybags , because you ’ re passionate in everything , you carry everything to the point of passion
1	he leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as in a vise
1	in short , his life had already touched upon the age when everything that breathes of impulse shrinks in a man , when a powerful bow has a fainter effect on his soul and no longer twines piercing music around his heart , when the touch of beauty no longer transforms virginal powers into fire and flame , but all the burnt-out feelings become more accessible to the sound of gold , listen more attentively to its alluring music , and little by little allow it imperceptibly to lull them completely
1	nikolenka , what a lovely dog trunila is !
1	kolya led the prince not far away , to liteinaya , to a café and billiard parlor on the ground floor , with an entrance from the street
1	raskolnikov was violently agitated
1	this nasty anecdote occurred precisely at the time when , with such irrepressible force and such touchingly naive enthusiasm , the regeneration of our dear fatherland began , and its valiant sons were all striving toward new destinies and hopes
1	it 's impossible not to admit , prince andrei went on , that napoleon was a great man on the bridge of arcole , and in the jaffa hospital , when he shook hands with the plague victims , [ ] but there are other acts which are hard to justify
1	god , so much happiness in one instant !
1	at bald hills , the estate of prince nikolai andreevich bolkonsky , the arrival of the young prince andrei and the princess was expected any day ; but that expectation did not disrupt the harmonious order in which life went on in the old prince 's house
1	my dear , versilov added to me , i am even glad you have come , so sit in the corner , i beg you , while the baron and i finish here
1	this is the prince ’ s first real moment of reticence in the novel
1	he was surprisingly excited
1	the professor did not go himself , but sent his intern korolev in his place
1	baron , baron chère enfant , je vous aime , the prince wept out , reaching his arms towards anna andreevna
1	once i tried to go down with two of my servants , but he flew into a terrible rage
1	there are powers above his , which do not rest on the caprice of a man or the outcome of an event
1	i see myself that i may have acted very , very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict does the fellow want his head smashed ?
1	totsky and the general exchanged glances once again ; ganya stirred convulsively
1	the eldest girl was shaking like a leaf
1	c'est curieux , ma parole
1	this lovely one , this meek one , this heaven—she was a tyrant , an unbearable tyrant and tormentor of my soul !
1	i ’ d be quite surprised , however , not knowing society ( i admit it ) , that you not only remained in the company of our people tonight , which is quite unsuitable for you , but that you also kept these … girls here to listen to a scandalous affair , though they ’ ve already read it all in novels
1	these results are himself
1	plums , cherries , black cherries , all kinds of vegetables , sunflowers , cucumbers , melons , beans—even a threshing floor and a smithy
1	the englishman stood in front
1	on the table stood vodka , a flask of rum , white bread , and roast mutton with salt
1	oh , that is a proof that the lord is with us , felton , replied milady
1	why waste time talking to him ?
1	i know the serfiss , and i am habituated to strictly fulfilling orders
1	get undressed and go to bed
1	the prince ’ s observation , by its seriousness and simple-heartedness , dispelled the last remnants of his mistrust
1	she jumped up from the sofa at once and fluttered off with him to line up for the quadrille
1	it is solely in that assurance that i have come to you !
1	that 's not it , that 's not what i am asking you , hangman !
1	maybe ( so it seemed to velchaninov ) he was also intelligent : but since natalia vassilievna rather disliked it when her spouse did much talking , his intelligence went largely unnoticed
1	i think only of you all the time , i have lived by my thoughts of you
1	it 's not right for you to spend the night here , sir , said the beadle
1	he had barely ridden out beyond the projecting arm of the forest when he saw a fat gentleman in a visored beaver cap coming towards him on a beautiful black horse , accompanied by two grooms
1	murmured the queen , whose teeth were chattering with fear
1	i want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles , he thought , with an odd smile
1	mack has surrendered and his whole army with him
1	but this is terrible , dymov !
1	but , having learned as unquestionably that his will is subject to laws , he does not and can not believe it
1	† warning to the reader
1	if the purpose was the spreading of ideas , printing would have carried it out far better than soldiers
1	you are the master
1	i saw it myself !
1	i ’ ve seen her twice , only from a distance
1	well , we have turned the corner now , dounia interrupted , and my brother wo not see us
1	the cardinal went to the table , and , without sitting down , wrote a few lines on a parchment that was already two-thirds filled and set his seal to it
1	he bent down over the stone , seized the top of it firmly in both hands , and using all his strength turned it over
1	lambert at once refilled it
1	i see you are tired , because your wounded leg hinders my leg !
1	well , brother , i do not mind that
1	he went to dounia and gently put his arm round her waist
1	i shall be back directly , he shouted to the horror‐stricken mother , and he ran out of the room
1	in his changed tone she seemed to hear the murderer speaking
1	cried athos , with an accent like that of a man who sees that he is about to tread on a snake
1	a lot of mourners were packed in there
1	i will call the police !
1	soon an old uniform top with frayed cuffs spread its sleeves in the air and embraced a brocade jacket , after which another stuck itself out , a gentleman 's , with armorial buttons and a moth-eaten collar ; then white twill pantaloons with stains , which had once been pulled onto ivan nikiforovich 's the story of how ivan ivanovich quarreled with ivan nikiforovich legs and now might be pulled onto his fingers
1	to take the hundred pistoles , d'artagnan
1	the appearance of pierre 's nonmilitary figure in a white hat struck these men unpleasantly at first
1	kari , mala , tafa , safi , muter , kaskà , he pattered , trying to give his voice expressive intonations
1	i was a staff-captain then
1	he cried out in despair
1	oh , it was not only the blood of that time that alarmed me so much , and not even the tuileries , but all that was bound to follow
1	why , i have taught you , you know some phrases
1	he held out his hand to me and called me his friend—his friend !
1	he began to see some sort of revolutionary trend in everything , he imagined allusions everywhere
1	andryusha , the elder boy , imitating her , came after her on tiptoe
1	why do not you sit down and rest
1	i but no , i will talk with you later and prince andrei , with a strange gleam in his eyes and with uneasy movements , went over to natasha and sat down beside her
1	he tried , says richelieu in his memoirs , to keep it from them for as long as possible , closing the ports throughout the kingdom , and being very careful that no vessel should leave until buckingham 's army was ready to depart , taking it upon himself , for want of buckingham , to oversee the departure
1	four bullets went through me in four places
1	i asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to consider it thoroughly
1	what is it , then ?
1	though princess marya , despite her plainness , seemed more attractive to him than julie , he found it awkward , for some reason , to court princess bolkonsky
1	and at eight o'clock this morning'—that was the third day , you understand— ' i saw nikolay coming in , not sober , though not to say very drunk—he could understand what was said to him
1	said d'artagnan , in so firm a tone that it seemed to milady the expression of an unflagging devotion
1	it 's like an assault of voices , an inspired chorus , victorious , overwhelming , something like our 'up-borne-by-the-an-gel-ic-hosts ' —so that everything 's shaken to its foundations , and everything changes into an ecstatic , exultant , universal exclamation— 'hosanna !
1	my calling is different , princess marya thought to herself , my calling is to be happy with a different happiness , the happiness of love and self-sacrifice
1	he remembered you as light ’ ; those were his own words , i heard them from him
1	i also know that i can hate you very much , more than i love you
1	asked the young man
1	demand , demand , demand , and do not ask ! … burdovsky babbled and turned red as a lobster
1	the whole favor consists only in your coming with me
1	with tormentingly strained attention , he peered into everything his eyes lighted upon , he looked at the sky , at the neva
1	my god , but what do i care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if for some reason these laws and two times two is four are not to my liking ?
1	i have put together something like two or three thousand écus of income in the mercery trade , and above all by investing certain sums in the last voyage of the famous navigator jean mocquet , so that , you can understand , monsieur
1	and many whispered among themselves that it was a most ordinary affair , that princes marry all kinds of women , and even take gypsy women from their camps
1	and precisely here , in russia , in our dear fatherland
1	another absolutely insisted on climbing onto the table and delivering a toast , and only the officer , who grabbed him by the coattails , restrained his premature enthusiasm
1	the campaign began , the regiment was moved to poland , the pay was doubled , new officers arrived , new men and horses , and above all that excitedly cheerful mood spread around which accompanies the beginning of war ; and rostov , conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment , gave himself up wholly to the pleasures and interests of military service , though he knew that sooner or later he would have to leave them behind
1	wait here , i will be back at once
1	he was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness
1	none of us got anything then—that is , again , the ones like me
1	anne d'autriche took a step back , so pale one would have thought she was about to die ; and , supporting herself with her left hand on a table that was behind her , to keep from falling , she drew a paper from her bosom with her right hand and held it out to the keeper of the seals
1	only the kindhearted youth who had told about the book of dreams proved good for anything , and inopportunely at that
1	playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that 's for all the world like the old austrian hof­kriegsrath , as far as i can judge of military matters , that is : on paper they would beaten napoleon and taken him prisoner , and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion , but look you , general mack surrendered with all his army , he‐he‐he !
1	they began poking the commissariat clerk and whispering something to him
1	and he began bowing his way out , as if the rest was henceforth up to him
1	as he was riding away from the battery , shots were also heard to the left , in the woods , and as it was too far from the left flank for him to get there in time himself , prince bagration sent zherkov there to tell the senior general , the one who had presented the regiment to kutuzov in braunau , to pull back beyond the ravine as quickly as possible , because the right flank would probably be unable to hold the enemy for long
1	that is , already dead
1	murmured bonacieux , who knew that this was the title usually given to m le cardinal
1	he altered a waistcoat for me yesterday
1	yegor semyonych gave a strained chuckle , blushed , and began repeating the phrases that bashful authors usually say
1	and this hapless lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face , though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment , for the axe was raised over her face
1	they wo not notice me , and i need a little fresh air , for you have come just in the nick of time—another two minutes and i should have come to blows !
1	for me that is an axiom
1	yet i absolutely had to be done that day with the matter of my salary—before the arrival of certain persons
1	they knew shame , and shame was made into a virtue
1	the great writer was finally forced to give him a whipping , for the satisfaction of his reader ’ s offended moral sense , but , seeing that the great man merely shook himself and , to fortify himself after his ordeal , ate a puff pastry , he spread his arms in amazement and thus left his readers
1	he thought with irritable mockery , stopping at the gate
1	what was it they liked ?
1	no , i am studying , answered the young man , somewhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly addressed
1	herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter , avdotya romanovna , i beg you to accept the respectful homage of your humble servant , what am i to do now , dmitri prokofitch ?
1	three more shots were heard from the gateway
1	she was thinking of something else
1	this is what it is , she began in haste , as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind
1	where is he now ?
1	three hundred people were then seated in the dining room by rank and importance , the more important closer to the guest of honor , as naturally as water flows deeper where the terrain is lower
1	in pierre 's presence there was always a joyful radiance on his face , and he blushed and became breathless whenever pierre addressed him
1	by way of a fee !
1	you do not believe it then ?
1	the two friends never parted for a moment now
1	then you will have to come up to my place
1	though they whispered and used remote phrases , i guessed it
1	he ne ’ er raised for anyone
1	but , by our holy father the pope , keep it concise , for i am going to pluck you in my turn , i warn you
1	[ ] only schoolboys can have fun like that , prince andrei added in russian , pronouncing the word with a french accent , noticing that zherkov was still within earshot
1	he did not find the official ; he was told that the master has not come back since morning , and is unlikely to come back tonight before three or four o'clock , because he is staying in town for a name-day party
1	it seemed she valued not so much the people as the whole family
1	if that activity displeases someone , it displeases him only because it does not coincide with his limited notion of what the good is
1	so she looks upon you as a stranger ?
1	it is the only thing of father 's left us
1	does her face inspire mere passion ?
1	then said the jews , behold how he loved him !
1	you are a brave man , anyhow !
1	yes , yes that 's clear , it 's all clear now
1	je ne parle pas trop , mais je dis bien
1	to deserve this love a man would be ready to lay down his soul , to face death
1	and he rushed from the apartment , closed the door , and waited outside , the soldier 's half pike in his hand , as if he was mounting guard in his place
1	if i had still had some doubts about my misfortune , those doubts had vanished into a hopeless reality : i was in the power of a man i not only detested , but despised ; of a man capable of anything , and who had already given me a fatal proof of how far he might venture to go
1	it 's clear that rodion romanovitch raskolnikov is the central figure in the business , and no one else
1	down the stone steps he descended , between the charred stumps , to where he had a dugout shelter deep in the ground
1	with feigned astonishment ( a real gascon ) , he turns to auersperg : 'where is that austrian discipline the world praises so much , he says , 'if you allow the lower ranks to speak to you like that
1	he cried , and at the same time , probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them , spurred his horse and rode to the right
1	come sit down , you are tired , i will be bound
1	also waiting for the commander in chief ?
1	there was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk
1	since she 's not left the room , the money would have to be on her !
1	low fires burned nearby , among the french guards , and glimmered far off through the smoke along the russian line
1	raving , raving , there 's where the raving is !
1	pulcheria alexandrovna glanced at sonia , and slightly screwed up her eyes
1	so this is your opinion of pyotr petrovitch ?
1	then i turned at once and quickly sprang away to the opposite corner , so as at least not to see
1	of yours and answer the question : why were you unscrewing the nut ?
1	he could eat a whole portion of selyanka from the pan
1	i helped you , but even so i have to tell you the truth : it 's a dangerous business , and , once you look at it , stupid
1	i quickly closed the door , and the prince , coming in through the other door , noticed nothing
1	but here you sit , guzzling boiled beef as though you would not had a bite for three days
1	i do not know what sadness , sorrow , or boredom is
1	she 's sure to come !
1	forgive my troubling you about such trifles , he went on , a little disconcerted , the things are only worth five roubles , but i prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me , and i must confess that i was alarmed when i heard that 's why you were so much struck when i mentioned to zossimov that porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges !
1	and stands on tiptoe so as at least to see the white cap one more time
1	is trying to get at the seventy-five thousand , is that it ?
1	the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road
1	you need a cure
1	it 's a long time since we have had a bone to pick with the guards of m le cardinal , and m de tréville must think we have died
1	but i can answer you in one word and annihilate all your suspicions
1	she asked him several times about certain details of his trip and seemed to be very interested in the position of the prussian army
1	they all clambered into mikolka 's cart , laughing and making jokes
1	however , i thought it would be more interesting
1	indeed , every day the king asked the cardinal when the fête would take place , and every day the cardinal , under some pretext or other , put off fixing the date
1	he seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape
1	when i came to the office , he called me over and started talking to me like this : well , pray tell me , what are you up to ?
1	i , the vile lebedev , do not believe in the carts that deliver bread to mankind !
1	you are fibbing , my cock‐sparrow !
1	and therefore do not corrupt the youth for nothing
1	such a refutation of your own words , as i have already observed to you , looks like a new confirmation of them , grunted the baron
1	a short , stout man of about thirty , in white trousers , top boots , and nothing but an evidently just-put-on cambric shirt , was standing in this room ; a valet behind him was buttoning on a pair of splendid new silk-embroidered suspenders , which rostov noticed for some reason
1	i sat on the bed and at once found myself an opening in the portière
1	noticing that he was not asleep , she asked :
1	you had begun to pervert my poor felton ; he was already falling under your infernal influence , but i intend to save him
1	he gets up and leaves ; she watches him go : her gaze moves over the tall , skinny figure of her husband and caresses and fondles it
1	your grace , she said in a high little voice , now crying bitterly , mama and all of us were left in such misery
1	prince andrei 's eyes were shut , which made him look tired and sleepy
1	i understand only too well , sir !
1	you have seen the cardinal ?
1	said rastopchin as soon as the man left
1	in a brief outline , he satisfied their curiosity about the wedding
1	i had no time to occupy myself with her upbringing , i observed her only in snatches and therefore can say very little about her childhood
1	the old count rode home
1	andré , pourquoi ne pas m'avoir prévenu ?
1	lambert hurried with the meal , urging the waiter to serve every minute
1	he was even making ready to fight when they should come in
1	there 's something here , thought nikolai and , still more convinced of his conjecture by dolokhov 's departure right after dinner , he called natasha out and asked what it was
1	tomorrow , he said , you will be avenged , or i will be dead
1	while she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle ; dounia , too , put on her things
1	the flabber-gasted ferdyshchenko replied
1	either it 's ill fancy or they know !
1	we might begin it to‐day , we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak
1	pierre was about to reply , but he interrupted him
1	in this case totsky remained true to the good old traditions , changing nothing in them , and showing a boundless respect for the invincible power of sensual influences
1	and he suddenly hurried out of the room , again through the kitchen ( where he had left his fur coat and hat )
1	above all , by proclaiming your illegitimacy , which in itself is a slander , you thereby revealed your mother 's secret and , out of some sort of false pride , dragged your mother to judgment before the first scum to come along
1	he was shaking with rage
1	raskolnikov noticed all this , and he too was uneasy
1	it 's nothing more than a dignity ; it 's not anything visible that you can take in your hands
1	prince andrei said suddenly , clearly wishing to please them
1	the thing is that i want to recall it all now , each trifle , each little feature
1	everyone was silent , and if they spoke , they spoke softly
1	and so , my dear host , do not have any qualms , and go on giving him all the care his condition demands
1	you intend , apparently , to speak in such words tomorrow
1	oh , yes , i also changed the subject , i also tried by all means not to remind her of certain things
1	she won ’ t write to the other one anymore ; she promised ; and she ’ ll leave here tomorrow , as you wished
1	all this , my friend , is a completely worldly thing
1	the triumphant general went on heatedly
1	the lines danced before her eyes , but she knew what she was reading by heart
1	i only remember through my sleep that vasin , having finished his work , put things away neatly , gave my sofa an intent look , undressed , and blew out the candle
1	dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever , razumihin did the same
1	i only wanted to say that your idea of the nobility is at the same time a denial of the nobility , said the prince
1	another obstacle , mme bonacieux murmured woefully
1	no , my dear , i will go , and go straight to the commissar
1	a gentleman clinks glasses with a writ server !
1	the transport was going , on the twenty-second of october , from the village of mikulino to the village of shamshevo
1	they served him dinner
1	and it did look like it
1	some lady may happen to send me out a glass of vodka and a piece of pie , so then i drink to her health
1	she cried out and fell unconscious on his shoulder
1	there his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat
1	why shouldn ’ t he tell a story ?
1	yes , but only to take a small rosewood box with her initial on it and go out at once
1	khobotov shrugged , grinned , and exchanged glances with nikita
1	several times—from terror , no doubt—cold sweat broke out on her burning forehead
1	since then i have gone around every day
1	things have happened there , and there are all sorts of queer people living there
1	hey , matryoshka , the sable one !
1	that 's from another opera , said burkin
1	the three musketeers as long as they were within the camp enclosure , the four friends did not exchange a word
1	athos looked at his watch
1	do you have any money ?
1	during this time , the two young men and the poor lackey had gone downstairs
1	country life has its conveniences , he used to say
1	he is interested , frightened
1	the judge would undoubtedly have done so before anyone else , if he had not entered , meanwhile , into an amusing conversation
1	but the landlady is out of the question ; it 's all right for me , but it 's out of the question for you : she would not take you , for she 's for she 's a fool she would be jealous on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you , too , if you want to know of avdotya romanovna certainly
1	cried the prince , beside himself with astonishment
1	i tell you she will trust you for anything
1	he was a most excellent man , you ’ re right about that , ivan petrovich said imposingly and now without a smile , yes , yes … he was a wonderful man !
1	you can tell it all in the street
1	amalia ludwigovna i have you once before told that you to call me amalia ludwigovna may not dare ; i am amalia ivanovna
1	devil knows what this is !
1	well , i ’ m going to leap over all the gymnastics and start straight off with capital ; in fifteen years people will say : there goes ivolgin , the king of the jews
1	how shall i tell you , natasha replied
1	the man ’ s arms and legs are trembling , he ’ s even turning pale , he has a menacing look
1	at last the door opened and sisoy came in , holding a candle and a teacup
1	and the unconcealed , persistent , nervous , and discourteous sarcasm of porfiry seemed strange to razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face
1	the old woman said
1	as solemn peace is higher than all worldly trouble ; as creation is higher than destruction ; as an angel in the pure innocence of his bright soul is higher than all the innumerable powers and proud passions of satan—so is a lofty artistic creation higher than anything that exists in the world
1	piskarev , utterly at a loss , was about to say , and would probably have produced a whole heap of the most incoherent things , but just then a gentleman-in-waiting approached with witty and pleasant observations and a beautifully curled forelock on his head
1	aglaya ivanovna … lebedev began at once
1	he thought finally that the sin might perhaps lie with his overcoat
1	all have forsaken us !
1	the local assessor , the late denis petrovich , always used to say when he saw him in the distance : look , look , there goes the windmill
1	the adjutant generals collected money by subscription
1	in an extensively composed project , toll suggested another plan of campaign—the complete opposite of armfelt 's plan and pfuel 's plan
1	j'ai entendu piailler quelque chose au jardin
1	ce que j'ai vu ces trois mois , est incroyable
1	the worst of it was that he supposedly also hinted it to the father , the husband of the part one unfaithful wife , explaining that the prince was only an amusement
1	nous ne faisons pas la guerre pour le roi de prusse , mais pour les bons principes
1	what do they need ?
1	but with these people prince andrei was able to behave in such a way as to be respected and even feared
1	at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness
1	it is not i ; it is an entirely different person
1	as the child was being baptized , he cried and made such a face as if he anticipated that he would be a titular councillor
1	versilov ran after me
1	when nikolushka was brought to prince andrei , he looked at his father with fear , but did not cry , because no one was crying
1	she finally got up to leave
1	she used to say : 'buy a house , makarych !
1	no , said natasha , though in fact she had also been thinking at the same time about prince andrei and how he would have liked their uncle
1	at last my wretched little wall clock hissed five
1	by eight o'clock in the morning , he was at athos 's place
1	korzh turned to wood , gaping and clinging to the doorpost
1	surely you were appointed for some reason
1	the esteemed mentor said to that
1	they might have known it from varvara ardalionovna , who could and certainly did know everything that ptitsyn knew about the prince and his stay in moscow
1	but i silently took the revolver out of my pocket and put it on the table
1	natasha raised her head , kissed her friend on the lips , and pressed her wet face to her
1	it was the first time in my life that this had happened
1	he ate a little , three or four spoonfuls , without appetite , as it were mechanically
1	mister adjutant , protect us
1	i really do not know what drew me to her then—i think it was because she was always ill if she had been lame or hunchback , i believe i should have liked her better still , he smiled dreamily
1	raskolnikov smiled in reply ; that 's not my fault
1	now , said aramis , you understand , gentlemen , that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours
1	and so , among this household , of whom there were a great many besides makar ivanovich , there was a girl , and she was already about eighteen years old when the fifty-year-old makar dolgoruky suddenly showed the intention of marrying her
1	over a trifle , over a goose
1	anna mikhailovna looked at vera and stopped
1	mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted , he scanned raskolnikov 's low and narrow cabin
1	when i saw the prince again , i felt terribly pained and offended for him
1	and there was always something stuck to his uniform : a wisp of straw or a bit of thread ; moreover , he had a special knack , as he walked in the street , of getting under a window at the precise moment when some sort of trash was being thrown out of it , and , as a result , he was eternally carrying around melon or watermelon rinds and other such rubbish on his hat
1	the old prince turned to prince vassily
1	what do you mean who ?
1	dostoevsky ’ s doubles , which might seem images of personal division , are in fact images of human oneness
1	but , cried bonacieux , this man you are showing me is not d'artagnan !
1	i will be seized , i will be taken to court , i will be thrown out of work , put in prison , sent to siberia , exiled
1	pyotr petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment
1	the old women chased the children away , but they came to the window , sometimes just for a moment , only to say : bonjour , notre bonne marie
1	no doubt , only there 's one problem : my husband was known at the louvre , and they would let him in , while you are not known , and they will shut the door on you
1	the mellow little light still shone through the calm of the night
1	she builds all her hopes on you ; she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it , and we will begin a new splendid life
1	she felt that he had to tell her something , but could not resolve to do it
1	while they were strong , we took no pity on ourselves , but now we can pity them
1	i also remember huge trees near the house , lindens , i think , then strong sunlight sometimes coming through the open windows , a front garden with flowers , a path , and you , mama , i remember clearly only at one moment , when you took me to communion in the church there , and lifted me up to receive the gifts and kiss the chalice ; that was in summer , and a dove flew across under the cupola , from window to window lord !
1	he came running to me with a pale face but never mind him , why bring him in ?
1	he had called on raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agreeable flattery
1	the old woman will stay with you ; and in the front hall and outside cossacks are sleeping !
1	he went through the large room to the front hall , in order to get to the corridor and from there to his room
1	he has a stroke , he 's dying , but you let his blood , you cure him , and he will go around crippled for another ten years , a burden on everyone
1	is your secret at least worth the trouble of my letting you live ?
1	but what are we to think up , andrei petrovich ?
1	no , but you can find me a place in the provinces , with some lady of your acquaintance—where you come from , for instance
1	she has not been out of this room : she came straight from you , you wretch , and sat down beside me , everyone saw her
1	that ’ s the best reply
1	i was mistaken in you !
1	for man sometimes loves suffering terribly much , to the point of passion , and that is a fact
1	why are you backing away from me ?
1	did not i tell you bonaparte was a great tactician ?
1	not a sound came from the stairs
1	six hundred roubles , ace , corner , nine i ca not win it all back !
1	devil take you , i have not slept because of you !
1	i have been all day with sofya semyonovna
1	pierre , barely holding back his sobs , ran towards dolokhov and was about to cross the space separating the barriers when dolokhov cried : to the barrier !
1	the soldiers in my battalion , if you can believe it , refused to drink their vodka : not on such a day , they said
1	he saw before him the face of a quite young , fair‐haired girl—sixteen , perhaps not more than fifteen , years old , pretty little face , but flushed and heavy looking and , as it were , swollen
1	that was five weeks ago , sir
1	he 's lucky he got away from me ; but i will find him , she said in her rough voice
1	it 's time , said yavtukh , let 's go
1	she was almost as beautiful as you are , but she could not laugh the way you do , and her face , which was as attractive as yours—lost its attraction ; but yours is terribly attractive precisely for that ability
1	would it be possible ?
1	how had he found out about her arrival ?
1	the prince did not refuse
1	said porthos , puffing out his chest
1	his bed was made up in this same study , on a soft and also shabby sofa ; he hated this study of his and , it seems , did nothing in it , but preferred to sit idly in the drawing room for hours at a time
1	said dounia laughing , though she , too , was upset
1	that must be how it 's supposed to be !
1	which means the second person comes out as the first person , and the first person as the second person
1	but i saw clearly that the friend had to be prepared , completed , and even won over
1	must be with black eyebrows and eyes big as olives ; and me lying beside her smoking my pipe !
1	you ’ re afraid of a million ?
1	they stared in each other 's faces
1	koch keeps crossing himself and saying : 'if i had been there , he would have jumped out and killed me with his axe
1	well , how did she die ?
1	kovrin was not sleepy , he got to talking with the old man and went back to the gardens with him
1	that question he had never once asked himself today ; here his heart was pure : he knew whom he loved … he was afraid , not so much of the meeting of the two women , not of the strangeness , not of the reason for the meeting , which he did not know , not of its outcome , whatever it might be—he was afraid of nastasya filippovna herself
1	dusk had fallen over the earth , and the roar of the artillery had died down
1	this was athos 's word
1	i walked among them , wringing my hands , and wept over them , but i loved them perhaps still more than before , when there was as yet no suffering on their faces and they were innocent and so beautiful
1	the latter turned round
1	this officer , a very young boy with a broad , red-cheeked face and quick , merry eyes , galloped up to denisov and handed him a wet envelope
1	that 's how it always is with these schilleresque noble hearts ; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them , till the last moment , they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong , and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture , yet they wo not face the truth till they are forced to ; the very thought of it makes them shiver ; they thrust the truth away with both hands , until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool 's cap on them with his own hands
1	i can see that you are perhaps more ashamed for me than anyone else , evgeny pavlovich ; you ’ re blushing , that ’ s the sign of a beautiful heart
1	what profit could you make ?
1	raskolnikov felt a great desire to make out what he was singing , as though everything depended on that
1	and , by-the‐way , are you fond of schiller ?
1	demyan demyanovich , ivan ivanovich said as he finished the last sip , i have come to you on some necessary business
1	as if inadvertently , himself not knowing how , the blacksmith pushed through the crowd and stood next to her
1	she put her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest , pressing her other hand to her aching chest
1	her opinion was that part two no one could bear it , because the future would be ruined then , and resurrection into a new life would be impossible
1	i told you to set fire to the bridge , and somebody got it wrong ; everybody 's going crazy there , they ca not figure it out
1	good boy , grigory petrovich !
1	prince vassily 's words frightened her ; her once beautiful face showed spite , but that lasted no more than a moment
1	maybe we should call the priest ?
1	do you remember him clearly ?
1	since then the memory of nakedness has been loathsome to me ; believe me , she was a beauty
1	prince vassily had decided that they had to throw this bone , a promissory note for thirty thousand , to the poor princess , so that she would not take it into her head to talk about prince vassily 's part in the affair of the inlaid portfolio
1	planchet set out after his master and rode ten paces behind him
1	and , quickly opening the door , he stepped resolutely onto the balcony
1	went to the theater
1	my friend , really , it 's better not to wake him , he 's asleep , the princess said in a pleading voice
1	at that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall
1	and morally i fear very much for him
1	where shall i go ?
1	the last words were uttered in the passage
1	in an unfinished house on varvarka street , with a pot-house on the ground floor , drunken shouting and singing was heard
1	a cardinal , a papal nuncio , at the levay dew rwah ( do you know what the levay dew rwah was ?
1	you ’ re a perfect child , prince !
1	having finished with his needle , he slowly rose from his seat , slowly moved the chair aside , slowly took off his spectacles , slowly counted the money , and at last , having asked me over his shoulder : should he get a full portion ?
1	indeed , it was planchet and grimaud
1	i ordered my bast-covered kibitka to stop in front of the church and went in so quietly that no one turned around
1	he got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window
1	for a minute i thought it over ; she waited in silence
1	ahead of him he saw our artillerists , some of whom were fighting , while others abandoned the cannon and came running in his direction ; he also saw french infantrymen , who had seized the artillery horses and were turning the cannon
1	we are so different and you know , sonia , it 's only now , only this moment that i understand where i asked you to go with me yesterday !
1	i am not lying , cried dounia , losing her composure
1	i can do the two things at once , he added
1	the old man asked , studying anatole closely and intently
1	as the things would have fetched little in the market , they were looking for a dealer
1	you are selling my bajazet ?
1	whatever wrong i did you , the fault was mine
1	he turned at once to look at pavel pavlovich 's bed
1	and what are you , a soldier ?
1	for two days only the children looked after her , taking turns in coming , but afterwards , when they learned in the village that marie really was dying , the old women of the village began coming in turns to sit by her bedside
1	but she saw that the front doors were locked
1	she will see that i have character and say , ah , he has character !
1	so they brought down the ray of light
1	leave us , my dear , go somewhere , stand in a corner behind a door and have a good cry , remembering your former innocence , and perhaps god will forgive you
1	but i noticed that he put up with my irritability as if he had promised himself beforehand to spare the sick man
1	pavel pavlovich , as usual , was not at home , and he handed the note to marya sysoevna to be passed on
1	they did not suffer for me when sometimes , in tears , i kissed their feet , joyfully knowing at heart with what force of love they would respond to me
1	it 's a pity , brother , that you did not set to work in the right way at first
1	i am unable to submit to a dark power that assumes the shape of a tarantula
1	— and in these penetrating words rang other words : i am your brother
1	but now their hands did not part
1	he thought , feeling the silence of the cemetery and gazing at the clear , serene sky
1	i can speak , and i will say boldly that there are few wives who would not take lovers ( des amants ) with a husband like you , but i did not do that , she said
1	for six months now i have been here without the shadow of a distraction , then you come , your presence would be charming company for me , and here , in all probability , i will be leaving the convent any moment !
1	adelaida tried to ask him who this uncle was who had just been spoken of and what had happened in petersburg
1	pidorka and petrus started living like lord and lady
1	you ’ re not from those same rogozhins … the clerk began with increased importance
1	what a wily person you are !
1	he longed for a drink of cold beer , and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food
1	damn , lieutenant , he said , you are not so bad off to be given commissions like that , especially if milord authorizes you to look till she 's in bed
1	but who poured you the wine that was in this glass ?
1	there were not such big receptions as before , but they maintained the same way of life , for without it the count and countess could not imagine life at all
1	one keeps harping on the same note , like a drum !
1	well , there she goes !
1	i am sure that in less than three days this balm will cure you , and at the end of three days , when you are cured , well , then , monsieur , it will still be a great honor for me to be your man
1	mrs pseldonymov , a courageous and magnanimous woman , undressed him herself , took off all his clothes , looked after him as after her own son , and spent the whole night carrying the necessary vessels from the bedroom to the corridor and back again
1	let 's leave honor out of it ; besides , your answer was bound to be democratic
1	she wanted but did not dare to pray , did not dare to address herself to god in the state of soul she was in
1	your brother went to get it ; it ’ s in the front hall
1	i do not insist , by the way , that she understood it all clearly ; but on the other hand she fully understood that i was a loathsome man and , above all , incapable of loving her
1	the officer almost whispered to the dragoons , and one of the soldiers , his face disfigured by rage , suddenly struck vereshchagin on the head with the flat of his broadsword
1	lizaveta prokofyevna asked with enthusiasm and wrath , and expected an immediate answer
1	what are you glad about ?
1	no , never mind the island of madagascar , she said and , jumping off his back , she went downstairs
1	he suddenly cheered up again , so you are waiting for grisha ?
1	but tatyana pavlovna was the most frightened of all
1	i said through my sobs
1	in her view and understanding , all too much had occurred and been revealed in this incident , so that in her head , despite all the disorder and fear , resolute thoughts were already germinating
1	a fancier and a hunter , he had recently obtained for himself a fine , big , dashing don horse , light chestnut with a white mane and tail , on which no one could outgallop him
1	a crowd had already gathered by the open gates and was looking into the yard
1	it 's as if you had spied and eavesdropped on my innermost thoughts
1	he even surprised them with his special , casual way of dancing
1	a man 's been killed !
1	i will say outright : it was almost impossible to endure it without tears , and not from tender feeling , but from some sort of strange rapture
1	my god , what light !
1	from the moment of the scene with nikolay at porfiry 's he had been suffocating , penned in without hope of escape
1	she says , lowering her voice a whole octave
1	let 's go to the table !
1	go on , i am terribly
1	and if i take such an interest in you , it ’ s because i even have some intention concerning you ; you ’ ll learn what it is later
1	at least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity , as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison
1	she heard his news almost with horror
1	oh , quite the contrary , dear friend , i swear to you !
1	soldiers threw chairs out of the windows of the senate onto the square and built campfires
1	only the russian , even in our time , that is , long before the general summing up , is capable of becoming most russian precisely only when he is most european
1	big circles formed around count rastopchin , valuev , and naryshkin
1	and since she was too chaste , too pure to consent to the kind of love a merchant needs , she did not want to deceive me
1	koch , like an ass , did not stay at the door ; so the murderer popped out and ran down , too ; for he had no other way of escape
1	it seemed he was chapter four practical , and , indeed , several times he gave her advice that appeared good , but all this advice , as if on purpose , turned out to be unfeasible
1	the child fell asleep , and ivan himself began to doze
1	how he is bleeding , she said in despair
1	i was so vexed that i lost my sleep
1	in their bright little eyes i read : go up , thou bald head !
1	rogozhin , who was getting more and more vexed with every word , finally cried out in a sort of frenzy
1	sonia , sonia take his money !
1	i lied about his telling me ; but it was opportune
1	putting his fur coat on in the front hall , he says with a sigh :
1	first , your simple-heartedness alone is pleasant to look at ; it ’ s pleasant to sit and talk with you ; i know that i at least have a virtuous man before me , and second … second …
1	if you ran away , you would come back to yourself
1	he asked his wife , looking past her
1	the appearance of ivan nikiforovich—and , what 's more , in court—seemed so extraordinary that the judge cried out ; the secretary broke off his reading
1	princess marya sighed , and the expression of her face said : yes , that 's what i expected and was afraid of
1	all the best moments of his life suddenly recalled themselves to him at the same time
1	it ’ s a matter of a human life !
1	sickness does not go away easily in such a life
1	when they went into the reception room , everyone was just sitting down to supper
1	crutch got up to go home to the factory
1	i noticed on those evenings that , though he sometimes came in with me , he somehow distanced himself from me during the evening and did not introduce me to any of his people
1	indeed , indeed , who could you have learned it from , sir !
1	perhaps i will bump into something comforting
1	it was nearly eleven o'clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night , yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs
1	granted , granted , i am a scoundrel , but she is a woman of a noble heart , full of sentiments , refined by education
1	her disappointment was too great
1	the devil moaned pitifully
1	if only you knew how furious i have been
1	it 's the well‐known resource—flattery
1	the three musketeers but she was rather perplexed : she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist
1	ii est de très mauvaise humeur , très morose
1	this circle , made up almost exclusively of diplomats , clearly had its own high-society interests , which had nothing in common with war and politics , interests in relations with certain women and in the administrative side of their service
1	i also remember that i was gradually overcome by a rather palpable nervous trembling , which went on for several minutes , and even all the while i was at home and having a talk with versilov
1	they seek truth , they insist on their rights , yet they themselves slander him up and down like heathens in their article
1	he was not unaware that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres ; but in truth the words that had accompanied the gift were beyond price
1	you are mine now , i shall be near you all my life … i shall die soon
1	the young man felt her press his hand and understood that it was with a feeling not of coquetry but of gratitude for his departure
1	art is provincial in principle , preserving for itself a naive , external , astonished and envious outlook
1	i should think so , said zossimov
1	i certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed
1	on bolshoi prospect i will find a cab at once
1	i remember , i remember , of course , and i ’ ll be there
1	it was when i was wandering about yesterday , rather delirious , i chanced upon a man who had been run over a clerk delirious ?
1	oh , i recall very well , the prince replied
1	by heaven , said athos , i have nothing against retreating : we bet on an hour , and we have stayed an hour and a half
1	then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring
1	no , not married , the prince smiled at the naïvety of the barb sent his way
1	he looked repeatedly at the clerk , partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him , obviously anxious to enter into conversation
1	though chernyshevsky is not mentioned by name in notes from underground , his theories , and in particular his novel , are the most immediate targets both of the underground man 's diatribes and of dostoevsky 's subtler , more penetrating parody
1	from the story with rinochka the opposite followed , that no idea can be so intensely fascinating ( for me , at least ) that i can not stop suddenly before some overwhelming fact and sacrifice to it at once all that i had done for the idea during years of toil
1	i flew to prince nikolai ivanovich 's , with a still greater presentiment that the answer was there
1	but does not 'that woman ' also figure on the list of your newer friends ?
1	well , what are you going to do ?
1	i felt very sad
1	but i myself could not leave for anything ; i kept drinking and talking , and i wanted terribly to speak myself out finally
1	as the house is quite orderly , and we do our accounts every week , at the end of eight days we presented him with our bill , but it seems we happened upon the wrong moment , for , at the first word we uttered on the subject , he sent us to all possible devils
1	he whispered at last
1	at the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness
1	for the great man there is no bad
1	he suddenly felt so ashamed , so distressed , as he had not felt in the most unbearable moments of his eight-day illness
1	—was how i felt
1	but the countrymen , pressed shoulder to shoulder , catching on their bayonets and never pausing , moved across the bridge in a solid mass
1	seeing his russian face and recognizing him , by the way he walked in and by his first words , as a person of her own circle , she looked at him with her deep and luminous gaze and began to speak in a faltering voice trembling with agitation
1	pavel pavlovich suddenly became terribly animated
1	this pride grew in me over the years , and if it had so happened that i allowed myself to confess to anyone at all that i was ridiculous , i think that same evening i would have blown my head off with a revolver
1	my life has not yet died with that old woman !
1	he served science and died from science
1	he listened silently to the rhetor , feeling from it all that the testing was about to begin
1	buckingham saw , from the expression on the young man 's face , what was going on in his thoughts , and he smiled
1	gusev , did your commander steal ?
1	'one good whack , he says , 'and you will take them all , tikhon concluded , glancing merrily and resolutely into denisov 's eyes
1	if i would spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau and presents , on knick-knacks , dressing‐cases , jewellery , materials , and all that sort of trash from knopp 's and the english shop , my position would have been better and stronger !
1	in a few words , porthos and aramis were let in on the situation
1	astonishing , said ganya , and even with a consciousness of his purpose , he added with a mocking laugh
1	poor pulcheria alexandrovna blurted out , incautiously
1	it was here that i let slip about the portrait …
1	i am betrayed on all sides ; can i trust you ?
1	ebd e‐booksdirectorycom and what if there has been a search already ?
1	denisov , as always , rode out in front of the line , showing off his courage
1	he was very silent himself , sat facing me and , leaning strongly towards me , listened without tearing himself away ; at times he smiled a long , drawn-out smile , baring his teeth and narrowing his eyes , as if making an effort to think and wishing to guess
1	but if he spoke to you , it means you could see him
1	what is your name ?
1	maybe he went out , the caretaker decided
1	awaiting orders , your excellency , to be dispatched to my new assignment , replied boris , showing neither vexation at the prince 's abrupt tone , nor the wish to get into conversation , but so calmly and deferentially that the prince looked at him intently
1	she was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck
1	the main thing here is to carry it through to the end—that ’ s the whole task !
1	it 's worth paying for , is not it ?
1	if my benefactor had been here , he would have told me
1	that same evening pierre went to the rostovs to carry out his errand
1	iv : the dinner at dinnertime ivan fyodorovich drove into the village of khortyshche and turned a bit timid as he began to approach the master 's house
1	d'artagnan did not waste time in useless compliments ; he bowed to the governor , thanked him , and left
1	unfortunately , it was a poorly chosen hour for a conciliabule
1	well , enough , enough , velchaninov interrupted him with ever-increasing impatience , as if clearly saying : no point in talking , i know everything you are going to say , and i know with what intention you are saying it !
1	allow me , auntie , to drink with you to samorodov 's health !
1	he cried out slightly , gnashed his teeth , and with his strong hand seized me by the shoulder and spitefully shoved me away , so that i went flying two or three paces
1	coming out to the road , dolokhov did not ride back to the field , but went through the village
1	but the sight of olmütz , where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and both emperors lived with their suites of courtiers and attendants , increased still more his desire to belong to that supreme world
1	but that 's not the main thing
1	but what is it ?
1	yes , said felton , but silence , silence !
1	the prince held to the old fashion of wearing a kaftan and powdering his hair
1	pelageyushka said in horror , turning to princess marya for defense
1	three of my best soldiers , whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotion you have more than once appreciated , and who , i may affirm it to the king , take his service greatly to heart—three of my best soldiers , i say , mm
1	do not jeer at me !
1	said denisov , who had jokingly placed himself on the footing of natasha 's knight in the rostovs ' house
1	i would not give this paper away if they covered it with gold pieces
1	lambert seemed terribly crude to her and aroused her deepest loathing ; but , being prudent , she still accepted his services , which consisted , for instance , in spying
1	the ball was to be attended by the diplomatic corps and the sovereign
1	he was turning to razumihin , but checked himself in time and turned to zossimov again
1	he was still confronted by the question , how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind , since she could not bring herself to jump into the water ?
1	my landlady is a good‐hearted woman , but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons , and not paying her for the last four months , that she does not even send up my dinner and i do not understand this i o u at all
1	why are we staying ?
1	to reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the second turning to the left
1	having ridden down and looked around , denisov nodded to a cossack who was standing next to him
1	the only question is what the meeting in berlin between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia will tell us
1	what 's the sweet fellow doing these days ?
1	it was a warm , rainy autumn day
1	why did he insult me , i ask you ?
1	then d'artagnan stopped knocking and pleaded , with an accent so full of care and of promises , of fright and cajolery , that his voice would have reassured the most fearful person
1	i know that not one of its pale and clerical inhabitants would trade nevsky prospect for anything in the world
1	d'artagnan ground his teeth
1	until then , m bonacieux , until then
1	he stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant eyes
1	there was thus great astonishment and great joy in the regiment when they saw the young man reappear safe and sound
1	they were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this , when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession
1	why , it 's pretty plain
1	it would seem to make no difference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that
1	the two young men hurried to bakaleyev 's , to arrive before luzhin
1	maybe i am terribly depraved
1	by god , it ’ s so !
1	here are two signatures of the german text—in my opinion , the crudest charlatanism ; it discusses the question , 'is woman a human being ?
1	what do you mean ?
1	i never stop loving you
1	but she is an awful old harpy and he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was , how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost ; how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on
1	a whole crowd of decent people , clustered together , vied excitedly with each other over something
1	at first i might have thought it was simply her coquetry here—the coquetry of a depraved but witty being , to put on a more costly show
1	( that is , ivan yakovlevich would have liked the one and the other , but he knew it was utterly impossible to ask for two things at the same time , for praskovya osipovna very much disliked such whims )
1	eh bien , si vous ne m'aviez pas dit que vous êtes russe , j'aurai parié que vous êtes parisien
1	why , you are like a child asking for matches !
1	reaching the place , i went into the courtyard indicated on the announcement , and entered mrs lebrecht 's apartment
1	but the intercession seemed to have brought the general to his senses
1	what was his horror now , when he indeed became convinced , by indubitable signs , that he indeed had enemies at the table , and it was no longer possible to doubt it
1	gentlemen , said jussac , with great regret i must inform you that the thing is impossible
1	she got up , went to the table , ate little , and drank only water
1	no , it 's not ; i undoubtedly already knew something , knew even all too much , but how ?
1	and what are they doing ?
1	rostov barely had time to hand him the letter and tell him all about deni-sov 's case before the sound of quick footsteps with spurs was heard from the stairway , and the general , leaving him , moved towards the porch
1	fear is coming over me
1	this strange fact of a bachelor and man of society , who still wished to preserve his gentlemanliness , keeping a single girl as a servant , almost made velchaninov blush , though he was very pleased with this pelageya
1	quite by chance , with the help of my sister , varvara ardalionovna ptitsyn , i obtained from her close friend , vera alexeevna zubkov , a landowner and a widow , a letter from the late nikolai andreevich pavlishchev , written to her from abroad twenty-four years ago
1	intensely unpleasant as it was , he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and incredible
1	the other corner was disproportionately obtuse
1	you mean george villiers ?
1	but a minute later the quadrille was over , and almost at once the very thing took place which ivan ilyich had imagined as he was dreaming on the plank sidewalk
1	i wither from his soft , even voice and bookish language , i grow dumb from his stories
1	papushin was a very rich merchant
1	the shape of the painting is unusual : the narrator describes it as being around six feet wide and no more than ten inches high
1	be quiet , be quiet !
1	he was only dimly conscious of himself now , and the farther he went the worse it was
1	sonya was no less agitated than her friend—both by her fear and grief , and by her own personal thoughts , which she did not tell to anyone
1	he had forgotten the fact so well that he could not even remember the old man 's last name , though all the circumstances of the adventure presented themselves with inconceivable clarity
1	and from the height or that picture , all that used to torment and preoccupy him was suddenly lit up by a cold , white light , without shadows , without perspective , without clear-cut outlines
1	they borrow from the svidrigaïlovs
1	evidence that was no evidence , and that 's what we have to prove
1	he met his visitor with an apparently genial and good‐tempered air , and it was only after a few minutes that raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him , as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret
1	not to mention , said athos , that if he had not taken me out of cahusac 's hands , i would most certainly not have the honor of making my most humble bow before your majesty at this moment
1	we saw each other much later , oh , a long time later , when i went to ask her permission to marry here i will convey the essence of the matter , that is , only what i myself could take in ; and he also began telling me things incoherently
1	but i am giving you an announcement not about a poodle , but about my own nose : which means almost about me myself
1	at last poor akaky akakievich gave up the ghost
1	if he had been more in control of himself then , as he had been up to that moment , he would not have asked me that question about the document ; if he did , it was probably because he was in a frenzy himself
1	it makes no difference
1	oh , for my part i forgive him everything ; you can tell him that
1	he embraced me , stroked my head , called me tender words as if i were a little child
1	but i must be cooler ; i have become too irritable of late
1	to go wrong in one 's own way is better than to go right in someone else 's
1	but you kindly do not beat me !
1	surely versilov , once he 's married my mother , could ask the authorities for permission to adopt me for the father 's services , so to speak
1	of course it 's perfectly natural in your position
1	how pale you ’ ve grown !
1	give me some tea and bring me the papers , the old ones for the last five days , and i will give you something
1	i felt instinctively that someone was approaching me
1	she seemed to be imploring svidrigaïlov ; she had entirely forgotten her fear
1	he gazed at that pale , thin , irregular , angular little face , those soft blue eyes , which could flash with such fire , such stern energy , that little body still shaking with indignation and anger—and it all seemed to him more and more strange , almost impossible
1	i merely want to ask you , mr… ippolit … sorry , i ’ ve forgotten your last name
1	ah , the devil find what out ?
1	well , who would have expected to run into a slavophile ?
1	the affair did not work out on account of lydia 's death , and maybe it would not have worked out even if she had remained alive , but even now i do not let mama see the child
1	did i murder the old woman ?
1	understand , prince , that it was a momentary inspiration of his—who , then , informed you of it ?
1	tell her : peace or war !
1	besides , you liked her very much
1	it 's new and untried
1	if i am so scared now , what would it be if it somehow came to pass that i were really going to do it ?
1	but it was the end of everything ; he had not the axe !
1	the crackling of this burning straw and its light made the front hall very pleasant on a winter evening , when ardent youths , chilled in the pursuit of some swarthy beauty , came running in clapping their hands
1	all this is to be carried out in order ( le tout se fera avec ordre et méthode ) , sparing as far as possible the troops of the reserve
1	they approached a flooded river , which they had to cross by ferry
1	at nine o'clock , mme la première présidente arrived
1	why , she would give away her last penny !
1	suddenly she rushed and opened the small , old , out-of-tune piano that was in the room , started strumming on it and singing
1	milady saw at a single glance all the suffering she was causing felton by lingering over each detail of her story , but she did not want to spare him any torture
1	i must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear
1	neither her father and mother , nor sonya , nor prince andrei himself could have foreseen how parting with her fiancé would affect natasha
1	but there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him , that gradually his attention was riveted upon her , at first reluctantly and , as it were , resentfully , and then more and more intently
1	where the four of us would have been seen conferring together , so that in a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been warned by his spies that we were holding a council
1	in fact , all those seven years of their married life he gave way to her , too much so indeed , in many cases
1	but you have already started , she could not help herself and smiled
1	lida was never tender , she spoke only about serious things ; she lived her own separate life and for her mother and sister was as sacred and slightly mysterious a personage as an admiral who always remains in his cabin is for his sailors
1	take us to the man himself !
1	everything up to a certain limit , and everybody up to a certain limit—you ’ re all the same
1	giving lambert a searching look and figuring that at this point he could get money from him , the man agreed to follow him
1	you were probably silent for a very long time before this
1	these knee breeches and doublet , though new , looked wrinkled , like traveling clothes long shut away in a portmanteau
1	it would be needed only for the study of illnesses as phenomena of nature , not for their treatment
1	i sent her a note , by a maid , at the back door , sir
1	she was truthful and honest , while i—i was a spy , and with documents !
1	that 's true , said the medical student , and he became embarrassed , but anyuta did not manage to tidy up today
1	and you know she fancies it 's very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is !
1	of course it must all be interesting in its way ( ha‐ha‐ha !
1	no need to be nervous , the latter blurted out
1	it was carried on by means of sonia , who wrote every month to the razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity
1	they have a special gift for making these colorless beauties laugh and listen
1	the second , equally essential token is that a petersburg russian never uses the word breakfast , but always says frühstück , putting special emphasis on the früh
1	raskolnikov walked straight to x—— bridge , stood in the middle , and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance
1	not clever , alexandra agreed
1	ivan fyodorovich , hearing that the matter concerned a book , began assiduously serving himself sauce
1	i am no expert at giving mocking nicknames
1	they were approaching ; they were only a flight from him—and suddenly deliverance !
1	the officer presided over all these details with the same calm that milady had constantly seen in him , not uttering a word himself , and making himself obeyed by a gesture of the hand or a note of his whistle
1	rising ever higher and higher , this number , by the fall of , had reached a figure exceeding the population of the year
1	the sheer original does not exist ; we can not escape imitation
1	in church this time the pastor did not heap shame on the dead girl , and anyway there were very few people at the funeral , only some who came out of curiosity
1	i swear it by our god
1	her eyes , fixed upon him , betrayed horror and infinite grief
1	he was gray , remember , and his teeth were white—he stood and looked at us
1	yes , yes though i do not agree with you in everything , added avdotya romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry , for he squeezed her hand so painfully
1	the only ones who say it are always those who have never experimented with anything , never started any life , and went on vegetating with everything provided
1	you will grow so-o-o big , so-o-o-big !
1	but surely you are going to command it yourself ?
1	besides , even if nothing held him up on his way , his intention could no longer be carried out , because more than four hours ago napoleon had ridden from the suburb of dorogomilovo down the arbat to the kremlin , and , in the darkest mood , was now sitting in the tsar 's office in the kremlin palace , issuing detailed , thorough instructions about the measures to be taken immediately to put out the fires , prevent looting , and reassure the inhabitants
1	what do you think , could she have had such a thought ?
1	but along with that he knew that dron , grown rich and therefore hated by the community , was bound to waver between the two camps—the masters and the peasants
1	true , filipp ivanovich potanchikov used to visit me
1	you wrote that you had been insulted by my brother ; i think that this must be explained at once , and you must be reconciled
1	that is not the case at all
1	you know nothing , nothing about it she is so unhappy ah , how unhappy !
1	ones like that , in a shop now , cost only sixteen roubles , the younger one replied to lambert , justifying himself with reluctance
1	it 's odd that even at your father 's funeral you should be so unpunctual
1	i see , he went on , standing up again , i see that everything is against me here , everything and everyone
1	i absolutely want to know this poem
1	suddenly he jumped up , seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom
1	he assured us that this was impossible , that it was all 'cause of a fifteener , and so on , and so forth
1	but they were hardly out of the pothouse when they found themselves staring at the cause of the great commotion
1	a personally honorable citizen and a capable speaker
1	however , you know that , too , sonya
1	he added , looking at raskolnikov 's rags
1	they are all the same , he said to himself , thinking that he was not the only one to have the sad lot of being connected with a vile woman
1	what kind of warrior am i ?
1	he made an effort to look at the servant who never left his post at the head of the bed
1	and tell me , please , what do you find so shameful even in cesspools ?
1	not only did princess marya , won over by his meek attitude towards the wanderers , give him her most luminous looks , but the little one-year-old prince nikolai , as his grandfather called him , smiled at pierre and went to his arms
1	soon after artynov , his excellency came to thank her for taking part in the charity bazaar
1	i might be afraid of the godless man even now , the old man went on with concentration , only the thing is , my friend alexander semyonovich , that i have never once met a godless man , what i have met instead is vain men—that 's how they would better be called
1	he , too , appeared to be in some agitation
1	in that case you may be sure i have taken measures
1	yet my hatred could never ripen and settle in my soul
1	since the day when pierre , leaving the rostovs ' and remembering natasha 's grateful eyes , had looked at the comet that hung in the sky , and had felt that something new had been revealed to him—the question that eternally tormented him about the vanity and folly of all earthly things had stopped presenting itself to him
1	in the diplomatic respect , all napoleon 's arguments about his magnanimity and fairness , both before tutolmin and before yakovlev , who was mostly concerned with acquiring an overcoat and a wagon , proved useless : alexander did not receive these ambassadors or reply to their ambassage
1	when they became wicked , they began to talk of brotherhood and humaneness and understood these ideas
1	these vague expressions seemed quite comprehensible to him , though still too weak
1	this is the moment for consecrating our existence to the king of kings , said d'artagnan , if you insist on doing him a courtesy : non inutile desiderium in oblatione
1	the masters have sent a gig to go to the hospital
1	the horses went like the wind , and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london
1	prince shch , running up to her , finally persuaded her to leave quickly
1	did his majesty not just leave here , and did he not ask you to prepare for this visit ?
1	you did not speak like that just now and i can not be mistaken !
1	the boat pulls in , and from it steps the sorcerer
1	but she was obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling so strongly of scent ; and though her smile was impudent as well as cringing , it betrayed evident uneasiness
1	you earned it—right you are !
1	jussac cried for the third time
1	bilibin came out to meet bolkonsky
1	thought porthos , walking away
1	he turned around , but there was absolutely no one there ; he looked in all directions , peeked into the bushes— no one anywhere
1	she went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water
1	he felt very suspicious of svidrigaïlov
1	the last idea was the most revolting , but he was a sceptic , he was young , abstract , and therefore cruel , and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely
1	so do me the favor
1	nikolenka , what 's the matter with you ?
1	and he actually got it confused : i heard some such story about a stone back in the time of my childhood , only , naturally , it was not the same and was not about that stone
1	at last her restlessness reached an extreme point
1	your mother will add the recipe for a certain balm , which she got from a bohemian woman , and which has the miraculous virtue of healing every wound that does not attain the heart
1	excuse me , prince , what are your orders ?
1	finally , he dreamed he was having a sort of waking delirium and was quite unable to scatter the visions crowding around him , despite the full awareness that it was only delirium and not reality
1	which of us is the madman ?
1	i remember that , sitting and reasoning , i turned all these new questions , which came crowding one after another , even in quite a different direction and invented something quite new
1	i am saying , sire , that these excessive struggles and eternal labors are bad for my health
1	tanya came walking towards him through the park
1	our silence had already lasted some five minutes
1	you see , mother may ask for it before dinner
1	he may die during the night !
1	one 's ashamed to speak of it
1	i had entered that regiment when i came back from abroad , after that meeting abroad with andrei petrovich
1	dounia shook her head
1	said the eldest daughter , alexandra
1	and dull thoughts spoiled his merriment , and he kept thinking that this was not life around him , but scraps of life , fragments , that everything here was accidental , it was impossible to draw any conclusions ; and he even felt sorry for these girls who lived and would end their lives here in this backwoods , in the provinces , far from any cultivated milieu where nothing was accidental , everything made sense , was right , and where every suicide , for example , could be understood and one could explain why and what its significance was in the general course of life
1	i do not think so , he said , although—yes
1	we show you the door
1	wo not he leave dounia in peace even here ?
1	she said , handing the flower back to him
1	he says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance , and yet he lies in bed doing nothing
1	her father had died long ago ; his armchair was lying in the attic , dusty , one leg missing
1	on the contrary , your reasoning is excellent
1	but that was not what louis xiii wanted ; louis xiii wanted a discussion that would yield some sort of light , convinced as he was that the cardinal had some ulterior motive and was contriving some terrible surprise for him , as his eminence knew how to do
1	well , if you remembered something ; that 's all right !
1	at the end of january , princess marya left for moscow , and the count insisted that natasha go with her so as to consult the doctors
1	she felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy
1	such mockery of us , the epanchins !
1	besides , porthos ca not owe you much
1	and i went there about a scandalous business
1	however , ukrainian tales levchenko is now sitting at the deacon 's , that i know
1	perhaps there is some misunderstanding here , but , generally speaking , that seems to be so , and our society has been fully just in defining its ideal of the practical man
1	i never thought it was possible for a man who has never wept , for a man of forty-five , not a child , to weep from fear !
1	we are very poor , but i can speak for myself at least : precisely because your father is rich , i do not consider myself his relation , and neither i nor my mother will ever ask for or accept anything from him
1	jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of god ?
1	i also suspected that , besides that , he also despised me for yesterday 's scene at dergachev 's ; that was as it should have been : efim was the crowd , efim was the street , and that always bows down only to success
1	in our settlement there 's a cossack named sheptun
1	he 's a political conspirator , there 's not a doubt about it , razumihin decided , as he slowly descended the stairs
1	they do not even take it into account in the way it ought to be taken , and yet the whole account depends on that
1	but the thoughts he read in the book did not satisfy him
1	a cold sweat broke out on the cardinal 's brow
1	the man quickly came back and , taking a large unsealed envelope from his pocket , threw it down on a little table near the prince
1	cheated him , that is
1	he said to her
1	his flight from home , and his kaftan , and his pistol , and his declaration to the rostovs that he would stay in moscow—all this would not only lose its meaning , but would become contemptible and ridiculous ( to which pierre was sensitive ) , if , after all that , he left moscow like everybody else
1	a mace gleamed in his hand ; around him his hired troops ; on both sides stirred a red sea of zaporozhtsy
1	she went strolling alone , in the same beret , with the white spitz ; nobody knew who she was , and they called her simply the lady with the little dog
1	but in spite of that , natasha , now excited , now frightened , her eyes staring , lay for a long time in her mother 's bed that evening
1	and with love one can live even without happiness
1	pierre turned with the same question to prince andrei
1	that 's how it was you attracted my curiosity
1	you absolutely must come and visit us
1	a young , childish sleep was irresistibly coming over him
1	ilya petrovitch held out his hand
1	the greater was his amazement when this same pseldonymov , not more than a week ago , put in a request to get married
1	he had eaten nothing and slept poorly that night , as people close to him said
1	he thought it would be terrible for me
1	marya dmitrievna was known to the tsar 's family , was known to all moscow and all petersburg , and both cities , astonished at her , chuckled secretly at her rudeness and told anecdotes about her ; nevertheless , everyone without exception respected and feared her
1	zakhar , without changing the position of his outstretched arms , raised the hand that held the reins
1	see , he holds it up ( his head , natasha meant )
1	oh , he knows , she went on answering me , but looked as if she had forgotten me and was talking to herself
1	you would better have some tea !
1	she still stood meditating
1	i can not have it anymore , he said and left the room
1	said athos , still in the breach
1	but it seems to me that the only possible happiness is animal happiness , and you want to deprive him of it
1	they all stammer , do not they ?
1	best sort , he muttered , choosing a rhyme , resort
1	he did not know where to put it , racked his brains over it , trembled from fear that it might be stolen from him , and finally seemed to decide to bury it in the ground
1	why should they have called the porter , if it had been their doing ?
1	what orders , your honor ?
1	sits without money and mopes , i replied briefly , burning with curiosity myself
1	so does it matter whether it 's sooner or later ?
1	no , such people , it seems , are not of flesh but of bronze !
1	and so on , and finally , taking her daughter by the hand , she drew her from her husband to her own room , taking upon herself personally the next day 's responsibility before the terrible father when he called for an account
1	till then i had never realized that i loved her
1	but the main thing , the main thing is not in the thought alone , but in the whole situation !
1	his landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals , and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her , though he went without his dinner
1	here was a girl of pride , character , virtue , of education and breeding superior to his own ( he felt that ) , and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension , and would humble herself in the dust before him , and he would have absolute , unbounded power over her !
1	and could she see him ?
1	finally , the confession , at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism , and when , moreover , there were no proofs against the real criminal , no suspicions even ( porfiry petrovitch fully kept his word ) —all this did much to soften the sentence
1	for the world of the angels and the souls of all the bodiless beings who dwell above us , natasha prayed
1	why , if i had the slightest suspicion of you , should i have acted like that ?
1	well , what are they getting at me for ?
1	he repeated , now pacing the room , now stretching out on the sofa , and constantly looking at his watch
1	i do not understand the meaning of this strange custom at all
1	grandpa himself , as malasha mentally called kutuzov , sat apart from them in a dark corner behind the stove
1	by those indefinable signs which , even from a distance , unmistakably distinguish a living body from a dead one , napoleon saw from poklonnaya hill the quivering of life in the city and felt , as it were , the breathing of that big and beautiful body
1	nikolai was a simple farmer , did not like innovations , especially the english ones which were becoming fashionable then , laughed at theoretical writings on farming , did not like millworks , expensive products , expensive cereal crops , and generally was not taken up with any specific part of farming
1	pierre was looking at him and had no time to turn away before the old man opened his eyes and fixed his firm and stern gaze directly on pierre 's face
1	if it had not been for something that happened , they would have done so to‐day for certain ; perhaps even now they will arrest me to‐day but that 's no matter , sonia ; they will let me out again for there is not any real proof against me , and there wo not be , i give you my word for it
1	i ’ ll remind you of it tonight …
1	la plèbe , le traître le bien publique , he thought
1	at seven in the morning , he woke up and called planchet , who at the second call opened the door , his face still not properly cleansed of yesterday 's worries
1	in view of this coffin , not only should the money not be taken , but , on the contrary , a deduction should be made from us in your favor !
1	not that i say it in reproach of her !
1	him i know , not personally , but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman
1	you say katerina ivanovna 's mind is unhinged ; your own mind is unhinged , he said after a brief silence
1	i am quite ready to , said d'artagnan , but first i would like to be sure of one thing
1	a peasant woman came into the cottage and began unhurriedly to fire the stove in order to cook supper
1	he went to have a look at the patient
1	yegor semyonych and tanya often quarreled and said unpleasant things to each other
1	but the greatest attention was accorded to totally extraneous events , which had no relation to the battle
1	anna mikhailovna , meek sorrow and all-forgiveness on her face , and the unknown lady stood by the door
1	crowds of wounded and unwounded men of various units , with frightened faces , trudged on the one side back to mozhaisk and on the other side back to valuevo
1	he had not been at mama 's since last evening
1	his face expressed the joy of relief a man feels who intends to rest after an official appearance
1	said d'artagnan , drawing his pistols from his belt
1	do not talk to me like that : i am not worthy of it !
1	it 's better i should know , far better !
1	he drank two bottles of wine by himself
1	quite impossible , to my thinking
1	have not i already done it once ?
1	the cardinal 's , replied mme bonacieux
1	razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs
1	said ivan nikiforovich , too upset himself to know what to do and , contrary to his habit , getting to his feet
1	he shouted , forgetting himself and choking on every word
1	enough , mother , said raskolnikov , deeply regretting that he had come
1	then , finally , there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even to himself , and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things of this sort
1	but that was not kanev , it was shumsk
1	three silver roubles or two 'paper ones ' as she says that old woman hm
1	it 's spirited of you , it proves you wanted to spare rodion romanovitch
1	learned men now say that genius is akin to madness
1	am i to give my dounia to a man like you ?
1	simply a floating idea
1	and , as she said these words , she actually devoured her with her gaze
1	( she seized him by the shoulder , he got up , looking at her almost bewildered )
1	lose it he does , rogozhin agrees
1	denisov , we are here ! —he 's asleep , he said , leaning his whole body forward , as if hoping by this posture to speed up the movement of the sleigh
1	i will never tell it to anyone , but my god !
1	the dusk turns gray
1	at supper he drank two glasses of champagne—an agent known to have a good effect with regard to gaiety
1	andrei petrovich , speaking here yesterday about nobility , did not say anything new to me , i assure you
1	why should … but i ’ m tired , kolya … besides , it ’ s too sad to start about that again … how is he , though ?
1	cried the astonished cardinal
1	cried luzhin , utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now
1	he said resolutely ; he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office
1	however his health seemed unimpaired so far , and looking at his noble , clear‐skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late , pyotr petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the conviction that he would find another bride and , perhaps , even a better one
1	just as i do
1	you once said that makar ivanovich came to visit you several times , and always stayed in my mother 's apartment ?
1	but i am a most ordinary woman ; i am a calm woman , i like
1	it 's cheap , though i could not , of course , find out so much about it , for i am a stranger in petersburg myself , pyotr petrovitch replied huffily
1	it 's highway robbery , my dear sir , you will answer for it !
1	here you expect an explanation from me , sonia ; you are sitting and waiting for it , i see that
1	how many did we kill ?
1	there were six children
1	that ’ s not how i wanted to put it
1	that , my friend , you must ask the doctor , he said , and , clearly making another effort to be gentle , he said with his lips only ( it was clear that he did not at all think what he was saying ) : merci , chère amie , d'être venue
1	but what if we should all go !
1	outside it was a dark autumn night
1	but what can i do ?
1	i have lost the key and can not find it
1	why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was caught in boulogne , [ ] while later the criminals were the ones he caught ?
1	early on the third day after the murder , when they were still dandling koch and pestryakov—though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff‐an unexpected fact turned up
1	but neither in the one case nor in the other , however we may change our point of view , however we may try to grasp what connection the man finds himself in with the external world , or however inaccessible it seems to us , however much we lengthen or shorten the period of time , however intelligible or unfathomable the causes are for us—we can never imagine either total freedom or total necessity
1	this cause consisted in their numbers
1	i used to carry you about in my arms , sir
1	besides , i am going he paused
1	killing people if i took away the rail or , let 's say , put a log across the tracks , well , then the train might go off , but this
1	there was certainly something of the sort , raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him , goodness knows why
1	do not answer yet , katerina nikolaevna , but listen to everything and then tell me the whole truth
1	i haven ’ t heard it either !
1	nothing 's been tidied up , vassilyich is running his feet off
1	he stopped in mid-speech , lowered his eyes , so as not to see her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face , and said : it 's not at all to quarrel with you that i have come today
1	bring me tea and veal
1	but my brother nikolai ivanych did not lament over it ; he ordered twenty gooseberry bushes , planted them , sat down and began living like a landowner
1	no , it 's decided , everything 's decided
1	and it seems she does not want to know yet
1	it made me ill , but dounia bore it better than i did , and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up !
1	now drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes ; it was dark as in a cellar , so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of objects
1	he said that masonry is the teaching of christianity , freed of state [ ] and religious fetters ; the teaching of equality , brotherhood , and love
1	and your little cottage is choking on something and squealing pitifully
1	petya shook himself , jumped up , took a rouble from his pocket and gave it to likhachev , swung the saber to try it out , and put it in the scabbard
1	as she needed her bile to work , so she also sometimes needed her remaining thinking capacity to work , and the pretext for that was a game of patience
1	the full moon stood high in the bright sky
1	that the prince may marry her you do know ?
1	but he stood in the waiting‐room , and people , who apparently had nothing to do with him , were continually passing to and fro before him
1	as i came in now , i suddenly said , hello , mama , something i had never done before , though somehow this time , too , out of shyness , i still could not force myself to look at her , and sat down at the opposite side of the room
1	he finally had some sort of fit , which resolved itself in sobbing
1	as he passed through , the wind swelled out porthos 's long cloak , and d'artagnan dove straight into it
1	the queen gave them to me ; the queen is taking them back again : her will , like god 's , be done in all things
1	sounds of a struggle were heard , and sonya 's displeased voice :
1	exactly four days ago
1	i was firmly convinced in myself that i would not betray or tell my idea to them ; but they ( that is , again , they or their sort ) might tell me something on their own that would make me disappointed in my idea , even without my mentioning it to them
1	yes , in all likelihood ; but that is too cheerless an idea
1	indeed , dear rodya , the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this day i can not read it without tears
1	here , from among the folk marveling with fear , one leaped on his horse and , looking wildly around , as if trying to see whether anyone was pursuing him , hastily rode off as fast as his horse could go
1	he was almost beginning to rave something seemed suddenly to go to his head
1	i know what you lack : it 's this !
1	the moment anyone became the least bit famous and was talked about , she made his acquaintance , became his friend that same day , and invited him to her house
1	that 's good , afanasy ivanovich would answer
1	i wo not let you drink !
1	dolokhov said now , as if guessing rostov 's thought , and he smiled
1	all this doubt only gave him a more intense desire to reach some certainty , and he went to his friend with the firm intention of renewing the evening 's conversation ; but he found athos completely sober again—that is , the most subtle and impenetrable of men
1	this incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness , even consternation
1	a quite handsome curly-headed boy with a gaze resembling the gaze of christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing bilboquet
1	his visit the evening before , it will be remembered , had been very brief and not very explicative
1	he had already gone one step , but could not help himself and turned
1	he was not , for the moment , wearing a uniform tabard , which in any case was not absolutely obligatory in that time of lesser freedom but greater independence , but a sky blue jerkin , a bit faded and frayed , and over this garment a magnificent baldric , embroidered in gold , which glittered like the sparkles that scatter over the water in bright sunlight
1	the criminal ends by going and denouncing himself to the clergy , and surrenders to the hands of the authorities
1	prince lev nikolaevich suddenly asked , after a moment ’ s silence
1	she articulated softly and caressingly , as though surprised to find her there
1	or the one who wraps silk around a razor , fixes it tight , sneaks up behind his friend , and cuts his throat like a sheep , as i read recently
1	not one of them has ever poked his nose in here , i have never set eyes on them
1	this new woman announced to him that in the fullest sense it would make no difference to her if he married any woman he liked right then and there , but that she had come to prevent this marriage of his , and to prevent it out of spite , solely because she wanted it that way , and consequently it must be that way—well , so that now i can simply laugh at you to my heart ’ s content , because now i , too , finally feel like laughing
1	but you remember everything !
1	the boy told me to do it
1	and above all , i am getting old , that 's the thing !
1	so , the unknown man said coldly , he 's some prince of the blood in disguise
1	raskolnikov really was almost well , as compared with his condition the day before , but he was still pale , listless , and sombre
1	rochefort , all is not lost , and perhaps
1	it 's hard on me
1	dubasov told me yesterday ; he 's always the first to know such news
1	prove to me that you are my friend , come with me !
1	i must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than i have done , for i have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning
1	not in the least
1	however , it seems the regiment 's not such a bad one eh ?
1	berg , judging by his wife , considered all women weak and stupid
1	young people do not know how to drink anymore , said athos , looking at him with pity , and yet he 's one of the best !
1	the silver cigarette case ; i spoke of it last time , you know
1	but he did not look at them ; he looked fixedly only at what was happening ahead of him—at the battery
1	a handsome man and a drunkard , the number one at the second gun was known in his world as uncle ; tushin looked at him more often than at the others and rejoiced at his every movement
1	with his son , however , he used the diplomacy he made use of on important occasions
1	what could he do ?
1	but no bad conclusions were drawn from her grief
1	but those are for the most part the learned and all old fogeys , so that it would be almost ill‐bred in a man of society
1	their characters can best be known by comparison : ivan ivanovich has an extraordinary gift for speaking with extreme pleasantness
1	the stupid woman had never seen a king of spain before
1	you do not know , but they really thought that
1	he needs activity , and this regular , quiet life is ruining him
1	what was to be done ?
1	i ’ m not trying to ferret out anything about gavrila ardalionovich in asking you , observed nina alexandrovna , you must make no mistake on that account
1	why should he be the only exception ?
1	i can not suspect my maid : she was sitting in her kitchen
1	are not you my pretty one !
1	pierre stopped laughing , got up , went further away from the curious fellow , and looked around
1	he stood for some time on the steps , looking gloomily at raskolnikov striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging
1	monsieur knows this horse ?
1	rushing to the conclusion that amalia ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent , she began treating her with extreme nonchalance , which the latter promptly observed and resented
1	how do you know it ?
1	but no matter , he will turn up
1	not yet , wait a little : you said this evening
1	after the twentieth of each month we send him fifty roubles—that mainly serves as the theme of our conversation
1	and a magnificent one !
1	i explained the way myself , told you where it was , and the hours you could find me here
1	besides , it does not matter , they still know nothing , he thought , and they are used to thinking of me as eccentric
1	how did i come to that ?
1	how do you mean ?
1	i will finish my letter tomorrow
1	among them stood a man in a bloody white shirt
1	all my misfortunes come of having said more or less what you have just said before a woman who i believed was my friend and who betrayed me
1	there 's no hurry , there 's no hurry , it 's all nonsense
1	as he was slowly walking down the path with his usual unconcern , having no thoughts at all , a strange incident occurred with him
1	sit down , dear boy , you must be tired ; i see you are
1	it 's written here 'campany , that 's a thing to remember , that letter a , and to look at it again in a month—how shall i look at it then ?
1	till now no one has found out who she 's in love with : i am the first to discover it
1	( at the wishes of liza and prince andrei , they had sent to moscow in due time for an accoucheur , and he was expected at any moment )
1	fortunately that did not happen
1	i forgot to ask you ; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman ?
1	so pierre reflected , and accustomed as he was to it , this whole general , universally acknowledged lie amazed him each time like something new
1	wake up , sonya , she said almost with tears in her voice
1	the three stopped at once , drew close together , and waited , keeping to the middle of the way
1	he cried in a sudden spasm of agony , let me be !
1	the prince gave a start
1	i interrupted with vexation
1	allow me to say , auntie—is not that the storchenko i became acquainted with at the posting station ?
1	i came out proud , but crushed in spirit
1	you miss an infinitesimal line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence !
1	alexandra picked it up , adelaida came over to her , and they both began to study it
1	mlekopitaev , a titular councillor
1	you are begging for some favor on my part , he asked , pondering , and being terribly insistent—i find that suspicious ; i want to know more
1	prince andrei cried in a high , squeaky voice
1	listen , what would you say to becoming an ensign in my guards , and to commanding a company after the campaign ?
1	it was all only a dream , from the horror of that time … i began to study then ; i wouldn ’ t have come back here for three years …
1	kutuzov listened to the report of the general on duty ( the main subject of which was a critique of the position at tsarevo-zaimishche ) in the same way as he had listened to denisov , in the same way as he had listened , seven years earlier , to the debate at the austerlitz council of war
1	but put some writer or foolish peasant woman in jupiter 's place—oh , what thunder , what thunder there will be !
1	my dear rodion romanovitch , excuse me !
1	je crois que non , replied the officer , feeling himself all over , mais je l'ai manqué belle cette fois-ci
1	tikhon went and told him
1	get in , all of you !
1	let him come in then , let him come in !
1	before , when he was still sitting at home , in anguish , he had imagined a thousand times how he would enter his office
1	asked the gascon , proud to show off so rich a present before the eyes of his friends
1	never mind , never mind , replied rostov
1	these are with cloves and walnuts !
1	and of whom shall i now ask forgiveness ?
1	he was standing , hat and gloves in hand , but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases
1	he looked : dolokhov was standing on the windowsill , his face pale and merry
1	and where is she to get raspberries for you ?
1	the little princess , like an old warhorse hearing the sound of trumpets , was preparing herself , unconsciously and forgetting her condition , for her habitual coquettish gallop , without any second thoughts or struggles , but with naïve , light-minded merriment
1	she begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to‐morrow for the service , and then to be present at the funeral lunch
1	qu'on emmène cet homme , [ ] the french officer said quickly and energetically , taking the arm of pierre , whom he had just promoted to frenchman for saving his life , and going into the house with him
1	but all the same you ought to go to the reception room , he observed as insistently as possible
1	incredible as it might seem , on the third day after the quarrel , mrs epanchin sent him a footman with a note asking him to come without fail ; kolya did not put on airs and went at once
1	do you know , i fancied i keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination
1	now , let 's reckon up how much we have in all
1	so i have had my sleep
1	the church is quiet
1	but there were far , far too many other insoluble circumstances that had come together that morning , all at the same time , and all demanding immediate resolution , so that the prince felt very sad
1	he had brought me here to explain , to recount , to justify something to me ; and yet everything was already explained and justified before any words
1	only , please , when i am entertaining the guests , said vera , do not interrupt me , because i know how to entertain each of them and what to say in all kinds of company
1	she fell into an armchair , crossing her arms , lowering her head , and expecting every moment to see a judge come in to interrogate her
1	andrey semyonovitch was an anæmic , scrofulous little man , with strangely flaxen mutton‐chop whiskers of which he was very proud
1	as you like , it 's nothing to me , but i wo not come with you ; here we are at home
1	the thaw and the fog persisted ; at a distance of forty paces they could not see each other clearly
1	she must have passed this way , he added with a terrible smile , for i see a dead body !
1	karl ivanych always says that sleep is best of all , princess marya whispered with a sigh
1	learning now that andrei yefimych was destitute , that he had nothing to live on , he suddenly wept for some reason and embraced his friend
1	and how do you know whether i wanted to save anyone then ?
1	here , too , is an abyss ; here , too , is a forty-five-degree slope , down which you can not help sliding , and something invincibly challenges you to pull the trigger
1	and there 's pomatum , too , you see , she must have things ; petticoats , starched ones , shoes , too , real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle
1	and i kept thinking and i had dreams all the time , strange dreams of all sorts , no need to describe !
1	i never have liked water , he thought , even in a landscape , and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea : surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter , but i have become more particular , like an animal that picks out a special place for such an occasion
1	i am very glad , really very glad , that my brother has distinguished himself
1	and how proud they are !
1	i noticed these brooders while i was still in school , and concluded then that it was all because they became envious very early on
1	did i say that ?
1	why is he here ?
1	i , of course , do not have the least right in people ’ s eyes to have any self-love
1	the man stood in the doorway , looked at raskolnikov without speaking , and took a step forward into the room
1	he was very tired and talking as if at random
1	i tell you again , mother , he is still very ill do not you see it ?
1	'oh , in such‐and‐such a place
1	the mystery of death !
1	you see , i am trying on my wedding outfit
1	khoma was again taken to the church in the same way ; again he was left alone , and the door was locked on him
1	how did it happen ?
1	he asked , pointing to the young man
1	in a double sleigh harnessed to two gray trotters that kicked snow back into the dashboard , anatole flashed by with his usual friend makarin
1	even if he had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him , it would not have allayed his uneasiness
1	dolokhov 's back in its white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides
1	one little finger was named pistachio , another vanilla , another raspberry , and so on
1	guffaws , shouts , and ladies ' shrieks were heard
1	letters were sent twice a year , neither more nor less , and they were extremely like one another
1	he took out a notebook , quickly jotted something with a pencil , tore out the page , handed it over , went with quick steps to the window , dropped his body into a chair , and looked around at those who were in the room , as if asking why they were looking at him
1	so flowed the peaceful life of this man who , with a salary of four hundred , was able to content himself with his lot , and so it might have flowed on into extreme old age , had it not been for the various calamities strewn along the path of life , not only of titular , but even of privy , actual , court , and other councillors , even of those who neither give counsel nor take any themselves
1	it can not be , muttered dounia , with white lips
1	pour vos beaux yeux , mon cousin !
1	d'artagnan , mute with wrath and anxiety , sat down , threatening as a judge
1	but she was silent , perhaps waiting for him to speak
1	i never lie , madame
1	they went out ; pavel pavlovich contemplated the dressed-up velchaninov with satisfaction ; it even seemed as if more respect and importance showed in his face
1	so you have seen that man before ?
1	that 's right , said the king , let 's put the case before the judges : it 's their business to judge , and they will judge
1	milady fell backwards and seemed to faint
1	the door was wide open on the stairs ; he could hear exclamations and discussion
1	soon as they make peace , the war with boonapart will open up
1	and yet i wo not look at it as you do
1	he had wanted to go every day and kept being distracted by circumstances … but now he promised himself … without fail … even to —– province … so you know natalia nikitishna ?
1	but maybe you would not have managed to reassure her ; even without you , it seems a lot was seething and smoldering there , vasin remarked in passing
1	on sunday morning , marya dmitrievna invited her guests to the liturgy at her parish of the dormition on mogiltsy
1	i was dying of boredom
1	and why did you also keep silent earlier and not ask ?
1	jesus said unto her , thy brother shall rise again
1	two weeks after the receipt of the letter , in the evening , prince vassily 's people arrived in advance of him , and the next day he himself arrived with his son
1	grandpa , asked lipa , when a man dies , how many days after does his soul wander the earth ?
1	abroad , in yearning and happiness , and , i will add , in the strictest monastic solitude ( this particular information i received later through tatyana pavlovna ) , he suddenly remembered mama—remembered precisely her sunken cheeks—and sent for her at once
1	i kept looking , too … listen , when i came in here earlier and looked at your dear faces—i ’ m very attentive to faces now—and heard your first words , i felt light at heart for the first time since then
1	'and how was that ?
1	and it certainly was a fatum
1	and more about death
1	sofya ivanovna , he went on , addressing sonia , who was very much surprised and already alarmed , immediately after your visit i found that a hundred‐rouble note was missing from my table , in the room of my friend mr lebeziatnikov
1	to each his own , ivan danilych
1	and maybe sonia herself will be bankrupt to‐day , for there is always a risk , hunting big game digging for gold then they would all be without a crust to‐morrow except for my money
1	i ’ m noble , noble , chivalrously noble !
1	i myself ca not tell whether they were dreams or something else— as if some evil spirit was strangling me—and the accursed old man kept appearing in them
1	reading was , of course , a great help – it stirred , delighted , and tormented me
1	go and start a conversation with him : poor , destitute , and wretched , the wife died , there was no money for medicine , and in the winter the baby froze to death ; the older daughter has become a kept woman … he ’ s eternally whimpering , eternally complaining !
1	what a strange note !
1	of that later , but i will note that it was this strangeness of his relations with versilov that struck me in his favor
1	well , how nice , the young man said , laughing , she finds me worth something at least—a hundred louis !
1	yet much , very much , of the essential needed to be defined and clarified , even urgently so , but of those things we did not speak
1	molière had not yet written his play the miser
1	my first impulse , on regaining consciousness , was to look under my pillow for the knife i had been unable to reach
1	my share of the inheritance satisfies stebelkov , but stebelkov says that zhibelsky also has to be satisfied
1	and sonia hastily jumped up from her seat
1	besides , i have something to ask you , general
1	ah , vakula , you are here !
1	i will tell her , when it can be done
1	from nikitskaya , from presnia , from podnovinsky boulevard , several trains like the rostovs ' came together in kudrino , and now two lines of carriages drove down sadovaya
1	we spent the night in the fields , brother , and i woke up early in the morning , everybody was still asleep , and the sun had not even peeked out from behind the forest yet
1	what would have become then of the activity of all those people who opposed the then tendency of the government—an activity which , in the opinion of the historians , was good and useful ?
1	their children were everyone 's children , because they all constituted one family
1	oh , this was too much !
1	you have granted me that awakening ; let me enjoy it at my ease
1	well , but then i took heart
1	and olenka was widowed again
1	she looks around , seeking this power in order to rid herself of it , but she can not find it
1	both passed the examination
1	i ’ ll go to the street , katya , you heard , that ’ s the place for me , or else i ’ ll become a washerwoman !
1	—killed his friend with one blow , like a sheep , and took his watch
1	you are surely not telling us everything ; you surely did something said natasha , and she paused , something good
1	however , he himself did not understand why he found it so especially funny , but the further it went , the funnier it became to him
1	meaning that there 's a big question , sir : about the crape , sir ?
1	yes , that wall of meyer ’ s can tell a lot !
1	that i will become the laughing-stock of all moscow ; that everyone will say that you , in a drunken state , forgetting yourself , challenged to a duel a man of whom you were groundlessly jealous , hélène raised her voice and became more and more inspired , and who is better than you in all respects
1	the meanest and most hateful thing about money is that it even gives one talent
1	several important persons were to be there , who had to be shamed for going to the french theater and inspired with patriotic sentiments
1	was just being hatched in their brains you understand ?
1	not in the least
1	she was wringing her hands
1	so i will write him a letter more or less in these terms let 's hear , said aramis , putting on a critical face beforehand
1	remember thy compassion and mercy from all eternity ; drive us not away from thy face , neither scorn our unworthiness , but have mercy upon us according to thy great mercy and in the abundance of thy compassion regard not our sins and transgressions
1	i will note once and for all that never in my life has casualness suited me , that is , it has never made me look good , but , on the contrary , has always covered me with shame
1	she worked day and night for her sister , and besides doing the cooking and the washing , she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned
1	i appeal particularly to you , honoured pulcheria alexandrovna , on this subject , the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else
1	so carts may quite cold-bloodedly exclude ?
1	still , it 's a pity
1	cried the stupefied musketeer
1	i really do not know what drew me to her then—i think it was because she was always ill if she had been lame or hunchback , i believe i should have liked her better still , he smiled dreamily
1	my name is vrazumihin , at your service ; not razumihin , as i am always called , but vrazumihin , a student and gentleman ; and he is my friend
1	well , i see now , the old woman said , it 's evidently his fate
1	oh , how low i have sunk !
1	it 's hard to describe how good it is to jostle about on such a night with a bunch of laughing and singing girls and lads ready for every joke and prank that a merrily laughing night can inspire
1	the lady did not live with him long
1	what is she doing , then ?
1	and she menacingly pushed her sleeves up still higher
1	well , then , tell him this , rochefort : tell him that our conversation in the inn of the red dovecote was overheard by these four men ; tell him that after he left , one of them came upstairs and tore from me by violence the safe conduct he had given me ; tell him that they warned lord de winter of my crossing to england ; that , this time again , they almost caused the failure of my mission , as they caused the failure of the one with the pendants ; tell him that , of these four men , only two are to be feared— d'artagnan and athos ; tell him that the third , aramis , is mme de chevreuse 's lover : he must be left alive , we know his secret , he may be useful ; as for the fourth , porthos , he 's a fool , a fop , and a ninny , and not even worth bothering with
1	the merry beauty said , turning to one of the girls , you have new booties !
1	maybe we were expecting you
1	moscow has nothing else to do but gossip , he went on
1	the hussars assiduously began lining up their horses
1	he looked extraordinarily sad and weary
1	what are you afraid of , liza ?
1	( ) however accessible the chain of causes of any event , we will never know the entire chain , because it is endless , and again we will never get complete necessity
1	for the street , this is apology enough versilov stopped and suddenly rocked with laughter ; i even thought for a moment that he had gone ahead with this whole story for the fun of it , but that was not so
1	but little folk 's philosophizing does not harm anyone , andrei yefimych said , sounding as if he wanted to weep and awaken pity
1	i can barely see … the bed
1	in those times , too , people loved , envied , sought truth , virtue , were carried away by passions ; there was the same complex mental and moral life , sometimes even more refined than now , among the upper classes
1	trust me in this matter and , believe me , i shall be capable of judging impartially
1	i ca not remember a single new book in which the author does not do his best , from the very first page , to entangle himself in all possible conventions and private deals with his conscience
1	you were all in it together , and i do not know what keeps me from exterminating you all !
1	she did not respond at all to velchaninov 's timid consolations and ardent promises to bring her father to her the next day without fail
1	or-orphans , lebedev began , cringing , but stopped : the prince looked ahead of him distractedly and had quite certainly forgotten his question
1	could it be i was a born gambler ?
1	kutu-zov 's reply to this letter was the same as to the first , sent with lauriston : he said there could be no question of peace
1	but just as the force of gravity , unfathomable in itself but sensed by every man , is only comprehensible to us insofar as we know the law of necessity it is subject to ( from the primitive knowledge that all bodies are heavy , to newton 's law ) , so , too , the force of freedom , unfathomable in itself but of which each of us is conscious , is only comprehensible to us insofar as we know the laws of necessity which it is subject to ( starting from the fact that every man dies and going as far as the knowledge of the most complex economic or historical laws )
1	what would have become of me but for you ?
1	who do you mean ?
1	he writes nothing about his sufferings
1	i know nothing about it , she cried with a heartrending wail , and she ran to katerina ivanovna , who clasped her tightly in her arms , as though she would shelter her from all the world
1	it 's the uniform of the cardinal 's guards ; there 's not an moment to lose !
1	and what cowards they all are here , about having an opinion of their own , you ca not fancy , rodion romanovitch
1	the whole thing , in fact , was perfectly clear
1	i , for instance , am quite unable to reconcile myself to the solemn expression my wife acquires each time gnekker sits down with us , nor can i be reconciled to the bottles of lafite , port , and sherry that are served only for his sake , to give him ocular evidence of the luxury and largesse of our life
1	ebd e‐booksdirectorycom a strange period began for raskolnikov : it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape
1	andreev knocked your hat off , and you gave him twenty-five roubles for it
1	here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes
1	said d'artagnan , who could calculate like archimedes
1	he hastens to prescribe some medicine and waves his arms , so that the peasant mother will quickly take the child away
1	but what if it were the fourth , what if it were the fifteenth , that 's all nonsense !
1	suddenly and quite unexpectedly the ruffled young man in blue spectacles popped from behind a bush
1	but i was afraid to analyze and tried with all my might to divert myself
1	now , when everything ’ s already concluded , i will allow myself to ask just one thing : how could she give you her consent and even present you with her portrait , when you don ’ t love her ?
1	( it was evident that he did not like the viscount and that , though he was not looking at him , his talk was directed against him )
1	by very different means , with opposite tonalities , both stories reveal the infinite value of what is perishing
1	and you know , my dear , my good one—i want to change completely toward him : i want to show him kindness
1	what , is it late ?
1	i have come to see the count with my mother , but it seems he 's not entirely well
1	by the way , my friend , what was it that happened to you last time in front of katerina nikolaevna ?
1	otherwise he will take up one thing or another , turn smart , and then there will be no getting rid of him !
1	but it cost her great effort to do so , because what he said did not interest her at all
1	in my opinion , you may even be very intelligent at times , the prince went on
1	i took up the exercise , and as nature has granted me certain abilities , today i can throw a lasso as well as any man in the world
1	once , a week before his death , katerina nikolaevna suggested inviting me for diversion , but he even frowned
1	can it be that i , too , will reach such a state some day ?
1	however , i have long ceased thinking of anything—it 's all the same to me
1	what a burden to bear !
1	i am , my friend , the legs mostly ; they brought me as far as the doorstep , but once i sat down here , they got swollen
1	saddle horses stood by this house , and the suite was gathering , evidently preparing for the sovereign 's levee
1	your cockiness is dear to you , you do not feel like apologizing , the staff captain went on , but for us old-timers , since we have grown up and , god willing , will die serving in the regiment , the honor of the regiment is dear to us , and bogdanych knows it
1	you know , dear heart , you need not have flown into a temper !
1	anna mikhailovna left him , and when she came back , he was sound asleep , his head resting on his arm
1	so it is finally settled ; you have determined to marry a sensible business man , avdotya romanovna , one who has a fortune ( has already made his fortune , that is so much more solid and impressive ) a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation , as mother writes , and who seems to be kind , as dounia herself observes
1	ptitsyn looked in and called ganya
1	denisov , rostov , and nesvitsky closed their eyes
1	cried razumihin , seizing him by the shoulder again
1	suddenly it was as if an electric shock ran through natasha 's whole being
1	and if she did beat me , what then ?
1	what do you say to that , dorofei trofimovich ?
1	of your town then there will gradually be no stone left upon stone— everything will turn upside down , everything will change as if by magic
1	it was not so at all !
1	except for two or three older writers , all modern literature seems to me not literature but some sort of handicraft , which exists only so as to be encouraged , though one is reluctant to use its products
1	said the weaver , coming to his senses
1	but that 's not all !
1	i already know one
1	i am not surprised at your intelligence , i am surprised that you , a man so pure and so immeasurably far above me—that you can walk with me and speak so simply and politely , as if nothing had happened !
1	but in a short while , some five minutes , the convent choir began to sing , there was no more weeping , everything was as before
1	i fancy i really am : i tell you these things for nothing and do not even expect a reward for it , he‐he !
1	my mother worked , my sister also took in sewing ; versilov lived idly , was capricious , and went on living with a great many of his former , rather expensive habits
1	that may have been accidental
1	such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system
1	the poor , dear man , he 's innocence itself !
1	aramis cried in transport
1	i mark all these meannesses in order to show how poorly fortified i was in the understanding of evil and good
1	help us , she said through her nose , in a sing-song voice
1	and the fact that he could not keep up the character , but confessed , makes him easier to believe in
1	i see , i see ; and how do we feel now , eh ?
1	those would be appropriate now , really , those are what i ought to put on now but i am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters ; i am somehow forgetful you see i have come to warn you , sonia , so that you might know that 's all—that 's all i came for
1	but the stairs , too , were quite deserted ; all the doors were shut ; he met no one
1	said raskolnikov , his face twitching nervously
1	i do not know how to reply to your sharp-ness !
1	but i hope you understand why i am here
1	her , the dark-haired one
1	the primitive quality of the word appears to have alarmed our predecessors , who translate it as wishing , desire , will , intention , choice , volition , and render it variously at various times
1	and did i really do it for the fatherland ?
1	why are you so disturbed ?
1	and she broke off with a strange laugh
1	they say that the wretch lost in the deserts of america can feel the approach of a snake in the same way
1	so much the better if you do not understand , and , i confess , my friend , i was sure of that
1	it 's all my stepan 's fault
1	the princess rose quickly to meet him and gave him her hand
1	and you yourself would do the same ?
1	sonia too was very busy
1	she gazed indifferently at her empty courtyard , thought of nothing , wanted nothing , and later , when night fell , went to sleep and dreamed of her empty courtyard
1	speaking of holbein ’ s christ , he says that it shows nature as some huge machine of the newest construction , which has senselessly seized , crushed , and swallowed up , blankly and unfeelingly , a great and priceless being
1	i took it under my care with your mama 's permission
1	he waved his hand weakly to razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his mother and sister , took them both by the hand and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking
1	ryabovsky , what do you say of that forehead ?
1	i buried my husband to‐day
1	he sobbed , but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest
1	the gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies ' fluffles , they are beyond anything you can fancy
1	so you came here to conquer hearts , to win over high society , to take revenge on devil ivanovich because you are an illegitimate son , is that what you wanted ?
1	only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane
1	it wo not do , princess , it wo not do , he said , when the princess , having taken and closed the notebook with the next day 's lesson , was getting ready to leave
1	i must also inform you , said the rhetor , that our order conveys its teaching not only by words , but by other means which affect the true seeker of wisdom and virtue perhaps even more strongly than verbal explanations
1	do you think there 's a place on earth that the cardinal can not touch , if he wishes to take the trouble of reaching out his hand ?
1	it suddenly turned up here , in the skirt of my own frock coat
1	he said to him , with a well‐feigned irritability
1	woman was created for our ruin , and it is from her that all our miseries come
1	the captain 's face expressed the anxiety of a schoolboy who is asked to recite a lesson he had not learned
1	she smiles in order to charm me , she fawns on me ; i am sorry , but i begin to feel disgust
1	i fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me ; parasha came on to the scene again , and not she alone ; in fact there was a tremendous to‐do
1	from the landing where pierre stood , another stairway led to the back door
1	this was the first time she had spoken to him of the project , and she launched out into the most alluring details
1	and don ’ t think that it ’ s all so innocent and unthreatening for us ; oh , we must respond , and swiftly , swiftly !
1	and how sorry i was for him sometimes !
1	and therefore to imagine the action of a man that is subject only to the law of necessity , without the slightest remainder of freedom , is as impossible as to imagine a totally free action
1	about a year ago , while doing research in the royal library for my history of louis xiv , i chanced upon the memoirs of monsieur d'artagnan , printed—like most works of that period , when authors were anxious to tell the truth without going for a more or less long turn in the bastille—in amsterdam , by pierre rouge
1	bonsoir , lise , [ ] said prince andrei , standing up and kissing her hand politely , as if she were a stranger
1	and you say you will wait for me in argentières ?
1	he was one of the numerous and varied legion of dullards , of half‐animate abortions , conceited , half‐educated coxcombs , who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve , however sincerely
1	he threw down the pillow , but in one instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down his back under his shirt
1	and he was enchanted by the evening , and the country houses and dachas along the way , and the birches , and that quiet mood all around , when it seemed that , together with the workers , the fields , the woods , and the sun were preparing to rest on the eve of the holy day—to rest and perhaps to pray
1	in my opinion , the best thing you can do now is abandon the study of medicine entirely
1	'you are perishing because of me , old man
1	so you have understood the whole disposition of the troops ?
1	he did not notice the road at all and suddenly found himself at the office ; in the porter 's lodge he took the overcoat off , looked it all over , and entrusted it to the porter 's special care
1	well , then , my dear girl , said d'artagnan , establishing himself in an armchair , come here till i tell you that you are the prettiest soubrette i have ever seen !
1	he finished eating it as he walked away
1	the third and most incomprehensible thing consists in the fact that the people who study history deliberately refuse to see that the flanking march can not possibly be ascribed to any one man , that no one ever foresaw it , that at that time this maneuver , just like the retreat from fili , was never pictured by anyone in its entirety , but proceeded step by step , event by event , moment by moment , from a countless number of the most diverse conditions , and only presented itself in its entirety when it had been accomplished and become past
1	he will pick on her in order to be rude to me
1	he sleeps like a top , soundly , quietly , and god grant he may sleep ten hours
1	in this wing , sir ?
1	the one thing pierre now desired with all the forces of his soul was to get away as quickly as possible from those dreadful impressions in which he had lived that day , to return to the ordinary conditions of life , and fall peacefully asleep in a room on his own bed
1	the little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand , not even a willow near it ; only in the far distance , a copse lay , a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon
1	but why did you ask ?
1	i would never seen her with such a face before
1	asked nastasya filippovna , not concealing the most squeamish loathing
1	what does she say when she comes to you ?
1	ganya suddenly turned to him
1	she lay as if alive
1	one word , only one word from you—and i ’ m saved
1	svidrigaïlov 's lips were twisted in a condescending smile ; but he was in no smiling mood
1	his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him ; his smile and glance were more cheerful and attractive
1	raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here
1	yes , milord , but with the hope of soon becoming enemies
1	he got up from the chair
1	from a good family , educated , and—a monster , a monster to the last degree !
1	that 's good , he said , sifting his words
1	she lived at number six on the place royale , which was then a fashionable quarter
1	the question was not put quite like that , observed porfiry
1	i remember him then , all purple , coming into our classroom
1	'today , she says , 'right now , i will bring him the money and fling it in his face ; he wanted to insult me , she says , 'like safronov ' ( that 's our merchant ) ; 'only safronov insulted me like a crude peasant , and this one like a cunning jesuit
1	but let 's admit that you are a slave from the first beginning
1	i am not able
1	two magnificent ladies were sitting in the carriage
1	she 's such a heart , nicolas , i am so glad !
1	bedridden by then , ippolit purposely sent for the prince to tell him the story
1	the first frenchman with the hooked nose came so close that the expression on his face could already be seen
1	but why are you all standing , ladies and gentlemen , please be seated , congratulate me and the prince !
1	impossible even to hope
1	you would not know what the subject of their conversation was ?
1	he did not yet dare to express his joy fully , but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton‐weight had fallen off his heart
1	the nanny was bored and asked me to send nastasya egorovna—oh , as if i could be bothered with that !
1	the ways of god are inscrutable !
1	now i know you personally , i am convinced of it
1	there were three in the cardinal 's party ; the musketeers , including their lackeys , were seven
1	zhenya looked sadly at her sister and mother and left
1	he thought , looking at his naked body , and he shuddered , not so much from the cold as from revulsion and horror , incomprehensible to himself , at the sight of this enormous number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond
1	would not it be natural for me to turn to the one who ever since childhood has replaced my father , whose kindness towards me i have seen for so many years ?
1	( ) the relation of the man committing the act to the external world ,
1	up to now , thank god , i have been a friend to my children and have enjoyed their full trust , said the countess , repeating the error of many parents who suppose that their children have no secrets from them
1	well , and i have long guessed by tatyana pavlovna 's face that she 's in love with me
1	lord de winter said slyly
1	devil take it , said athos , i would gladly propose that you stake planchet , but as it 's already been done , the englishman might not want any more of it
1	the kingdom of heaven to her—and now enough , madam , leave me in peace !
1	listen : i was sure of her love then
1	he does not understand it , and therefore i must explain it to him , he must hear me out , thought the old prince
1	after him came another soldier on a cart
1	except maybe when i hand him some papers , and he asks , how is it outside ?
1	no , it ca not be , it would be too extraordinary , she thought , and the moment she thought it , the face and figure of prince andrei , in a fur coat with a snow-sprinkled collar , appeared on the landing where the servant stood with a candle
1	i felt extreme pleasure , delight , and began to climb
1	it 's obvious all you women are crybabies , said petya , pacing the room in big , resolute strides
1	he bent over her once more
1	and say to the prince : remember what you promised ?
1	look here , what subjects : here he 's painted his room
1	i was stunned earlier ; i had no time earlier to reflect on it , he thought , recalling his first encounter with liza , but now i must find out
1	the painting made an overwhelming impression on my husband , and he stood before it as if dumbstruck …
1	he will be at your orders at once
1	yes , you said you had this letter , and i thought : since he has such a letter , why should he lose what 's his ?
1	i am listening to your eminence with the greatest attention , replied a woman 's voice that made the musketeer shiver
1	it would be another thing if i myself had been in love then
1	i ca not stand these old men
1	he kissed anna pavlovna 's hand and , narrowing his eyes , looked around at the whole company
1	i , of course , understood very little of it , but dounia explained to me that , though he is not a man of great education , he is clever and seems to be good‐natured
1	) , was not quite acting properly in this matter
1	j'espère , mon cher ami , que vous remplirez le désir de votre père
1	berg and his wife , who were not dancing , came up to them
1	i am not going anywhere with you !
1	at last everybody was seated , the steps were folded and flipped back into the carriage , the door banged shut , the strongbox was sent for , the countess leaned out and said what she ought
1	it was i began raskolnikov
1	the fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse , partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime
1	the uncle smiled without answering
1	further down , the dnieper carouses ; he has no care for anyone : he storms , and it is gloomy for the prisoner to hear his monotonous noise
1	ivan ivanovich asked for the reading to proceed , and taras tikhonovich went on : this gentleman , ivan , son of nikifor , dovgochkhun , when i came to him with friendly offers , publicly called me by a name offensive to me and defaming to my honor , namely : goose , whereas it is known to the whole mirgorod region that i have hitherto in no way ever been called , and have no intention of being called , this vile animal
1	one of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy
1	we always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception , something vast , vast !
1	all eyes were involuntarily turned to this french column that was moving towards them , winding down the terraces of the slope
1	they minced not for the sake of some sort of profit , but just so , because he was a man favored with the gifts of nature
1	the old newspapers and the tea were brought
1	there have been examples
1	she smiled again and took a slightly stronger grip on prince vassily 's arm
1	when petitioners would come for information to the desk where i sat – i would gnash my teeth at them , and felt an inexhaustible delight when i managed to upset someone
1	it should be done peacefully , lovingly
1	he was about fifty years old ; but ukrainian tales the deep despondency on his face and a sort of wasted pallor showed that his soul had been crushed and destroyed all of a sudden , in a single moment , and all the old gaiety and noisy life had disappeared forever
1	oh , how good it is there !
1	you see the kingdom of the good and the true on earth , and i do not see it
1	he was in love with his every button , his every fingernail – absolutely in love , and he looked it !
1	that 's just one example
1	may i , ekaterina vladimirovna ?
1	i brought a candle and , reaching out my hand , which he seized , helped him to drag himself up
1	that the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago
1	khoma and the cossack stopped respectfully by the door
1	which meant that , just at the time when i was abusing her , she was departing
1	but it 's particularly so with women
1	he was not completely unconscious , however , all the time he was ill ; he was in a feverish state , sometimes delirious , sometimes half conscious
1	i would portray how the black shadow of a bat flits over the white road and settles on the white chimneys of the houses
1	come bold and free into my house
1	here neither kind , nor sex , nor rank is mentioned—that means an animal can also be guilty
1	since yakov played the fiddle very well , especially russian songs , shakhkes sometimes invited him to join the orchestra for fifty kopecks a day , not counting gifts from the guests
1	then their circle widens : they finally arrive at marrying a merchant 's daughter who can play the piano , with a hundred thousand or so in cash and a heap of bearded relations
1	y'est un allemand ; mais brave garçon , s'il en fut
1	for a long time they kept glancing at the red rugai , who , his hunched back dirty with mud , jingling his collar , trotted behind the uncle 's horse 's legs with the calm look of a conqueror
1	when he talks , only his eyes and eyebrows smile , as generally with people given to mockery
1	it 's been ages , ages
1	that i understood ; that was quite other than the meeting with that one
1	each time it comes out as fun in the beginning , but by the end it turns senseless each time , because nobody knows how to finish ; though maybe with you it would be more amusing
1	pavel pavlovich greedily fell upon the water ; having taken three gulps , he raised his head , looked very intently into the face of velchaninov , who was standing before him with the glass in his hand , but said nothing and went on drinking
1	not in the least , versilov replied , getting up from his place and taking his hat
1	the tea sat on the table ; we did not touch it : it went so far that i purposely refused to begin drinking , so as to make it still harder for her ; and it would have been awkward for her to begin
1	you can , madame , he said emphatically
1	how can he love you , when he knows that you will be called away from him any moment
1	his conversation was a fact without accessories
1	he silently accepted the glove from the adjutant , sat down in the lady 's place , putting his big hands on his symmetrically displayed knees in the naïve pose of an egyptian statue , and decided to himself that this was precisely as it had to be and that that evening , so as not to lose his head and do something foolish , he ought not to act according to his own reasoning , but give himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him
1	some of the stewards ( there were half-literate managers among them ) listened fearfully , taking what he said to imply that the young count was displeased with their stewardship and their concealing of money ; others , after the first fright , were amused by pierre 's lisp and the new words they had never heard before ; a third group simply took pleasure in hearing how the master spoke ; a fourth group , the most intelligent , the head steward among them , understood from his speech how they ought to treat the master in order to achieve their own aims
1	we can eat as much as we want all through the feast days
1	or do all our strong impulses , all the whirlwind of our desires and boiling passions , come merely from our bright youth and seem deep and devastating only because of that ?
1	yes , and now the landlady is going too , still weeping and moaning and then her door slammed now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms , exclaiming , disputing , calling to one another , raising their voices to a shout , dropping them to a whisper
1	i had your word as a soldier and your oath as a gentleman ; i hoped i could count on them
1	do not you see i have no time to lose ?
1	it ’ s an example of an official address to an important person , also a rounded script , nice and black , the writing is black , but remarkably tasteful
1	mrs lialikov , a stout , elderly lady in a black silk dress with fashionable sleeves , but , judging by her face , a simple and illiterate one , looked at the doctor with anxiety and hesitated , not daring to offer him her hand
1	her dresses were always the most fashionable
1	but i notice , my dear , something nervous and soulfelt suddenly sounded in his voice , something that went to the heart , which happened terribly rarely with him , i notice that you yourself speak of it all too ardently
1	yet he himself knows that his moans will be of no use to him ; he knows better than anyone that he is only straining and irritating himself and others in vain ; he knows that even the public before whom he is exerting himself , and his whole family , are already listening to him with loathing , do not believe even a pennyworth of it , and understand in themselves that he could moan differently , more simply , without roulades and flourishes , and that it 's just from spite and craftiness that he is playing around like that
1	it 's a pity readers can not have a vivid description of its appearance
1	if he 's accused of distributing napoleon 's proclamations , that has not been proved , said pierre ( not looking at rastopchin ) , and vereshchagin
1	but into the middle of the dnieper they dare not look : no one except the sun and the blue sky looks there
1	pavel pavlovich 's teeth even chattered as he articulated this
1	in the best , the friendliest and simplest relations , flattery or praise is necessary , just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning
1	yes , loved me from spite ; that 's the strongest love
1	it was as if she deliberately paid not the slightest attention to him
1	first of all , my dear prince , don ’ t be angry with me , and if there was anything on my part—forget it
1	my aunt had the honor
1	give me your hand ; i ’ ll press it firmly , like this … you do still give me your hand , though ?
1	that she apparently rejected evgeny pavlych about a month ago , and that they had a rather formal talk , her sisters told us , as a guess … a firm guess , however
1	alpatych 's courtiers—the land reeve , the clerk , the scullery maid , the cook , two old women , a boy servant , the coachmen , and other domestics—saw him off
1	he threw himself on his knees , grasped that hand , and respectfully pressed his lips to it
1	the prince is this for me , that i believe in him as the first truly devoted man in my whole life
1	when they heard the order of napoleon , who , in return for their mutilation and death , presented them in consolation with the words of posterity about their having been at the battle of moscow , they cried vive l'empereur !
1	and you bought it yourself ?
1	already this one word , that he 's a vater—i am not speaking only of germans—that he has a family , that he lives like everybody else , has expenses like everybody else , has duties like everybody else— here you do not become rothschild , but remain only a moderate man
1	some of them tried to get in
1	he will do what i want
1	but the russian type of nobility has never resembled the european
1	speaking later about the lawyer who all but won the case , he also said : and you know what a lawyer is : a lawyer is a hired conscience
1	the pseudoscientific terms and even a certain clumsy use of parentheses , as joseph frank has shown , are the narrator 's deliberate mockery of chernyshevsky 's writing
1	at the word apologies , a cloud darkened athos 's brow , a haughty smile flitted over porthos 's lips , and aramis responded with a negative gesture
1	behold—he was no longer there
1	he said that he did not want to know of her existence , but gave her fair warning beforehand that she dare not show her face to him
1	and again she could not believe it : he , he is a murderer !
1	he will be furious , but i do not care ; i am within my rights
1	quiet , do not disturb me
1	i have marveled at that terribly all the while i have been coming to see you
1	it chapter thirteen : conclusion happened in the following way : lambert had after all inclined him to take part with him and , getting hold of the document then , had told him all the details and all the circumstances of the undertaking , and , finally , the last moment of the plan as well , that is , when versilov thought up the combination of deceiving tatyana pavlovna
1	and prince nikolai ivanovich wo not refuse you for anything , especially now , in his joy
1	any shock , any irritating sensation stimulated and revived his energies at once , but his strength failed as quickly when the stimulus was removed
1	fowl , outbuildings , barns , what not else ; vodka of various flavors ; pears and plums in the orchards ; poppies , cabbage , and peas in the garden
1	then i had suddenly fallen asleep for a while on the sofa in the corner , and lambert had immediately felt my pocket then and made sure that a piece of paper was actually sewn up in it
1	over his shoulder hangs a game bag with a crumpled black grouse in it
1	oui , oui , il est charmant he knows anecdotes , but we would better invite him later
1	the prince gave a sudden start
1	the children are crying
1	you know , for instance , beforehand with positive certainty that this man , this most reputable and exemplary citizen , will on no consideration give you money ; and indeed i ask you why should he ?
1	the crowd of girls shouted , laughing
1	i will probably kill you the fourth time , he said to him , as he offered a hand to get him to his feet
1	d'artagnan 's friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay , observing at the same time that it was still possible to cancel it
1	why go riding into the middle of a battalion ?
1	it was all smoldering in me
1	d'artagnan said to himself
1	i will get it at once !
1	i refuse to know you if you do not !
1	this was speransky , secretary of state , counselor to the sovereign , and his companion at erfurt , where he had seen and spoken with napoleon more than once
1	so , chum , you have not been to the deacon 's new house yet ?
1	everything was being done by itself
1	he repeated aloud , sighing
1	but another minute goes by , she hears voices : it is the veterinarian coming home from the club
1	he turned to balashov with this question , and the recollection evidently pushed him back onto the track of his morning 's wrath , which was still fresh in him
1	but the prince did not know what to ask further and how to finish the question ; besides , his heart was pounding so hard that it was difficult for him even to speak
1	natalia vassilievna was perfectly respected in t— ; she , however , did not value that very much , accepting it as her due , but at home she always knew how to receive superbly , having trained pavel pavlovich so well that his manners were ennobled enough even for receiving the highest provincial authorities
1	but to leave there , to run off together , to go to another part of france , where they could live peacefully because they would not be known , required money
1	then he opened them and whispered softly : what about the tea ?
1	once it 's proved to you that , essentially speaking , one little drop of your own fat should be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow men , and that in this result all so-called virtues and obligations and other ravings and prejudices will finally be resolved , go ahead and accept it , there 's nothing to be done , because two times two is – mathematics
1	a little later she saw him stepping out the grand rond with a partner , and this time he staggered and shouted something , to the great embarrassment of his lady , and anya remembered how three years ago he had staggered and shouted in the same way at a ball , and it had ended with a policeman taking him home to bed , and next day the director had threatened to dismiss him from his work
1	but pseldonymov was a man of firm character
1	( ) finally , the sixth and for me the most important consideration concerns the small significance which , to my mind , so-called great men have in historical events
1	ah , but that athos went on , speaking half to himself and half to d'artagnan , but if i kill you , i will look like a child eater !
1	but still he went
1	so it is mme de lannoy 's opinion that she gave them to buckingham ?
1	même le divorce , [ ] he said
1	oh , monsieur , just keep on going , you may become the equal of m de voiture and m de benserade !
1	why do you come and ask for me and say nothing
1	not precisely of the tubercles
1	what , is a man to die like a dog ?
1	wait , i ’ ll make up the bed meanwhile , and then you can lie down … and i ’ ll lie down with you … and we ’ ll listen … because i don ’ t know yet , man … i don ’ t know everything yet , man , so i ’ m telling you ahead of time , so you ’ ll know all about it ahead of time …
1	or throw up life altogether !
1	wait , said the prince , i asked the caretaker and the old woman earlier whether nastasya filippovna hadn ’ t spent the night
1	i thought so myself … but still it ’ s somehow hard to believe …
1	here i obtained a situation i obtained it and i lost it again
1	yes , duke , i know you are very indulgent towards the queen , too indulgent perhaps ; and i warn you , we shall have to talk about that later
1	i maintain that if the discoveries of kepler and newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one , a dozen , a hundred , or more men , newton would have had the right , would indeed have been in duty bound to eliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity
1	no , just add two bottles of champagne , and the difference will go for the napkins
1	svidrigaïlov looked intently at raskolnikov and suddenly , after a brief pause , dropping his voice , asked : but how is it , rodion romanovitch ; you do not seem yourself ?
1	i believe i served you sincerely , without arguing and pestering ; i never asked you what sort of happiness you wanted to look for with aglaya
1	how could it happen that it should depend on my decision—who has made me a judge to decide who is to live and who is not to live ?
1	even to spend the night with you
1	in fact , for our parents such a conversation as we are having now would have been unthinkable ; they did not talk at night , they slept soundly , but we , our generation , sleep badly , are anguished , talk a lot , and keep trying to decide if we are right or not
1	only pleasant curiosity and … an obligingly noble soul , yes , sir !
1	the moon had risen high over the house , lighting up the sleeping garden , the paths ; the dahlias and roses in the flower garden in front of the house were clearly visible and seemed to be all of the same color
1	why , what for , when he 's superior to everyone in the world without that ?
1	i happened , too , to hear of the scene at the office , from a man who described it capitally , unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness
1	there was another question he could not decide : why were they all so fond of sonia ?
1	and maxim ivanovich sent for the tutor , for pyotr stepanovich ; they had not seen each other since that occasion
1	before him sat only a uniform , a bodice , a tailcoat , before which an artist feels chilled and all imagination collapses
1	he speaks like a parisian , and he 's only mocking those russians who want to speak french aloud among themselves in society , but do not know how dans les wagons , the long one clarified
1	but the happy day came , and when natasha , on that sunday so memorable for her , in a white muslin dress , came home after communion , for the first time in many months she felt calm and not burdened by the life that lay ahead of her
1	she 's such an unearthly being !
1	she said , glancing at her brother , as if asking him : what on earth is it ?
1	if they would told him to jump head foremost from the staircase , he would have done it without thought or hesitation in their service
1	of course not , and it is even unnatural
1	the porter sullenly pulled the bell rope that rang upstairs and turned away
1	she began to prepare for his coming , began to do up her room for him , to clean the furniture , to wash and put up new hangings and so on
1	natasha covered her hair with a white kerchief and , holding it by the ends with both hands , went outside
1	for every trifle he ran to katerina ivanovna , even hunting her out at the bazaar , at every instant called her pani
1	there 's slush , muck , wet snow in the grave — they wo not go to any trouble over you
1	finally , though it ’ s shameless and improper to pursue a person so directly , i ’ ll tell you directly : i ’ ve come to seek your friendship , my dear prince
1	that , of course , is nothing like quietism , alexandra said to herself
1	the curtain rose again
1	that is precisely the name of my traveling companion
1	and i am the more convinced of this , so to speak , suspicion , seeing that if , for example , one takes the antithesis of the normal man , that is , the man of heightened consciousness , who came , of course , not from the bosom of nature but from a retort ( this is almost mysticism , gentlemen , but i suspect that , too ) , this retort man sometimes folds before his antithesis so far that he honestly regards himself , with all his heightened consciousness , as a mouse and not a man
1	she looked intently , maliciously and mistrustfully
1	if you please , your excellency , petrusha has come with papers , said one of the maids who assisted the nanny , addressing prince andrei , who was sitting on a child 's little chair , frowning , his hands trembling , pouring drops of medicine from a vial into a glass half filled with water
1	during nikolai 's brief visit , as usual in a house where there are children , he resorted to prince andrei 's little son when there was a moment of silence , stroking his head and asking if he wanted to be a hussar
1	observed nastasya , not taking her eyes off him
1	the captain looked at pierre
1	he was an old man , over sixty , not tall , very thin , bent over , white-haired , a naive smile on his face , his eyes tearful , his lips constantly smacking as if he were sucking candy
1	at last i shook my fist in his ugly face , and told him as a cousin i would brain him
1	the walls of the rooms were adorned with several paintings , big and small , in old-fashioned narrow frames
1	he wanted terribly to meet someone , to talk with someone , even a stranger , and only that , finally , suggested to him the thought of a doctor and that his hand probably ought to be properly bandaged
1	he dozed off on the bench , but his anxiousness continued in his sleep
1	porfiry petrovitch had turned to go , but he seemed to prick up his ears at this
1	does that mean you know i ’ m sincere ? … maybe i won ’ t drink anymore
1	but at the very moment , he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness , and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation , though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion , obviously with a motive , from necessity
1	recommandez , je vous prie , à leppich d'être bien attentif sur l'endroit ou il descendra la première fois , pour ne pas se tromper et ne pas tomber dans les mains de l'ennemi
1	at the same time i added that he , pyotr petrovitch luzhin , with all his virtues , was not worth sofya semyonovna 's little finger , though he spoke so ill of her
1	but … maybe it ’ s a good thing i let on … a strange idea was beginning to flash in his head , though not a very clear one as yet
1	and the wise ones and those of understanding will say , 'oh lord , why dost thou receive these men ?
1	i ca not help it i will come in half an hour
1	no , what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they , the children and if she has not gone out of her mind but who says she has not gone out of her mind ?
1	he wanted to resolve it , but felt with terror that in this case he lacked the resolve that he knew he had and that indeed was in him
1	so she carries the keys in a pocket on the right
1	why do they torment me ?
1	nastasya was continually out of the house , especially in the evenings ; she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop , and always left the door ajar
1	[ ] came from all sides
1	merci , friend , i never once crept up here , not even when i was renting the apartment
1	what is it , ma'am ?
1	but i was already a despot in my soul ; i wanted to have unlimited power over his soul ; i wanted to instill in him a contempt for his surrounding milieu ; i demanded of him a haughty and final break with that milieu
1	are not you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering ?
1	again he waited till evening , again fell asleep , again dreamed of some official who was an official and at the same time a bassoon
1	so you are in funds ?
1	katerina kept listening , not taking her eyes off him
1	at dinner the conversation was about subjects most closely related to dining
1	splendid , madame , and there is an old proverb which says that youth is shaped by travel
1	he also built a school in melikhovo in , which came out so well that he chekhov as naturalist ( ) , in chekhov , ed
1	lebedev addressed kolya in an all but affectionate voice , having to inform the prince of a matter essentially of concern …
1	something strange , as it were , passed between them some idea , some hint , as it were , slipped , something awful , hideous , and suddenly understood on both sides razumihin turned pale
1	but he came quite tipsy , and asked for three bottles again , and then he lifted up one leg , and began playing the pianoforte with one foot , and that is not at all right in an honourable house , and he ganz broke the piano , and it was very bad manners indeed and i said so
1	the conversation and the accounting with mitenka did not last long
1	do you know that one can be blamelessly to blame ?
1	all these anecdotes are the height of indecency , but you should know that this type of the indecent is much deeper and more widespread than we think
1	buckingham wanted to smile a last time , but death arrested his thought , which remained graven on his forehead like a last kiss of love
1	you can imagine what happened
1	the clergy were there , the factory managers and their wives , merchants and tavernkeepers from other villages
1	i myself am a … medical man ( he did not say doctor ) , and having said that , he pointed to the room with his hand for some reason , as if protesting against his present situation
1	but … why did i leave my room then ?
1	indeed , pity never possesses us so strongly as at the sight of beauty touched by the corrupting breath of depravity
1	in misery he asked himself this question , and could not understand that , at the very time he had been standing looking into the river , he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions
1	during the day i had nothing to fear
1	echoed akim petrovich ; the guests stirred again , but the stupidest thing of all was that pseldonymov , though he did bow again , even now did not smile , just as if he were made of wood
1	written in and still one of the most penetrating discussions of chekhov 's art , contains the following description of the spiritual condition of that time : to calculate beforehand is impossible
1	he gave direct , precise , and perfectly satisfactory evidence about everything , as a result of which the prince was eliminated from the case at the very beginning
1	this sokolovich owes all the happiness of his life and career to me , to me alone and no one else , but … here we are
1	there 's no need now that 's all stuff !
1	then if , by excess of love , i have made myself guilty before you , you will forgive me ?
1	couldn ’ t you help me ?
1	a telephone was also installed in the local administrative office , but there it soon stopped working , because it got infested with bedbugs and cockroaches
1	zametov 's unexpected presence struck raskolnikov unpleasantly
1	as soon as she began thinking about him , to her memory of him were added the memories of the old prince , of princess marya , of last night 's performance , and of kuragin
1	granted that he 'let it slip , though he is a sensible man , ( yet maybe it was not a slip at all , but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible ) but dounia , dounia ?
1	what farce is this ?
1	he gave him some medicine , a powder , i saw it , and then your coming here
1	the steps died away
1	they only arrived yesterday , may i ask you ?
1	it 's more in your interest , believe me
1	quite the contrary , said athos , it must be carefully kept
1	who is the curly‐headed one who has just peeped out ?
1	they must have come for some raid : some of them have muskets ; spurs jingle , sabers rattle
1	the moment she saw him , she suddenly burst into tears , but the prince at once calmed her down , and she laughed
1	you know , it 's even frightening
1	his former fantastic thoughts and apprehensions ( after his conversation with lebedev ) now seemed to him , in sudden but frequent recollections , such an unrealizable , impossible , and even ridiculous dream !
1	pavel pavlovich , as soon as he saw his fiancee come in , approached her at once with a grin
1	there they found out that the king and buckingham were hawking in the marshes some two or three leagues away
1	do not , do not look at me like that
1	and the more kutuzov desired it , the less he allowed himself to believe it
1	the women from our village are working here , so i am here with them
1	pavel pavlovich peered into his eyes defiantly and at the same time with some strange uneasiness
1	it was the order of st george , first degree
1	she aimed straight at my head
1	he whispered with trembling and paled lips
1	after dinner they all went out to the balcony to have coffee
1	petya had decided to go directly to the place where the sovereign was and explain directly to some gentleman-in-waiting ( petya thought that a sovereign was always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting ) that he , count rostov , despite his youth , wished to serve the fatherland , that youth could be no hindrance to devotion , and that he was prepared while getting ready to go , petya had prepared many fine words which he would say to the gentleman-in-waiting
1	peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the leaf buds of the oak are sprouting , and indeed a cold wind blows every spring when the oak is sprouting
1	another voice responded to the sovereign , telling of the resolution just arrived at by the moscow nobility
1	well , what , are you finished ?
1	going into my room , i sat down on the bed , thoughtful and agitated
1	she was gazing at me with those eyes
1	he is in 'an intelligible condition ' !
1	a french hussar colonel , obviously just out of bed , came riding from the village on a handsome , well-fed gray horse , accompanied by two hussars
1	the blacksmith followed them timidly , afraid of slipping on the parquet floor at every step
1	everyone came out to see velchaninov off ; the children brought liza , with whom they had been playing in the garden
1	let 's go , then , though you are in a fever , but there he did not finish
1	it 's nice , your excellency , if you would be so pleased !
1	above all , you are not mad !
1	she was running after him , calling wait !
1	you have known bezukhov for a long time , have not you ?
1	you do love him more than anything in the world , you are looking for a friend , an ideal in him ?
1	fearing a scandal , the host , with the help of his waiters , carried the wounded man to the kitchen , where he was looked after a little
1	reading and then lying in bed , he kept thinking about ivan dmitrich , and waking up the next morning , he remembered that he had made the acquaintance of an intelligent and interesting man yesterday and resolved to visit him again at the first opportunity
1	you were delirious when you did all this !
1	he will save europe !
1	but 'notes ' such as yours could , it seems to me , serve as material for a future artistic work , for a future picture—of a disorderly but already bygone epoch
1	ah , it ’ s such a simple-hearted story ; the story of an old soldier , an eyewitness to the french occupation of moscow ; there are charming things in it
1	she drops into a chair and begins to sob
1	you should know that my memory 's rotten beyond words : tell me something or not , it 's all the same
1	he 's a nice old man , i repeat again , simple and merry at home , but the moment he 's in the office , you ca not even imagine !
1	i see a cross in his hand—he must have just taken it off—on a worn light blue ribbon , only it ’ s a real tin one , you could see it at first glance , big , eight-pointed , of the full byzantine design
1	the older and more respectable of them all , as if by common consent , stayed away
1	you understand , d'artagnan , i can not insult the unknown donor , d'artagnan picked up
1	velchaninov slapped himself on the forehead
1	shouted the peasant woman
1	and that is what each of them thought
1	i have no wish now to judge alexei nikanorovich 's intentions in this matter , and , i confess , after his death i was painfully undecided about what to do with this document , especially in view of the impending decision of the court case
1	it owes to courtilz the incantation of names , not only of athos , porthos , and aramis , the three musketeers whom d'artagnan meets in m de tréville 's antechamber , but also of their opponents jussac , biscarat , cahusac , and bernajoux , as well as the name of milady , who appears briefly in the memoirs as miledi x
1	countess marya glanced at him and turned to pierre
1	she was living somewhere , in some matrosskaya street , in a gawky little house , with darya alexeevna , but her carriage was just about the best in pavlovsk
1	he stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs , waited till they were out of hearing , and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when dmitri and nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry ; possibly he was seen , but not noticed
1	his face was frowning , his lips were compressed
1	the stocks are empty , the roads are impracticable
1	but raskolnikov was already stepping into the street
1	he was brought at once to the best rooms of the hotel , taken for the night by dolokhov
1	a cart drove past , raising dust , with an unsold horse running behind it , looking as if it were glad it had not been sold ; then a resisting cow was led past by the horns , then came another cart carrying drunken peasants , their legs dangling down
1	what 's more , m de tréville earns ten thousand ecus a year ; so he is a very great lord
1	in the name of the king , i arrest you and declare that you must surrender your sword to me , monsieur , and that without any resistance
1	as for me , i was decidedly offended by the prince 's last words ; the allusion to versilov being dishonorable was so clear ( and so astonishing ! )
1	the gentleman was like everybody else , there was nothing special about him , he had passed by quickly , but he had glanced at velchaninov somehow much too intently and for some reason had at once greatly attracted his attention
1	said the little old lady , addressing ivan fyodorovich , who at that moment was being offered a platter by a rustic waiter in a gray tailcoat with a black patch
1	a dashing frenchman in a blue greatcoat , hatless , with a red , frowning face , was fighting off some hussars with his bayonet , when petya galloped up , the frenchman had already fallen
1	i have heard from three men already that you pull noses so hard when you give a shave that they barely stay attached
1	the conversation was conducted in english , a language d'artagnan did not understand , but by the tone of it the young man guessed that the beautiful englishwoman was extremely angry
1	raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and contemptuously after his speech , but strange to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone 's opinion , and this revulsion took place in a flash , in one instant
1	we are not even brother and sister , but some sort of illegitimates , without a family name , a household serf 's children
1	he lowered his head and saw that the grass , which was almost under his feet , seemed to be growing deep and distant and that over it was water as transparent as a mountain spring , and the grass seemed to be at the deep bottom of some bright , transparent sea ; at least he clearly saw his own reflection in it , together with the old woman sitting on his back
1	sure , just you try it !
1	on leaving the office , they passed the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room
1	listen , now : i will call on you myself , without fail , and then i do hope
1	now , kindly taste our wine , and tell us , without reservation , what you think of it
1	does she even mean to have a funeral lunch ?
1	'on crime ' or something of the sort , i forget the title , i read it with pleasure two months ago in the periodical review
1	at least at the dacha , i want it to be otherwise , and rest assured that i will receive whomever i like and go wherever i like
1	here 's what i kept thinking it was strange that you gravely ill people , instead of staying in a quiet place , wound up on a ship , where the stuffiness , and the heat , and the tossing—everything , in short , threatens you with death , but now it 's all clear to me
1	at the bottom was a village
1	you were still sound asleep , and i did not know what to do
1	have you been at mother 's ?
1	before his departure , prince andrei had a long talk about something with his father , and princess marya noticed that before his departure they were both displeased with each other
1	pierre found it strange to look at this calm , indifferent crowd of people who did not know what was happening in his soul
1	give me the baby !
1	the feelings of both were so strong that they were not affected by the external , dreadful side of death , and they found no need to exacerbate their grief
1	[ ] was the will of the mass of the russian people transferred to napoleon in , when our troops in alliance with the french went to make war on austria ?
1	may my arms and legs wither !
1	i can ’ t , nastasya filippovna ; and generally i consider such a petit jeu impossible
1	to fear , to try to escape that force , to turn with requests or admonitions to the people who served as its tools , was useless
1	olga ivanovna obediently followed him
1	it was des roches le masle , canon of notre dame , and formerly the cardinal 's valet , who had proposed him to his eminence as a completely devoted man
1	i am in complete agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , and think there is every probability of realising them
1	i said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your little finger and that i did my sister honour making her sit beside you
1	stop joking , bilibin , said bolkonsky
1	because he has found his fatherland , which he had missed here , and he rejoices ; he has found the shore , the land , and he rushes to kiss it !
1	there 's no sense in it anyway
1	mr o areilly , the duke of buckingham said to him as he led him to the chapel , look at these diamond pendants and tell me what they are worth apiece
1	i went up to dergachev , squeezed his hand as hard as i could , and shook it several times , also as hard as i could
1	to all the questions put to him , important or quite trifling , he replied with equal vagueness
1	she suddenly turned quickly to me and peered at me piercingly for half a minute
1	but as soon as night brings darkness , he is visible again and is reflected in the lakes , and behind him , trembling , rides his shadow
1	it was anna andreevna 's brother , the kammerjunker , the young versilov , versilov 's son and therefore almost my brother
1	dounia did not ask , but she knew it was so
1	xxxiii : soubrette and mistress d'artagnan returned to milady 's the next day
1	in fact , if there could be any hope , it would be very ephemeral , because there would be no claim for assistance in that case , far from it and she is dreaming of a pension already , he‐he‐he !
1	besides , your mother and sister are here now ; you must think of them
1	along with that , he felt that the further the ground he stood on gave way under his feet , the more involuntarily he was bound to it
1	first of all , fedosei petrovich has known me even since my youngest years , he knew my late spouse , how i lived , and what my reputation is , sir , and , finally , i have a fortune , and here also i have now obtained a post and a promotion—so all this carries weight , sir
1	but why are you so keen about virtue ?
1	not for one hour , not for two hours , does the battle between polacks and cossacks go on
1	i said it , prince , said berg , recognizing prince andrei , only because i must carry out orders , because i always carry them out precisely excuse me , please , berg apologized for something
1	what are you shoving for , little master , see , everybody 's standing
1	his confidential valet appeared
1	everything would be saved !
1	i have come on business of my own , which i shall have the pleasure of explaining after her versilov nevertheless went on looking at me curiously
1	about that , avdotya romanovna said finally
1	but he liked that he was from a good family , had a fortune , that is , a big rental property with a manager , was related to some not-insignificant people , and , on top of that , carried himself well
1	what is he seeking with his eyes ?
1	the girl studies at the conservatory , she 's always in good society , and she 's dressed god knows how
1	if anyone had come in , what would he have thought ?
1	but since i would not hand over the document for anything down to the last moment , he ultimately decided even to throw in with anna andreevna , so as not to lose all profit , and therefore he foisted his services on her with all his might , till the very last hour , and i know that he even offered , if need be , to procure a priest
1	how is it you do not go head over heels ?
1	how is it she 's not bored and ashamed !
1	your horses , your lackeys , your looks , my lords , had all been described to me
1	i know he won ’ t shoot himself , general , my much-esteemed general , but all the same … for i ’ m the host
1	he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation , and only the other day he won an important case
1	katerina ivanovna ran to the window ; there , on a broken chair in the corner , a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood , in readiness for washing her children 's and husband 's linen that night
1	katerina ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him , in the first place , because he was the one educated visitor , and , as everyone knew , was in two years to take a professorship in the university , and secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having been unable to be at the funeral
1	rather than depicting society , he borrows the sign system of literature — anthropological and fictional — that depicts society , in order to depict and address human conscience , conscious , unconscious , subconscious
1	i will not allow myself to be tortured , he whispered , instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by the thought
1	something was happening to him entirely new , sudden and unknown
1	can he have gone away ?
1	shall we take a cab ?
1	well , and i do know that i am a blackguard , a scoundrel , a self-lover , a lazybones
1	nastasya filippovna , who was walking along as if not noticing anyone in particular , suddenly turned in their direction , and seemed only now to recognize evgeny pavlovich
1	why , you said you would just greet your aunt and come straight over , and then you did not !
1	razumihin looked after him thoughtfully
1	what are you doing standing there , ivan ivanovich ?
1	perhaps i do not want to go to siberia yet , sonia , he said
1	hit her in the face , in the eyes , in the eyes , cried mikolka
1	what is your name , if i may inquire ?
1	this lackey was my compatriot , so that we made friends all the more quickly , in that there were strong similarities of character between us
1	he would not be alone in his room , there would be two of them everywhere !
1	would not it be better
1	so kutuzov replied , and he went on using all his powers to keep the troops from attacking
1	after that they spent another hour or hour and a half in serious and preoccupied conversation
1	i knew one poor fellow of whom i was told later that he starved to death , and , i remember , that made me furious : if it had been possible to revive the poor fellow , i think i would have executed him
1	mme bonacieux mechanically ate a few mouthfuls and dipped her lips into her glass
1	whoever deals with you becomes a woman himself
1	repeated nikolai , who in his heart did not like nikolenka , but whom he was always ready to acknowledge as nice
1	and if i put you in prison—say you have been there a month , or two , or three—remember my word , you will confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise
1	it 's not exactly this old man 's death , he replied , not only his death ; there 's something else now that has hit on the same spot may god bless this moment and our life , for a long time to come !
1	this evening as well , aramis sat looking sombre and dreamy
1	the sick soldier sokolov , pale , thin , with blue circles around his eyes , sat in his place , the only one unshod and undressed , staring questioningly , with eyes prominent in his emaciated face , at his comrades , who paid no attention to him , moaning softly and regularly
1	but—who knows ? — perhaps she would have made a new man of me somehow he ground his teeth and sank into silence again
1	his nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering ; in spite of the heat he felt cold
1	ah , i have upset him with my chatter !
1	aie , they will do nikifor wrong , i am afraid they will !
1	in this child ’ s eyes flashing with patriotism , he said , i have read the opinion of the whole russian people
1	what kind of ice cream , marya dmitrievna ?
1	that ’ s quite wrong , cried kolya , and it was quite the contrary : ippolit seized the prince ’ s hand yesterday and kissed it twice , i saw it myself , and that was the end of all the explanations , except that the prince simply said it would be better for him at the dacha , and he instantly agreed to come as soon as he felt better
1	look it up in suvorin 's calendar
1	non , il fera son entrée demain , [ ] he said and went on with his stories
1	as if his earlier dream had merged with reality
1	in the unfortunate , sobbing , exhausted man whose leg had just been removed , he recognized anatole kuragin
1	their acquaintance had already begun in luga , and it had always seemed to me that vasin was not indifferent to her
1	yes , very nice , said rostov , smiling
1	here , drink this glass , drink some water , drink it !
1	your most devoted servant submits this report , dating it , and observing that if the army remains in its present bivouac for another two weeks , by spring we will not have one healthy man left
1	they looked at her now , it seemed , with still greater perplexity than before
1	she comes in , curtseys , you can fancy , still in a short frock—an unopened bud !
1	you do not know , dmitri prokofitch , that marfa petrovna 's dead !
1	she led him to the dark drawing room , and pierre was glad that nobody could see his face
1	why was he going into that , what 's in his mind , eh ?
1	that 's why she needs to have man over her , that 's why she was created a subordinate being
1	potemkin frowned and smiled at the same time
1	the guests went on being amazed , whispering and exchanging glances , but it became perfectly clear that it had all been calculated and arranged beforehand , and that now nastasya filippovna—though she was , of course , out of her mind—would not be thrown off
1	what does my hair matter !
1	something very bad for me ?
1	and therefore , in order to explain in what way the submission of millions followed from their relations , that is , how from components equal to one a there followed a resultant equal to a thousand times a , the historian must necessarily allow again for the same force of the power which he denies , recognizing it as the result of forces , that is , he must allow for the unexplained force acting upon the composite
1	he walked down slowly and deliberately , feverish but not conscious of it , entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him
1	it was a pleasure to look at her face , as kind , bright , and pure as an angel 's
1	balashov remembered the words—that not a single armed enemy remains on russian soil—but some complex feeling held him back
1	i was walking in the street , out there at the corner , about ten o'clock and he seemed to be walking in front
1	do you want some tea ?
1	he took the cloth off it , and the harp gave out a false sound
1	yes , that is what i love him for , razumihin , exaggerating it all , muttered to himself , with a vigorous turn in his chair
1	and if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand , which would have been noticeable
1	in fact , i feel it strange myself how timid , chaste and modern she is with me !
1	this memory of the small details of life struck the doctor
1	the loaded-down pavel pavlovich stood in the middle of the room , as if undecided , with a long , drunken smile on his drunken face ; but at velchaninov 's repeated menacing cry , he suddenly started bustling about as fast as he could , moved the table aside , and , puffing , began to spread and smooth out the sheet
1	then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written , accompanied by a signature and a seal , and presented it to the man , who had shown signs of repugnance too prematurely
1	do you think , then , madame , felton replied in the same grave voice , though with a gentler accent , that i believe i have the right to hinder a creature who is bowing down before her creator ?
1	he had become so completely absorbed in himself , and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting , not only his landlady , but anyone at all
1	he exclaimed , trembling as if in fever and with flashing eyes
1	her vengeful and proud mind was aroused in the highest degree
1	i was silent and concentrated , attentive and terribly calculating ; i was patient and stingy and at the same time decided in decisive moments
1	but will my prayer help him if he 's already condemned ?
1	d'artagnan had turned away to hide his ill humor
1	the feeling of domination and possession
1	ah , queen of heaven , holy mother !
1	but if she came to invite us , why did she start treating mama that way ?
1	i only wish everyone could be as happy as i am
1	that will be … proper !
1	we will see each other tomorrow
1	but if they come ?
1	and so , as i was looking at the sky , this girl suddenly seized me by the elbow
1	but what day will the ball take place ?
1	he urged on his already tired horse so as to get quickly past these crowds , but the further he went , the more disorderly the crowds became
1	they are my enemies , they are all criminals , to my mind
1	pidorka made a vow to go on a pilgrimage ; she collected the property left by her father and a few days later was indeed no longer in the village
1	and he decided to separate from her , at once , whatever the cost
1	but all the same he often told about the sovereign , about his love for him , letting it be felt that he was not telling all , that there was something else in his feeling for the sovereign that not everyone could understand ; and he shared with all his soul the general feeling at that time in moscow of adoration for the emperor alexander pavlovich , who in moscow at that time was given the nickname of angel in the flesh
1	came the dashing voice of the company commander
1	he was met , too , by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback ; he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight
1	he was wearing a straw hat and a white waistcoat with a gold chain , and looked more like a landowner than a dealer
1	nothing come along you shall be witness
1	suddenly he went off completely
1	in one place one hears of a student 's robbing the mail on the high road ; in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes ; in moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets , and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history ; then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain and if this old woman , the pawnbroker , has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society—for peasants do not pawn gold trinkets—how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society ?
1	thus , it is perfectly well known to us that in the course of those two weeks the prince spent whole days and evenings with nastasya filippovna ; that she took him with her for walks , for concerts ; that he went for rides with her every day in the carriage ; that he would begin to worry about her if he did not see her for only an hour ( which meant that , by all tokens , he sincerely loved her ) ; that he listened to her with a quiet and meek smile , whatever she might talk to him about , for whole hours , saying almost nothing himself
1	everybody ’ s been waiting for you , everybody ’ s only been waiting for your happy wit …
1	pierre stood looking at the sisters for a while and , bowing , said :
1	nikolenka was overcome by terror and woke up
1	you see , it 's ten years since i visited petersburg
1	one tormenting impression would not leave him : those broad-boned , reddish hands , with hair showing from under the cuffs , those hands which he loved and hated , and which held him in their power
1	i am too strong not to stop when i want to
1	may i give him a bone ?
1	she then slammed the door and left
1	the air one breathed was sad , damp , and chilly
1	the sovereign said straight out that the council and the senate were estates of the realm ; he said that the government should be based not on arbitrariness , but on firm principles
1	drink ’ s to blame , of course
1	seeing ganya , he smiled venomously and whispered to himself : so there !
1	nothing more is needed , he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table
1	i am frightened of the children 's crying , too for if sonia has not taken them food i do not know what 's happened !
1	but this celerity was of little use to him
1	take care , milord , for now you are in god 's hands
1	it is hard to make anything out in the darkness
1	something 's the matter with her
1	it certainly did seem possible , so violently was he shaking it
1	those who met him in the street felt an involuntary fear
1	he heard wings beating against the glass of the church windows and their iron frames , heard claws scratching iron with a rasping noise and countless powers banging on the doors , trying to break in
1	the study was nothing to her , and she had painted it only so as to have a further pretext for calling on the artist
1	) , but varvara ardalionovna , i think , realized that they had to clear out quickly , and that this was more than enough from aglaya ivanovna , and she dragged her brother away
1	on entering , ivan ivanovich , after bowing in all directions , usually installs himself in the choir and sings along very well in a bass voice
1	in september , during the early stages of planning the novel , he notes : in the first person it would be much more original , and show more love ; also , it would require more artistic skill , and would be terribly bold , and shorter , easier to arrange ; moreover , it would make the character of [ the adolescent ] as the main figure of the novel much clearer and a little further on : a narrative in the first person is more original by virtue of the fact that the [ adolescent ] may very well keep skipping , in ultra-naive fashion to all kinds of anecdotes and details , proper to his development and immaturity , but quite impossible for an author conducting his narrative in regular fashion
1	what have you done ?
1	neither do i , said athos
1	i assure you i am proud of these breeches , and he exhibited to raskolnikov a pair of light , summer trousers of grey woollen material
1	he saw before him an ugly , wrinkled , tear-stained face , beside it another face , an old woman 's , toothless , with a sharp chin and hooked nose , and above them the fathomless sky with racing clouds and the moon , and he cried out in terror
1	i wrote a story—it was not published
1	the next day was spent in preparations for departure
1	he made no answer
1	it is too , too important , too important !
1	the thing is that i keep pacing , pacing , pacing
1	do you still say your prayers , rodya , and believe in the mercy of our creator and our redeemer ?
1	he , too , took his cap
1	who is this , nastasya ?
1	the terrible vengeance when petro died , god summoned the souls of the two brothers , petro and ivan , for judgment
1	the young man stepped into the dark entry , which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen
1	maybe she ’ ll answer … believe me , only in the utmost , the very utmost case , would i turn to … who else can i send it with ? … it ’ s very important … it ’ s terribly important for me …
1	when they passed the farmstead , and a smooth hollow opened out before them , and the coal-black forest spread out to one side , only then did he say to himself : oh-oh , this is a witch !
1	then he gave a prolonged yawn , opening his mouth as wide as possible
1	i cringed all over
1	instead of moving horses and hussar backs , he saw the immobile earth and stubble around him
1	the more so as i am dolgoruky and not versilov
1	it 's not simply that he did not believe me , she said , lowering her eyes and smiling somehow strangely , but he decided that i had 'all vices ' in me
1	this happiness is for those who do not have what you have
1	oh certainly , as much as you like !
1	the rochelois thus had no hope except in buckingham
1	they talked about what pierre had told them
1	rothschild became all alarmed and ran ahead of him
1	he raised his eyes , looked earnestly at them all , smiled , and took his cap
1	but since your purse is quite empty now , allow me to offer you these twenty-five roubles to begin with
1	rodya has given me leave
1	maybe a thousand pistoles
1	and you ’ re not , of course ?
1	the doctor and the priest have been , all as it should have been
1	if i had done that thing , i should certainly have said that i had seen the workmen and the flat , raskolnikov answered , with reluctance and obvious disgust
1	and his serenity does know you , after all , and would receive you graciously
1	the sun shone straight in his eyes , so that it hurt him to look out of them , and he felt his head going round—as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the street on a bright sunny day
1	and if you must examine me , do so in the proper form !
1	somebody 's had real luck to get so much stuff for his caroling !
1	the usually calm face of bilibin was troubled
1	the weaver 's wife wanted to respond in kind , but instead spat into the unshaven chin of the headman , who , in order to hear better , had edged right up to the quarreling women
1	pierre took out his notebook and began to read
1	but there was absolutely nothing in it even faintly resembling such an incoherent dream
1	somewhere far away , it might be in the gateway , two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting , quarrelling and scolding
1	on the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling ; but no one noticed him and no one met him
1	cried m de tréville
1	as soon as rostov heard the sound of that voice , a huge burden of doubt fell from his soul
1	who could believe that this sufferer would resurrect ?
1	the actor recited , the artists painted , the cellist played , the singer sang , and at half-past eleven , unfailingly , the door to the dining room would open , and dymov , smiling , would say :
1	his small , deep-set eyes always looked out directly and merrily
1	it seemed to him that something extraordinary had happened , which had destroyed everything all at once , and that he himself had almost been the cause of it by the mere fact of this reading aloud
1	so he got his sight back !
1	and again she immersed herself in reading
1	they never spoke to each other informally but always with respect , as afanasy ivanovich and pulkheria ivanovna
1	only one who loves can remember so well
1	it seems everything has already been thought through , and there 's nothing now that is capable of stirring my mind
1	come along , come along !
1	cried ilya petrovitch from his place , where he , too , was looking through papers
1	i did not remember either getting undressed or going to bed
1	his dwelling itself was unlike all the other little wooden houses
1	what were its causes ?
1	earlier , at exactly ten o ’ clock , while still in bed , at the moment of waking up , the young ladies had a cup of coffee
1	pierre got up and walked away from his new comrades , between the campfires , to the other side of the road , where he was told the captive soldiers were camped
1	the host was alone and sitting at his desk , one of the drawers of which was half open
1	but that 's not the point
1	she looked at me with such eyes that my heart stopped …
1	as a legitimate son , pierre will get everything
1	why do you do it ?
1	it 's a violent crowd , your excellency
1	suddenly he bent over and quietly began to collapse onto kolya ’ s arm
1	there was a lot of empty laughter
1	many times i asked myself how i , a braggart and a liar , could manage not to speak to them about my knowledge—of which they , of course , had no notion—not to wish to astonish them with it , if only out of love for them ?
1	he was of firm character , an honest , direct , even crude man , covered on the outside with a somewhat tough bark , not without a certain pride in his soul , who spoke of people at once sharply and condescendingly
1	the prince asked with a sort of extraordinary surprise
1	the three musketeers who told you there was a woman here ?
1	we sat down facing each other in the middle of the room , at his enormous writing table , and he gave me an already finished fair copy of his letter to versilov to read through
1	he had settled in here , grown accustomed to it , relished it ; he ate a lot , washed in a bathhouse , gained weight , was already at law with the commune and both factories , and was very offended when the peasants did not call him 'your honor
1	the fellow cried victoriously
1	they embarked on their ventures as a whole gang or in parts
1	no , sir ; that same night it disappeared from under the chair , sir
1	aglaya gave the presumptuous brat a terrible look , but kolya did not wait and left
1	but suddenly some little figure turned up beside pseldonymov and started bowing
1	i will do them a good turn , and they will berate me still more ; nothing will be accomplished , except that a great rumor will spread
1	official duty is one thing but you are thinking i meant to say friendship is quite another ?
1	it 's still bearable at our battery , said the adjutant
1	however a beauty 's cloak may flutter behind her , i shall never follow curiously after her
1	what if it 's me ?
1	he will die immediately
1	with especial readiness , the now completely recovered engineer thundered his consent in a bass voice
1	he looked at the yellow and tattered paper , at the dust , at his sofa
1	husband and wife are one flesh
1	i remembered the other
1	petya , forgetting himself , clenched his teeth , rolled his eyes out wildly , and rushed forward , working with his elbows and shouting hurrah !
1	here milady had left the wood and climbed into the carriage
1	and so it will be unto ages of ages
1	all evening nikolai paid most attention to a blue-eyed , plump , and sweet-looking blonde , the wife of one of the provincial officials
1	life 's gone to hell !
1	on coming home in the evening , he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary visits or rendez-vous at appointed hours
1	and karl pulled him away from the window by his coat , and it is true , mr captain , he tore sein rock
1	tikhon began to scratch his back with one hand , his head with the other , and suddenly his whole mug stretched into a beaming , foolish smile , revealing the missing tooth ( for which he was nicknamed shcherbaty—gap-toothed )
1	i would thrash all these orphans
1	he will suffer if he is sorry for his victim
1	and how do you look at the sin of suicide , makar ivanovich ?
1	i got up and left
1	the swedes—their destiny is to be ruled by mad kings
1	they went out to the porch and to the stable
1	glancing through the door , rostov saw sick and wounded men lying there on the floor , on straw and overcoats
1	good morning , darling olga semyonovna !
1	but natasha herself needed to see a doctor
1	i babbled these last incoherent phrases when we were already in the street
1	he was waiting for sonia ; he saw that they were parting , and that sonia was going home
1	the actor is told to undress and wash off his greasepaint and rouge : there is no more need for him
1	maybe i yearned to fall at her feet , or maybe i wanted to give her over to every torment and quickly , quickly prove something to her
1	first , it will show your delicacy , and second , you will also be allowed to lie in return - two enormous profits at once
1	liza , who loved so strongly , must have suffered very much
1	she kept begging him
1	here , rodya , sit up
1	there are even more horrible criminals than this one , who have killed ten people and do not repent at all
1	the first thing he did was to wipe his blood‐stained hands on the red brocade
1	and all those high-ranking fathers of theirs , all those who fidget in all directions and worm their way into court and say they are patriots and this and that : income , income is what these patriots want !
1	she looked him over attentively
1	cried one of the new‐comers ; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw
1	first of all , i will not and can not judge anyone
1	nastasya filippovna glanced fleetingly at the general and also smiled to herself
1	after reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed with anguish
1	only what kind of work was there , except for the factory ?
1	the officers stood up
1	attention has been refreshed , and i can go on
1	as you asked , so i answered , he replied , with a surprising expression of simplicity
1	but you have provided for the children of katerina ivanovna
1	his wife is an amazing woman ; i keep whipping her up , convincing her to go and study
1	indeed , it had a certain resemblance to the inside of a coffin , and i even marveled at how correctly he had defined it with a single word
1	mother , you did fortune-telling yourself said the daughter
1	that proves that one of them is at home
1	after alpatych and the coachman , ferapontov 's entire household came out
1	since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere !
1	that 's what comes of having diamonds , my dear master , athos said disdainfully
1	anatole went up to him and began saying something to him , looking and pointing at the rostovs ' box
1	some years later , in , gogol wrote a letter to his father confessor in which he declared himself guilty and cursed not only for having portrayed the devil , which he had done with the intention of mocking him , and not only for having painted nothing but grotesque images , being unable to describe a positive character properly , but first of all for having attemped to re-create each thing as alive as a painter from life
1	that is , again , there were no quarrels , but there was silence and—and a more and more bold look on her part
1	rogozhin had not come back ; no one opened to his ringing ; he rang at old mrs rogozhin ’ s ; they opened the door and also announced that parfyon semyonovich was not at home and might not be back for some three days
1	he brought avdotya romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her a chair
1	i am wounded , i can not mount a horse , and therefore can not command an army
1	they were having a noisy , loud , merry time for themselves
1	he once told , for instance , a chapter three recent story about a discharged soldier ; he was almost a witness to this event
1	or who are you going to shave so early ?
1	turmoil even ensued , but that was just what marya nikitishna wanted
1	on the contrary , but there 's a sort of dignity
1	what things people will imagine !
1	thank you , prince , eccentric friend of our house , for the pleasant evening you have provided for us all
1	now he is setting up for being advanced , not that he has an inkling of anything , but , of course , i encourage him
1	the vegetable oil in the shop is bitter , rancid , the people 's tar is better
1	four shots replied to them at almost the same moment , but they were better aimed than those of the attackers : three soldiers were killed outright , and one of the workers was wounded
1	lebedev came in at last , having only just returned , and , noticing the twenty-five-rouble note in keller ’ s hand , he winced
1	the cellar rats will swim out , and men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys
1	looking at her closely , he saw at once that she was completely drunk
1	( aniska was a dressmaker in the country , one of our former serf girls who had been trained in moscow , a pretty wench )
1	he was noticeably in very low spirits
1	i do not know your excellency i had no men , your excellency
1	well , good evening , good evening , je vois que je vous fais peur , sit down and tell me about it
1	through the female side , i believe ?
1	she went to the sitting room , stood , thought , and went to the maids ' quarters
1	and you may be sure , my dear boy , that i love you very much
1	the long one and his comrade also came in with us , despite lambert 's words
1	i don ’ t care a whit about it
1	he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose , but did not yet take it out altogether , simply holding it in his right hand under the coat
1	schiller found it extremely vexing that an unknown , uninvited person had suddenly hindered them so inopportunely
1	if you get anywhere , i declare you are the devil himself !
1	with a low bow , she offered it to kutuzov
1	but , devil take it , you know yourself you are just babbling
1	athos always carried the key to this casket with him
1	it struck him as strange and grotesque , that he should have stopped at the same spot as before , as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts , be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him so short a time ago
1	i believe it will come on to rain
1	we just went hunting and had some fun with the lads
1	you ’ re talking out of a book again , kolya , observed adelaida
1	oh , the scoundrels , the scoundrels !
1	they were all such young , even such underage people , that one could marvel both at the occasion and at the whole ceremony that proceeded from it
1	from insomnia and as a result of the intense struggle against mounting weakness , something strange is happening to me
1	in that case , tatyana pavlovna suddenly abandoned the door , in that case— settle it between you as you like
1	at the end of the court , the corner of a low , smutty , stone shed , apparently part of some workshop , peeped from behind the hoarding
1	but i will add seriously now : if , in the accumulation of wealth , i should reach the same figure as rothschild , then it might indeed end with my flinging it to society
1	and he darted down into the saloon below
1	i am too old for her why do not you speak ?
1	the procureuse went towards the basin of holy water ; porthos got there ahead of her , and , instead of a finger , put his whole hand into it
1	said the prince and sat down at the table
1	one after another , they rush to demonstrate their nonentity to him
1	no , aglaya , no , i ’ m not crying , the prince looked at her
1	i remember two things like these too , a silver one and a little ikon
1	i was in love with boris , with my teacher , with denisov , but this is not the same at all
1	london is far from paris , very far , and maybe the commission you are entrusting to me is not without its dangers
1	one image succeeded another
1	the room ivan ivanovich entered was completely dark , because the shutters were closed , and a ray of sunlight , passing through a hole made in the shutters , turned iridescent and , striking the opposite wall , drew on it a colorful landscape of rush roofs , trees , and the clothing hanging outside , only all of it inverted
1	it was about six o'clock
1	there is a son serving in the provinces , but he does not help ; there is a daughter , who is married , but she does not visit them
1	what an excellent man !
1	it is not for nothing that one is twenty years old , and above all that one is born in tarbes
1	father , father , he cried , father , what are they doing ?
1	with veneration rather than filial feeling , i leaned on his breast and kissed his flowing silver hair
1	the impulse was so strong that she might have died , or so at least it seemed to the prince
1	the count wanted to leave , but hélène begged him not to ruin her improvised ball
1	he spoke softly , measuredly , placing his hands behind his back and looking down
1	you have heard it , and we will all do our duty
1	it 's a good twenty-five years , i think , since i have been to the cemetery ; a nice little place !
1	dyudya 's second son , hunchbacked alyoshka , lives in his father 's house
1	you do not know what you ask ; you are like a child !
1	even as it was , everyone he met seemed to stare and look round , as if they had nothing to do but to watch him
1	finally , yesterday , in the course of one day , i did not manage to figure it out , despite all the indications
1	she met the father and daughter especially courteously and took them to the princess
1	liza 's married to andrei ( a better husband would seem hard to find these days ) , but is she pleased with her fate ?
1	when the pit was all filled , a command was heard
1	for all the twenty minutes of his visit , the prince was even very pensive , almost absentminded
1	they pad themselves quite openly with some frou-frou behind , to show that they are belles-femmes
1	excuse me , i ca not come right now , i am busy with dasha
1	so , then , do not you need a horse first of all ?
1	yakov made good , sturdy coffins
1	it was hot , uncomfortable , and it seemed to him in his sleep that he was not in taunitz 's house and not in a soft , clean bed , but still in the zemstvo cottage , on hay , hearing the witnesses talking in half-whispers ; it seemed to him that lesnitsky was nearby , fifteen steps away
1	you can see very well that it 's all profit
1	but pierre considered it necessary to ask :
1	look at you , fat mug , baring your teeth
1	only aglaya , who had allowed herself so much in her lecture , was not abashed in the least , she even seemed glad
1	the boys at the counter fell to sniggering
1	rostov , preoccupied by his relations with bogdanych , stopped on the bridge , not knowing what to do with himself
1	i wo not leave it like this !
1	you can understand a great deal
1	no need to explain that !
1	pavel pavlovich sat down and filled his glass
1	authors write very funny plays nowadays
1	and you certainly will have to go and thank them ; we will go every day if you wish
1	the old man ’ s getting rabid … mother ’ s howling … by god , varya , say what you will , i ’ ll throw him out of the house or … or leave myself , he added , probably recalling that he really could not throw people out of a house that was not his
1	you must not make a disturbance
1	i can hardly imagine her now with a chapter seven different face , and yet once she was young and lovely !
1	what a beautiful , what a saintly soul !
1	when dounia returned from her last interview with her brother , she had found her mother already ill , in feverish delirium
1	the countess , who had just dozed off , said , waking up
1	the main thing is that from the very first , though she tried to hold back , she threw herself to me with love , she would meet me with rapture when i came home in the evening , told me in her prattle ( the charming prattle of innocence ! )
1	besides , what is this fantasy that medicine has ever cured anybody killed , yes !
1	god , death , love , the brotherhood of men , he said to himself , connecting vague but joyful notions of something with these words
1	sometimes i left the house and wandered about somewhere till late in the evening
1	there 's an element of attraction here , brother
1	i defy your eminence to prove it , cried m de tréville , with all his gascon frankness and all his military gruffness , for an hour earlier m athos , who , i confide it to your majesty , is a man of the highest quality , did me the honor , after dining with me , of conversing in my hôtel drawing room with m le duc de la trémouille and m le comte de châlus , who happened to be there
1	i burst into the front hall by force
1	she told me that a deed of gift from the late stepan kuzmich
1	i expect i look as if i came from a café chantant and have had some adventure on the way
1	ah , my god , my god !
1	as i understand your life now , you will always remember it with pleasure , because the self-sacrifice by which you live now
1	nobody did see him , razumihin answered with vexation
1	well , now , young man , he said to him , it seems we are putting in some long nights !
1	they are industrious , commercial people ; 'the happiness of all ' is their case
1	how some people are able , how they manage to maintain their dignity !
1	she will be my nurse
1	oh , naturally , recalling my whole paradoxical and devil-may-care mood then , i would , of course , have gotten out of it by some most noble impulse , or catchy little word , or whatever , but i suddenly noticed a spiteful , accusing expression on liza 's frowning face , an unfair expression , almost mockery , and it was as if the devil pulled at my tongue : you , madam , i suddenly addressed her , seem to visit darya onisimovna frequently in the prince 's apartment ?
1	no doubt such a woman can be found , milady said coldly
1	we see it ’ s your mother and sister , rogozhin said through his teeth
1	heavens said ivan ilyich , and even with pleasure he took and crushed between his fingers a single walnut
1	and to her , too , it seemed that he was thinner , weaker , and more insignificant than anyone , and she no longer remembered that he was a bishop , and she kissed him like a child very near and dear to her
1	her mother was already very sick then and nearly dying ; in fact , two months later she did die ; she knew she was dying , but even so she never thought of being reconciled with her daughter till her dying day , never spoke a single word to her , chased her out to sleep in the front hall , gave her almost nothing to eat
1	these mr know-it-alls are occasionally , even quite frequently , to be met with in a certain social stratum
1	at the same time and swift as lightning , the unknown man drew his
1	i said somewhat timidly
1	dessales allowed himself to address him with a question
1	i , however , succeeded in
1	it was quiet everywhere , and one could clearly hear the rustling and tramping of the french troops , already beginning to move and take up their positions
1	then , taking the glass in one hand , she said : drink , drink—this wine will give you strength
1	kutuzov , frowning , glum , was sitting on a bench by the bridge and playing in the sand with his whip , when a caleche noisily galloped up to him
1	hello , pseldonymov , recognize me ?
1	the moon had left the yard and stood behind the church
1	can it be that he has such a love of destruction and chaos ( it 's indisputable that he sometimes loves them very much ; that is a fact ) because he is instinctively afraid of achieving the goal and completing the edifice he is creating ?
1	answered one of the two horsemen
1	kutuzov did not always ride a white horse , holding a field glass and pointing at enemies
1	after that , she grew up , scrofulous and sapless , under the crutch of her lame and drunken parent , amid a bedlam of household gossip , spying , and calumny
1	if they denounce you , they will betray themselves !
1	he 's lost a trick here
1	enough , madame , said porthos , let us speak no more of that , i beg you
1	she looked at me and sat down
1	i know this dog
1	by the way , asked m de tréville , what 's become of your three companions ?
1	who did you ask ?
1	yes , indeed , i am quite surprised at him to‐day , began zossimov , much delighted at the ladies ' entrance , for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes
1	i foresaw he would change his mind !
1	nobody can know the relative strength of the troops
1	he shouted , bringing his fist down on the table
1	he 's better , said the host
1	the father and mother spoke no further with their son about this matter ; but several days later the countess summoned sonya to her and , with a cruelty neither of them expected , reproached her niece for luring her son away and for ingratitude
1	she assured razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman , that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it
1	i must find out ; i absolutely must find out !
1	there wo not be later , but at present there is confound it !
1	one , very fat , in a white silk dress , sat apart on a low stool with a piece of green cardboard glued to the back of it
1	vasya , the messenger boy in afanasy ivanitch 's shop , is better dressed !
1	the funeral and burial are tomorrow , he 's already lying in his little coffin , sir
1	so you know , and that 's wonderful , and so go to her
1	he began to speak more loudly , obviously so that everyone could hear him
1	but , liza , what about you ?
1	since we had made peace and quarreled with bonaparte , we had made constitutions and unmade them , yet the salon of anna pavlovna and the salon of hélène were exactly the same as they had been—the one seven years earlier , the other five years earlier
1	maybe i will go to see her , and maybe not
1	on guard then , monsieur , on guard !
1	let 's go to bed
1	indeed , against his will he is called by certain accidents from non-being into life
1	it 's not really that i came to drink wine
1	it explained everything to me , everything , but as long as she was near , before my eyes , i hoped irresistibly and was terribly happy
1	that 's as it should be , they tell us
1	the same happened with his lawyer ; and yet the lawyer had something to tell him : he had settled the lawsuit quite adroitly , and the adversaries had come to a peaceful agreement , with a very insignificant part of the disputed inheritance as compensation
1	even his own , perhaps too complacent , consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances , seeing that pyotr petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé
1	her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever , and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home
1	i reproached myself for something and tried to think about other things
1	in my opinion , he did not know himself , but he certainly would have shot her if we had not pushed his hand away
1	shouted one of them , a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot
1	the resurrector , the former hero , flinging himself like a mangy , shaggy mutt at his lackey , who just laughs at him !
1	why are you standing there , stupid girl , winking at the office boys ?
1	because she 's afraid of compromising you
1	thus he had his musketeers as louis xiii had his , and these two rival powers were seen in all the provinces of france , and even in all foreign states , selecting men for their service who were famous for great strokes of the sword
1	ah , rodion romanovitch , is that you ?
1	he surely wo not want to lean over and slurp them up like noodles , and it 's not the right way—a dumpling has to be dipped in sour cream first
1	at four-thirty he lit the candle again and this time saw the black monk , who was sitting in the armchair near the bed
1	so it has been till now and so it will always be
1	let it stay there a while , and later i will take it out
1	now it remains to find out if fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the trouble of risking four heads
1	i admit it openly—for one may as well make a clean breast of it—i was the first to pitch on you
1	hold that mad woman !
1	they thought i would write chief clerk so-and-so at the very bottom of the page
1	no , it would be shameful to be afraid of it
1	at esau 's mess of pottage , the punishment of sodom , and the ordeals of the little boy joseph , she grew pale and opened her blue eyes wide
1	spring was only just beginning , and the real luxuriance of flowers was still hidden in the hothouse , yet what blossomed along the walks and here and there in the flower beds was enough so that , strolling in the garden , you felt yourself in a kingdom of tender colors , especially in the early hours when dew sparkled on every petal
1	the weaver 's fat wife babbled , standing in the middle of the street amidst a crowd of dikanka women
1	and allow me , my dear sir , for my part , to point out to you , ivan fyodorovich , having lost all patience , suddenly said vexedly , that my wife is here visiting prince lev nikolaevich , our mutual friend and neighbor , and that in any case it is not for you , young man , to judge lizaveta prokofyevna ’ s actions , nor to refer aloud and in my teeth to what is written on my face
1	people go from west to east , killing their own kind , and this event is accompanied by words about the glory of france , the baseness of england , and so on
1	they said she was having a romance with some princeling in a village there
1	excuse me , she said
1	well , people shouted , rushed from the ferry , tried to pull him out , but the current was swift , it carried him away , and when they pulled him out he was already dead—drowned
1	and these pictures appeared before her with such clarity and detail that they seemed to her now a reality , now the past , now the future
1	four chinks came into our yard , bringing firewood or something—i do not remember
1	moreover : then , you say , science itself will teach man ( though this is really a luxury in my opinion ) that in fact he has neither will nor caprice , and never did have any , and that he himself is nothing but a sort of piano key or a sprig in an organ ; [ ] and that , furthermore , there also exist in the world the laws of nature ; so that whatever he does is done not at all according to his own wanting , but of itself , according to the laws of nature
1	he angrily clenched and ground his teeth
1	possibly , indeed , he came like that on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone
1	it began very long ago—when i fled abroad for the last time
1	he said that he had forever bound himself by his word , but that he did not want to bind natasha and gave her full freedom
1	lord save us , lord protect us !
1	servants ran to and fro in a flurry
1	besides , how not show a little condescension to a husband whose wife has given you a rendezvous that same evening at saint-cloud , across from m d'estrées 's pavilion !
1	these four horses are equipped for campaigning
1	i went outside feeling somehow especially cheerful
1	but the need to seek causes has been put into the soul of man
1	but the humble air of piskarev , who clung fearfully to a column , was enough to show that he was utterly at a loss
1	the assistant asked him about something else
1	i do not know what would happen to him if natasha did not keep him on a leash
1	going down the huge , steep , and crooked hill that led out of the town , past the cathedral that stood on the hill to the right , in which a service was going on and the bells were ringing , pierre got out of the carriage and went on foot
1	true , thousands of men will have paid for my happiness with their lives ; but what will that matter to me , provided i see you again !
1	and i had a nice card ready
1	two hours went by
1	svidrigaïlov , too , might be a means of escape ; but porfiry was a different matter
1	i thought i should amuse you with my chatter , and i believe i have only made you cross
1	first he asked her for a job , to enter the service , then he started complaining about me , my husband , and you especially … said all kinds of things
1	you read remarkably well !
1	several men came around the corner , talking animatedly
1	all were excited and did not understand one another
1	listen he may marry anna andreevna !
1	i even noticed very well that , generally , at the fanariotovs ' , they must have been somehow ashamed of versilov ; i noticed it , however , from anna andreevna alone , though once again i do not know if one can use the word ashamed here ; anyhow , there was something of the sort
1	nikolai could not refuse iogel and asked sonya to dance
1	no , no , no , stone sober !
1	what sort of girl am i ?
1	it , too , was being done up ; there were workmen in it
1	the right trace horse lunged into the collar , the high springs creaked , and the body rocked
1	but i will tell you what i have been thinking to myself of late , on my way here in the train , especially : did not i contribute to all that calamity , morally , in a way , by irritation or something of the sort
1	through an agent ; my name wasn ’ t mentioned , nor was my address
1	after the first feeling of perplexity that berg 's proposal aroused in the parents , the festivity and joy usual on such occasions installed themselves in the family , yet the joy was not sincere , but external
1	she was trembling in a real physical fever
1	he bore these remarks quietly , however , and , without looking round , he turned down a street leading to the police office
1	in inviting me to stay with you , you wanted to catch me in your nets ; you calculated that i wanted to be revenged on the prince
1	and what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner ?
1	he muttered , helplessly sitting on the sofa again
1	said planchet , who had seen his master blush and pale successively
1	confound it , he went on almost aloud
1	and so , as you see , my dreams have come true
1	i do not want to , i ca not sleep , what am i to do ?
1	vos grenadiers ont été superbes , tonnerre de dieu
1	and ganya laughed spitefully
1	there 's no denying that raskolnikov had compromised himself seriously , but no facts had come to light as yet ; there was nothing positive
1	i asked her like a sensible woman to invite people , especially those who knew my late husband , and look at the set of fools she has brought !
1	it was he who noticed that the diphtheria had passed into the nose
1	porthos lived in an apartment of vast size and sumptuous appearance on the rue du vieux-colombier
1	this room was still smaller and narrower than the previous one , so that i did not even know where to turn in it ; a narrow single bed in the corner took up terribly much space ; the rest of the furniture consisted of three simple chairs heaped with all sorts of rags and a very simple wooden kitchen table in front of an old oilcloth sofa , so that it was almost impossible to pass between the table and the bed
1	perhaps he is repentant before the hour of his death ; only his sins are not such as god will forgive
1	later i asked an officer , and he said that was exactly right
1	irritated that my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations , he gradually began being unpardonably rude to them
1	she 's a millionaire bride , said mme peronsky
1	the old prince paced his study , stepping on his heels , and sent tikhon to marya bogdanovna to ask what news
1	let us commend ourselves and all our life unto christ our god
1	each drop strove to spread and take up the most space , but the others , striving to do the same , pressed it , sometimes destroying , sometimes merging with it
1	crowds of officers surrounded him
1	no one could say he had ever been seen at any party
1	he was heard at the council of war and will be heard when he talks to the point ; but to drag our feet and wait for something now , when bonaparte is afraid of a general battle more than anything—is impossible
1	it is not for sorcery , not for deeds of apostasy , that the sorcerer sits in the deep cellar
1	lizaveta prokofyevna turned to him
1	she had been pale to begin with , but when she heard these words , her face changed and something lit up in her luminous , beautiful eyes
1	if you repent of the way you have behaved with me , the young girl who hands you this letter will tell you how a gallant man may obtain his pardon
1	suddenly aglaya came out on the terrace ; she looked calm , though somewhat pale
1	it ca not be a line , because they are in a bunch !
1	it would seem that you , as an artillerist , ought to set an example , and here you are bootless
1	i ’ ve even happened to think sometimes , the prince went on very seriously , being genuinely and deeply interested , that all people are like that , so that i even began to approve of myself , because it ’ s very hard to resist these double thoughts ; i ’ ve experienced it
1	i do not know why , but the sight of those two tables piled high with books gradually began to infuriate me
1	avdotya ignatievna exclaimed with rapture
1	and have you ever seen a shade before ?
1	when they brought me from russia , through various german towns , i only looked on silently and , i remember , i didn ’ t even ask about anything
1	raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink dejectedly
1	give this good news to your sister , my dear cousin
1	guffaws and squeals came from all over the regiment
1	the old woman is of no consequence , he thought , hotly and incoherently
1	after a pause , he added : but preserve these gloves , gentle brother , that they not adorn unclean hands
1	if only you would help your mother !
1	it 's a splendid aim and all ; but in the present circumstances , something else is needed
1	he looked at her strangely
1	yes , i am a bit ill
1	how do you know it ?
1	so please do come for dinner , he said
1	my late grandfather 's aunt used to say that he was vexed with her the most , precisely for having abandoned the former tavern on oposhnyanskaya road , and he tried with all his might to vent his anger on her
1	perhaps she avdotya romanovna could not finish
1	that the renewal , so to speak , of things
1	to his first knocking there was no response
1	d'artagnan flattened himself to his horse 's neck , in order to see without being seen
1	and even this trifling sum is beyond me
1	kutuzov rode along , falling asleep and waking up and trying to hear if there was gunfire to the right , if the action had begun
1	why , she 's pretty , he said , drawing himself up and looking at her
1	the coroner thought listlessly , watching the outrunner working his legs
1	things to be seen to
1	moisei ilyich is sending me again
1	what for many years past he had feared more than anything was being shown up and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of transferring his business to petersburg
1	maybe it 's precisely the means of seduction that struck him most of all
1	she was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place
1	what drove you to tell him ?
1	as soon as aglaya got the hedgehog , she put it into a wicker basket with kolya ’ s help , covered it with a napkin , and started asking kolya to go at once and , without stopping anywhere , take the hedgehog to the prince on her behalf , with the request that he accept it as a token of her profoundest respect
1	you are right , said felton , after looking at milady from where he was , without taking a step towards her
1	tomorrow , or tonight perhaps , i will see him again , and then the past will no longer exist
1	but there ’ s no need , at least insofar as i ’ m acquainted with your affairs , the general went on hotly
1	not knowing why himself , he announced directly that he would not go
1	but once i reached early manhood , i became a bit calmer for some reason , though with every passing year i learned more and more about my terrible quality
1	but we have calculated it all , dounia and i , to the last penny , and we see that the journey will not cost very much
1	what is it , nicolas ?
1	in spite of all his agonising inward struggle , he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans
1	white , white as that birch , and gallant , you might say , noble fellows
1	and our little tea table ?
1	i suddenly remembered that on the day when nastasya egorovna had come to see me , i had let slip to her that i did not know where lambert lived , but in the sense that i did not know and did not want to know
1	ah , how terribly i lied !
1	in fact the author ’ s absence from russia can be felt in the book , if we compare it with his preceding novel , crime and punishment ( ) , which is so saturated in place , in the streets , buildings , squares , and bridges of petersburg , that the city becomes a living participant in events
1	i do not want it , said raskolnikov , pushing away the pen
1	how good it would be to know where to look for help in this life and what to expect after it , there , beyond the grave !
1	instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life , she gave the simple facts—that is , his own words , an exact account of his health , what he asked for at their interviews , what commission he gave her and so on
1	everywhere is darkness , not a ray , not a spark , but chekhov goes forward , slowly , hardly , hardly moving
1	four men took hold of the hussar and began to lift him up
1	only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have ; so you must be mad
1	however , maybe i would not have given it to her , because i would have been very ashamed to confess to her then that i had it and that i had been watching her for so long , waiting and not giving it to her
1	he has convictions , firm ones , rather clear
1	but let 's stop arguing , we will never see eye to eye , because i place the least perfect of all little libraries and first-aid kits , which you have just spoken of with such scorn , above all the landscape paintings in the world
1	he fell down before her , he kissed her feet and both wept , embracing
1	to the question of what constitutes the cause of historical events , a different answer presents itself , which is that the course of world events is predestined from on high , depends on the coincidence of all the wills of the people participating in those events , and that napoleon 's influence on the course of those events is only external and fictitious
1	he cried in sudden fury
1	for thirty years i have been a beloved professor , have had excellent colleagues , have enjoyed honorable renown
1	i am leaving this minute !
1	he remembered however , that on coming out on to the canal bank , he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more conspicuous , and he had thought of turning back
1	the boldness of it !
1	in my opinion , each of us has the right to have his own feelings if it 's from conviction so that no one should reproach him for them , i addressed vasin
1	once she got to talking with her friend natasha about sonya and about her unfairness towards her
1	say at once : 'ivan fyodorovich !
1	after tea , varka stands in one spot for a whole hour , looking at the guests and awaiting orders
1	at least i remember him once murmuring somehow strangely , with that air of worldly squeamishness he repeatedly allowed himself with me , that my mother was a person of the defenseless sort , whom you do not really fall in love with—on the contrary , not at all—but for some reason suddenly fall to pitying , for their meekness , is it , or for what , anyhow ?
1	i feel weak , dounia , i am very tired ; and i should have liked at this moment to be able to control myself
1	all who live in it try to mimic and mock one another
1	maxim ivanovich obeyed : i cheated foma that time
1	reason expresses the laws of necessity
1	but the law of history relates to man
1	do you remember i defended them here ?
1	pierre knew that everyone was only waiting for him finally to say one word , to cross a certain line , and he knew that sooner or later he would cross it ; but some incomprehensible terror seized him at the mere thought of that frightful step
1	it seemed he was trying to forget that former life and was interested only in his case with the provision officials
1	but to‐day , to‐day it 's all cleared up
1	pyotr petrovitch began getting up from his chair
1	the grandson of the heroes portrayed in the picture portraying a russian family of the average upper-class cultivated circle over three generations and in connection with russian history—this descendant of his forebears could not be portrayed as a contemporary type otherwise than in a somewhat misanthropic , solitary , and undoubtedly sad guise
1	good-bye , i have no time , liza cut me off , and i suddenly saw so much hatred in her fleeting glance that i at once cried out in fright : liza , dear , why that look ?
1	but how to put it into words ?
1	he was shouted at a couple of times for being in the way
1	why , he had seen lizaveta afterwards !
1	the soul is immortal which means , if i will live forever , then i also lived before , lived for the whole eternity
1	always before , whenever i actually imagined to myself how i would be buried in the grave , my only association with the grave proper was the feeling of dampness and cold
1	so then so then , pack our things , planchet , and let 's be going
1	the stuff 's no good
1	but that 's all nonsense , and on the surface
1	it was told of him that during that month he had supposedly become incomparably more reasonable , even more stern , was no longer frightened , did not weep , and in all that time never once uttered a single word about anna andreevna
1	he closed his eyes and it seemed he slept , but twice he heard the clock strike and father sisoy cough on the other side of the wall
1	how is it you have no notion of anything ?
1	he asked if the russians were still there
1	towards four o'clock in the afternoon , murat 's troops were entering moscow
1	go and tell liza
1	but the thought was painful : if things are well with him , he won ’ t come , the prince went on thinking , he ’ ll sooner come if things are not well with him ; and things are probably not well …
1	that other was your father , polya ; papa was fearfully angry is the water ready ?
1	they were expecting her husband to arrive
1	i am only saying one thing , general , that if the matter depended on my own personal wish , the will of his majesty the emperor franz would have been fulfilled long ago
1	cried the blacksmith , and how will you like this ?
1	tatyana pavlovna picked up
1	yes , yes , let them come at once ; it 's nearly eight o'clock , and at nine i expect a visit
1	in revenge he up and married me to you a huntsman to a cow girl
1	this was the freshness and naivete dostoevsky was seeking , a sense of the world and the person being born at the same time
1	why , i was telling you last night what i think about all such ceremonies
1	as far as i could conclude , the guest , despite his amiability and seeming ingenuousness of tone , was very stiff and , of course , valued himself enough to consider his visit a great honor even for whoever it might be
1	gavrila ardalionovich was starting out precisely in that line ; but he was only starting out
1	wait , when you have not the strength to live , and yet you must live and want to live !
1	sire , me permettrez-vous de vous parler franchement en loyal militaire ?
1	ask them yourself and perhaps you will find out foo !
1	that is another significant moment of reticence on myshkin ’ s part
1	cried porfiry with a perfectly good‐humoured , sly and composed face
1	my wife has escaped ?
1	porfiry petrovitch went on , looking round the room
1	but if i do not recognize any judgment over me , i know all the same that i will be judged , once i have become a deaf and speechless defendant
1	but he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful , shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her
1	if we take what might seem the most traditional of gogol 's tales—the terrible vengeance , for example , or viy ( which gogol calls a folk legend and claims to retell almost as simply as he heard it ) —we will see that their procedure is precisely antitraditional
1	he intimidated him , that 's what
1	but confound them all now !
1	i remember , towards the end we became terribly merry
1	how true it is !
1	we are trying to establish a community of our own , a special one , on a broader basis
1	the preparations for the funeral dinner at katerina ivanovna 's excited his curiosity as he passed
1	alphonsine , not a step from the house !
1	i will let you know , however
1	so the summer went by
1	asked aramis , seeing what was happening
1	the house with the mezzanine : an artist 's
1	for having coffee to drink , and being well fed ?
1	they live well , but it 's impossible to save , what with the family , sir
1	i am sorry , too , that with all the energy and resolution in protesting—which she has already shown once—she has little self‐reliance , little , so to say , independence , so as to break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas
1	there was faith , hope , love
1	do you know that ?
1	exactly three weeks after his last evening at the rostovs ' , prince andrei returned to petersburg
1	that it actually was rogozhin himself , and not a vision , not delirium , i at first did not doubt in the least
1	where 's his head pointing ?
1	whom did she send ?
1	and each time he passed , the young man had a sick , frightened feeling , which made him scowl and feel ashamed
1	asked aramis , with that gentleness of expression which was noticeable in him each time his thoughts led him back to the church
1	dounia understood it , snatched up the key , flew to the door , unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room
1	do not be angry at the boldness of a desperate man , at a drowning man , for daring to make a last effort to save himself from disaster
1	the guests began to disperse , but few went home : many stayed the night in the captain 's wide yard ; still more cossacks fell asleep , uninvited , under the benches , on the floor , by their horses , near the barn ; wherever a drunken cossack head staggered to , there he lay and snored for all kiev to hear
1	that is … i know a lot
1	oh , nonsense , you knew , you knew beforehand ; maybe even yesterday …
1	the fact of a father was nothing , and i disliked tender feelings , but this man did not want to know me and humiliated me , while all those years i had dreamed long and hard of him ( if one can say that about dreaming )
1	why , weren ’ t you asking seriously ?
1	i do not sleep at night until dawn , and that for a year now
1	and those tears a moment ago , which , like an ashamed woman , i could not hold back before you , i will never forgive you !
1	listen , you say he does not like to show his feelings , so perhaps i shall annoy him with my weaknesses ?
1	how can you not know that ?
1	natasha , cautiously opening the door , peeked into the room
1	marfa petrovna you have got rid of marfa petrovna , too , so they say ?
1	at that the conversation ended
1	lxiv : the man in the red cloak athos 's despair had given way to a concentrated grief , which made the man 's brilliant mental faculties still more lucid
1	monseigneur , the musketeers , when they are not on duty , or their duty is over , drink and throw dice , and for their lackeys they are very superior officers
1	and he began ringing at the bell , all but broke it
1	then sensuality was quickly born , sensuality generated jealousy , and jealousy—cruelty
1	and he seems to be quite sick himself
1	the man exclaimed , as if boasting that it had happened
1	he did not think about karataev , who grew weaker every day and obviously would soon be subjected to the same lot
1	and here the enemy will devastate you
1	meanwhile katerina ivanovna apparently heard nothing
1	not only is it encountered at every step , but all the descriptions of the general historians are made up of a consecutive series of such contradictions
1	i thought precisely that about her then , with pride and with joy , because there was magnanimity in it : on the verge of ruin , yet goethe 's great words still shine
1	and now i want to carouse , i ’ m a streetwalker !
1	to pierre 's question of what he must do and how to answer , willarski said only that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre need do nothing more than tell the truth
1	princess marya felt insulted in her sense of her own dignity , because the arrival of the promised suitor excited her , and she was still more insulted that her two friends did not suppose it could be otherwise
1	where is the money !
1	it was to this important person that our akaky akakievich came , and came at a most unfavorable moment , very inopportune for himself , though very opportune for the important person
1	you wanted to take revenge on me for something just now , swore to ruin me , and certainly would have killed or beaten anyone who uttered even one bad word about me in your presence
1	tie a string round your finger , then
1	here people danced precisely in simplicity of heart , to make merry and even get wild
1	after eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street , with my orphans !
1	i thought it was luzhin 's present , observed raskolnikov
1	it was also impossible to suppose that they feared a denunciation to the police ; for what could the police do here ?
1	c'est pour vous que je dis cela , monsieur kiril
1	when our charabanc stops at the gate , he does not conceal his joy and impatience
1	razumihin broke in upon her thoughts , guessing them , as he strolled along the pavement with huge steps , so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him , a fact he did not observe , however
1	oh , papa , what 's the matter with you , you do not understand !
1	to that end , he took on the valet of one of his master 's guests , named fourreau , and that false soldier who had wanted to kill d'artagnan , and who , belonging to no corps , had entered into his service , or rather planchet 's , since d'artagnan had spared his life
1	the doctor 's coarse , peasant face gradually lights up with a smile of tenderness and delight at the movements of the human spirit
1	you , though , how do you look at this renunciation ?
1	the priest 's wife , with dimples on her red-cheeked , smiling face , followed him into the room
1	should be here shortly
1	here on the terrace like yesterday ?
1	show us the new carriage your master acquired recently
1	he ’ s obviously very absentminded now , and hard to make out ; he talks , tells stories , laughs , guffaws , then suddenly gets terribly angry with me , i don ’ t know why , sir
1	all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience
1	if he had shrieked in a desperate voice , that shriek would have terrified princess marya less than the sound or that voice
1	the officer timokhin , with a little red nose , was wiping himself on the dam and , seeing the prince , became embarrassed , yet ventured to address him :
1	tell us , did you not yet know of the countess 's death when you stayed in moscow ?
1	he slammed the door , summoned mlle bourienne , and quieted down in his study
1	he made haste to turn them all over
1	well , yes , yes , said the regimental commander , still one must pity the young fellow in his misfortune
1	rostov understood that the old man meant to ask him something
1	seeing this she did not pull the door back , but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with it on to the stairs
1	but not all those present were drunk ; lodgers came in from all the rooms
1	but he , though he was a good man , became so bewildered and even frightened at the mention of money , that he came out with the most unexpected rubbish
1	however , there are railroads everywhere in europe now , and steamships drive very fast
1	the masters are leaving , the whole house is empty , said the old woman , addressing the old servant
1	finally , at around half-past ten , the prince was left alone ; he had a headache ; the last to leave was kolya , who helped him to change his wedding costume for house clothes
1	they repeated to him their first question , which he had told them he did not want to answer
1	the news of this letter affected the old prince maybe several times more strongly than she part three or any of us had supposed
1	have you asked her to join your community ?
1	incidentally the murder of lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis : a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open !
1	naked as the poorest wretch , writes isabelle jan , but masters in faithfulness , rapidity , and effectiveness , they are indeed demigods
1	his two companions were already waiting on horseback
1	the horse , puff , puff , is quite a decent one !
1	and look at the ground again
1	at least they discussed it together
1	and he could be silent like that for several hours , without experiencing in himself or causing in others the slightest embarrassment
1	would you like me to finish ?
1	what , you still do not believe me ?
1	his hair was soaked with sweat , his quivering lips were parched , his eyes were fixed on the ceiling
1	never would i have stooped to such a stupid conversation with anyone else
1	the cossacks bowed on all sides and stood in a cluster
1	in the military respect , napoleon , as soon as he enters moscow , gives general sébastiani strict orders to keep track of the movements of the russian army , sends corps to various roads , and orders murat to find kutuzov
1	and as a result of that , when they sat for him , they sometimes acquired such expressions as astonished the artist : one tried to make her face show melancholy , another reverie , a third wanted at all costs to reduce the size of her mouth and compressed it so much that it finally turned into a dot no bigger than a pinhead
1	at the council , in opposition to the opinion of the old men—kutuzov and prince schwarzenberg—it was decided to go on the offensive immediately and give general battle to bonaparte
1	since then i ’ ve had a terrible fondness for asses
1	and what was the meaning of this face that he was afraid of and that he loved so much !
1	will you explain what you want ?
1	but since that story of the lapdog on the train three years ago , my relations with our porthos , epanchin , have been definitively terminated
1	thank you , monsieur , replied mme bonacieux
1	but when he was on the semyonovskoe heights , the artillery commander had suggested placing several batteries on those heights to increase the fire on the russian troops crowding before knyazkovo
1	it so happened that he also wanted terribly much to do versilov a good turn , to make , so to speak , a first step , and versilov allowed it
1	though boris had come with the intention of speaking of his love , and therefore intended to be tender , he began speaking irritably of women 's inconstancy : of how easily women could go from sadness to joy , and that their mood depended only on who was courting them
1	avdotya romanovna flushed , but did not break the silence
1	said the young woman , pressing her hands together and weeping at the queen 's distress herself
1	nothing to do but read it , taras tikhonovich , said the judge , addressing the secretary with an air of displeasure , and his nose inadvertently sniffed his upper lip , which previously it used to do only from great pleasure
1	the solitary shot of a signal gun rang out , and the troops that surrounded moscow on all sides moved into the city through the tver , kaluga , and dorogomilovo gates
1	you would be more comfortable staying somewhere with us , even
1	i knew perfectly well that liza used to visit mrs stolbeev and later occasionally visited poor darya onisimovna , whom they all came to love very much ; but suddenly , after this , incidentally , extremely sensible statement from the prince , and especially after stebelkov 's stupid outburst , or maybe because i had just been called prince , suddenly , owing to all that , i blushed all over
1	yet it 's a known fact that a great many of those who are capable of contemplating their imminent death , self-willed or not , are quite often inclined to be concerned with the handsome appearance in which their corpse will be left
1	gentlemen , said d'artagnan , whose wits never deserted him , gentlemen , think it over !
1	you want to go there with us , too ?
1	what a fine sight we will be on those nags , while aramis and porthos go prancing along on their horses !
1	people laugh , dogs bark
1	i wanted forcefully to subject myself and to be faithful to nature , soullessly , having stifled everything
1	besides a general feeling of alienation from all people , natasha experienced at that time a particular feeling of alienation from the persons of her own family
1	cried dounia , in vexation
1	so i went along and thought : no , i ’ ll wait before condemning this christ-seller
1	what may we offer you , ivan ivanovich ?
1	a coachman , after shouting at him two or three times , gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip , for having almost fallen under his horses ' hoofs
1	and i see you are an intelligent man too
1	have you the papers ?
1	he gazed for a long time , thrusting his head out the vent
1	his estate turned out to be in order and , besides that , there turned out to be quite a considerable capital
1	whatever is young and honest , they destroy !
1	it was considered closed , but went on working secretly , with the knowledge of the district police officer
1	have not you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg ?
1	swarthy and fair , tall and short , some fat as ivan nikiforovich , some so thin it seemed each of them could have been put into the police chief 's scabbard
1	they were separated by an empty space of about six hundred yards
1	ganya , before the moment when they all got up from the table , had suddenly stopped drinking and pushed his glass away ; something dark had passed over his face
1	if i call , he said , come
1	the inhabitants were leaving , the retreating troops were filling moscow
1	i am lost , d'artagnan said to himself
1	i am not the point
1	tolstyakov , a friend of mine , is always obliged to take off his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other people wear their hats or caps
1	that 's just the point , that the ordinary man would unfailingly behave that way
1	mixed with the memory of that young girl was the memory of wrath , and a desire for vengeance had distorted milady 's features , which , however , recovered almost at once the calm and benevolent expression that this woman of a hundred faces had momentarily lost
1	there 's nothing more pleasant than to owe everything to oneself
1	they may be of use some time
1	does that mean you have reasons to be ?
1	yes : the diamond pendants his majesty gave the queen
1	will you still say , discreet aramis , that you are on bad terms with mme de bois-tracy , when the gracious lady is kind enough to lend you her handkerchiefs ?
1	yes , sir , your honor , the soldier said with pleasure , rolling his eyes and drawing himself up still more zealously , but not budging from his place
1	d'artagnan responded in such a way that kitty remained in the greatest delusion
1	you do not get money every day ?
1	how would he find athos ?
1	he was extremely angry
1	why are you annoyed ?
1	yes , that 's right , milord , that 's right , in the left side with a knife
1	for half an hour or more i went on explaining in an even little voice , looking down like a well-behaved boy
1	you see , lukyan timofeich , it would be a terrible thing to be mistaken
1	that 's how it is with us , meaning no offense to you !
1	you are a terrible laugher , just like me wait she seized the countess by both hands , kissed the knuckle of her little finger—june—and went on kissing july and august on the other hand
1	shouted denisov , who could not stay still and fidgeted on his horse in front of the squadron
1	you ca not get on without us
1	of course , it 's hard to understand , but it 's like a gambler who throws his last gold coin on the table and has a revolver ready in his pocket—that 's the meaning of his proposal
1	understandably , it seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by the intrigues of england ( as he said , in fact , on the island of st helena [ ] ) ; understandably , to the members of the english parliament it seemed that the war was caused by napoleon 's love of power ; to prince oldenburg it seemed that the war was caused by the violence done him ; to the merchants it seemed that the war was caused by the continental system , which was ruining europe ; to the old soldiers and generals it seemed that the chief cause was the need to make use of them ; to the legitimists of that time , [ ] that it was necessary to restore les bons principes ; [ ] and to the diplomats of that time , that it had all happened because the alliance between russia and austria in had not been concealed skillfully enough from napoleon and because memorandum no
1	and , of course , my brother never thought for a moment that he was guilty of her death
1	blood was flowing from his head and face ; his face was crushed , mutilated and disfigured
1	set him next to his wife : a real tomfool !
1	i wish they would laid one like him next to me !
1	how do you do , your excellency , he said to the entering anatole , and held out his hand again
1	she asked , looking up at him across the table
1	one can quite understand it but how could you have lowered yourself to such an action ?
1	if there was any , we did not understand it , or else it was not witty at all , said the expressions of the marshals ' faces
1	each time the reading goes on uninterruptedly for several hours without tiring him
1	spirid went on : he would spot a rabbit quicker than you could take a pinch of snuff
1	it should be realized that this certain important person had become an important person only recently , and till then had been an unimportant person
1	how could you go and leave your poor olenka , poor , wretched me ?
1	but he did not believe a word he said , though he felt a strange inclination to believe
1	could live a little !
1	during the entr'acte there was a gust of cold in hélène 's box , the door opened , and anatole came in , ducking his head and trying not to snag on anyone
1	but in order to comprehend the laws of the continuous movement of the sum of all individual wills , human reason allows for arbitrary , discrete units
1	as they were going downstairs , d'artagnan slapped the chief on the shoulder
1	but the other one needs it more
1	at this amalia ivanovna , lashed to fury , struck the table with her fist , and shrieked that she was amalia ivanovna , and not ludwigovna , that her vater was named johann and that he was a burgomeister , and that katerina ivanovna 's vater was quite never a burgomeister
1	it seemed to evgeny pavlovich that he and adelaida had not yet become completely close with each other ; but the future seemed to promise a completely willing and heartfelt submission of the ardent adelaida to the intelligence and experience of prince shch
1	this other man wore a tailcoat , was over forty , and had a preoccupied physiognomy , and was the special office attendant and announcer to his excellency , owing to which he was conscious of his worth
1	we do not mention the old times at all ; she receives me very willingly , but speaks to me somehow abstractly
1	every woman is a serpent , and every serpent is a woman !
1	earlier you suddenly said something very intelligent
1	the conversation was evidently a continuation of their previous arguments during the week ; but into it , to my misfortune , there again slipped that same fatal little phrase that had so electrified me the day before , and it led me to an outburst that i regret to this day
1	what , at five years old ?
1	but a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained
1	but rostov took leave of the doctor and asked the assistant to accompany him
1	there 's some mistake in words here , from the very beginning , and 'love for mankind ' should be understood as just for that mankind which you yourself have created in your soul ( in other words , you have created your own self and the love for yourself ) , and which therefore will never exist in reality
1	he held out both hands to me , but he did not give me one—he drew it back in time , struck him suspiciously
1	you turned a bit crude , my friend , wherever it was that you grew up , but , anyhow , you are still decent enough
1	to me it also seems that there 's something wrong here
1	i must tell you that i would heard of this stupid story before you wrote and do not believe a word of it
1	this task is possible only if we stop arbitrarily substituting for the value of the whole unknown x the conditions under which force is manifested—to wit : the orders of the commander , armaments , and so on—taking them for the value of the multiplier , and recognize this unknown in its entirety , that is , as the greater or lesser desire to fight and subject oneself to danger
1	i believe it is real ah , i remember ; i must escape !
1	his relations even published in the newspapers that they were not answerable for his debts , but he continued his carousing even now , obtaining money at ten percent a month , gambling terribly in the gambling houses , and squandering all he had on a notorious frenchwoman
1	how do you know ?
1	and she had almost guessed right : in essence i actually felt something of that sort at the time
1	once more he softly touched the bell which gave one tinkle , then gently , as though reflecting and looking about him , began touching the door‐handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was only fastened by the hook
1	the little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that
1	as you know , i came up from the ranks
1	when he came to a streetlight , some ten steps ahead of me , i noticed that something fell out of his pocket
1	prodigiously , said athos , clenching his teeth
1	drink the tea , swallow it—never mind if it burns you ; life 's dearer
1	i dare say i do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash ; but you must not think me selfish or grasping for that , and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes
1	and here is why
1	it 's my last request of you
1	never mind my being drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of wine
1	ivan fyodorovich sat on his chair as if on needles , blushing and looking down ; but the young lady seemed not to notice it at all and sat indifferently on the sofa , studying the windows and walls diligently or following with her eyes a cat that timorously ran under the chairs
1	the three musketeers oh , yes !
1	i made the acquaintance of nikodim fomitch and ilya petrovitch , and the house‐porter and mr
1	i declare to you that there were grounds for your suspicions : this document exists that is , it did
1	i began showing him to the stairs with a candle ; the landlord also jumped over , but , in secret from versilov , i seized his arm with all my strength and shoved him away fiercely
1	those standing behind noticed the things that the orator did not say and hastened to say them
1	ivan ivanych quickly glanced into the shed and said :
1	and in general i ’ d advise you to keep to the family you ’ re going to be with
1	do you know what we are eating here ?
1	give me a little kopeck !
1	well , go on , go on— my dear friend !
1	i stayed , but with a look which showed every second that i was terribly afraid of being in their way ( as was proper )
1	in this lane there were high stone walls on both sides , for almost a hundred paces—the enclosures of backyards
1	[ ] you will see everything best from where count bennigsen is
1	katerina clasped her hands and fell like a sheaf on the dead body
1	tell me about it , tréville ; you know how i love stories of war and combat
1	so when you stand and pray before you go to sleep , add at the end : 'and have mercy , lord jesus , on all those who have nobody to pray for them
1	it was a sad prospect
1	this stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the serious , brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor
1	last year i had no need of it , but this year i resolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived
1	what made me think , he reflected , as he went under the gateway , what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment !
1	that 's the way to eat them
1	what do you mean to do now ?
1	this is our neighbor , mama , ivan fyodorovich shponka !
1	and again he was transferred to his former artificial world of phantoms of some sort or greatness , and again ( as a horse walking about a slanting treadmill imagines it is doing something for itself ) , he began to obediently fulfill that cruel , sad , oppressive , and inhuman role which had been assigned to him
1	do you know krylov ’ s fable , your excellency : the lion and the ass ’ ?
1	for instance , it was sinful to work on sundays and holidays , monday was an unlucky day , and as a result in one year there was a total of about two hundred days when he had , willy-nilly , to sit with folded arms
1	ippolit is her brother
1	it was as if he suddenly came out of some sort of dream , almost embarrassed ; he took a letter from a briefcase that lay on the table and gave it to me
1	i understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate , but who is proud , imperious and above all , impatient , to have to bear such treatment !
1	on the twenty-ninth of november , kutuzov rode into vilno—into his good old vilno , as he used to say
1	live like that if you want , and if you do not—go hang yourself
1	and yet , sincerely speaking , i had never seen more bitter and outright grief than when i looked at this unfortunate woman
1	and i did not realize then how happy i was !
1	he explained every incident of the murder , the secret of the pledge ( the piece of wood with a strip of metal ) which was found in the murdered woman 's hand
1	if only there was a seasoned hare running through the field , i would show you what kind of dog she is !
1	imagine for a moment what may have become of your sister in ten years ?
1	from the time of this news until the end of the campaign , kutuzov 's entire activity consists only of restraining his troops , by power , cunning , and entreaties , from useless attacks , maneuvers , and clashes with the perishing enemy
1	just as he entered the vestibule , another man also entered , dusty , out of breath , leaving at the door a post-horse which , on arriving , fell to its knees
1	but how do you come to know me ?
1	i have never seen a handsomer man
1	but , precisely because of its originality , chekhov 's work met with opposition from the established critics of the time
1	as soon as the uhlans had gone down the hill , the hussars were ordered to move up the hill to cover the battery
1	many people came to see how she would weep and walk behind the coffin ; then the pastor—he was still a young man and his whole ambition was to become a great preacher—turned to them all and pointed at marie
1	he calls her pashenka !
1	don ’ t they understand that the more oblivious i become , the more i give myself up to that last phantom of life and love with which they want to screen my meyer ’ s wall from me , with all that is written on it so frankly and simple-heartedly , the more unhappy they will make me ?
1	knowing that my wife and daughter are on his side , he sticks to the following tactics : he responds to my barbs with an indulgent silence ( the old man 's cracked , what 's the point of talking to him ?
1	yet time went by , the hours seemed to awaken the clock one by one as they passed , and each stroke of the bronze clapper echoed in the prisoner 's heart
1	i got dressed as quickly as i could
1	suddenly the galosh grows , swells , fills the whole room
1	he muttered , standing aimlessly in the gateway , just opposite the porter 's little dark room , which was also open
1	what then is to be done ?
1	true to his sweet dream ,
1	kindly note , your excellency : everybody else is witty , but i am not
1	with my capital i will throw myself into the 'idea , and in ten years all russia will be talking , and i will have my revenge on everyone
1	you have kissed the queen 's hand ?
1	that 's why i am not anxious to have you take it from me
1	after his meeting with pierre in moscow , prince andrei left for petersburg on business , as he told his family , but in reality in order to meet prince anatole kuragin , whom he considered it necessary to meet
1	i could not speak in the right way
1	raskolnikov had not heard them at first
1	it was as if the main screw in his head , which held his whole life together , had become stripped
1	that is , likhachev couldn ’ t get her for any amount of money !
1	do you think so , porthos ?
1	in five minutes he was standing on the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in
1	there are instances of it with everyone ; human beings in general , indeed , greatly love to be insulted , have you noticed that ?
1	pierre and thirteen others were led to the krymsky ford , to the carriage shed or a merchant ’ s house
1	the letters would be read aloud several times , and the old man , moved , flushed with excitement , would say :
1	let us try to take our revenge
1	he had two sons : sergei and ivan
1	rostov saw how the sovereign 's stooping shoulders shuddered as if a chill ran through them , and how his left foot convulsively began to spur the horse 's side
1	here 's the grocery where we used to buy gingerbread
1	in the end i decided to challenge my adversary to a duel
1	kutuzov made no objections or comments
1	i will read you the first canto ; it 's four hundred verses long and takes one minute
1	the prince jumped up from the chair in new fright
1	all of a sudden he seems to have lost patience
1	evidently ours had begun to respond
1	in this whole part of the province , his uncle had the reputation of a most noble and disinterested eccentric
1	the philosopher flitted into the weeds and broke into a run , constantly stumbling over old roots and crushing moles underfoot
1	soon after prince andrei 's return , the old prince separated his son 's share of the inheritance and gave him bogucharovo , a large estate thirty miles from bald hills
1	you did not drink before coming , or earlier ?
1	but there seemed to be nothing , no trace , except in one place , where some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers
1	i am very glad you have come , said kraft
1	the artist must pass judgment only on what he understands ; his range is as limited as that of any other specialist—that 's what i keep repeating and insisting upon
1	and now would you like to look over my estate ?
1	all this happened yesterday evening
1	the hostilities are over , we can shake hands with each other the emperor napoleon is burning with desire to meet prince auersperg
1	at the sight of d'artagnan , he stood up and politely took a few steps towards him
1	kutuzov , leaving his hands propped on the bench , looked at denisov with displeasure
1	the princess nodded to her daughter and sailed towards the door
1	events and time do not wait
1	and what have you done with your curates ?
1	he became suspicious to such a degree that he finally began to suspect his own self , started writing terrible , unjust denunciations , made innumerable people miserable
1	and anna andreevna thinks so , too
1	he said timidly at last in a weak voice
1	[ ] he added , already addressing pierre as his own brother
1	that 's why i have chosen this example , because it is an all too vivid one
1	she gave it to me
1	show him in , said milady , in a voice so curt but so piercing that d'artagnan heard it in the antechamber
1	what was more , she showed and read to everyone the letter in dounia 's own handwriting to mr svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it—which i must say i think was superfluous
1	no doubt you do not care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters dounia 's not at home , mother ?
1	but where can you have seen her the day before yesterday ?
1	of course , the funeral !
1	vive le roi de rome !
1	and since you have started to deign , it serves you right , love-child
1	after the death of prince andrei , natasha and princess marya equally felt that
1	at that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street , and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing the hamlet were heard in the entry
1	my hand is tired of writing !
1	all the while i spoke of the prince , she listened to me , looking down with a sort of sly but sweet smile : she knew why i was praising him so
1	you are right again , sonia
1	at the very moment she was expected to seize the hare , he swerved and flew out to the boundary between the green fields and the stubble
1	he had already been warned by d'artagnan , who first announced that it would mean glory , then money , and finally danger
1	does she even mean to have a funeral lunch ?
1	but while he stood at the railing , still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage , and rubbing his back , he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand
1	i will ask them again right now , said pierre , and he got up and went to the door of the shed
1	he saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there
1	i have a headache
1	he thought to himself
1	this time it was athos who turned pale
1	she had undertaken to lay the table , to provide the linen , crockery , etc , and to cook the dishes in her kitchen , and katerina ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone herself to the cemetery
1	and meanwhile , even in spite of all my desire , i could never imagine to myself that there is no future life and no providence
1	he knew that he was in the power of these people , that it was only power that had brought him there , that only power gave them the right to demand answers to their questions , and that the only purpose of this gathering was to incriminate him
1	in what , essentially , can i be of service to you , my much-esteemed prince , since all the same you have now … summoned me ?
1	he examined the hand , vainly looking for blood on it
1	moreover , it seems my shouting was heard in the reception room , and the talk and laughter suddenly died down
1	[ ] this letter was considered a model of patriotic , spiritual eloquence
1	am i very pale ?
1	what 's going on with her ?
1	the old man picked up an ember , blew it to flame—lighting up only his eyes and nose—then , when the yoke was found , went over to lipa with the light and looked at her ; his eyes expressed compassion and tenderness
1	it is me or luzhin
1	thank god , i took mama away and put her to bed , and there are no new developments
1	yes , it 's all right
1	but i repeat to you for the hundredth time , there is only one case , one only , when man may purposely , consciously wish for himself even the harmful , the stupid , even what is stupidest of all : namely , so as to have the right to wish for himself even what is stupidest of all and not be bound by an obligation to wish for himself only what is intelligent
1	mikhail kirilych has grown still fatter !
1	what will happen to them then ?
1	what word should i begin with , so that they understand at least something ?
1	and what are you painting ?
1	zametov had been sitting in the corner , but he rose at the visitors ' entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips , though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment
1	with my bearing you do not get far !
1	devil take it , is he spying on me , or what !
1	this was the cause of great uneasiness to dounia ; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son 's fate and was afraid to ask , for fear of hearing something still more awful
1	a man with such wishes is deserving of every respect for that alone
1	the proprieties were observed , and the sovereign showed the first example of it ; but everyone knew that the old man was at fault and good for nothing
1	in a strong and rather agreeable voice , cracked and coarsened by street singing , she sang in hope of getting a copper from the shop
1	what am i to do ?
1	oh , he did need me , that is , not me but the document !
1	he went into that room—the fourth in order ; it was a small room and packed full of people , rather better dressed than in the outer rooms
1	after the suffering he had endured , prince andrei felt a bliss such as he had not experienced for a long time
1	however unfathomable for us is the cause of the expression of will in any act of mine or others , the first demand of intelligence is the assumption of and search for a cause , without which no phenomenon is conceivable
1	i love you as a brother , and will love you always , and i need nothing more
1	i went into it like a wise man , and that was just my destruction
1	and so it turned out
1	in the hospitals death was such a certainty that soldiers sick with fever and bloated from bad food preferred to go on serving , forcing themselves to drag their feet to the front rather than go to the hospital
1	akhmakov is extremely afraid of
1	after that he wanted to get his freedom
1	she knew him , she knew that on her return after a useless journey , she could argue all she liked about prison , she could make as much as she liked of sufferings endured , the cardinal would respond with that mocking calm of the skeptic who is powerful in both strength and genius : you should not have let yourself be caught !
1	further away , beyond the yard , frogs were croaking and a nightingale sang
1	having listened to this decision , akaky akakievich plodded sadly to his room , and how he spent the night we will leave to the judgment of those capable of entering at least somewhat into another man 's predicament
1	thanks to the sale of his horse , he was beginning his career with four ecus more than m de tréville had begun his with
1	for two or three moments they stood facing each other ; finally something mocking barely showed in her face ; she smiled slightly and walked past him
1	let her strike me , it relieves her heart it 's better so
1	we wo not hold out !
1	the prince , on behalf of his pupil
1	lev nikolaevich , aglaya ivanovna has just given me a little word for you in secret
1	i asked in perplexity
1	almost an hour went by , the tea was finished , and after tea the guests finally felt ashamed to stay longer
1	prince andrei obviously felt awkward ; but for the two women it seemed natural to weep ; it seemed it had never occurred to them that their meeting could be otherwise
1	kolya , all worked up , red-faced , in agitation , went on reading in an agitated voice :
1	and therefore i request that the said gentleman , ivan , son of nikifor , dovgochkhun , being guilty of arson , of insult to my rank , name , and family , and of the thievish appropriation of property , and above all of the base and reprehensible appending to my family name of the appellation goose , have a penalty imposed on him , with payment of expenses and losses , and be condemned himself as a trespasser , put in chains , and taken to jail , which decision with respect to my petition should be handed down at once and without fail
1	on top of that came four hundred roubles—when would he ever save up so much !
1	only the pre-eternal god can decide the fate of the fatherland , papa , said berg
1	besides that , for some reason it seemed to them that their little sister , aglaya ivanovna , might know more about this affair than the three of them , including the mother
1	let 's drop it , said versilov , looking at me strangely ( precisely as one looks at an uncomprehending and unsuspecting man )
1	it seemed to milady , in one of those furtive glances that she cast at the peephole , that she glimpsed the young man 's burning eyes through the tight grating ; but whether this was a reality or a vision , this time he had enough control over himself not to come in
1	he knew that all the words napoleon was now saying meant nothing , that he would be ashamed of them himself once he came to his senses
1	he was almost weeping
1	such is my will
1	there was an abundance of riches and no end of them in sight ; everywhere around the area occupied by the french , there were other areas , unknown and unoccupied , in which , as it seemed to the french , there were still greater riches
1	on going into his hôtel , m de tréville reflected that he ought to steal a march by making the first complaint
1	you have sucked enough of our blood , you herods , a plague upon you !
1	said natasha , turning her head and putting both hands to her hair , which the maid who was holding it did not have time to let go of
1	after performing this test , the physician shook his head and said : no , impossible
1	what do you mean 'so young ' ?
1	velchaninov was forced to jump down ; other vehicles and people pushed him farther back
1	it 's a brutal state to be in !
1	and what the devil do i care about his look ?
1	it 's not true , it 's not true he 's lying i want natasha !
1	the same people , in almost the same positions , were sitting in the anteroom , exchanging whispers
1	but before he finished the verses , the loud-voiced butler announced : dinner is served !
1	you have cross-examined my landlady , i will be bound well , that 's enough !
1	i humbly ask you to give her my greetings , and to remind alexandra mikhailovna … in short , convey to her my heartfelt wish for that which she herself wished for on thursday , in the evening , to the strains of chopin ’ s ballade ; she ’ ll remember … my heartfelt wish !
1	athos followed the road for a while , his eyes fixed on the ground ; slight stains of blood , which came from a wound inflicted either on the man who accompanied the carriage or on one of the horses , marked out the way
1	the sovereign was not dancing ; he stood in the doorway and stopped now one couple , now another , with gracious words that he alone knew how to utter
1	i wo not come in , i have not time , he hastened to say when the door was opened
1	if you say a single word to anyone at all before getting on the ship , my sergeant will blow your brains out—he has orders to do so
1	aglaya replied with haughty indignation
1	out of reverent respect for me , he took me there , believing in the nobility of my feelings—
1	natasha smiled through her tears
1	this is our zemstvo agent then he imagined lesnitsky and the beadle loshadin walking over the snow in the fields , side by side , holding each other up ; the blizzard whirled above them , the wind blew in their backs , and they walked on and sang :
1	prince andrei was one of the best dancers of his time
1	i swear i will shoot again
1	if you want so much to have such shoes , it 's not hard to do
1	les allemands sont de fieres bêtes
1	but why are you so pale , rodion romanovitch ?
1	pavel pavlovich repeated in a tenderly slack voice
1	what is this bobok ?
1	god alone can see and judge my feelings for him , and i do not allow society to judge me for the step i have taken !
1	what sort of melons are they ?
1	go , he said in a low voice , find rochefort for me
1	konstantin mochulsky comments on the shift in emphasis from dostoevsky 's previous novel : as in demons , the action is concentrated around the hero , but the personality of versilov is revealed differently than the personality of stavrogin
1	have you seen him , aunt ?
1	you should have seen the change these words produced in the strange moneylender
1	towards evening this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily
1	then suddenly you start reading a whole lecture about all this darkness and the seventy-five thousand
1	the walking men kept the wolves from coming near , so that gray could eat as much as he liked
1	did you receive my hedgehog ?
1	if the porter had asked him , what do you want ?
1	and the weekly review ceased to exist , so that 's why it was not printed at the time
1	he quite calmly walked over me , and i bounced aside like a ball
1	and avdotya romanovna ca not possibly be left in those lodgings without you
1	i will still get them carried away !
1	then for a long time he lived somewhere in the south
1	i knew one eternally laboring man , though not from the people ; he was a rather developed man and able to generalize
1	in our monastery nobody 's interested in them
1	and this simpleheartedness was attractive
1	cried aramis , you are killing me !
1	but as such cries , given their frequency , attracted no one in the rue des fossoyeurs , and , besides that , the mercer 's house had been rather ill-famed for some time , bonacieux , seeing that no one came , went out himself , still shouting , and his voice could be heard moving off in the direction of the rue du bac
1	there must be something wrong here , you have been ringing and pulling at the door and still they do not open !
1	the general had a flourishing family
1	maybe i did take your cross , but i won ’ t kill you for your watch !
1	but although he had almost always been by himself of late , he had never been able to feel alone
1	no , you can ’ t smoke here , and moreover you should be ashamed of having such thoughts
1	in another lane , a sentry standing by a green box called out to him , and only after the repetition of the threatening cry and the sound of the sentry cocking his musket did pierre understand that he should go over to the other side of the street
1	or throw up life altogether !
1	the old woman lay silent all the while with her eyes closed
1	the crowd round them was laughing too and indeed , how could they help laughing ?
1	zametov , left alone , sat for a long time in the same place , plunged in thought
1	arouse the fire of virtue in all hearts
1	the fact is that , in those unfortunate times , one tried hard to surround oneself with men of tréville 's temper
1	i will follow you !
1	but in bringing her into my house , i thought i was bringing a friend , and i needed a friend so very much
1	extreme sadness , the most sincere , the fullest , was expressed in his features
1	to deliver a letter , a petition to his majesty , nikolai said in a trembling voice
1	a carriage that was driving behind the convoy pulled up close to a convoy wagon and punched its shaft through it
1	it was an ordinary summons from the district police‐station to appear that day at half‐past nine at the office of the district superintendent
1	but it was obvious that his thoughts were wandering god knows where , otherwise he would have heard choub hiss when his hair got caught by the rope that tied the sack and the stalwart headman begin to hiccup quite audibly
1	nikolai gave his horses free rein ; zakhar , stretching his arms forward , clucked his tongue and let his own go
1	her kind , weepy face expressed only anxiety and fear
1	so many beautiful children came to us
1	in a suffering , weary voice he was saying something to tikhon
1	he was killed almost in my presence
1	since that same morning when we saw each other last , i have taken a step that not every person can understand and grasp as one with your as-yet-uncontaminated mind , with your loving , unspoiled , fresh heart would understand it
1	but , nevertheless , he by no means believed it was as simple as that ; he had a vague and fearful presentiment of something
1	you ’ re mistaken , general , he said
1	varya flared up , looking contemptuously at her brother
1	what it was that i wanted to tell you then—i have forgotten , of course , and did not know then , but i had a burning desire to see you as soon as possible
1	who wants to go and see him off in such weather !
1	aglaya ivanovna blushed and , believe it or not , was even a bit at a loss , either because i was there , or simply seeing gavrila ardalionovich , because he ’ s so good-looking , but she just blushed all over and ended the business in a second , very amusingly : she stood up , responded to gavrila ardalionovich ’ s bow and to the ingratiating smile of varvara ardalionovna , and suddenly snapped : i ’ ve invited you only in order to express my personal pleasure at your sincere and friendly feelings , and if i ever have need of them , believe me … ’ here she made her bows , and the two of them left—feeling like fools , or else triumphant , i don ’ t know ; ganechka , of course , felt like a fool ; he didn ’ t understand anything and turned red as a lobster ( he sometimes has an extraordinary expression !
1	as he was finishing , the host came back with the requested bottles and a ham which , fortunately for him , had not gone to the cellar
1	and meanwhile his left arm was as heavy as though a twenty-pound weight was hanging from it
1	can you really think i am ashamed of it all , or that it 's all any stupider than whatever there may have been , gentlemen , in your own lives ?
1	keep the lieutenancy , my dear , keep it
1	marmeladov broke off , tried to smile , but suddenly his chin began to twitch
1	she listened to the sound of their voices through the door
1	for god 's sake , captivity again and horsemeat !
1	my god , how he had tormented her !
1	but where can such a lackey be found ?
1	i looked away indifferently
1	other muzhiks , hearing of their comrades ' failure , came to the city with wheat , oats , hay , and beat each other down to prices lower than before
1	the princess let go
1	he was suddenly changed
1	they will be in the street , all of them , she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall , as she did to‐day , and the children will cry
1	no , i consider it empty ritualism
1	it is in just such stupid things clever people are most easily caught
1	and what are we doing now ?
1	svidrigaïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it
1	the dust , the stuffiness , the white nights of petersburg , which chafed his nerves—this was what he enjoyed in petersburg
1	they made a custom of entering their master 's forests as if they were their own ; they built a lot of sleds and sold them at the local fair ; besides that , they sold all the big oak trees to the neighboring cossacks to be cut down for their mills
1	but spring was coming , it was already the middle of april , the storm windows had been taken down , and bright sheaves of sunlight began to light up our silent rooms
1	everything is deception , everything is a dream , everything is not what it seems to be !
1	loud voices rang out ahead
1	i have got the letter , he said to athos and his friends
1	you surely would not be willing actually to betray your brother ?
1	i was just waiting for her to say that—oh , the truthful one , oh , the sincere one , oh , the honest one !
1	i married this woman when she was a young girl ; i the three musketeers married her in spite of all my family ; i gave her my property , i gave her my name ; and one day i discovered that this woman was branded : this woman was marked with a fleur-de-lis on her left shoulder
1	that 's what betrays him !
1	before half a year went by , i received a highly poetical and rapturous letter , beginning with the words : i am in love
1	all sympathy between us is extinguished
1	indeed , as we have said , the whole camp was stirred up
1	the entire market was completely bought up for this dinner , so that the judge and his deaconess had to eat buckwheat pancakes and cornstarch custard
1	i … i ’ ve come to you … for a human talk
1	alpatych , gliding along , all but running , followed behind rostov , barely keeping up with him
1	zametov will make a scandal in the french style in a house of bad reputation , over a glass of champagne
1	why , yes , arkashenka , yes !
1	je suis gentilhomme avant part three tout et je mourrai gentilhomme !
1	he murmured to himself , almost unaware of his words
1	she lay dead in the same position in which he had seen her five minutes before , and , despite her still eyes and pale cheeks , there was the same expression on that lovely , timid , childish face , with its lip covered with fine black hair
1	on the contrary : if your man is mine , i will have two vengeances at one stroke , that 's all
1	ah , why do such people as you have children ?
1	anya 's eyes still glistened with tears , but she was no longer thinking about her mother , or money , or her wedding , but was shaking hands with some high-school students and officers she knew , laughing merrily and saying quickly :
1	planchet , quite dumbfounded , was in the process of currying them and had already finished two
1	dostoevsky 's devastating attack on the nihilists in demons ( - ) had turned most of the radical intelligentsia against him
1	i could sit it out when they called me a spy and an idiot ; and the further they went in their conversation , the less possible it seemed for me to appear
1	when the prince observed to him that earlier as well it had been the same almost every day , kolya decidedly did not know what to answer to that and how to explain precisely what caused his present anxiety
1	what are you losing your mind for ?
1	how much did you pay per yard ?
1	a sort of sinister feeling finally passed over nastasya filippovna ’ s face ; her gaze was becoming stubborn , firm , and almost hateful , not tearing itself from her guest for a single moment
1	the same is true for moral illnesses
1	for him , milady was no longer that woman of fatal intentions who had frightened him momentarily , she was an ardent and passionate mistress abandoning herself entirely to a love that she herself seemed to feel
1	hit her in the face , in the eyes , in the eyes , cried mikolka
1	the one who bit off the assessor 's ear ?
1	and i loved you , sir , all that year in t—
1	wait , let 's get out and then follow in his tracks
1	besides , it was his definite intention to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies , but without weakness , fearing that the result of the duel would be what is always the most regrettable result in an affair of this kind , when a young and vigorous man fights against a wounded and weakened adversary : vanquished , he doubles the triumph of his antagonist ; victorious , he is accused of treachery and easy audacity
1	lviii : escape i have no time to waste : tomorrow is the twenty-third , and buckingham is leaving tomorrow with the fleet
1	it won ’ t take long to snatch it out !
1	what does 'have not distinguished yourself mean ?
1	napoleon , standing on the barrow , looked through a field glass , and through the small circle of the field glass he saw smoke and people , sometimes his own , sometimes russians , but when he looked again with the naked eye , he could not tell where what he had seen was
1	he was deaf and did not hear prince andrei ride up
1	you should not , dounia i am happy now—simply in seeing you , rodya hush , mother , he muttered in confusion , not looking at her , but pressing her hand
1	it was affirmed ( andronikov is said to have heard it from katerina nikolaevna herself ) that , on the contrary , versilov , still earlier , before the beginning of the young girl 's feelings , had offered katerina nikolaevna his love ; that she , being his friend , and even in exaltation over him for some time , though constantly disbelieving and contradicting him , met this declaration of versilov 's with extreme hatred and mocked him venomously
1	you are a beast , not a man !
1	well , sirs , i am that very same hunchback !
1	and i smiled because because when you guess something , you always smile it was even strange
1	cried the young queen , feigning surprise
1	perhaps it 's the last time i shall speak to you
1	to forestall the french with his entire army was impossible
1	but how can you go in such a state ?
1	the three musketeers so you really love my mistress , monsieur le chevalier ?
1	he would whistle : 'here , robber !
1	and their attitude towards people was the same
1	yes , milord , i accept , said d'artagnan , and if it please god , we will make good use of your presents
1	finally , the latest episode in poland , still fresh in the captain 's memory , which he recounted with quick gestures and a flushed face , consisted in the fact that he had saved the life of a pole ( in general , episodes of saving lives occurred constantly in the captain 's stories ) and the pole had entrusted his enchanting wife to him ( parisienne de coeur [ ] ) , while he himself entered into the service of the french
1	madame , he said in an altered voice , you will receive a visit from m le chancelier , who will communicate to you certain matters which i have entrusted to him
1	said nikolai , once more searching into the expression of his sister 's face to find out if it was true , and , his boots creaking , he jumped off the fender and ran to his sleigh
1	this encouraged the deputy
1	well , off you go , off you go
1	there is no one—no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you !
1	well , then , i am your humble servant , monsieur le baron , said d'artagnan , though your names are quite hard to remember
1	the king said , shaken , so that 's how things went ?
1	they suddenly started saying that i was waiting for you and that i loved you
1	he rolled his dead eyes in all directions and saw dead men rising from kiev , from the land of galicia , and from the carpathians , their faces as like his as two drops of water
1	he said , going out
1	raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor
1	shouts lambert , and the two of them guffaw still more , and my heart sinks : oh , can this shameless woman possibly be the same one at whose mere glance my heart boiled over with virtue ?
1	on the tenth of august , the column of which his regiment formed part drew level with bald hills
1	no , athos picked up with a singular smile , i gave it away during a night of love , as it was given to you
1	the prince is formally her fiancé , the matter ’ s settled
1	there was some other vaudeville with funny verses about lawyers , especially about some collegiate registrar , written quite freely , so that i wondered how it passed the censors , and they said outright that merchants cheat people and their sons are debauchers and try to worm their way into the nobility
1	moreover , the artist turns away from them , finding in them a necessary falsehood
1	[ ] he had picked up a shell splinter that had killed an adjutant standing next to the commander in chief and offered this splinter to his superior
1	no , i was sent the wine in your name
1	on receiving the news of natasha 's illness , the countess , though not quite recovered and still weak , went to moscow with petya and all the household , and the whole rostov family moved from marya dmitrievna 's to their own house and settled in moscow
1	you must hope for the best , and i am sure
1	by the way tell mr
1	an old woman , all bent over and dressed in black , a kerchief on her head , bowed silently and deeply to rogozhin
1	he had overslept himself !
1	i came into this very room
1	lord , how well made !
1	the old servant on my floor comes to ask whether i have bed linen
1	in deathly anguish he waited for the answer
1	he had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation
1	said the count , and the moment he said it , he saw coming around the corner of the house , between two dragoons , a young man with a long , thin neck , half of his head shaved and covered with new stubble
1	how is it you do not understand , finally , catiche ?
1	take a wing , ivan fyodorovich , the other one , with the gizzard !
1	but i maintain that he is not cunning , not practised , and probably this was his first crime !
1	you can reckon on my word
1	the question is this : russia 's salvation lies in the army
1	we ca not go through the hollow—it 's swampy , said the esaul
1	not there , but the room next to it
1	polenka came in holding kolya and lida , who were trembling and weeping
1	i did not want to lie about it even to myself
1	what is the meaning of it ?
1	but sometimes she was unexpectedly overcome not only by the fear of death , but by the fear of illness , weakness , the loss of beauty , and involuntarily she sometimes studied her bare arm , amazed at its thinness , or in the morning contemplated in the mirror her drawn and , as it seemed to her , pathetic face
1	porthos and aramis were trembling with rage
1	ieronym recovered himself and rushed to the cable
1	dymov , in his shirtsleeves , his waistcoat unbuttoned , was sitting at the table and sharpening his knife on his fork ; on a plate in front of him lay a grouse
1	excuse me , said d'artagnan , reappearing from under the giant 's shoulder , but i am in a great hurry , i am running after someone , and and do you forget your eyes when you run , by any chance ?
1	she ’ s afraid to ruin and disgrace you , but me she can marry , meaning it doesn ’ t matter—that ’ s how she considers me , note that as well !
1	if the government offices were evacuated , it was done only on the demand of the officials , with whom the count agreed reluctantly
1	our own stupidity , yakov alpatych , voices responded , and the crowd immediately began to break up and scatter through the village
1	withal not forgetting , out of long habit , to steal an old boot sole that was lying on a bench
1	to stifle his petty feelings , he hastened to reflect that he himself , and khobotov , and mikhail averyanych , must die sooner or later , without leaving even a trace on nature
1	why do you ask ?
1	the floors were strewn with freshly‐cut fragrant hay , the windows were open , a fresh , cool , light air came into the room
1	for it ’ s actually so , we are ridiculous , light-minded , with bad habits , we ’ re bored , we don ’ t know how to look , how to understand , we ’ re all like that , all , you , and i , and they !
1	the fat colonel‐major ( he was really a discharged officer of low rank ) was also absent , but it appeared that he had been not himself for the last two days
1	yours , alexandra ivanovna , is also a beautiful and very sweet face , but you may have some secret sorrow ; your soul is no doubt very kind , but you are not joyful
1	there must be something to it
1	a moment later , the three young men separated , arranging a rendezvous for four o'clock at athos 's and leaving planchet to guard the house
1	she rushed to the furthest corner , where she made haste to barricade herself with a little table
1	something inconceivable , something terrible is happening in our home
1	i have written this down now without being ashamed , because maybe it was all good , despite all its absurdity
1	i thought the prince would keep it to himself and not tell
1	they didn ’ t agree … i kissed marie two weeks before her mother died ; when the pastor gave his sermon , all the children were already on my side
1	raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands , without opening it
1	what were we talking about at dinner ?
1	a dressing room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur
1	he shouted , that 's true , he shouted three times , another voice declared
1	only when people were killed or wounded , he winced and , turning away from the dead man , shouted angrily at his crew , who , as always , were slow to pick up a wounded man or a body
1	yet i still kept going to see him ; i could hardly not go , however , having been drawn into all that
1	who knows , maybe in his sorrow he will make up his mind to fall in love with another girl and out of vexation call her the first beauty of the village ?
1	but his laughter was quickly followed by despair
1	the sergeant major 's come for money
1	he never could have loved a healthy , strong , red-cheeked woman , but pale , weak , unhappy tanya he liked very much
1	and now he felt no fear , he felt nothing
1	and turning on his heel , he was about to go back into the inn through the main gate , under which d'artagnan , on his arrival , had noticed an already saddled horse
1	the thaw was still going on ; a dismal , warm , noxious wind whistled along the streets , carriages splashed through the mud , iron-shod trotters and nags struck the pavement ringingly
1	in short , i do not know precisely what exactly , but do not you know something ?
1	a normal man , it is true , hardly exists
1	i say that i am of porthos 's opinion , replied aramis
1	he turned and went out , and never came again
1	that 's enough , papa
1	tell me , what answer should i give this purebred scoundrel when he asks , 'why should i necessarily be noble ?
1	to his question— would i let sofya semyonovna sit down beside my sister , i answered that i had already done so that day
1	on glimpsing her brother-in-law , she uttered a terrible cry
1	i returned home , and when i announced that i would been taken back into the service and should receive a salary , heavens , what a to‐do there was !
1	but what do you say to this argument ( help me with it ) : ghosts are , as it were , shreds and fragments of other worlds , the beginning of them
1	and her deaf husband , who understood nothing , did not look at her ; he sat with his legs crossed eating nuts , and cracked them so loudly that it was as if he were firing a pistol
1	and he looked at his blushing daughter
1	said dolokhov , and he picked up the cards with a smile
1	two conclusions follow directly from this : first , persistence in accumulating , even by kopecks , produces enormous results later on ( time means nothing here ) ; and , second , that the most unsophisticated but continuous form of gain mathematically assures success
1	such a beginning was no good omen for the end
1	he opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what vengeful purpose he had come , but she added : poor angel , that monster of a gascon nearly killed you !
1	then i don ’ t want to know you !
1	but for our hero this visit contained in itself something even capital
1	your mother is an angelic soul , do you hear , kolya , an angelic soul !
1	he got up and went to sonia
1	i have nothing to do with captain eropegov , don ’ t you agree ?
1	we wo not get up , mother !
1	for a whole month you were silent , making ready , and suddenly—nothing !
1	and he smiled approvingly , obviously glad for the junker
1	-the sun had set long ago
1	dawn was breaking ; the outlines of the barge , the osier bushes in the rippling water , could be seen clearly , and , looking back , there was the clay cliffside , the hut roofed with brown straw below , and a cluster of village cottages above
1	she would begin to say something softly to her from the other end of the room
1	at a single glance , the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details
1	the cold water refreshed him , he dried himself off , and , without saying a word , not even thanking his sister of mercy , seized his hat , took on his shoulders the fur coat held for him by mrs pseldonymov , and through the corridor , through the kitchen , where the cat was already miaowing and the cook , raising herself on her pallet , gazed after him with greedy curiosity , ran out to the courtyard , to the street , and rushed for a passing cab
1	no , i wasn ’ t laughing at you , i only meant to praise you … kolya told me that the prince called you a child … that ’ s good … so , what was i … there was something else i wanted …
1	what 's that nonsense you asked about the fire brigade ?
1	look how he treats the ladies !
1	devil take it , there 's something strange in it
1	let me , pelageya danilovna , i will go , said sonya
1	it seems to me , afanasy ivanovich would say , that this kasha is a wee bit burnt—do not you think so , pulkheria ivanovna ?
1	he said , with the feeling of a russian for whom things are going badly
1	pavel pavlovich exclaimed vexedly , but the young man at once checked him
1	you will answer for it , cried berg , who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the left flank of the infantry of the first army— a quite agreeable and visible post , as berg put it
1	yes , i ’ m unwell , the prince replied distractedly and even impatiently
1	athos alone smiled a strong and scornful smile
1	what can i do with the people ?
1	the viscount said that the duc d'enghien [ ] had perished from his own magnanimity and that there were special reasons for bonaparte 's viciousness
1	he raised himself and sat up
1	never yet had napoleon or any of his generals seen such horror , so many men killed on such a small space
1	the only entertainment for a poor man at the petersburg feast !
1	one lady , who got out of a second-class car and was remarkably pretty , but somehow too magnificently dressed for a traveler , almost dragged with her , in both hands , an uhlan , a very young and handsome little officer , who was trying to tear free of her grip
1	the prince cries : she ’ s yours !
1	i do not know my mother , either
1	that night he woke up before morning among some bushes in krestovsky island , trembling all over with fever ; he walked home , and it was early morning when he arrived
1	he was a young man with a beard , wearing a full , short‐waisted coat , and looked like a messenger
1	but for you and me , brother , it 's time to drop these niceties , dolokhov went on , as if he found a special pleasure in talking about this subject , which irritated denisov
1	vera asked her father impatiently
1	the wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out , his eyes contracted , his features broadened and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh , shaking all over and looking raskolnikov straight in the face
1	you do not think , sister , that i was simply afraid of the water ?
1	the imperial adjutant wolzogen , the same one who , riding past prince andrei , had said that war should be im raum verlegen , and whom bagration hated so much , rode up to kutuzov during dinner
1	he did not lift his arms to embrace them , he could not
1	sergei sergeich also sits rubbing his little hands and occasionally mixes in
1	raskolnikov did not sit down , but he felt unwilling to leave her , and stood facing her in perplexity
1	it is a delight then for the hot sun to look down from on high and plunge its rays into the chill of the glassy waters and for the coastal forests to be brightly reflected in them
1	and maybe they are both cheats ?
1	you are old , too , we will soon see each other in the next world
1	my mother added , noticing something like a smile on tatyana pavlovna 's face
1	however , as i handed her the two roubles , i could not help myself and said as if with a certain irritation : i am doing it only for you , moser would not take such a thing from you
1	they joined forces against him and hanged him from a tree
1	he kissed her hand and addressed her as miss sonya
1	do you know who i have met here ?
1	bazin was stationed in the corridor and barred his way with all the more intrepidity in that , after many years of trial , he saw himself at last about to reach the result he had eternally striven for
1	( and she herself told me once in moscow : you ought to edify yourself at least somehow , at least read solovyov ’ s russian history , you don ’ t know anything at all )
1	it makes me miserable
1	think what you are saying
1	i ca not live like this any longer !
1	gurov cut himself a slice and unhurriedly began to eat it
1	thought rostov , still sensing that smell of dead flesh he had picked up in the soldiers ' section , and still seeing around him those envious looks that had followed after him on both sides and the face of the young soldier with rolled-up eyes
1	of how he gives the madmen haircuts , and how nikita helps him to do it , and what commotion among the patients each appearance of the drunken , grinning barber causes , we will not speak
1	such a woman can be found : the duke is a ladies ' man , and if he has sown much love by his promises of eternal constancy , he must also have sown much hatred by his eternal infidelity
1	marfa petrovna is pleased to visit me , he said , twisting his mouth into a strange smile
1	and it seems to master danilo ( here he began feeling his mustache to see if he was asleep ) that it is no longer the sky but his own bedroom that he sees : his tartar and turkish sabers hang on the walls ; around the walls are shelves , and on the shelves dishes and household utensils ; on the table , bread and salt ; a cradle hanging
1	pulcheria alexandrovna was emotional , but not sentimental , timid and yielding , but only to a certain point
1	pardon me for the trouble , officer , i would reward you , too , for your labors , but you are all on such a noble footing now my dear , he turned to me , there 's an eatery here , in fact a terrible cesspool , but one can have tea there , and i would suggest to you here it is now , come on
1	dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview , that her brother would not be alone
1	and when he had sunk down on the american leather sofa , which was in even worse condition than his own , razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill
1	listen to me , rather than contributing to my destruction , rather than contributing to my ignominy
1	she still did not give any reply to his main questions : she was stubbornly silent about everything concerning her former relations with her father
1	do i want it myself ?
1	you have such fine handwriting accessories , and so many pencils , pens , such fine , thick paper … and it ’ s such a fine office you have !
1	on days of battle , soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment , listen intently , look about , and greedily inquire into what is going on around them
1	princess marya did not understand what he wanted from her and what he was asking to be released from
1	that 's annoying , though , chartkov thought to himself
1	he cried in a rage
1	yes , said athos , let 's give the purse , not to our lackeys , but to the englishmen 's
1	but i may be mistaken ; that may only be the part he assumes
1	and now everything scattered at their first meeting and with their first words
1	i only know that the real will is in his desk , and this is a forgotten document she tried to go around anna mikhailovna , but anna mikhailovna sprang over and again barred her way
1	the phrase viva , andrei petrovich !
1	what steeds , if you knew , katerina , what steeds we drove away with us !
1	yes , seriously , i have
1	it was either that i could not hear her breathing in bed , or perhaps i made out in the darkness that her bed was empty— only i suddenly got up and felt with my hand : there was no one in the bed , and the pillow was cold
1	my lodging , he answered , listlessly
1	yes , that meek face was becoming bolder and bolder
1	andrey semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes with indifference and even contempt
1	and the family parted on the most friendly terms
1	blessed is the chosen one who possesses it
1	in the doorway i was almost knocked off my feet by lukerya , who ran swiftly from makar ivanovich 's room to the kitchen
1	after which , naturally convinced that the lady was at home , i went in and , finding no one , began to wait , supposing that tatyana pavlovna would presently come out of the bedroom ; otherwise why would the cook have let me in ?
1	the prince was terribly glad to see him and at once spoke about the epanchins ; such a simple-hearted and direct opening completely unbound evgeny pavlovich as well , so that without preliminaries he , too , went straight to the point
1	she is mistrustful had i better wait a little longer till my heart leaves off thumping ?
1	maybe we were already flying through those spaces
1	you must go to bed at once , he pronounced , examining the patient as far as he could , and take something for the night
1	ah , how nice of you to come , we are so bored here otherwise , another girlfriend said to him amiably , one he had not yet noticed at all , and who appeared from god knows where , a little redhead with freckles , her face flushed in a terribly funny way from walking and the heat
1	and what a drama must have taken place between them then and from what ?
1	the general suddenly said with feeling and warmth , i … and even lizaveta prokofyevna herself ( who , incidentally , began railing at you again , and at me along with you and on account of you , only i don ’ t understand what for ) , we love you all the same , sincerely love you and respect you , even in spite of everything , that is , all appearances
1	come , mamma , come out of the room at least for a minute , dounia whispered in dismay ; we are distressing him , that 's evident
1	but around one-thirty an event took place which no pen can describe
1	i began on that pyramid while still under my child 's blanket , when , as i was falling asleep , i would weep and dream— about what ? —i myself do not know
1	in this farmstead a man often appeared , or , better , a devil in human form
1	i found out that it ’ s all true
1	our two doves were grief-stricken ; and then a rumor spread through the village that some polack had taken to calling on korzh , all trimmed in gold , with a moustache , with a saber , with spurs , with pockets that jingled like the little bell on the bag our sacristan taras goes around the church with every day
1	the prince glanced fleetingly at it , as if recalling something , not stopping , however , wanting to go on through the door
1	there were several moments of silence
1	at some other time , it would be my pleasure , he mumbled , but now
1	everyone fell silent and waited for what he would say
1	and the airy beauty trembled
1	yes , what was it my sister told me about this baby ?
1	on the little table by the head of the bed , the taken-off and scattered diamonds sparkled
1	but the presence of this woman did not keep milady from reflecting
1	the opening night was on february n ,
1	keep on your guard at all times and before all else
1	i am sitting all alone in a strange town , on a strange bed , rubbing my aching cheek with my palm
1	she saw the objects around her and was aware of all that went on around her , but she was unable to form an opinion about anything and did not know what to talk about
1	they all fell silent
1	and it is here , in this void , that chekhov begins seeking new paths
1	dans cette réunion de grands souverains , nous eussions traités de nos intérêts en famille et compté de clerc à maître avec les peuples
1	the doctor and the coroner , followed by the beadle holding the lamp above his head , went into the clean room
1	he said to his daughter
1	the two valets quickly dressed his majesty , and he , in the dark blue uniform of the guards , with firm , quick steps , went out to the reception room
1	and it 's enough that i have come here ill with fever
1	oh , the vileness , oh , the stupidity , oh , the narrowness of these 'rotten , sentimental souls ' !
1	yes , in uniform , but thanks to ah , stebelkov , so you are here ?
1	every decent man of our time is and must be a coward and a slave
1	cried aramis , throwing his calotte in his face
1	my father , whom i told of my plans , made it an absolute condition for his consent that the marriage not take place for a year
1	ivan ivanovich saw the woman already setting her foot on the wattle fence , intending to climb into his yard , when ivan nikiforovich 's voice suddenly rang out : come back !
1	take him straight to the police station , the man in the long coat jerked in abruptly
1	yes , we shall still have happy days !
1	but maybe i just imagined it that way : it 's impossible for a nose to vanish so idiotically , he thought and went into a pastry shop on purpose to look at himself in the mirror
1	all the main things had become clear to me , in spite of this unworthy tangle ; everything i was afraid of—had been confirmed
1	look at what people are saying
1	that innocent blockhead never does see anything !
1	the princess blushed and waved her hands desperately
1	she was wearing a different dress
1	in my opinion , this is in fact called life
1	no , i do not want to trust myself to anyone
1	he whispered , and , taking a glass in his hand , he arose
1	what are you to be pitied for ?
1	and i do apo-lo-gize , my dear and andrei makarovich , the young man began to maunder , approaching me with an extraordinarily casual air and taking hold of my hand , which i was unable to withdraw
1	he responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that
1	have you ever been to nastasya filippovna ’ s ?
1	once again , colonel , the general said , i can not in any case leave half my men in the woods
1	that horrid , military , pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future
1	said balaga , also drinking his glass and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief
1	and this baby in her arms is an orphan , her sister , my daughter lyubov , born in most lawful wedlock of the newly departed elena , my wife , who died six weeks ago in childbed , as it pleased the lord … yes , sir … in place of a mother , though she ’ s only a sister and no more than a sister … no more , no more …
1	natasha had rarely experienced such a joyful feeling as she experienced now , sitting in the carriage next tp the countess and gazing at the walls slowly moving past her of alarmed , abandoned moscow
1	the whole following story about this wedding was told by knowledgeable people in the following way and seems to be correct :
1	so ve old hussars see it , anyvay
1	zossimov has gone , so you must
1	i ran away in a fright , and , besides , the bell rang
1	does it make any difference how the note is worded , count , he said , if the content is strong ?
1	gretchen wants to pray , but only cries burst from her breast—you know , when your breast is contracted with tears—but satan 's song does not stop , ever more deeply it pierces the soul , like a sharp point , ever higher— and suddenly it breaks off almost with a shout : 'it 's all over , you are cursed !
1	we have both reached the limit , and before god 's judgment we are equal in our trespasses
1	to her heart i confided much of what has since been so hideously realised
1	but her family thought the match unequal
1	but i ’ ve gone on too long
1	the guards , under the command of m des essarts , took quarters with the minimes
1	death , which will end everything and which must come today or tomorrow—in a moment , anyhow , compared with eternity
1	i am very sorry for it , my dear sir
1	now that these facts have been made known , it must be clear to everyone that mr burdovsky is a pure man , despite all appearances , and now the prince can , the sooner and all the more willingly than before , offer him both his friendly assistance and the active help which he mentioned earlier , speaking about schools and pavlishchev
1	my father died while he was on trial , the prince observed again , though i could never find out precisely for what
1	i am drowning , i run to you asking for help , and you say to me : drown , that 's how it should be
1	and do you really repent ?
1	the artist observes , selects , guesses and synthesizes
1	for every trifle he ran to katerina ivanovna , even hunting her out at the bazaar , at every instant called her pani
1	prince vassily knew that and , having once realized that if he were to solicit for everyone who solicited from him , it would soon become impossible for him to solicit for himself , he rarely used his influence
1	the prince had to turn towards liteinaya street
1	dounia , goodness knows whether he will come !
1	when we get to paris , we will still have a good four hundred , said porthos , plus the harnesses
1	why are you going ?
1	never thought of it !
1	you can see for yourself it is
1	leave me , leave me alone !
1	is there anything in it that remotely resembles an event ?
1	what a show the new french ambassador made of himself !
1	and my appearance was all too unseemly
1	i ’ m here under special dispensation
1	then comes that mysterious time when lamps endow everything with some enticing , wondrous light
1	they tried to keep from crying , but many failed and cried loudly , especially the girls
1	( she read loudly , cold and trembling with ecstasy , as though she were seeing it before her eyes )
1	i go down on my knees to you , and i will pray to god eternally for you , take me away from here or i will die
1	and , smiling , he winked at me with his left eye
1	dolokhov said that cossacks were only a fear for stray ones like him and his comrade , but added questioningly that they probably did not dare to attack large detachments
1	you say to me
1	i am so glad you will be getting acquainted
1	you were not on duty today , it was zastupov hired you to replace him
1	i am not one of those tyrants who keep women by force
1	he added , passing his gaze over them all with a sort of defiance , and as if addressing them all indiscriminately
1	i can at least answer for myself …
1	gogol had a different understanding of the artist 's task and of his temptation
1	kutuzov had ordered himself taken around by the back streets to the other side of moscow
1	i agree that it 's a bold thought ( and therefore sweet )
1	pierre looked at the serious faces of the people around him , remembered all he had already gone through , and realized that he could not stop halfway
1	no matter , ilya petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly
1	yes , very interesting , said pierre
1	i like sometimes to descend for a moment into the realm of this remarkably solitary life , where not one desire flies over the paling that surrounds the small yard , over the wattle fence that encloses the garden filled with apple and plum trees , over the village cottages surrounding it , slumped to one side , in the shade of pussy willows , elders , and pear trees
1	well , good-bye , your excellency , be well , said rastopchin , getting up with his peculiarly quick movements and holding out his hand to the prince
1	he covered his face with his hands and fell to thinking
1	if they were all out , they would have locked the door from the outside with the key and not with the hook from inside
1	the prince cried fearfully , again seeing expressions of offended confusion in burdovsky , of agitation and protest in his friends
1	true , we do not know what that sinner of a grigorievich is going to say
1	i get up and we will go on !
1	at the widow 's , is not there ?
1	the basses droned in the stove again , and it suddenly became frightening
1	who told you those are my words ?
1	the devil , that 's the last straw , he muttered , grinding his teeth , no , that would not suit me just now
1	ivan dmitrich knew very well that they had come to reset the stove in the kitchen , but fear whispered to him that they were policemen disguised as stovemakers
1	very well , so be it , velchaninov again paused briefly , i apologize to you ; but you must agree , pavel pavlovich , that after all this i no longer reckon myself as owing to you , that is , i am speaking with regard to the whole matter , and not only the present case
1	kutuzov , with the affectation of a frontline veteran , ordered his standing troops to attention and , saluting , rode up to the emperor
1	i live there in that house , we are coming to it
1	but he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination range
1	ah , my god , but that i know !
1	i slapped myself on the head with my hand
1	and here i am thinking that i have not lagged behind your generation and understand contemporary youth
1	where is your tobacco ?
1	'you dare not sit together with noble children , you are of mean origin and the same as a lackey !
1	the mirror reflected an unattractive , weak body and a thin face
1	he had not meant to say that , he had meant to ask : how did you , the headman , get into this sack ?
1	she went up to him , and with a quick , supple , youthful movement dropped to her knees
1	that 's another slander , he yelled
1	who 's been pouring champagne into you just now ?
1	the sun , having just burst from behind the cloud that had covered it , sprayed its rays , half broken by the cloud , across the roofs of the street opposite , over the dew-covered dust of the road , over the walls of the houses , the windows , the fences , and pierre 's horses , which were standing by the cottage
1	the game was hide-and-seek
1	he was so sure that he was indeed the neapolitan king , that when , on the eve of his departure from naples , while strolling with his wife through the streets of the city , several italians had cried viva il re !
1	you did not imagine i would forgotten ?
1	the bright crescent shone in the sky
1	but now i recalled all the details of this meeting and in my mind said the most spiteful words and caustic replies to him
1	the french army melted away and was annihilated in the same proportion from moscow to vyazma , from vyazma to smolensk , from smolensk to the berezina , from the berezina to vilno , irrespective of the greater or lesser degree of the cold , the pursuit , the barring of roads , and all other conditions taken separately
1	do you want to ?
1	why has he taken such responsibility upon himself ?
1	no , it 's not enough , sir !
1	well , here 's the story
1	i don ’ t understand anything about it
1	why , i have three who will be highly honored to play the same game as myself
1	at first , at the very first , yes , i did have an urge , and i would fall into great restlessness
1	i do not care about him at all , i merely wanted to see the old lady , who was always kind to me and to whom i owe a great deal
1	at that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall
1	but the artist should not forget that the notion of historical figures and events formed among people is based not on fantasy , but on historical documents , insofar as historians have been able to amass them ; and therefore , while understanding and presenting these figures and events differently , the artist ought to be guided , like the historian , by historical materials
1	: , so that even at that moment i should have been thrown into perplexity , seeing such an unexpected turnabout in her feelings , which meant , perhaps , in lambert 's as well
1	you , your highness , are pleased to reproach me , but what if i prove it ?
1	mikhail ivanovich , sit down
1	both were watching each other , but when their eyes met , quick as lightning they looked away
1	on the way home i talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him all sorts of things and amongst them that you were afraid that he might become insane
1	the bad presentiment that suddenly came over rostov was confirmed more and more the further he rode into the space beyond the village of pratz , occupied by crowds of different troops
1	the prince ordered that nobody should be found here
1	look into it more carefully and understand it !
1	availing myself of the first opportunity , i make some quip
1	it 's nothing , tanya , nothing
1	the visitor was reciting as if by rote , but all the while he spoke , he looked at the ground , though , of course , he could see everything above as well
1	you did not listen to me when i taught you reason , so you can weep now
1	who is he blinking at , god be with him ?
1	but here , in this portrait , the sun , as if on purpose , found sonya in her main moment—of modest , meek love and her somewhat wild , timorous chastity
1	hunching his shoulders and spreading his fingers wide , korostelev played a few chords and began singing show me such a haven where the russian muzhik does not groan in a tenor voice , and dymov sighed again , propped his head on his fist , and fell to thinking
1	god rest her soul ! —though the dear departed was always unfair to me
1	nous cherchons—il n ' y en a point
1	oh , yes , i understand , said the governor 's wife
1	z on turning over the soil for a new garden , a third more on budding with
1	finally the horsemen rode down off the barrow and disappeared from sight
1	more than two hours went by
1	maybe i should not have spoken in front of them , but i am no diplomat
1	sonya and the maids were holding her by the arms
1	now , why need you have come ?
1	what business is it of yours what i mean to do ?
1	he was young , tall , swarthy , with enormous hands , and by the looks of him you could see he had a bass voice , and in fact he boomed like a barrel : boo , boo , boo
1	he called me a liar , and i called him a liar
1	but , rodya , nothing would induce me to leave you now !
1	and both so handsome !
1	a decent hunk of lard , a few white loaves , and sometimes even a trussed-up chicken would go in as well
1	the next day , at the first sound of the trumpets , the friends parted : the musketeers rushed to the hôtel of m de tréville , the guards to that of m des essarts
1	maybe if i used my strength against women , i might chance to find them still weaker than i , and so might defeat them ; but i am fighting against men , and for them i am merely a woman
1	but i should like to know why mother has written to me about 'our most rising generation ' ?
1	give him alms , bazin , and tell him to pray for a poor sinner
1	no , they wo not accept it , they certainly wo not , because they found the jewel‐case and the man tried to hang himself , 'which he could not have done if he had not felt guilty
1	the weaver asked as they went
1	he laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered , pondered a long time
1	but what am i to do ?
1	and there i go lending the poor fellow twenty-five roubles today , ha , ha , ha !
1	at last , all confused , beautiful , trembling and weeping , she throws herself at my feet and says that i am her savior , and that she loves me more than anything in the world
1	i cry out to myself : courage and hope !
1	that 's nonsense , that 's arch-nonsense !
1	finally he raised his head , fixed his eagle eye on that loyal , open , intelligent physiognomy , read on that tear-furrowed face all the sufferings he had endured over the past month , and reflected for the third or fourth time on how much future this boy of twenty-one had before him , and what resources his activity , courage , and spirit could offer to a good master
1	i wanted him out of the way so that i could drink by myself !
1	the woman was english ?
1	but an especial and obvious hatred shone from the collaborator on the firebrand : he sprawled so in his chair , had such a proud and presumptuous air , snorted so independently !
1	it 's here somewhere , said lavrushka
1	look at the smoke !
1	authorial commentary , if not entirely absent , is kept to an absolute minimum
1	do not be angry , i did not mean you pavel pavlovich muttered , dropping his eyes
1	she probably opened the letter not knowing whom it was from
1	terror brought me back to myself
1	but … i didn ’ t allow it … murmured the unhappy prince
1	the commander of artillery of the rd corps , general fouché , will place the howitzers of the rd and th corps , sixteen in all , on the flanks of the battery designated to bombard the left fortification , which will bring against it a total of guns
1	he forced him to take the glass
1	they peeked out on the sly three times or so , and then drew all the blinds
1	then she broke her silence to cry out : you are cowards , you are wretched assassins , it takes ten of you to cut one woman 's throat !
1	with that , his face assumed an imposing mien
1	we know what a castle is : it ’ s a whole mountain of stones
1	he took solid , squirely care of his soul , and did good deeds not simply but imposingly
1	m le cardinal 's guards , perceiving his extreme youth and , what 's more , that he was a stranger to the corps , invited him to withdraw before they attacked
1	it will all go on trifles
1	pseldonymov would not hear of it
1	vi : his majesty king louis the thirteenth your majesty gives me his word that he will see no one between m de la trémouille and myself ?
1	what is it you ’ ve got there , ippolit ?
1	the doctor remained very displeased with something , changed something , turning the wounded man over so that he moaned again and , while he was being turned , again fainted from the pain and began to rave
1	and even if it were possible , what other feeling than vénération can a man like mon père evoke ?
1	the cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention ; when he came to the end , he read it a second time
1	yes , and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness
1	the captain of the king 's musketeers ?
1	they ran to the barn and came back , each by a separate porch
1	wait a bit , the new ones will speak
1	and , lowering his fat arm , he offered it to the slender girl
1	what are you waiting for ?
1	well , then , if you do not leave this very instant , i will have you arrested by order of the queen , and i will have them put you in that bastille you are so afraid of
1	it ’ s getting much too noisy and industrial in mankind , there is too little spiritual peace , complains a secluded thinker
1	i left with the intention of remaining in europe , my dear , and never coming home
1	at last i have sort of got you by the collar !
1	xiv : sashenka and nadenka
1	the prince found his fiancée locked in the bedroom , in tears , in despair , in hysterics ; for a long time she refused to listen to anything they said to her through the locked door ; at last she opened it , let in only the prince , locked the door after him , and fell on her knees before him
1	how many days would it take to make two pendants like these ?
1	and like vygoda , with its strongly accented first syllable , profit leaps from the mouth almost with the force of an expletive , quite unlike the more unctuous advantage or its russian equivalent preimushchestvo
1	cried andrei yefimych , trembling all over
1	that is , you think you can live more intelligently than everyone else ?
1	the news that liza had not told me anything simply crushed him
1	how can i renounce evil imaginings forever , so as peacefully to do thy will ?
1	and there flashed in pierre 's imagination the dinner at the club , when he had challenged dolokhov , and his benefactor in torzhok
1	i am at least twice as strong as you are and i have nothing to fear , besides
1	and it was quite an accident lebeziatnikov 's turning up
1	one of the two horsemen , the one who had spoken second , was ten paces in front of his companion
1	he was lying on his back , still dazed from his recent oblivion
1	the count stood by the window and , without turning his face , listened to natasha 's words
1	he looked at sonia and felt how great was her love for him , and strange to say he felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved
1	he rushed like a madman to pick it up , seized the packet , clutched it convulsively in his hand , which sank from the heavy weight
1	well , andrei petrovich , dear heart , what have they done with our young lady ?
1	you don ’ t answer me ?
1	princess marya understood everything
1	now , when his uneasiness had become quite noticeable , aglaya ’ s agitation and uneasiness also grew , and each time he looked behind him , she almost at once looked around as well
1	he was warming up by the fire
1	oh , he came to me so frightened !
1	a day and a night are soon past
1	you know my rules : everything 's in the open !
1	what am i to do ?
1	but there was such ardor in his eyes , such persuasiveness in his voice , that she felt drawn to trust him
1	maybe you were not expecting me , eh ?
1	and how did you become acquainted with my daughter ?
1	when everything was ready , the traveler opened his eyes , moved to the table , and , having poured himself a glass , poured another for the beardless old man and handed it to him
1	this made so quick and complete a diversion to the attack that d'artagnan 's adversary , while the former turned to face this hail of blows , sheathed his sword with the same precision , and , from the actor he had failed to be , became a spectator of the combat , a role he fulfilled with his ordinary impassivity , though muttering to himself : a plague on these gascons !
1	he got up and took his cap
1	this is what i wanted to say
1	the light rain stopped ; only mist fell and drops of water from the branches of the trees
1	observed zametov , yes , that 's quite possible
1	regarding my gratitude for your visits , rest assured that everything my means will permit
1	prince andrei sighed with relief , smiled , and held out his hand
1	look , your excellency , today they buried the actual privy councillor tarasevich
1	but what about the painter ?
1	and it would have meant a terrible scandal for dounia too ; that would have been inevitable
1	half a minute goes by and there is more knocking
1	the gentleman asked sternly , scowling in haughty astonishment
1	what are you to be pitied for ?
1	shy and chaste , i swear !
1	yes , yes , all right , the count said quickly , only , excuse me , my friend , i will give you twenty thousand , and a promissory note for eighty thousand besides
1	voyons à qui en avez vous avec votre roi de prusse ?
1	but what an end !
1	that 's sure , pavel ivanych , a bad man 's cherished nowhere , not at home , not in the service , but if you live right , obey orders , then who has any need to offend you ?
1	well , yes , naturally i do not mean that—that is , not in that sense—i only wanted to say that despite any
1	berg was sitting by the countess and , with respectful intimacy , was trying to comfort her
1	i have a headache and no money
1	they started coming to see me often , asking me to tell them stories ; it seems i did it well , because they liked listening to me very much
1	but the secluded position of svidrigaïlov 's lodging had suddenly struck her
1	that 's why love among relations is immoral , mama , because it 's unearned
1	aha , so they have stuck you in here , too , my dear !
1	as far as i am concerned , you may all go to hell , but from what i see , it 's clear to me that i ca not make head or tail of it ; please do not think i have come to ask you questions
1	baron , but maybe he was just an official—who knows !
1	he moved away from the window , shut it , lighted the candle , put on his waistcoat , his overcoat and his hat and went out , carrying the candle , into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in the midst of candle‐ends and all sorts of rubbish , to pay him for the room and leave the hotel
1	i thought ceaselesslywell , no matter , let her come
1	i drew my sword in turn , and as he came back to the charge , i believe i felt that , in throwing himself upon me , he ran himself through
1	i look upon you with tenderness ; oh , god bless you !
1	i thank your serenity , replied prince andrei , but i am afraid i am no longer fit for the staff , he said with a smile , which kutuzov noticed
1	perhaps you are right after all : men know far more about politics than women , and you above all , m bonacieux , who have talked with the cardinal
1	i went straight into the military …
1	while he bent over the kettle , scooping up big spoonfuls and greedily chewing one after another , his face could be seen in the firelight , and the soldiers silently looked at him
1	i will re-pin it , and she rushed forward , and the sewing girls , who had no time to follow her , tore off a piece of gauze
1	it looks as if you begrudge telling us , aglaya needled him
1	winter has exchanged his usual stupidity for a previously unknown prudence
1	which was why this unconscious tune of the uncle 's , as in the songs of birds , was so extraordinarily good
1	you are the very portrait of him , and not so much in face as in soul
1	imagine that all of us , rich and poor , work only three hours a day , and the rest of our time is left free
1	he pulled a used deck , wrapped in paper , out of his pocket and handed it to the prince
1	so will you come ?
1	and this is too light , it wo not do , no , it wo not do !
1	just like a prison
1	katerina ivanovna rose from her chair , and with a stern and apparently calm voice ( though she was pale and her chest was heaving ) observed that if she dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa , she , katerina ivanovna , would tear her cap off her head and trample it under foot
1	one fine morning liza enters my room and says in a joking tone :
1	he took a few gold coins from the pocket of his wide trousers and put them on the platter for her
1	my wife suddenly remembers that i have not had my tea yet and becomes alarmed
1	ah , what a pity i did not see you greet the children , said natasha
1	yes , word of honor
1	lord de winter passed before the door without stopping , and the sound of his footsteps could be heard going away
1	she was the first to hold her up to disgrace : when they heard in the village that marie had come back , everybody ran to look at her , and nearly the whole village came running to the old woman ’ s cottage : old men , children , women , girls , everybody , in such a hustling , greedy crowd
1	from that point on , rogozhin becomes the prince ’ s shadow , lurking , menacing , hiding , yet inseparable from him , until the final scene finds them pressed face to face
1	besides , what value has the life of that sickly , stupid , ill‐natured old woman in the balance of existence !
1	i see you fight seriously , and painfully , too !
1	they all exchanged questioning glances ; but the prince , it seemed , did not understand these words and was in the highest degree of happiness
1	raskolnikov gave her what came first—fifteen copecks
1	porthos , without replying , took a second step away
1	razumihin said to zossimov
1	pierre stopped , pressing himself to the edge of the road , which was dug out of the hillside
1	yes , i will go up and then suddenly will it be a pistol or a dagger ?
1	first , i put it to you that we have no right to ask that of the sovereign , and second , if the russian nobility did have that right , the sovereign could not answer us
1	kolya stopped to see him , also for a moment ; this one was indeed in a hurry and in great and dark anxiety
1	v : the king 's musketeers and the cardinal 's guards d'artagnan knew no one in paris
1	pardieu , as if i did not !
1	on the contrary , in that first confused moment in bed , right after nastasya egorovna 's departure , i did not even linger over lambert , but
1	why is it hard to imagine eternity ?
1	ganya suddenly turned , hearing her get up from her seat
1	she aimed straight at my head
1	but why , my good sir , all of a minute what is it ?
1	aglaya said impatiently and wrathfully , getting up from her chair
1	one believes and disbelieves—everything
1	it ended with an embittered break between them , and it seems he wanted to kill her ; he frightened her and maybe would have killed her ; but it all suddenly turned to hatred
1	jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave
1	he said suddenly in a completely different voice , looking at me in bewilderment
1	‡ my husband is mistaken
1	never mind , never mind
1	prepares for institutions of learning—of course , that also means in arithmetic ?
1	i was in the sixth class at the gymnasium , said zametov with some dignity
1	i will show you their pamphlets
1	take your old woman and god speed you
1	what , does he really love you , this lover ?
1	but the maid didn ’ t open the door , not wishing to waken mr vilkin , and maybe not wanting to get out of bed herself
1	you do not say there 's no one at home , the new‐comer cried in a cheerful , ringing voice , addressing the first visitor , who still went on pulling the bell
1	aramis , after a trip to lorraine , disappeared all at once and stopped writing to his friends
1	someone may be watching you besides me , and it wo not do you any good
1	when the preparations for the night were over , natasha slowly lowered herself onto the sheet that covered the straw , on the side nearest the door
1	well , what makes you go to war ?
1	she does understand it ; don ’ t be angry with her
1	i straightaway bribed the maiden aunt , the younger one , with a hundred roubles , and gave her twenty-five up front
1	she glanced at the clock , got up , sat down again , smiled at d'artagnan with a look that meant to say : you are very nice , of course , but you would be so charming if you left !
1	lipa could not get used to it either , and after her husband left , she slept not in her own bed but wherever she happened to be—in the kitchen or the shed—and every day she washed the floors or did the laundry , and it seemed to her that she was doing day labor
1	pulcheria alexandrovna caught her up , hotly and jealously
1	get undressed and have a good sleep
1	they are buffoons , panie , buffoons !
1	and they are pleased , pleased !
1	razumihin stood a moment , thought and let his hand drop
1	no , simply : maison de ma mere , [ ] he decided to himself
1	his swollen , lazy eyes are turned to the iconostasis
1	and i shall venture to explain it precisely to you , lev nikolaevich , as a man the sincerity of whose reception and the nobility of whose feelings i trust as … as … you ’ re not surprised at my words , prince ?
1	cried a multitude of voices
1	the blood rushed to natasha 's face and her feet made an involuntary movement , but she could not jump up and run
1	what reason was there to suppose there was a tendency to revolt in the city ?
1	you can see i have no strength left ; you can see i ca not walk : flee by yourself !
1	i read it , my dear , and of course there was a great deal i did not understand ; but that 's only natural—how should i ?
1	do not laugh , and do not be angry !
1	but when varya left lizaveta prokofyevna and said good-bye to the girls , they did not even know that she had been denied the house once and for all and that she was saying good-bye to them for the last time
1	and it would have been too disadvantageous for him if she , bypassing him , wheedled the document out of me , and we entered into an part three agreement
1	the staircase seemed strangely familiar
1	dolokhov walked slowly , without raising his pistol , his light , shining blue eyes peering into his adversary 's face
1	and he will say , 'come to me !
1	there ’ s no need for all this … the prince tried to begin
1	the essential relations of strength had changed , and it became necessary to attack
1	i think that 's all nonsense and there 's no need of softness ; on the contrary , what 's wanted is protest
1	dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother
1	if they receive me—good ; if not—that also may be very good
1	among the men in the back , wearing the same shakos , stood a russian hussar
1	he listened to the reports brought to him , gave orders when his subordinates demanded it ; but , as he listened to the reports , it seemed that he was not interested in the meaning of the words being said to him , but that something else in the expression of the face , in the tone of the reporter 's speech interested him
1	lebedev sat the prince down on a green wooden bench , at a green table fixed in the ground , and placed himself opposite him
1	here you will meet such waists as you have never seen in dreams : slender , narrow waists , no whit thicker than a bottle 's neck , on meeting which you deferentially step aside , lest you somehow imprudently nudge them with your discourteous elbow ; timidity and fear will come over your heart , lest somehow from your imprudent breath the loveliest work of nature and art should be broken
1	they found it impossible to educate me systematically because of my illness
1	well , in prison , it seems , he remembered the venerable elder ; the bible , too , made its appearance again
1	be that as it may , interest in the event grew daily , the more so as there remained not the slightest doubt that the scandalous wedding would actually take place
1	i am going to see mama
1	the old woman came back
1	they have begun to forget about anisim
1	it 's a government clerk retired from the service , marmeladov
1	to be sure , said d'artagnan
1	when the prince asked precisely when rogozhin had called , the captain ’ s widow named almost the same hour when nastasya filippovna had supposedly seen him that day in her garden
1	and if there is not that , there 's nothing
1	aux suivants l'intérêt et le ridicule montent comme de raison
1	a woman , if she 's in love , likes to be kept in a tight fist
1	to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two concepts , the philosophy of history can and must follow a path opposite to the one other sciences have taken
1	in short , he was a real landowner a landowner good and proper
1	will you come for dinner ?
1	all right , you will get there !
1	i am wicked , i see that , he thought to himself , feeling ashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to dounia
1	english joneses and french coques walk hand in hand with the charges entrusted to their parental care and , with proper gravity , explain to them that the signs over the shops are made so that by means of them one may learn what is to be found inside the shop
1	in speaking of it to dounia , he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired , and he could not understand that others should fail to admire it too
1	catching the expression of his face and gaze , she suddenly grew timid and felt guilty
1	as if i had gone so as to encounter it
1	and it was falling yesterday , and it was falling the other day as well
1	having finished his shop talk , my colleague abruptly stands up and , waving his hat in the direction of my work , starts taking his leave
1	ashamed as i am , i will describe one that occurred the other day after dinner
1	she is in prison ?
1	but anyhow , i repeat , it ’ s as you wish
1	since then , sir , he went on after a brief pause—since then , owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil‐intentioned persons—in all which darya frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect—since then my daughter sofya semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket , and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us
1	in inexpressible anguish , he reached his inn on foot
1	now , now , now , aglaya
1	i suddenly felt so drunk , sir
1	he suddenly said unnaturally and threw down his chisel
1	tikhon knew the prince 's habit of sometimes expressing his thoughts aloud , and therefore with an unchanged face met the irately questioning gaze of the face that emerged from the shirt
1	in any case , i ca not take him there the way he is !
1	i was here when you were lying ill in bed , not officially , not in my own person , but i was here
1	i will promise them monthly rations and quarters on the estate near moscow ; i am sure andré would do still more in my place , she thought , approaching in the twilight the crowd standing on the green by the barn
1	if you do ( which is obvious ) , then do you intend , or do you find it right in all conscience , having obtained millions in your turn , to reward pavlishchev ’ s needy son , even though he bears the name of burdovsky ?
1	the only difference is that i do not contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals , as you call it
1	she will have returned to the louvre
1	the fact is that it wasn ’ t , it turned out badly , people actually told all sorts of things , many told the truth , and , imagine , many even enjoyed the telling , but then they all felt ashamed , they couldn ’ t stand it !
1	i was my own judge , and— god , what there was in my soul !
1	after these irritations , bile would spread over her face , and her maids knew by sure signs when mrs belov would again be deaf , and the snuff would again be damp , and when her face would turn yellow
1	are you late somewhere ?
1	and though i was standing some way off , i saw it all
1	then rostov was laid in a sleigh and accompanied to the first posting station
1	but here again the whole incident is shrouded in mist , and what came later is decidedly unknown
1	scraps and shreds of thoughts were simply swarming in his brain , but he could not catch at one , he could not rest on one , in spite of all his efforts
1	marmeladov—such is my name ; titular counsellor
1	this … this i do not understand !
1	as in the austerlitz disposition , it was written , though not in german :
1	there was vodka , rum and lisbon wine , all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity
1	she was a diminutive , withered up old woman of sixty , with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose
1	yes , a capital thing , answered raskolnikov , looking at him almost ironically
1	read them , andryusha , and persuade papa to write more often
1	why , he there was asking whether a student lived here , mentioned your name and whom you lodged with
1	in the course of a boring day , during which prince andrei was entertained by the older hosts and the most respected guests , who filled the old count 's house on the occasion of an approaching name-day party , bolkonsky glanced several times at natasha , who was laughing at something and having fun among the other , young half of the company , still asking himself : what is she thinking about ?
1	i became all light as a bird
1	it was not what he read in the letter that made him angry ; what made him angry was that the life there , now foreign to him , could excite him
1	it 's a delight for some girls to live at home !
1	when velchaninov bent down carefully to her little head , to kiss at least the edge of her dress in farewell—she suddenly opened her eyes as if she had been waiting for him , and whispered :
1	this joyful news contributed greatly to my recovery when i regained consciousness
1	please come to the portrait room
1	two years later he used this letter to request the money from me through the court , and with interest , so that he surprised me again , the more so as he literally went about collecting money for building a church of god , and since then he 's been wandering for twenty years
1	all rushed out of the village again , but tushin 's guns could not move , and the artillerists , tushin , and the junker silently looked at each other , awaiting their fate
1	there was a moment 's silence
1	this article she was continually reading , she even read it aloud , almost took it to bed with her , but scarcely asked where rodya was , though the subject was obviously avoided by the others , which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions
1	quite so , svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour
1	it is the same every morning
1	you can see very well that i have no sword , said the englishman
1	he sat down in the place shown him by the beautiful hélène and listened to the general conversation
1	they would have too easy a time with four isolated men , while four men together make a troop
1	you are told that the wind can snap its chain , that you are brutes , pechenegs , and you believe it ; you get it in the neck , and kiss the man 's hand ; some animal in a raccoon coat robs you , then tosses you a fifteen-kopeck tip , and you say :
1	you know how preposterously shy and modest she ’ s been all along : as a child she used to get into the wardrobe and sit there for two or three hours , only so as not to come out to the guests ; she ’ s grown into such a big thing , but it ’ s the same now
1	and if your majesty 's suspicions , the three musketeers which i continue to doubt , turned out to have some substance , what a terrible scandal !
1	i have been waiting for you like a sun that would light up everything for me
1	the higher human reason rises in the discovery of these purposes , the more obvious for it is the inaccessibility of the final purpose
1	time means nothing here … even for a physical requital … but i got a moral … a moral slap , not a physical one !
1	je vous offre mon amitié
1	yes , the solitary awareness of strength is fascinating and beautiful
1	but the landlady is out of the question ; it 's all right for me , but it 's out of the question for you : she would not take you , for she 's for she 's a fool she would be jealous on my account of avdotya romanovna and of you , too , if you want to know of avdotya romanovna certainly
1	yes , i bowed down to him and prayed for him
1	i consider this coincidence of words fateful , almost miraculous
1	on the narrow dam of augesd , on which for so many years an old miller in a cap used to sit peacefully with his fishing rods , while his grandson , his shirtsleeves rolled up , fingered the silvery , trembling fish in the watering can ; on this dam over which , for so many years , moravians in shaggy hats and blue jackets had peacefully driven in their two-horse carts laden with wheat and had driven back over the same dam all dusty with flour , their carts white— now , on this narrow dam , between wagons and cannon , under horses and between wheels , crowded men disfigured by the fear of death , crushing each other , dying , stepping over the dying , and killing each other , only to go a few steps and be killed themselves just the same
1	that time i borrowed from the prince
1	he dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to europe from the depths of asia
1	the dying man probably understood little ; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds
1	lambert might not lambert have gotten in with her as well ?
1	what would it matter to you , he cried a moment later with a sort of despair , what would it matter to you if i were to confess that i did wrong ?
1	the other three patients—two soldiers and a sailor—who played cards all day long , are now asleep and muttering to themselves
1	we will part , if you please , but only if you give me a fortune , said hélène to part—how scary !
1	preparing to do something , this gentleman will at once expound to you , with great eloquence and clarity , precisely how he must needs act in accordance with the laws of reason and truth
1	ivan dmitrich proved unable to endure such a life , he lost heart , wasted away , and , quitting the university , went home
1	the whole crowd of his listeners instantly made the same movement , seeking the extraordinary portrait with their eyes
1	he , he alone , was the cause of it all—and yet he was the only one i was not angry with then
1	snorting and grunting , he turned now his fat back , now his hairy , fat chest under the brush with which a valet was rubbing his body
1	despite the non-russian locality and surroundings— orchards , stone walls , tile roofs , mountains visible in the distance—and the non-russian folk gazing with curiosity at the soldiers , the regiment looked exactly the same as any russian regiment waiting for review somewhere in central russia
1	liza , the children , work—oh , how we both dreamed of it all , dreamed of it here , right in these rooms , and what then ?
1	a life for one night with me ! … ’
1	bolkhovitinov was all covered with mud , and , wiping it with his sleeve , he smeared it over his face
1	she took the book however
1	said pulcheria alexandrovna , addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay
1	the three musketeers this hesitation aroused some suspicions in the three friends , and athos , advancing a few paces , called out in a firm voice : who goes there ?
1	after which he at once began a merry little conversation , into which he successfully inserted two or three compliments
1	now , you ’ re not offended when i tell you to your face that you ’ re ridiculous ?
1	and so , while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable , he was not at all resigned to dying meekly , as another man less courageous and less reasonable than he would have been in his place
1	petya was standing by the door when denisov said that
1	and do you suppose , from the character of our legal system , that they will accept , or that they are in a position to accept , this fact—resting simply on a psychological impossibility—as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution ?
1	he turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room
1	i cried to him
1	there was no knowledge , but my heart throbbed with anticipations , and evil spirits already possessed my dreams
1	the wine was also transferred there
1	you can see it 's all burned down , and that 's the end of it why are you pushing , as if there 's not road enough , he turned gruffly to a man walking behind him , who had not pushed him at all
1	zershchikov pointed to the spot where it was lying , was lying just now , and that spot turned out to be right next to me , adjoining me , the place where my money lay , meaning much closer to me than to aferdov
1	she cried , my god !
1	look , what a day , look , how good !
1	you always maintained that i was a fool , but by jove , my boy , there are greater fools than i am !
1	and , on top of that , you sit there and get surprised at me
1	but you do not believe it anyway , raskolnikov let slip in his anger
1	the official whispered to raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the doctor , but he ordered him to be sent for
1	in the first place , she appeared to be a girl quite young , and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves , waving her arms about in an absurd way
1	xxvii : the wife of athos tell me , athos , tell me
1	she only saw that pyotr petrovitch had somehow come to grief
1	and the further back we transport ourselves in examining events , the less arbitrary they appear to us
1	some foolishness , some trifling carelessness , and i may betray myself !
1	the poor knight ’ is that same don quixote , only a serious and not a comic one
1	i cough , i begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing
1	then it 's clear they do not teach you much sense there in your seminary
1	he has been raised by foster parents and tutors , has seen his mother , a peasant woman from versilov 's estate , two or three times in his life and his father only once
1	police stood by the brightly lit porch laid with red baize , and not merely gendarmes , but a mounted police chief and dozens of police officers
1	said the woman with the violet nose , pointing at the weaver 's wife
1	no , said porthos , there go two or three of them limping for safety
1	dostoevsky 's reply to chernyshevsky is both ideological and artistic , the implication being that the two are inseparable , and the further implication being that the indispensable unity of artistic form reflects a more primordial unity of the living person
1	for some reason i absolutely wanted him to begin first
1	i easily climbed the fence and went down this avenue , slipping on the fir needles that lay inches-thick on the ground
1	yesterday , playing chess with the king , m le cardinal told us , with an air of condolence which greatly displeased me , that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers , those daredevils—he stressed these words with an ironic accent that displeased me still more— those true destroyers , he added , looking at me with his tiger-cat 's eyes , had stayed late at a tavern on the rue férou , and that a patrol of his guards had been forced to arrest the troublemakers
1	the philosopher tried shouting , but his voice was completely muffled on all sides and met no response
1	my god is myself , myself and whoever helps me in my revenge !
1	when we cleaned the cottage for the colonel , we carried some of them out
1	indeed , in all of european literature there is no writer for whom dreams play such a large and crucial role as dostoevsky
1	your coffee will get cold , she said suddenly
1	he could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything ; his ideas seemed to gallop after one another , he talked incoherently , his hands trembled slightly
1	what did you write about ?
1	having reached the troops of the left flank , he did not ride forward , where the shooting was , but went looking for the general and the officers where they could not be , and therefore did not deliver the order
1	what are you saying , pyotr fyodorovich ?
1	finally , the walls of his own room began to show clearly before him
1	it will remain your responsibility if the enemy is in a position to detach a considerable corps for petersburg and threaten this capital , in which not many troops could remain , for with the army entrusted to you , acting resolutely and actively , you have all the means to prevent this new misfortune
1	all the tenants of the apartments came crowding around
1	he shuddered all over when just ahead of him the carpathian mountains appeared , and tall krivan , its crown covered with a gray cloud as with a cap ; and his horse raced on and was already roaming in the mountains
1	but that is all folly !
1	smoking was not prohibited , but neither was it permitted ; sort of half permitted , as usual ; well , and depending on the person
1	i will not speak of these dishes , because i much prefer eating them to holding forth on them in conversation
1	but , nevertheless , i know this as a most trustworthy fact : just a few days before his death , the old man , having summoned his daughter and his friends , pelishchev and prince v—sky , told katerina nikolaevna , in the likely chance of his imminent demise , to be sure to allot sixty thousand roubles of this capital to anna andreevna
1	not a bit of it , said razumihin , stung to the quick
1	the man is coming here , you say ?
1	at the council in fili , the predominant thought of the russian command was that a retreat straight back , that is , down the nizhni novgorod road , went without saying
1	what right have you to speak to her like that ?
1	( he was obviously angry )
1	it is , however , the only one we can give you
1	i will tell you both this , i pronounced , if it 's vile in the world , the only vile thing is me , and all the rest is lovely !
1	it was already light in the solitary street
1	the two interlocutors thus set out at a gallop , moving off along opposite sides of the road
1	and meanwhile ivan ilyich was falling more and more into reverie and into a certain round of ideas ; distracted , he imperceptibly but ceaselessly sipped from his glass
1	he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something
1	that position he occupied until he was dismissed on account of illness
1	nor am i capable of self-humiliation out of purity of heart
1	indeed , as this last reflection , this instinctive return to hope , indicated , fear and weak sentiments did not float for long on the surface of this deep soul
1	dron was of the same opinion ; but as soon as he expressed it , karp and some other muzhiks fell upon the former headman
1	maybe it is colorful ; one need only sort through the full-dress military and civil uniforms of all times and all peoples – that alone is worth something , and if you were to add the uniforms of the lower civil ranks , you could really break a leg ; no historian would be left standing
1	she would make a nice princess !
1	mon cher , you give the necessary orders i do not know about such things , she said , lowering her eyes guiltily
1	maybe there ’ s a man who has had the sentence read to him , has been allowed to suffer , and has then been told , go , you ’ re forgiven
1	it wo not be much trouble , i assure you
1	now for the boots
1	in any case , she did not consider herself guilty of anything , and gavrila ardalionovich had better learn on what terms she had been living all those years in petersburg , in what relations with afanasy ivanovich , and how much money she had saved
1	but he will start it himself , your excellency
1	some five years ago i passed through the town of mirgorod
1	we must live by the law of nature and truth , mrs dergachev said from behind the door
1	for pity 's sake , they will shout at you , you ca not rebel : it 's two times two is four !
1	perhaps they indeed expected something extraordinary
1	too bad you seem to know how to make a proper entrance ; where did you learn that ?
1	the croups of the horses in the front row moved
1	dolokhov remained by the gate
1	even if it was a great deal of trouble for me prince andrei said , as if guessing what it was about
1	i am from the province of smolensk
1	her character was like mine , that is , domineering and proud , and i always thought , both then and now , that she came to love the prince precisely because , having no character , he submitted fully to her domination , from the first word and hour
1	the cardinal dismounted ; the three musketeers did the same
1	but this counting skins , who brought in how many—it 's all the same to me !
1	sometimes , when the cardinal , always riding about like the least soldier of the army , ran his thoughtful gaze over these works being built under his command , though much more slowly than he would have liked , by engineers he had brought from all corners of the realm of france , if he met with a musketeer of tréville 's company , he would approach him , look at him in a singular fashion , and , recognizing that he was not one of our four companions , turn his profound gaze and his vast thought elsewhere
1	she came in again at two o'clock with soup
1	she said , could he know ?
1	the old prince did not want to hope : he decided that prince andrei had been killed , and though he sent an official to austria to look for his son 's traces , he ordered a gravestone for him in moscow , which he intended to put in his garden , and told everyone that his son had been killed
1	oh , that 's not it , that 's not it , sonia cried in distress
1	i believe it , my fghriend , i believe it , and i share it and appghrove
1	for me to keep quiet ?
1	next day sonia did not come , nor the day after ; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily
1	these thoughts , all gilded as they were by a last glimmer of love , were no less sad for that
1	he sat for a couple of minutes , smiled guiltily , and left
1	he was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated
1	they were tough and sour , but as pushkin said , wouldearer to us than a host of truths is an exalting illusion
1	the author himself took the verses from him and began to read
1	d'artagnan glanced around him
1	and so , the first moments of captivity were terrible : several convulsions of rage , which she had been unable to master , had paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature
1	when he looked more attentively , he could no longer see them
1	surely , good man , you must be known for your holy life and god-pleasing deeds , and maybe she heard about you
1	kovrin joked and laughed
1	even the table‐cloth was nearly clean ; the crockery , knives , forks and glasses were , of course , of all shapes and patterns , lent by different lodgers , but the table was properly laid at the time fixed , and amalia ivanovna , feeling she had done her work well , had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride
1	is it from london that you brought back that handsome diamond sparkling on your finger ?
1	maybe it 's your destiny that you and she live as a couple
1	rostov remembered what reply he should have given only when the man was already gone
1	liza came out with a pale little face , her eyes downcast , and took her bag
1	you have been misunderstanding me , i think , rodion romanovitch , he added after a brief pause , that 's why you are so surprised
1	he took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table behind him , without turning or looking at dounia
1	do not think ill of me
1	i really don ’ t know if there was anything between them , that is , i mean to say , whether he could have had any serious hopes
1	unquestionably , for him the height of bliss was the fact alone that he could again visit aglaya without hindrance , that he would be allowed to talk with her , sit with her , walk with her , and , who knows , perhaps that alone would have contented him for the rest of his life !
1	the uncle wrapped natasha up and said goodbye to her with a completely new tenderness
1	shouted nastasya , banging with her fist on the door
1	and died three days before the dormition
1	he stood over her
1	said chartkov , and did not finish
1	all memories of this passion turned to disgrace for him ; he blushed to the point of tears and suffered remorse
1	but raskolnikov had become superstitious of late
1	what a stupid thing i have done , he thought to himself , they have sonia and i want it myself
1	they are hastening to town to find work
1	the birds of the air neither sow nor reap , but your father feeds them , [ ] he said to himself and wanted to say it to the princess
1	he slapped me on the shoulder
1	well , now , she smiled venomously , as if pondering , resurrected !
1	and now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard ; he was holding his father 's hand and looking with dread at the tavern
1	when the prince returned home , at around nine o ’ clock , he found vera lukyanovna and the maid on the terrace
1	they are generally very timid : a star or a thick epaulette throws them into such confusion that nevsky prospect they unwittingly lower the price of their works
1	the aunt said and looked intently at ivan fyodorovich , who blushed and dropped his eyes
1	but katerina nikolaevna continued to rebel with implacable hatred
1	i kept nagging at myself , in furious hysterics , sometimes waking up , say , between two and three in the morningwhy precisely you and not him ?
1	briskly shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches , spreading the smell of scent around him , and admiring his lady , and himself , and the fine shape of his legs in their tight buckskins , nikolai was saying to the blonde that there was a certain lady there in voronezh that he wanted to abduct
1	natasha , having risen and curtsied , also did not know what to do with herself
1	you will come , you will come to‐morrow ?
1	toll wrote a disposition ; die erste kolonne marschier , and so on
1	i agreed , natasha now said to herself , that it would be terrible if he was left suffering always
1	you want to buy it
1	and he collapsed on the ground
1	forgive me , grandpa , he says , 'for christ 's sake
1	razumihin had nothing to say , so pulcheria alexandrovna was anxious again
1	natasha began to calm down , but it was clear from her face that she realized all the importance of her friend 's grief
1	i did not believe that such things happened to others , and therefore kept it to myself all my life as a secret
1	having recovered and realizing perfectly well whom he was dealing with , the officer politely ( though covering his face with a handkerchief ) addressed the prince , who had gotten up from the chair :
1	and much good it does me , chevalier , said milady , for do you know what 's happening ?
1	read the holy scriptures , but without the proper feeling
1	where are the proofs that it 's so ?
1	the philosopher wanted to push her away with his hands , but noticed to his astonishment that his arms would not rise , nor would his legs move ; with horror he discovered that the sound of his voice would not even come from his mouth : the words stirred soundlessly on his lips
1	i tell you so that you can take measures now
1	look into it more carefully and understand it !
1	' i will creep down the stairs , i thought , 'and go out , and then go on
1	( ) however close together we bring the time of judgment to the time of the act , we will never get a concept of freedom in time
1	i thought you would cry out again wouldo not speak of it , leave off
1	he may even amuse us a bit , at least so far as i can judge about him
1	are you going already ?
1	métivier , arriving on that morning with his felicitations , found it appropriate in his quality as a doctor de forcer la consigne , [ ] as he said to princess marya , and went to see the prince
1	she said , as if oblivious of the cold , insulting gaze directed at her
1	i will leave now , i wo not say another word to him , thought pierre
1	besides , you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother
1	this ought to be in-ves-tigated !
1	now , then , who are you ?
1	he suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay
1	he had his own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what was happening here
1	i did not know that you pledged things at the old woman 's , too
1	even zametov is rude is zametov rude ?
1	and if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his faculties
1	he gathered up all his packets , put them back into the sack , and , without looking at him , went out from behind the screen
1	but once again all this pleasant mood did not exist for long
1	historians of culture are perfectly consistent in relation to their progenitors , the general historians , for if historical events can be explained by the fact that certain people had such-and-such relations with each other , then why not explain them by the fact that such-and-such people wrote such-and-such books ?
1	strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and restore general safety
1	elle est bien malheureuse , [ ] anna pavlovna added
1	mon cher , vous m'avez promis , [ ] she addressed her son again , touching his hand to encourage him
1	we stopped at cyrus of persia
1	ah , your excellency , zherkov mixed in , not taking his eyes from the hussars , but still with his naïve manner , which made it impossible to tell whether he was speaking seriously or not
1	wouldo you know , she says , 'that he wanted to insult me ?
1	the general curiosity received a new and extraordinary jolt
1	as for me , athos responded to this whole story , i am quite at ease ; it wo not be women who pay the cost of my harness
1	and he really does it out of the kindness of his heart , i know him
1	where do you place stenay , athos ?
1	but you are wrong , you wo not do it !
1	i still wanted to move about , and so i would suddenly sink into some murky , subterranean , vile debauch – not a great , but a measly little debauch
1	and since up to the eleventh of july the manifesto and appeal had not been received , exaggerated rumors about them and about the situation of russia went around
1	the day after this conversation , natasha put on that old dress which was especially known for making her cheerful in the mornings , and with that morning began her former way of life , which she had abandoned since the ball
1	i do not know anything , said pierre
1	on the sofa another child slept , a three-year-old girl , covered , it seemed , with a tailcoat
1	what she did with that deed , god alone knows
1	but the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all
1	oh , yes raskolnikov sipped the glass , put a morsel of bread in his mouth and , suddenly looking at zametov , seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together
1	ukrainian tales here a new marvel appeared : the clouds flew off of the highest mountain , and on its peak appeared a mounted man , in full knightly armor , with his eyes shut , and he could be seen as if he were standing up close to them
1	here you are in our domain
1	i ’ m of exactly the same opinion , adelaida proclaimed solemnly
1	you are making it all up !
1	then his own walks through the hay market came back to his mind , and for a moment he waked up to reality
1	the thing is that the men you rode around the position with not only do not contribute to the general course of things , but hinder it
1	i was the only one who went up , everybody was silent ; there were no competitors
1	so that 's all there is to so-called heroism ?
1	besides , makar ivanovich had ordered her to marry
1	i suffered all evening , all night , i am partly suffering now as well
1	he looked back on the experience as rather gloomy , and later lost his faith , but his familiarity with church life shows in many of his stories , and his knowledge of the services and prayers was probably more precise than that of any other russian writer
1	i assure you i am proud of these breeches , and he exhibited to raskolnikov a pair of light , summer trousers of grey woollen material
1	to begin with there were rumours
1	one of those present , older than the others , with a frightened and angry face , suddenly moved forward and was about to seize dolokhov by the shirt
1	if god should see fit to test you in the duties of marriage , be ready to fulfill his will
1	so you would be russians ?
1	for one little moment , sir !
1	with that he warmly voiced his opinion that the prince , quite strangely and for god knows what reason , was called an idiot , that he thought completely the opposite of him , and that he was most certainly a man who kept his own counsel
1	when we got up from the table , i went over to mama , embraced her warmly , and wished her a happy birthday
1	he was made rather recently , as well , and is still quite proud of his advancement
1	wouldo not let anybody read over me , daddy , but send to the kiev seminary at once and bring the student khoma brut
1	bon , je vous laisse dans votre petit coin
1	this time i found my knife under the pillow , and while i feigned sleep , my hand convulsively gripped its handle
1	on the table next to her lay the opened letter from anatole
1	if we examine a man alone , without his relation to everything around him , his every action appears free to us
1	there was no answer ; i thought i could hear her footsteps down below
1	that 's all i keep repeating
1	my ruin has made me much richer
1	and that kept her from guessing his words
1	princess marya disliked natasha at first sight
1	she is bound to want to 'save him , to bring him to his senses , and lift him up and draw him to nobler aims , and restore him to new life and usefulness—well , we all know how far such dreams can go
1	after the loss of sevastopol , the artillery commander kryzhanovsky sent me the reports of the artillery officers from all the bastions and asked me to put those more than twenty accounts together into one
1	i heard yesterday … ( though i have no right ) , but if you ever need a faithful servant in anything , he ’ s here before you
1	i must say , i was never very glad of this marriage
1	at that moment , amalia ivanovna , deeply aggrieved at taking no part in the conversation , and not being listened to , made one last effort , and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation , that in the future boarding‐school she would have to pay particular attention to die wäsche , and that there certainly must be a good dame to look after the linen , and secondly that the young ladies must not novels at night read
1	and yet after each such conversation , i was more troubled than before
1	the horses and droshky were sent away
1	it was true that she now felt oppressed and bored , very bored ; afanasy ivanovich had divined her dreams ; she would like to resurrect , if not in love , then in a family , with the consciousness of a new purpose ; but of gavrila ardalionovich she could say almost nothing
1	he looked to see if the dish of broad beans was still there : the dish of broad beans had disappeared
1	i shall have to pull a long face with him too , he thought , with a beating heart , and he turned white , and do it naturally , too
1	on the dark height of the fourth floor , the unknown lady knocked at the door—it opened , and they went in together
1	having wept , talked , and wiped their tears , the two friends went up to prince andrei 's door
1	am i free now , this minute , or am i no longer free ?
1	well , as for the gentleman who thrashed the german , i feel no sympathy with him , because after all what need is there for sympathy ?
1	his state of mind was placid , submissive ; he willingly obeyed , and when varvara nikolaevna—that was his friend 's name—decided to take him to the crimea , he agreed , though he had a presentiment that nothing good would come of this trip
1	dounia lowered the revolver and looked at svidrigaïlov not so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement
1	to‐day , he repeated to himself
1	i suppose it was from stupidity , because shame could still have been surmounted
1	tell katerina not to abandon our son !
1	so you have no friends in paris , m
1	if you wish , what 's most characteristic here is that it 's possible to draw any logical conclusion you like , but to up and shoot oneself as the result of a conclusion—that , of course , does not happen all the time
1	they were cut off from the path of retreat to the left by the french line
1	even if you were not my father , still you would never make me betray my beloved , faithful husband
1	i : the three presents of m d'artagnan sr on the first monday of the month of april , the village of meung , where the author of the romance of the rose was born , seemed to be in as total an upheaval as if the huguenots had come to make a second la rochelle
1	raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd , stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh
1	what nonsense all around !
1	it was decidedly humiliating to listen further , but my curiosity was invincibly enticed
1	he added with a bitter smile
1	the four companions cried with one voice , we would get ourselves cut to pieces for your majesty
1	which is why it 's a sin , prince , for people such as you not to serve now
1	in all he was clearly a sloven : his gloveless hands were dirty , and his long nails were in mourning
1	perhaps i know more about it than you do
1	when schroeder left , she suddenly said to me again , looking at me terribly seriously :
1	here , la porte , said buckingham , these are the only tokens i had from her , this silver box and these two letters
1	there was nowhere to hide
1	and do not you order anything in your own name ?
1	and meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much , though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away
1	they both began talking , but the prince suddenly started to shout , as if in strong irritation , reaching the point of fury
1	but at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again , as though his conscience smote him
1	they are all generals ' daughters , it seems , but they have all snub noses , interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face , wearing a loose coat
1	i am a man of experience , immense experience , sir , and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self‐approval
1	and then he turned to pierre
1	the girl 's tongue , lips , and whole mouth got covered with a sort of fine white rash , and towards evening she died , gazing at me with her big dark eyes , as if she already understood
1	bjoring 's shouting was addressed to anna andreevna , who also came out to the corridor after the prince ; he threatened her and , i believe , stamped his feet—in short , the coarse german soldier told in him , despite all his high society
1	all this he absolutely had to think over quickly ; it was now clear that he had not imagined anything at the station either , and that something absolutely real had happened to him , which was absolutely connected with all his earlier uneasiness
1	but dostoevsky was uncertain about what would follow , and he continued in that uncertainty all the while he was writing the novel
1	why are you here ?
1	said the old man , looking at her rounded waist
1	he 's alive , said napoleon
1	in that case , you would not have brought me to the necessity of a refusal
1	she shook her finger at him
1	i do not know him , and besides , he 's an englishman
1	he was a very strange despot
1	what about the bridge ?
1	walking behind the liveried footman who made way through the crowd before her mother , natasha heard a young man 's voice saying of her in much too loud a whisper :
1	in the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother , when a service was held in memory of his grandmother , who had long been dead , and whom he had never seen
1	finally , liza died , on a beautiful summer evening , together with the setting sun , and only then did velchaninov seem to recover himself
1	you do not mean you are drinking this now ?
1	he was terribly certain that i would not escape ; he held and supported me with relish , like a dear little victim , and i , of course , was just what he needed , precisely that evening and in that condition !
1	and pierre , trying fearfully to recall whether he had done anything reprehensible , blushed and looked around him
1	on the third night , the countess calmed down for a few minutes , and natasha closed her eyes , resting her head on the arm of the chair
1	besides that , the whole staff of the russian army was now transformed
1	though he 's a drunk man , like as if unconscious , still it 's no good in front of a little child ; youngling as she is , she will still get it in her mind !
1	the poor artist 's heart began to pound harder
1	well , i kept expecting you , and so it was , you came !
1	and , besides , you must agree that all your outbursts downstairs , instead of falling on me , as you meant , only tyrannized and tormented her
1	it 's partly what made me ill in short , he shouted , feeling that the phrase about his illness was still more out of place , in short , kindly examine me or let me go , at once
1	at the same time i had thoughts of mme
1	generally , i recall some of my outbursts in those minutes with great displeasure
1	how is it true ?
1	i have already been apprised of that , monseigneur , cried bonacieux , giving his questioner the title he had heard the officer give him , but i swear to you that i know nothing about it
1	his face is turned three-quarters to us now , and poorly lit , but when he turns this way , look at his forehead
1	so laughing , they entered porfiry petrovitch 's flat
1	in the room , not a small one incidentally , there were upward of thirty guests
1	i dreamed a dream that was completely unexpected for me , because i had never had one like it
1	at the start of the mazurka , boris saw the adjutant general balashov , one of the closest persons to the sovereign , go up to him and in uncourtly fashion stop very close to the sovereign , who was talking with a polish lady
1	milady replied to his question with another question
1	they finally arrived , opened the doors to the house and the front hall wide , and with loud laughter dragged the sack inside
1	i do not know really what to say
1	he did not take his eyes off her face all the while we crossed
1	well , maybe that ’ s how it should be … and you also didn ’ t answer my letter then … well , good-bye and forgive me for bothering you
1	i loved and respected him , and i sympathize with you wholeheartedly
1	up and down the length of one of its great stairways , on the site of which our civilization could build an entire house , moved a procession of paris solicitors seeking some sort of favor , provincial gentlemen anxious to enlist , and lackeys decked out in all colors , who came to bring m de tréville messages from their masters
1	asked natasha , seizing her hand
1	only i have no idea where to make my start
1	bolkonsky noticed the hussar 's state and found it amusing
1	now it only remains for me not to ruin the finale
1	quand j'ai compris ce qu'il voulait , quand j'ai vu qu'il nous faisait une litière de lauriers , voyez-vous , je me suis dit : voilà un souverain , et je me suis donné à lui
1	tomorrow there will be no more time !
1	go that way , your honor , here you will get killed straight off , a soldier cried to him
1	no , rodion romanovitch , i am not mistaken
1	prince vassily 's son , he and a certain dolokhov , they say , were up to god knows what
1	he looked around at the darkness , shook his head convulsively , and asked :
1	in my opinion , it is not only not noble , but even vile
1	d'artagnan and athos took the horses of planchet and grimaud , and the two valets set out on foot , carrying the saddles on their heads
1	trudolyubov struck up some stupid song
1	having accompanied olenka to the gate , he said good-bye and went on
1	that love filled all her soul , became an inalienable part of her , and she no longer fought against it
1	i wo not describe in detail what happened with mama : scared to death , she stood with her hands raised and clasped above her and suddenly called out after him : andrei petrovich , come back at least to say good-bye , dear !
1	ah , she will say , 'so young , but he 's got character
1	i called on him yesterday , he didn ’ t receive me , was unwell , but he ’ s rich , rich and important , and … god grant him a long life , but all the same evgeny pavlych will get everything … yes , yes … but even so i ’ m afraid !
1	but if there ’ ll be no gratitude from you , then the prince can also say in answer to you that he feels no gratitude towards pavlishchev , because pavlishchev did good for the satisfaction of his own conscience
1	i gave him two lines and forgot about it at once
1	most likely he spent the night in the scales hotel , very near here
1	said the boy , blushing deeply and looking up at pierre with admiring , shining eyes
1	it 's very easy to judge a man in disgrace and shift the mistakes of others onto him ; but i say that if there was anything good done during this reign , it was done by him—by him alone he stopped , seeing pierre
1	it would seem impossible to draw oneself up more than timokhin had drawn himself up when the regimental commander reprimanded him
1	humaneness will save everything and keep it afloat
1	in perplexity , i ask myself : can it be that this old , very stout , ungainly woman with a dull expression of petty care and fear over a crust of bread , with eyes clouded by constant thoughts of debt and poverty , only capable of talking about expenses and only smiling at bargains—can it be that this woman was once that same slender varya whom i passionately loved for her good , clear mind , her pure soul , her beauty , and , as othello loved desdemona , that she did pity my science ?
1	( he had been standing there and waiting )
1	it was clear that she was stirred to the very depths , that she was longing to speak , to champion , to express something
1	read this , she said , handing him ganya ’ s note
1	nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup
1	you told me to
1	c'est un homme qui a été plus qu'un père pour moi
1	she said quickly , meeting him in the middle of the room
1	the general arrived late , arrived scowling , arrived with evgeny pavlovich , who was received excellently , and evgeny pavlovich himself was surprisingly merry and nice
1	of the young people , not including the countess 's elder daughter ( who was four years older than her sister and already behaved like an adult ) , and the young lady guest , only nikolai and the niece sonya remained in the drawing room
1	but it can ’ t be that you thought of it , you just sensed it , as i did … we sensed it word for word then
1	why , people in perfect health act in the same way too , observed dounia , looking uneasily at zossimov
1	i have posed many questions , but there is one most important question which , i will note , i have never dared to ask my mother directly , though i have become quite close to her over the last year and , moreover , as a crude and ungrateful pup who finds them guilty before him , have been quite unceremonious with her
1	athos had passed through all the trials we have seen bonacieux undergo
1	but i did ask her to remember 'thy servant rodion ' in her prayers , the idea struck him
1	one of pierre 's acquaintances , in the middle of talking about the weather , asked him whether he had heard about kuragin 's abduction of miss rostov , of which there was talk in town , and whether it was true
1	the confession was soon over
1	at these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak ; for two days he had scarcely tasted food
1	stepping full on his heels—we know about that
1	the policeman said , nothing , and at once turned to go back
1	versilov recounted it all jokingly and with extraordinary merriment , so that even mama burst out laughing ; he impersonated tatyana pavlovna , and the midshipman , and the cook
1	rostov felt both frightened and elated to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance , where no one had been before him
1	i do not know anyone or anything here
1	listen , athos , said d'artagnan , instead of keeping yourself locked up here as if you were under arrest , get on a horse and come for an outing with me to saint-germain
1	shall i put the sock on ?
1	well , generally , talk as much as possible
1	here 's how to do it , said boris
1	suddenly touchard himself came in and , with a foolishly important air , asked her : was she pleased with her son 's progress ?
1	but what is she—a nihilist , or simply a fool ?
1	any order from him—this he knew— would be approved by all against one or a few
1	she kept jumping up , impulsively embracing his head , and showering it with kisses
1	you should lie down , she said
1	some laughed at this subject , others declared that nothing could be loftier , but in order to portray the poor knight ’ there had in any case to be a face
1	but know that i adore your daughter and your whole family so much that i would give two lives he looked at the countess and , noticing her stern face good-bye , countess , he said , kissed her hand , and , without looking at natasha , with quick , resolute steps , left the room
1	stay here , and i will go
1	no , this i can not allow ; no , i truly can not !
1	having gone several steps , the officer , as if deciding to himself that the quarters were good , stopped , turned around to the soldiers who were standing in the doorway , and in a loud , commanding voice called to them to bring the horses
1	in short , wherever you turned , there was nothing but losses everywhere
1	but listen , brother , allow me to ask your name and patronymic ?
1	pierre , who was becoming more and more agitated during this conversation , got up and went over to the princess
1	rogozhin suddenly abandoned the painting and went further on his way
1	meet me at the hôtel of the guards
1	that 's something unheard of !
1	if there 's the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth , it leads to a discord , and that leads to trouble
1	for marriage he needed his father 's consent , and for that prince andrei set off the next day to see his father
1	arakcheev 's eyes turned towards him
1	the result of this acquired habit thus was that , on the first monday of the month of april , the townsmen , hearing noise , and seeing neither the yellow-and-red standard , nor the livery of the duc de richelieu , rushed for the jolly miller inn
1	it is too painful for me to think that i could be the cause of grief or discord in the family of my benefactors , she wrote , and my love has no other aim than the happiness of those i love ; and so i beg you , nicolas , to consider yourself free and to know that , despite all , no one can love you more than—your sonya
1	perhaps you don ’ t want to accept my proposal ?
1	is he in earnest ?
1	they served a panikhida in the morning and in the evening
1	she fell in love with you then , ever since that time , that birthday party
1	because of this figure of omission , i , in my lack of skill , have fallen back into those novelistic beauties that i myself derided above
1	she whispers , good-bye , yegor vlasych !
1	[ ] and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades
1	he had even let slip three days earlier , though timidly and remotely , that he was afraid of her coming on account of me—that is , that on account of me he would get a scolding
1	ah , here she is !
1	certainly , if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity , he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself
1	that 's not our business
1	i can almost hear her
1	what did he mean to say by his suggestion today ?
1	but let us turn to him
1	she did , i say , go chase the wind in the field !
1	a thousand thanks , dear friend , for the work you have sent me , and which is causing such a furor there
1	how quickly time flies !
1	interrupting each other , they all hastened to tell the beauty some new thing , unloaded their sacks and boasted about the loaves , sausages , and dumplings , of which they had already collected plenty for their caroling
1	softer , softer now , fade away
1	and … and there ’ ll be more !
1	we shall see the good porthos again , so much the better
1	why do you ask all this ?
1	do not let me find a trace of you in my room !
1	she was maintained in this delusion by the fact that , first of all , she had become a very rich bride , and second , that the older she became , the less dangerous she was for men , the more freely men treated her and , without taking any obligations upon themselves , profited from her suppers , soirées , and the lively company that gathered in her house
1	a madcap does not want to listen
1	you do not get money every day ?
1	besides , on bonacieux 's honor your name is bonacieux ?
1	oh , now it ’ s all one to me , now i have no time to be angry , but then , then , i repeat , i literally chewed my pillow at night and tore my blanket with rage
1	nevertheless , the old prince took great interest in them and especially liked one of these princes , the head of the family , so to speak— a young officer
1	one might even say it 's their only amusement
1	and be gentle with him , but … don ’ t let it show too much , and … and … you know …
1	the expression of her face was not entirely kind , but imposing ; twenty-two years old
1	he began , now that they were reconciled , beginning at once to think aloud in his wife 's presence
1	first he addressed the gray-haired cossack who was grieving over his father and mother : what 's there to cry about , uncle , he said , i am an orphan myself !
1	no , you see , there was this manuscript
1	but not like that !
1	i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler 's for a rouble and a half
1	i have no fiancé , i refused him , cried natasha
1	we have got to go , then ?
1	and they told me you had moved somewhere , to another apartment , that you got frightened and ran away
1	cried the bandit , throwing himself on his knees and leaning on his hand , for he was beginning to lose his strength along with his blood
1	anisim brought that time , they are his present
1	suddenly there was a crackle and boom that to pierre seemed louder than the most terrible peals of thunder , and he turned to look
1	but are the two men not essentially alike ?
1	he remembered how his grandfather always went to the forest to fetch a christmas tree for the masters and took his grandson with him
1	then i started talking with them , talking every day , whenever i had a chance
1	a mounted cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy
1	since those secrets may have an influence on your life , those secrets must become mine
1	fresh as that memory was , rastopchin felt that it was now deeply , bloodily engraved in his heart
1	the most vexing thing is that we will have to die here as well
1	though stupidity constitutes a special charm in a pretty wife
1	meanwhile , i must confess , since we had not counted on staying so long , we would already been without money for some time
1	he starts quietly , tenderly : aremember , gretchen , how you , still innocent , still a child , used to come with your mama to this cathedral and prattle out your prayers from an old book ?
1	one of them said in a thundering voice , seizing him by the collar
1	prince andrei galloped off to carry out his mission
1	prince andrei came into the room and stopped before her , at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying
1	this cloud you have made too loud—it 's not evening light
1	it seems the whole world is looking at me , hiding and waiting for me to understand it
1	elle est forte celle-là , he said
1	she cried , clasping her hands , your husband drunken horses have trampled !
1	the former i treat benignly ; the latter i grill for the whole year
1	take away my gun , i will get a fishing pole , take away the fishing pole , i will hunt bare-handed
1	sonia looked in silence at her visitor , who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room , and even began at last to tremble with terror , as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies
1	but don ’ t you see they ’ ve all lost their minds from pride and vanity ?
1	they began to whistle , clap their hands , and laugh , and marie ran away
1	having questioned several petitioners , the general raised his eyes to cherviakov
1	she 's had some dealings with satan
1	yes , i am certainly a louse , he went on , clutching at the idea , gloating over it and playing with it with vindictive pleasure
1	send for the doctor !
1	however , everything was still mixed up in his head
1	the level of the political thermometer shown to the company that evening was the following : however hard all european sovereigns and military leaders try to pander to bonapartius , in order to cause me , and us in general , unpleasantness and grief , our opinion of bonapartius can not change
1	a man perhaps of feeling and sympathy , maybe of some knowledge too , but my day is over
1	i suddenly and unexpectedly perceived that he had long known who i was , and maybe knew much more as well
1	that has been done with us as well , and it 's splendid
1	having swallowed a little , she had become so frightened that she had awakened sonya and told her what she had done
1	i will stop and explain everything beforehand ; otherwise it will be impossible for the reader to understand
1	so the hôtel is far away ?
1	a new horizon , new works would unfold , all filled with well-being and the propserity of all
1	what else did he say to you ?
1	they began talking about lizaveta
1	i must find out
1	and why would it not be slow in coming ?
1	did i know it then , sir ?
1	after about twenty minutes a pardon was read out to him , and he was given a lesser degree of punishment ; nevertheless , for the space between the two sentences , for twenty minutes , or a quarter of an hour at the least , he lived under the certain conviction that in a few minutes he would suddenly die
1	athos was standing in front of the door , wrapped in his cloak , his hat pulled down over his eyes
1	you give up everything , all your will
1	and they are hungry , hungry ! —and wringing her hands she pointed to the children
1	they counted me chapter six out a hundred and forty half-imperials in gold
1	or , rather , you are insulting me , she went on , gripping the arms of the chair with her clenched hands and raising herself on her wrists
1	it struck you as extraordinary ; i do not mind betting it 's that
1	yes , it was the same flesh , the same chair à canon , the sight of which already then , as if foretelling the present , had filled him with horror
1	he says , 'you are a drunkard , he says , 'you stink of onions , you are a blockhead , a son of a bitch
1	yes , there 's also natasha began
1	the three musketeers the young man turned around quickly , for this attack could not be coming from the bastion , which was masked by the corner of the trench
1	the buildings , begun in the lean time , were more than simple
1	or , if you please , perhaps the gentlemen officers can come along ?
1	dmitri prokofitch razumihin , she added , introducing him to luzhin
1	that all this had suddenly become something else—well , had turned out totally unlike his dream on the planks that evening
1	medicine 's that sort of thing , you have to grind away at it
1	no , you ’ re not at all as simple as they recommend you to be !
1	the princess turned to her and , trying to stifle the animosity for this girl that arose in her heart , kissed her
1	d'artagnan went to say good-bye to m de tréville
1	that is , i did lie , because the document was with me and had never been with kraft , but that was merely a detail , while in the main thing i did not lie , because the moment i lied , i promised myself to burn the letter that very evening
1	i hear sympathy in your voice , at the first sight of you i thought for some reason that i could talk with you about everything
1	were you quick in getting here ?
1	and he could no longer say a word , he understood nothing , and imagined that he was now a simple , ordinary man , walking briskly , merrily across the fields , tapping his stick , and over him was the broad sky , flooded with sunlight , and he was free as a bird and could go wherever he liked !
1	yes , apropos of something … then i told them how i ’ d lived there for three years , and also the story of a poor village girl …
1	he was thinking about all the vanity of his diplomatic career compared with pierre 's happiness
1	hearing that , sonya blushed so much that tears came to her eyes
1	he believed in his hatred of her to such an extent that he even suddenly thought of falling in love with and marrying her stepdaughter , who had been deceived by the prince , persuaded himself completely of this new love , and got the poor idiot girl to fall in love with him irresistibly , making her completely happy by this love during the last months of her life
1	it was as if this laughter echoed all at once in his heart and in his quietly aroused nerves , and at the same time vexation came over his soul that it was not in his power to cover this so nicely laughing face with kisses
1	do not say it , good sir
1	the countess exchanged glances with sonya
1	i am sorry for liza
1	she 's a very worthy girl , and you always liked her ; but now there are suddenly some sort of reasons
1	what was to be done ?
1	there , there was strife and logic ; there the frenchman was only a frenchman , and the german only a german , and that with a greater intensity than at any time in their entire history ; meaning that a frenchman never did more harm to france , or a german to his germany , than at that time !
1	several infantrymen ran to the kutafyevsky gates
1	the prince bared his teeth
1	that is your name ?
1	oh , yes , she said , and her glance added , did you notice anything ?
1	will i see you again before you leave ?
1	i lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think : though katerina ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady amalia fyodorovna only a week before , she could not resist then asking her in to coffee
1	and , assuming a most worldly pose ( god knows where and when she had learned it ) , fanning herself and smiling through the fan , she talked with her partner
1	i mean the one that was under the little trunk , and the one that was in the sledge in the yard i unscrewed along with mitrofan
1	would you have surrendered the letter , aramis ?
1	are they both dead , then ?
1	but i ca not know the divine providence and why do you ask what ca not be answered ?
1	at one point , for instance , versilov advises him : my friend , always let a man lie a little - it 's innocent
1	i wanted to say something important , but i got confused , he said
1	incidentally , i do not know or understand lambert 's relation with the pockmarked one , and why lambert could not do without him
1	such nice things are commonly said when one wants to justify one 's indifference ,
1	mama , are you asleep ?
1	sign the order to set him free , and all will be said , the cardinal picked up
1	listening to this multilingual talk , and these suggestions , plans , and refutations , and shouts , prince andrei was simply amazed at what they all said
1	non , mais figurez-vous , la vieille comtesse zouboff avec des fausses boucles et la bouche pleine de fausses dents , comme si elle voulait défier les années [ ] ha , ha , ha , marie !
1	there 's no hurry , there 's no hurry , muttered porfiry petrovitch , moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim , as it were making dashes towards the window , the bureau and the table , at one moment avoiding raskolnikov 's suspicious glance , then again standing still and looking him straight in the face
1	i do not feel right about money
1	sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk , that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters , that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when , seeing that he had guessed the truth , she told him at last of her death , she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it , not externally at any rate
1	all just like the palm of your hand
1	but for god 's sake be more careful : you know what a shock it may give your maman
1	not heeding the officers , the bearers stood leaning on the stretchers and , as if trying to comprehend the difficult meaning of the spectacle , looked intently at what was going on before them
1	among those present this time there were some who were prepared to sit even till morning without saying a word , for instance , varvara ardalionovna , who sat a little apart all evening , silent and listening all the while with extreme curiosity , and who may have had her own reasons for doing so
1	she take it , she ?
1	but ivan nikiforovich , frightened to have gone so far from home and to have endured such a dangerous quarantine , had already managed to get through the door , saying : ukrainian tales do not trouble yourself , it 's my pleasure
1	pierre noted that he was pale and his lower jaw was twitching and shaking as in a fever
1	that may be , i agree , only i don ’ t remember , prince shch
1	well , is everything ready , vassilyich ?
1	natasha suddenly asked , after a moment 's silence
1	pierre stood up to help the servant
1	god sent a pie-e-ece of che-e-ese
1	princess marya went up and kissed his hand
1	you saw him , he was melting with pleasure
1	a kind old man , but a very pauvre sire
1	stay a little , i wo not talk nonsense , about myself , i mean
1	he would transfer the question to metaphysical heights , go on to definitions of space , time , thought , and , deriving his refutations from there , descend again to the ground of the argument
1	devil take that indecent moment !
1	you know i am having a house‐warming this evening , i dare say they have arrived by now , but i left my uncle there—i just ran in—to receive the guests
1	we all remained standing
1	the sun is already high , and you have no dinner ready
1	ganechka also did not mention a word about the affair of pavlishchev ’ s son , perhaps out of false modesty , perhaps sparing the prince ’ s feelings , but all the same the prince thanked him again for having diligently concluded the affair
1	wishing to ask someone among these people where the commander in chief was , he rode up to the baggage train
1	at pontoise he changed mounts a last time , and at nine o'clock he came galloping into m de tréville 's courtyard
1	why no , not in the least , said boris
1	at eight o'clock i went to the office
1	sometimes in the evening he wraps himself in his robe and , trembling all over , teeth chattering , begins pacing rapidly from corner to corner and between the beds
1	if all russians are at least a little like you , he said to pierre , c'est un sacrilege que de faire la guerre à un peuple comme le vôtre
1	he stopped , silently looking around him
1	it 's time to put an end to it all : perish my soul , i will go and drown myself in a hole in the ice and pass out of the picture !
1	yegor puts his cap on the back of his head and , clucking for his dog , continues on his way
1	she did not seem afraid of svidrigaïlov , but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes
1	and to andrei petrovich , too , he confirmed as hard as he could that you would stay , and he assured anna andreevna of it
1	one arm rose to take hold of the windowsill , but lowered itself again
1	three days would go by without the stove being lit
1	she 's so kind , and maman loves her so
1	a personal meeting , to the joy and pride of the whole army , was refused , and instead of the sovereign , prince dolgorukov , the victor at wischau , was sent with savary to negotiate with napoleon , on the chance that these negotiations , contrary to expectation , had as their purpose a real desire for peace
1	she just knew you ’ d spend the whole evening with the other one
1	the subject he chose was the nativity of jesus
1	an hour later the order was issued in london that no ship laden for france was to be allowed to leave port , not even the mail boat
1	his face expressed calm piety and submission to the will of god
1	porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar ; d'artagnan , still unseen , leaned on the other side
1	the fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible
1	but he sat motionless at the table , kept silent , and refused to speak
1	together with this refusal of the colonel , he decided that it was necessary to employ a ruse so that , on leaving orel , he could make the italian officer accept some money , which he clearly needed
1	she went up to them
1	good people , have pity on me , an orphan
1	i ca not understand how you dare utter her name in my presence , if you really are svidrigaïlov
1	the bared trees , and the sand , and the stones , and the roofs of the houses , and the green spire of the church , and the angles of the distant white house—all this was etched with unnatural distinctness , with the finest lines , in the transparent air
1	she says it all right in my face
1	so he went to find the queen , and , as was his habit , accosted her with new threats against those who surrounded her
1	came from the crowd
1	he said that after the sixteenth he could not answer for anything
1	i am done for !
1	ah , how frightful it is !
1	pustovalov and olenka , once they were married , had a good life
1	i missed astonishing chances and tried not to get angry , but to succeed by coolheadedness and confidence
1	) , but the thing is that he was deceived , that ’ s why i insist that he be vindicated ; that ’ s why i say that he deserves to be pitied in his simplicity , and can not be left without support ; otherwise he , too , will come out as a crook in this affair
1	she instantly placed under the luckless man 's head a pillow , which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him
1	but for pierre this bright star with its long , luminous tail did not arouse any frightening feeling
1	it came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked
1	but russia is such a wondrous land that , if you say something about one collegiate assessor , all collegiate assessors , from riga to kamchatka , will unfailingly take it to their own account
1	well , you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score ; but there 's another thing worries me
1	if the uttering of this word without any witnesses had put ivan ivanovich beside himself and in such a rage as god keep us from ever seeing in any man—what now , only consider , gentle readers , what now , when this deadly word was uttered in a gathering that included many ladies , before whom ivan ivanovich liked to be especially proper ?
1	however , as you wish he was obviously displeased
1	i hope no one receives him here , despite his wealth
1	there could not be a better chance
1	of course , i could not put anything together then , but all the same i remember it
1	i turned to him from the sledge
1	felton named the baron de winter , the unknown man would name no one , and declared that he would make himself known to the duke alone
1	not painfully , by god !
1	and you , my dear , you really suspected nothing all the while ?
1	it happens not seldom in the world that the earth shakes from one end to the other : learned people say it is because somewhere by the sea there is a mountain out of which flames burst and burning rivers flow
1	you needn ’ t worry , there will be no tears or entreaties , as before , at least not on my part
1	but my nose really has vanished !
1	oh , it poured out by itself quite effortlessly
1	another pretext was her snuff , which seemed to her now dry , now damp , now poorly rubbed
1	you must get some rest , your serenity , said schneider
1	i would thus find myself more at ease , facilius natans , with a subject of my own choice , which would be to these tough theological questions what ethics is to metaphysics in philosophy
1	we were present at the scene of the two captives ' confrontation
1	to let me go first
1	but i did not guess , and a wicked feeling took hold of meyou just wait , i thought
1	his life there , however , was excellent
1	he had clearly forgotten all about pierre
1	it means that i am sick to death of you all and i want to be alone , raskolnikov answered calmly
1	can it be that this worthless oksana will never get out of my head ?
1	choub goggled his eyes when the blacksmith came in , and did not know which to marvel at : that the blacksmith had resurrected , or that the blacksmith had dared to come to him , or that he had got himself up so foppishly as a zaporozhye cossack
1	cousinage dangereux voisinage , [ ] she added
1	no , what i said to you , bonacieux picked up , was only so as to know if we will be coming home late
1	you hint at a crime committed , you say , by my brother
1	there 's a smell of hay and of something else very good
1	for more than twenty years you have had free quarters , with heat , light , servants , besides having the right to work as you want and as much as you want , or even not to work at all
1	he himself had spent the past night lying on the sofa
1	i do not want to and i wo not
1	he might still have a struggle to come with svidrigaïlov
1	if she shows pure repentance and changes her life , then i will marry her
1	you should have taken him to the police station all the same , said the man in the long coat
1	that shows it 's not locked , but fastened with the hook !
1	then he remembered rogozhin himself : recently at the burial , then in the park , then—suddenly here in the corridor , when he had hidden himself in the corner that time and waited for him with a knife
1	when the soup had been brought , and he had begun upon it , nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting
1	katerina ivanovna was busy with the dying man ; she was giving him water , wiping the blood and sweat from his head , setting his pillow straight , and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest
1	inquiring of madame lippevechsel who was busy laying the table while katerina ivanovna was away at the cemetery , he heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair , that all the lodgers had been invited , among them some who had not known the dead man , that even andrey semyonovitch lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel with katerina ivanovna , that he , pyotr petrovitch , was not only invited , but was eagerly expected as he was the most important of the lodgers
1	[ ] they sent the german pahlen to new york , to america , to fetch the frenchman moreau , [ ] he said , alluding to the invitation made to moreau that year to enter the russian service , wonders ! !
1	leave us to ourselves , without a book , and we will immediately get confused , lost – we wo not know what to join , what to hold to , what to love and what to hate , what to respect and what to despise
1	the wolf ran on and jumped heavily over a hole that lay in his path
1	nevertheless , he graduated successfully , because he had his protectors
1	pierre unfolded the cool napkin and , deciding to break the silence , glanced at natasha and princess marya
1	at last , faltering and continually glancing at her daughter , she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance
1	he then walked slowly another ten paces away and again halted
1	they broke two squares , your excellency
1	though he had beaten me two years part one earlier , he had always needed me , not only for his boots ; he used to tell me everything
1	yes , but i forgot i really must go home things to do pierre said hurriedly
1	sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and code
1	you asked for me , my young friend ?
1	his chest was covered with a coat of mail
1	mama always told me about everything at home , usually when she came with soup to feed me ( when i still could not eat by myself ) , in order to entertain me ; while i persistently tried to show each time that this information had little interest for me , and therefore i did not ask for any details about nastasya egorovna , and even remained quite silent
1	something awkward , at any rate , can be noticed in him each time he achieves some such goal
1	she stands pale , motionless as a statue , and catches his every step with her eyes
1	you will be no better off for that !
1	in the end they very often become disappointed
1	he plays on the different uses of the word ( who wants to want according to a little table ?
1	why , have you been a card‐sharper then ?
1	it was evident that all was not yet over
1	for my own part , i will observe that almost every actuality , though it has its immutable laws , is almost always incredible and implausible
1	dear women , dear girls , love the rich carpenter !
1	on the eleventh of october , , one of the infantry regiments just arrived in braunau had halted half a mile from the town , waiting to be reviewed by the commander in chief
1	i ’ ll kneel down and grovel at his feet until he does , otherwise i won ’ t leave !
1	and the queen brought her beautiful hand to her bodice
1	planchet followed his master 's movement , exactly as if he was his shadow , and found himself trotting beside him
1	the blacksmith looked distractedly around the corners of the room , catching from time to time the far-resounding songs of the carolers
1	there is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist
1	julie was preparing to leave moscow the next day and was giving a farewell soirée
1	mrs belov praised the gifts and admired her cotton fabric
1	every half hour , without taking his eyes off the book , he pours himself a glass of vodka and drinks it , then , without looking , feels for the pickle and takes a bite
1	in one instant his whole face as if melted into the sweetest smile
1	yes , you must have exaggerated !
1	it seemed strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance , no trace of disgust , no tremor in her hand
1	i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty-fourth , but i thought that the sooner it happened , the surer it would be
1	i wo not , i wo not
1	sachez , monseigneur , pour tout ce qui a rapport à mes sentiments intimes , je ne rends compte qu ' à dieu et à ma conscience , [ ] she concluded , touching her high , beautiful breasts with her hand and glancing up at the sky
1	xxiii : the rendezvous so you think i have something to fear ?
1	she always addressed him with a joyful , trusting smile , meant for him alone , in which there was something more significant than what was in the general smile that always adorned her face
1	mavra kuzminishna sent me , they have brought some wounded officers , will you allow them to ?
1	the man 's asking for the sake of art , not for some trifle
1	they talked of battle and also did not believe in the nearness of battle
1	suddenly the already very drunk collaborator on the firebrand , who had been sitting in glum silence , addressed ivan ilyich directly and , his eyes flashing , began to reply on behalf of the whole company
1	then , casting a last glance at the handsome young man , who was barely twenty-five years old , and whom he left lying there , insensible and perhaps dead , he heaved a sigh over the strange destiny that leads men to xx : the journey destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist
1	when i came into my tiny closet , even though i had been waiting for him all those three days , my eyes clouded over , as it were , and my heart gave such a throb that i even stopped in the doorway
1	in his essay the storyteller ( ) , walter benjamin wrote : experience passed on from mouth to mouth is the source from which all storytellers have drawn
1	and the soldier passed by
1	bazin , who had remained standing and had listened to the whole controversy with pious jubilation , rushed to them , took the curate 's breviary and the jesuit 's missal , and walked respectfully ahead of them to clear the way
1	and there was the fourth storey , here was the door , here was the flat opposite , the empty one
1	in fact , as soon as the blizzard arose and the wind began cutting right into their eyes , choub showed repentance and , pulling his ear-flapped hat further down on his head , treated himself , the devil , and the chum to abuse
1	excuse me [ ] dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset , and that the last time raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too late—translator
1	father andrei asked nina ivanovna
1	what was kovalev 's horror as well as amazement when he recognized him as his own nose !
1	he was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister , sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes , just as all good little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed
1	she evidently leaned all the way out of the window , because he could hear the rustle of her dress and even her breathing
1	the result of all this was that each of them wholeheartedly accepted the mission for which he had been summoned
1	finally they parted : once more gratitude , again guardian angel , again mitenka , and pavel pavlovich finally took his spouse and the uhlan to put them on the train
1	and everything was in order , except the footgear
1	he did not suspect , for instance , that the epanchins , having in mind such an important step as the deciding of their daughter ’ s fate , would not have dared not to show him , prince lev nikolaevich , to the little old dignitary , the acknowledged benefactor of their family
1	how often olga ivanovna herself had taken refuge behind that painting !
1	the wounded , waiting their turn by the tents , wheezed , moaned , wept , shouted , cursed , begged for vodka
1	the prince , incidentally , was greatly interested in his new guest who accompanied the general ; he guessed clearly that he was evgeny pavlovich radomsky , of whom he had heard so much and had thought more than once
1	you must tell me
1	she had a fortune , you know
1	m de tréville made them repeat this news twice , and each time his companions saw his face darken
1	they may be of use some time
1	but he still did not begin the action
1	excuse me , please , brother
1	give me , then , the strength to suffer
1	it would be much better for him
1	oh , she was smiling and joking ; but it was only from her immeasurable kindness , because her whole soul was filled at that moment , as i later realized , with such enormous care of her own and such strong and powerful feeling , that she could talk with me and answer my trifling , irksome questions only as one answers a little boy who has asked some importunate , childish question , in order to get rid of him
1	then he began to reflect on the events that had just occurred
1	he was also some sort of partner in these shares , and later he came to me from that gentleman in hamburg , with trifles , naturally , and i did not even know why myself , there was no mention of shares
1	if one ca not control one 's patients , how is one to cure them ?
1	cried d'artagnan , you could not possibly have arrived more opportunely ; the food wo not even have had time to get cold !
1	that must be true
1	everything about sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment
1	nastasya lighted them from a step below
1	i love you terribly , liza !
1	no , i am wrong ; that simplifies a great deal
1	but to protest right then would have meant breaking with them at once , which , though it did not frighten me at all , would have harmed my essential aims , and therefore i accepted the post silently for the time being , my silence protecting my dignity
1	( so all the frenchmen called pierre )
1	below them hang costly muskets , sabers , harquebuses , lances
1	this is a letter of that same stolbeev , following whose death a case arose between versilov and the princes sokolsky over his will
1	he not only was not interested in whether he would get to petersburg sooner or later , or whether he would or would not find a place to rest in this station , but , compared with the thoughts that occupied him then , it was all the same to him whether he spent a few hours or his whole life in this station
1	i do not even know with whom i am speaking , sir , pavel pavlovich added , i even think there is no reason for us to continue
1	from the very first i was brought up short there by a certain officer
1	and please do not think i am doing you a service ; quite the contrary , as soon as you came in , i saw how you could help me ; to begin with , i am weak in spelling , and secondly , i am sometimes utterly adrift in german , so that i make it up as i go along for the most part
1	that ’ s the highest independence of personal dignity , that means a direct challenge … no , it ’ s gigantic strength of spirit !
1	the smoke , especially thick because of the fog , at first prevented him from seeing anything ; but the other shot he was expecting did not follow
1	and he tried to draw him away , but he tore himself away from his hand , and , beside himself with horror , ran to the horse
1	he suddenly recollected himself
1	is that a polish mazughrka ?
1	it was indeed a miracle of the brush
1	bagration , knowing bolkonsky to be a favorite and trusted adjutant , received him with a superior officer 's special distinction and indulgence , explained to him that there would probably be a battle that day or the next , and allowed him full freedom to stay by him during the battle or to supervise the order of retreat in the rear guard , which was also very important
1	and what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be thirty‐two and able to begin a new life !
1	where are you going ?
1	or , for instance , once having imagined that so-and-so was afraid or ought to be afraid for such-and-such reason , he no longer doubted that the man was indeed afraid , as in an axiom
1	however , he had not lost sight of milady , and in the mirror caught the change that had just come over her face
1	prince andrei said in the same tone
1	his rooms were not entered directly from the passage , but through the landlady 's two almost empty rooms
1	then suddenly in the morning they come and tell me that marie is dead
1	she wanted to cry
1	in reality , all these movements forward and backward did nothing to alleviate or alter the situation of the troops
1	the evening will be fine , if only we do not have a storm
1	suddenly a bright light flashed into his room
1	and why , one asked , did she talk incessantly and laugh so much with sisoy , while with him , her son , she was serious , usually silent , bashful , which did not become her at all ?
1	she said , with the look of an exultant hawk
1	he has the strangest last name
1	it was nearly eight o'clock
1	he turns another way—there stands a third wife
1	indeed , it would be hard to impersonate any greater deference and self-satisfaction )
1	but no matter , another time !
1	however , aramis was in a good position and could still defend himself
1	what makes you conclude that she ’ ll reject me ?
1	natasha listened for a long time to the sounds that reached her from outside and inside , and did not stir
1	barclay de tolly tried to lead his army in the best fashion , so as to fulfill his duty and earn the glory of a great general
1	i sent uvarka to listen at dawn , his bass said after a moment 's silence
1	no , katerina , i told you your father was a bad man ; he does nothing in the orthodox way
1	ah , you are going to have a fight with lambert again !
1	now , that you can not say , my most gentle friend and benefactor—that i am trying to offend you
1	nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter
1	lizaveta prokofyevna asked sharply
1	will you stay if the enemy takes it ?
1	what deadly noose had tatyana let on about , sending me to anna andreevna ?
1	apart from the calculation which made anatole necessary for him , the very process of manipulating another person 's will was a pleasure , a habit , and a necessity for dolokhov
1	there i simply destroyed it : the soup i poured out the window into the nettles or a certain other place , the beef i either threw out the window to the dog , or wrapped in paper , put in my pocket , and took out later , well , and all the rest
1	humility , meekness , lowliness , and at the same time firmness , strength , real strength—that is your mother 's character
1	he said to raskolnikov , as they went out into the street
1	nobody makes frock coats from it
1	personal human feeling for a brief moment got the upper hand over that artificial phantom of life which he had served so long
1	am i not perhaps interfering with your pleasures ?
1	i did not want to question the landlady about anything , and had generally resolved to stop all contacts with them and even to move out of the apartment as soon as possible ; and therefore , the moment my coffee was brought , i latched the door again
1	all this seems to flash before me now
1	when i asked him myself , he told me that he had stopped loving you long ago , that even the memory of you was painful for him , but that he pitied you , and that when he remembered you , his heart felt pierced forever
1	and i , of course , as is my custom , will turn coward , start mincing before her , covering myself with the skirts of my dressing gown , start smiling , start lying
1	the day after that , the drums beat assembly
1	it 's unpleasant but my fiancée you must come to berg went on ; he was about to say to dinner , but changed his mind and said to tea , and with a quick movement of his tongue let out a small , round smoke ring that fully embodied his dreams of happiness
1	akhmakov has come , and they have got a pistol !
1	a boat , a boat was shouted in the crowd
1	oh , in her frenzy she cries constantly that she does not acknowledge her guilt , that she is the victim of people , the victim of a debaucher and a villain ; but whatever she tells you , know that she is the first not to believe it herself and that , on the contrary , she believes with all her conscience that she herself … is the guilty one
1	biblical tradition says that absence of work—idleness—was the condition of the first man 's blessedness before his fall
1	he came here at once after his wife 's funeral
1	and the hay is so tall , soft , rich !
1	for the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale
1	they hastened to ask and answer each other about a thousand little things that could interest only them
1	i could rest here
1	yes , she assented in a faint voice
1	that 's all we need
1	before i could blink an eye , he snatched the revolver from lambert and hit him on the head with it as hard as he could
1	but since the time of her visit , the old countess began to talk about her several times a day
1	was all he was able to utter with failing breath
1	he made up his mind to keep quiet and see what would happen
1	three times it was , we all heard it , shouted a third
1	just as you will sometimes meet on their unfinished landscape a nymph painted upside down , which the artist , finding no other place , sketched on the dirty background of an old work he once delighted in painting
1	this was raevsky , who had spent the whole day at the main point of the field of borodino
1	the countess was to wear a damson velvet dress , and the two girls white gauze dresses over pink silk slips , with roses at the bodice
1	what moves may always rise
1	and do not tell me any lies because can it be that they will take me away from here ?
1	in spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly and that everyone should taste them , in spite of the agonising cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse during the last few days , she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of the dinner , interspersing her remarks with lively and uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of her landlady
1	i am now almost convinced of it
1	they gave him the whole of europe and came to teach us !
1	well , and can i , do i have the right to regard such a slanderer , such a harlot , one might say , and monster , as my own nephew , the only son of my late sister anisya ?
1	but he sat down again for a second game
1	come , i say , and do not be afraid , athos went on
1	and i absolutely wanted to , because i was told
1	it was already late , petya had eaten nothing , he was streaming with sweat ; but he would not go home , and together with the diminished but still quite large crowd , stood before the palace , looking through the palace windows while the sovereign dined , expecting something further , and equally envious both of the dignitaries who drove up to the entrance , to the sovereign 's dinner , and of the palace footmen who served at the table and flitted past the windows
1	i love the solemnity of boredom—however , i have already told you that
1	the three musketeers i am not joking , replied athos
1	the closer he came , the more strongly , far more strongly ( as if moral feeling was also subject to the law of attraction , which increases in inverse proportion to the square of the distance ) , he thought of his home ; at the last station before otradnoe , he gave the driver three roubles for vodka and soon , breathless as a boy , was running up the front porch of the house
1	we passed just by the park , saw two deer , and such a wonderful house !
1	she did not cry when , at the moment of taking leave of her , he kissed her hand for the last time
1	there , you see , i have caught you out
1	the prince simply trembled
1	what have they come here for , i ask you ?
1	yet he turned his eyes to the coffin every other moment , as if asking the inadvertent question : what if she rises , what if she gets up ?
1	dron came and confirmed dunyasha 's words : the muzhiks had come on the princess 's orders
1	fair enough , said athos
1	i thought today 's fête was cancelled
1	finally , when i had drunk two cups , tatyana pavlovna suddenly got up , took a pair of scissors from the table , and said : give me your pocket , we must take out the letter—we ca not cut it with her here !
1	i asked suddenly , as if losing my reason
1	good thoughts and sound decisions to you !
1	the count led the male guests to his study , to offer them his prize collection of turkish pipes
1	that ’ s all i need for at least two weeks
1	and you went there on his invitation , imprudent as you are !
1	she was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six , with brown hair and blue eyes , a slightly upturned nose , admirable teeth , a marbled complexion of rose and opal
1	i ask myself : should i not , indeed , consult one of my colleagues ?
1	anyhow , the roofs are all thatched with rushes ; a willow , an oak , and two apple trees lean on them with their spreading branches
1	it will be freezing cold and everything became still
1	i ’ m very glad you want to resemble a human being
1	look , look , said this adjutant , looking not at the distant troops , but down the hill in front of him
1	but , tell me , how could kraft 's deduction weaken the striving for the general human cause ?
1	just what he wants , you may be sure , but once take him up , you wo not get rid of him we know the sort !
1	obviously unwillingly , with the painful certainty that he would not be understood , he voiced his thought more than once in the most varied circumstances
1	maybe the flints in your pistols are worn out ?
1	it was not so at all !
1	korostelev stood by the door of the study , twisting his left mustache with his right hand
1	ah , do sit down , please !
1	and i swear that here , too , there was something as if similar : i had been humiliated , searched , declared a thief , destroyed—well , then know , all of you , that you have guessed right , i am not only a thief , i am an informer as well !
1	they say that was the marked characteristic of gogol , among the writers
1	a moment later the count was admitted
1	let 's have your idea , aramis !
1	to regret the world is to regret the devil
1	mikhail fyodorovich should have gone abroad long ago , but he keeps postponing his departure each week
1	as for grimaud , he was ordered to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload the weapons
1	that fat-bellied rogue got the whole estate
1	so much the better for me , monsieur , if you speak to me , as you say , with frankness ; for then you do me the honor of valuing this similarity of taste
1	strangely , one of the things i liked in his little letter ( one small page of small format ) was that he did not say a word about the university , did not ask me to alter my decision , did not reproach me for not wanting to study , in short , did not produce any parental folderol of that sort , as usually happens , and yet that was precisely bad on his part , in the sense that it testified still more to his negligence about me
1	do you want to betray him ?
1	only i remember that , during our scuffle in the rue férou , i received a sword stroke which , after two weeks or so , produced exactly the same effect
1	how is it that they do not both see all that , or is it that they do not want to see ?
1	tatyana pavlovna turned utterly ferocious
1	they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking ; they admired her too for being so little , and , in fact , did not know what to admire her most for
1	pierre took it and began to read :
1	zverkov sprawled on the couch , placing one foot on a little round table
1	not at all , cried zametov , obviously embarrassed
1	something else tormented him , something like remorse
1	he examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing serious— something seemed to have gone to your head
1	dounia seemed strangely impressed by svidrigaïlov 's offer
1	but , to his surprise , balashov received that day , through duroc , an invitation to the emperor 's table
1	well , let them come and sit down ; there on the sofa is fine , and on the other sofa
1	this man had once been led to a scaffold , along with others , and a sentence of death by firing squad was read out to him , for a political crime
1	thought andrei yefimych , shyly wrapping himself in the robe , and feeling that his new costume made him look like a prisoner
1	i understood at once , as soon as she came in , that she was bound to throw herself upon me ; i was even slightly convinced that she had , in fact , come for that , and therefore i suddenly became extraordinarily casual ; and it did not cost me anything , because , after what had just taken place , i still went on being in joy and radiance
1	why did i ask so stupidly what he greases his boots with !
1	where is he , and who is he now ?
1	the sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue , which is so rare in the neva
1	then she ventured to ask what had become of felton
1	because he 's young , because he 's poor , because he 's a relation because you do not love him yourself
1	why do not you wash , it 's not clean , said prince andrei
1	fly to aid your brother , whoever he may be , instruct him who errs , raise up the fallen , and never nurse any malice or enmity against your brother
1	i should like to know what
1	if you don ’ t know how to look here , you won ’ t learn abroad
1	thought raskolnikov , standing in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross‐roads , and he looked about him , as though expecting from someone a decisive word
1	princess marya was not in moscow and out of danger , as prince andrei thought
1	pierre listened to what the colonel said and nodded approvingly
1	a fine clerk he is !
1	his intentions were unmistakable
1	pierre says that everybody 's suffering , tormented , becoming depraved , and that our duty is to help our neighbors
1	a penetrating study of the metapsychology of tabooing and the meanings of the unsaid in dostoevsky
1	but he learned it only later ; at the present moment he was not very observant
1	what do you mean ?
1	one 's ashamed to speak of it
1	ach , we are so different , he cried again , we are not alike
1	doctor , come and have a bite to eat !
1	even fierce wolf cubs will not tear their own mother !
1	ah , that 's terrible , terrible !
1	what is this war ?
1	his own family was small ; he had been a widower for twenty years and had only one daughter , the general 's widow , who was now expected any day from moscow , a young person whose character he unquestionably feared
1	he appeared by now to be extremely weak , but as he became more and more drunk , he became more and more talkative
1	and i suddenly felt that i did not have strength enough to struggle out of this whirl , though i had been able to restrain myself , keep silent , and not question nastasya egorovna after her wondrous stories !
1	lizaveta prokofyevna suddenly became frightened of something
1	here 's what i think
1	oh , yes , razumihin answered quickly
1	in that case , supposing he was at liberty , he would rejoin her in france , at the convent of the carmelites in béthune
1	another time he stopped , asked :
1	no , some other time
1	the grandmother , or granny , as she was known at home , very stout , homely , with thick eyebrows and a little mustache , spoke loudly , and from her voice and manner of speaking it was clear that she was the head of the household
1	three and a half miles , your majesty
1	it goes without saying that , for the rest of my life , my gratitude will know no bounds this meant she was now offering me a reward—money , maybe
1	it may be so with a simple peasant , but with one of our sort , an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side , it 's a dead certainty
1	fascination , and at the same time perplexity , showed on the faces of all the listening girls as well ; to everyone it seemed as if impossible and shameful to sing like that , and at the same time all these little faces and eyes burned and shone as if waiting for something more
1	why do not you catch him then ?
1	but she is not very clever either , eh ?
1	the old man was followed by nina alexandrovna , kolya , and , last of all , ippolit
1	he said that the peasants were obdurate , that at the present moment it was not sensible to antagonorize them , with no military detachment around , that it would be better to send for a detachment first
1	the worst thing , he thought , will be if they don ’ t receive me and think something bad about me , or perhaps receive me and start laughing in my face … ah , never mind !
1	the girl listened for some time , walking faster and faster , her head lowered and her face covered by a veil , afraid and trembling , but suddenly she stopped , threw back the veil from her very pretty , as far as i remember , but thin face , and with flashing eyes cried to us : ah , what scoundrels you are !
1	i must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear
1	a flash of terrible joy , quick as thought , sprang up in milady 's eyes
1	i see that you , too , are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity
1	he shook my hand warmly , but did not kiss me
1	well , that completely alters the aspect of affairs
1	xxvii : the wife of athos the present caused him no grief ; he shrugged his shoulders when anyone spoke to him of the future ; his secret was therefore in the past , as had been vaguely mentioned to d'artagnan
1	he said that , as he was the cause of the delay , he must bear all the burden of it
1	i never touch vodka , for it 's against my convictions
1	approaching tarutino , kutuzov noticed some cavalrymen , who were taking their horses to water across the road on which his caleche was driving
1	well , here i woke up
1	but do sit down , for mercy 's sake , sit down !
1	you did not see , you were crying all the time
1	let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now , because we have thrown up everything , and have come here relying on you , and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands
1	she really keeps him under her heel , but once it comes to arguments , she has no words of her own , she just speaks his words , nikolai added , yielding to that irresistible impulse that makes us judge the nearest and dearest people
1	it was your fault , sonia , with your advice to make it shorter , and now you see the child is quite deformed by it
1	maybe you have not seen it , but i have seen good people brought up in this tradition of unlimited power , as they become more irritated over the years , become cruel , coarse , know it , ca not help themselves , and become more and more unhappy
1	but who is he ? —but how can it be permitted ?
1	could not arrive at anything constructive
1	said the young man
1	sonya also bustled about constantly ; but the goal of her bustling was the opposite of natasha 's
1	ah , they are the french !
1	she had made her first practical step with extreme resoluteness by marrying mr ptitsyn ; but in marrying him she did not say to herself : if i ’ m to be mean , i ’ ll be mean , so long as i reach my goal—something gavrila ardalionovich would not have failed to say on such an occasion ( and even almost did say in her presence , when approving of her decision as an older brother )
1	the preparations are the bad part
1	i have the pleasure and blessed consolation of finding you in good health , he said to the grandmother , and it was hard to tell whether he was joking or serious
1	when the sovereign had ridden by almost all the regiments , the troops began a ceremonial march past him , and rostov , on bedouin , newly purchased from denisov , rode at the tail end of his squadron—that is , alone and in full view of the sovereign
1	a man who , ten years before , would have been afraid of going every day to a house where there was a seventeen-year-old girl , so as not to compromise her and bind himself , now boldly came to her every day and treated her not as a prospective bride , but as an acquaintance who had no sex
1	yes , he is there
1	it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way , though not much so
1	first of all , i gave you fifty
1	it makes no difference to me , i am ready for everything
1	by the'way , i have two letters here in my portfolio : one needs to be delivered and explained personally , the other is to the bank— and there , too and here he charged me with two supposedly urgent errands , which supposedly called for extraordinary effort and attention
1	never mind that it 's red inside , pulkheria ivanovna , afanasy ivanovich would say , accepting a none-too-small slice , sometimes it 's no good even when it 's red
1	i love an honest , pure life , sin is vile to me , i myself do not know what i am doing
1	and she threw herself onto the sofa again
1	the tall , ancient iconostasis showed a profound decrepitude ; its openwork , covered in gold , now gleamed only in sparks
1	are you authorized by her majesty to confide it to me ?
1	i knew nothing about it either !
1	like a clerk , he wore no beard , nor moustache , but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush
1	and he handed it back to d'artagnan , yet without ceasing to look at it
1	gavrila ardalionovich was , they say , dumbfounded by the suggestion and so much at a loss , showed such extreme perplexity on his face , that aglaya laughed at him as if in hysterics and ran away from him upstairs to nina alexandrovna , where her parents found her
1	whatever may befall , said d'artagnan , placing his hand on his heart and bowing , i shall be eternally grateful to your eminence for what he has done for me at this moment
1	seeing that there was no more hope of making his master give up his plan , planchet heaved a deep sigh and set about currying the third horse
1	you spoke of formality just now , apropos of the inquiry , you know
1	but the cossack seized hold of a branch and only the horse fell to the bottom
1	you are putting in a lot for oats , grandpa , said matvei sawich
1	repeated sonia , weeping hysterically and wringing her hands
1	she went and stood before her mirror , and looked at herself
1	you want to come , too ?
1	i ordered books , too
1	i told them you were coming it began with the socialist doctrine
1	all of mankind 's sciences have followed this path
1	read them her mother said pensively , asking about the verses that prince andrei had written in natasha 's album
1	and if mr luzhin had been of unalloyed gold , or one huge diamond , she would never have consented to become his legal concubine
1	not that way , said rogozhin
1	this melancholy , which did not keep her from making merry , also did not keep the young people who visited her from passing the time pleasantly
1	it might be worse not to obey him , said zossimov on the stairs
1	i ca not stand that insolent loudmouth
1	excuse me [ ] dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after sunset , and that the last time raskolnikov visited the police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming too late—translator
1	you are not looking in the right place it 's in the fourth gospel , she whispered sternly , without looking at him
1	said mme bonacieux , again addressing this epithet to her husband
1	her fate is enacted in a different realm
1	princess marya noticed it and looked at rostov gratefully , with that luminous gaze which made one forget the plainness of her face
1	now , i have heard that they humor you , fools that you are – they allow you to have lovers here
1	near the tavern the road became a dusty track , the dust of which was always black
1	while rostov was making these considerations and sorrowfully riding away from the sovereign , captain von toll happened to arrive in the same place and , seeing the sovereign , rode straight up to him , offered him his services , and helped him to cross the ditch on foot
1	what is he saying ?
1	there are insults , avdotya romanovna , which no goodwill can make us forget
1	because i love you !
1	d'you hear , she will gallop !
1	early in the morning of the twelfth , he came out of the tent , pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niémen , and watched through a field glass the streams of his troops flowing out of the wilkowiski forest and pouring over the three bridges thrown across the niémen
1	my father listened to the story all the while with undivided attention , and finally said : and the portrait is now with your nephew ?
1	in the corridor he met his roommate nesvitsky and the joker zherkov ; they were laughing at something , as usual
1	simply up and came
1	not true , alphonsinka 's a spy , lambert 's a spy !
1	and leave it to me
1	if it was not you talking , i might take it in an offensive way
1	for whom had they made all these preparations then ?
1	let 's go to maman
1	this business is turning my brain !
1	but before he got all the way down , dense crowds of russian soldiers appeared before him , who , falling , stumbling , and shouting , ran merrily and stormily up to the battery
1	and the whole reason is that they do not know whether god exists or not
1	( this was impolite both towards prince vassily in anna pav-lovna 's drawing room and towards anna pavlovna , who had received the news with as much joy ; but he could not help himself )
1	i feel sad beforehand !
1	what then : did he love that woman or hate her ?
1	ivan ivanovich has big , expressive eyes of a tobacco color and a mouth somewhat resembling the letter v ; ivan nikiforovich has small , yellowish eyes that disappear completely between his bushy eyebrows and plump cheeks , and a nose that looks like a ripe plum
1	i should live so long , brother !
1	but what would rothschild be then ?
1	have you noticed that the most refined blood-shedders have almost all been the most civilized gentlemen , to whom the various attilas and stenka razins [ ] sometimes could not hold a candle ?
1	and the other one 's not here !
1	there 's only one saint here , and that 's mama , but she , too you will frighten him !
1	i wanted to wait , but now in fact she made as if to rise
1	the real murderer dropped those ear‐rings
1	she cried as she said good-bye to uncle , sonya recalled
1	to‐morrow all this nonsense will be over to‐day he certainly did drive him away
1	the countess , with a coldness such as her son had never seen , replied to him that he was of age , that prince andrei was going to marry without his father 's consent , and that he could do the same , but that she would never recognize this intriguer as her daughter
1	no , he 's a freemason , i found out
1	the prince thought with a smile
1	the prince stood thinking
1	one could not , in fact , suffer from memories constantly ; one could rest and enjoy oneself—in the intermissions
1	they even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking ; they admired her too for being so little , and , in fact , did not know what to admire her most for
1	oh , monsieur , said the old man , do not ask me anything !
1	i got it ready some time ago a powder
1	indeed , what was i afraid of , and what could they do to me with no matter what dialectics ?
1	i had long since recognized the voice
1	a pity , a pity for the fine fellow ; give me the letter
1	but the latter had already succeeded in finding a towel , wetted it and began washing the blood off marmeladov 's face
1	that ’ s good , for certain considerations
1	natasha , you are sixteen years old
1	when she needed to exercise her vocal organs—this happened mainly between six and seven , after a digestive rest in a dark room—then the pretext was the telling of ever the same stories to ever the same listeners
1	a sleepy serf girl would go and rummage in the cupboards , and afanasy ivanovich would eat a little plateful , after which he usually said : there , that feels better
1	and he looked around to see if his opinion was shared
1	he seemed to see abysses of a dark and unknown depth in milady 's soul
1	everybody was looking , and i felt an extraordinary pleasure precisely because i was preaching while the note was in my pocket
1	i told you : a gossip and a little brat , said ganya
1	are you sure he was at home yesterday ?
1	she said , still hoping it was a joke
1	warming up , katerina ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in t—— , on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to give lessons in her boarding‐school , one a most respectable old frenchman , one mangot , who had taught katerina ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in t—— , and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms
1	the dear image of the poor child flashed sadly before him
1	during the first period of his acquaintance with speransky , prince andrei had a passionate feeling of admiration for him , resembling what he used to feel for bonaparte
1	you do not go about things lightly
1	keller agreed with feeling
1	the tartar looked at the sky
1	you think that this enthusiast waving his arms is telling how his wife threw a little ball out the window at a completely unknown officer ?
1	vereshchagin is a traitor and a turncoat , who will get the punishment he deserves , said rastopchin , with that hot anger with which people speak remembering an offense
1	you are just little ; we are both little , but he 's big
1	a man must be blind not to see it !
1	the prince , whom she herself had told that she sometimes went to vasin for advice , had taken this news with extreme uneasiness from the very first ; he had begun to be jealous
1	i would take the hundred pistoles
1	[ ] he visited the orphanage , and , having allowed the orphans he had saved to kiss his helping hands , conversed graciously with tutolmin
1	raskolnikov turned and walked away
1	she knew it , and asked herself : and what then ?
1	my tongue is my enemy
1	it seems you haven ’ t come to a cow-barn , gentlemen , my mother and sister are here …
1	but , i say , i have been told berg is going up in a great balloon next sunday from the yusupov garden and will take up passengers at a fee
1	he understood that hidden—latente , as they say in physics— warmth of patriotism which was in all the people he had seen , and which explained for him why all those people were calmly and as if light-mindedly preparing for death
1	every day i meant to talk with mashenka , only i did not know how to approach her so as to avoid any female screaming
1	the river is overflowing , he thought
1	and why do you call yourself a scoundrel ?
1	now i do not feel guilty before him for anything , not for anything !
1	if not , then as soon as it 's all over , prince vassily sighed , letting it be understood what he meant by the words all over , and the count 's papers are opened , the will and the letter will be sent to the sovereign , and his request will most likely be granted
1	he said , wiping his mouth
1	it 's forbidden in the streets
1	xxviii : the return have some of this ham , d'artagnan , it 's exquisite , said athos , cutting a slice , which he put on the young man 's plate
1	with everyone else things went smoothly , with them unevenly ; everyone else rolled along the rails—they constantly went off the rails
1	she went on , modestly covering her beautiful eyes with her hand , oh , never , never could i !
1	in my view , he said , turning to rostov , he ought simply to beg the sovereign for mercy
1	yes , yes , better , she repeated with conviction , when you go to meet your suffering , then put it on
1	willarski was married to a rich russian woman who had large estates in orel province , and he occupied a temporary position in that town in the provision sector
1	in her cozy room , with icon lamps before the icons , a young boy with a long nose and long hair and in a monk 's cassock was sitting on the sofa beside her at the samovar
1	but , gentlemen , in all this , said d'artagnan , we are not thinking of the queen
1	princess marya was gently stroking her head
1	but allow me to explain raskolnikov put in again , still addressing nikodim fomitch , but trying his best to address ilya petrovitch also , though the latter persistently appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious of him
1	this circumstance speeded the course of things
1	true , he started assuring me later that he had forgotten , and , when he grasped it , he instantly started taking out the fifty roubles , but he became hurried and even turned red
1	the difference between learned europeans and the chinese , who have no science themselves , is quite negligible and purely external
1	if i had been fifteen , i would have turned coward , but , being ten , i feared nothing and pushed my way through the crowd up to the very porch of the palace , just as napoleon was dismounting from his horse
1	and so , even among our nannies , the rank of general was considered the limit of russian happiness and , therefore , was the most popular national ideal of beautiful , peaceful felicity
1	what do people generally say ?
1	a napoleon creep under an old woman 's bed !
1	he began to seek solitude and avoid people
1	that 's why i drink too
1	nastasya egorovna could also find out a thing or two here : she pokes around everywhere
1	the grand inquisitor nevertheless left me in wrath and threatened me with some punishment
1	so you have sold yourself body and soul to the devil for the sake of money !
1	my brother languished in the office
1	it ’ s as if you …
1	what , do you want me to give you a convoy of two battalions that do not exist ?
1	pierre still considered it just as useful and worthy to kill the villain ; but he felt that now he would not do it
1	and who is coming ?
1	moreover , she had another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than fear for herself
1	the way you came running into the drawing room just now , everyone was ashamed of you
1	i am airing them out now ; fine fabric , excellent , just turn it inside out and you can wear it again
1	yes , arkady makarovich , you are a member of an accidental family , as opposed to our still-recent hereditary types , who had a childhood and youth so different from yours
1	he surely has not taken it with him
1	bah , the palais de cristal !
1	the mason cleared his throat hoarsely , as old people do , and called for his servant
1	he walked towards the neva along v—— prospect , but on the way another idea struck him
1	he was sitting in the carriage pale as can be
1	and yet she was three months short of sixteen then
1	all of it—the city , the passersby , the sidewalk i was running along—all of it was suddenly not mine anymore
1	the doctor was thus unable to measure either its direction or its depth ; he could only tell from the patient 's pulse that the case was not serious
1	not anywhere , but on this sofa !
1	well , you could even send kolya ; he ’ d be very pleased to do some spying , rest assured—for you , that is … because everything ’ s relative … ha , ha !
1	she sits here from year 's end to year 's end , the old hag ; her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk !
1	will you hurry up , finally ?
1	is it possible to speak with you about anything serious ?
1	go , little miss , i ’ ll talk more with you , but we ’ ve overstayed here
1	prince vassily fell silent , and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side , now on the other , giving his face an unpleasant expression which never appeared on prince vassily 's face when he was in a drawing room
1	bringing the sword to his throat , he said to the englishman : i could kill you , monsieur , for you are certainly in my hands , but i grant you your life out of love for your sister
1	this was a certain evgeny pavlovich r , still a young man , about twenty-eight , an imperial aide-de-camp , strikingly handsome , of a noble family , a witty , brilliant new man , exceedingly educated , and—somehow much too fabulously wealthy
1	at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes , thread , cotton handkerchiefs , etc
1	that will work out perfectly , for it will not look as though you are making a step towards the queen
1	but in the end he began somehow visibly to lose his indifference , and his attitude towards the prince changed to one not only of condemnation , but also of scornful irony
1	ivan fyodorovich shponka and his aunt this is a chicken , my dear sir , the fat grigory grigorievich went on , cutting it up in the wooden box with a knife
1	if he 's all right , serve him
1	people spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves , boys and girls and old people
1	have you been frightening me so as to lead up to this ?
1	he was so muddled and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa , trying to collect his thoughts
1	what a nice young man !
1	but as they approached yaroslavl , when there again emerged what she might face , and not after many days , but that same evening , princess marya 's agitation reached the utmost limits
1	and she listens to me with tenderness , with pride , with bated breath
1	how do you like what the prince said ?
1	in the corner a light was burning before a small ikon
1	we russians , generally speaking , have never had any stupid , translunary german , and more especially french , romantics , who are not affected by anything ; let the earth crumble under them , let the whole of france perish on the barricades – they are what they are , they wo not change even for the sake of decency , and they will go on singing their translunary songs till their dying day , so to speak , because they are fools
1	not a single thought occurred to him
1	what was the object of it ?
1	almost all madame lippevechsel 's lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms of the flat ; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway , but afterwards they overflowed into the room
1	you can always get money from her
1	and you are going alone ?
1	if he reports that the losses were great—it is not true ; maybe around four thousand , not more , and not even that
1	you could see it for yourself ; and how could i ?
1	cried porthos , doing his best to rid himself of d'artagnan , who was scrambling about on his back , you must be mad to go throwing yourself at people like that !
1	she 's gone out of her mind , said another
1	that was what it meant to lose the habit !
1	the duke bowed and left
1	porthos , aramis , call for help !
1	we must start , dounia , we must start , her mother cried in a flutter
1	despite his nervousness and the sharpness of his judgments , he was liked in town and , behind his back , was affectionately called vanya
1	he had not known , he had had no notion of pain , and therefore was not to blame , but his conscience , as rough and intractable as
1	they , too , had got up to go home , but were lingering in conversation with a friend , who had just come up to them
1	would you perchance deny him the title , madame ?
1	you look pale still
1	i don ’ t remember nikolai lvovich
1	speech about useless objects enters consciousness as a thing , as a ponderable mass , as a fact of language valuable in itself
1	nastasya stood over him
1	i , of course , just sit there smoking
1	i don ’ t want any dinner , kolya
1	i just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there
1	he praised his eminence highly to her , told her that he would unfailingly have entered the cardinal 's guards instead of the king 's guards , if he had known m de cavois , for example , instead of m de tréville
1	from my youth i have been chafed by jealousy , dissatisfaction with myself , lack of faith in what i am doing , i am always poor , i am a vagabond , but you , you are a healthy , normal person , a landowner , a squire—why do you live so uninterestingly , why do you take so little from life ?
1	the prince was about to address the voice from the sofa , but the young girl began to speak and , with a most candid look on her pretty face , said :
1	the prince caught her on his hook , first of all , because he never tried to catch her and , second , because in everybody ’ s eyes he ’ s an idiot
1	people say all kinds of things , rogozhin observed drily
1	it 's always like that , nesvitsky said , waving his hand
1	i turned my whole body convulsively , and suddenly , amidst the deep silence , clearly heard the words : lord jesus christ , our god , have mercy on us
1	dounia wants to arrange it all like this and i quite agree with her
1	dounia 's gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in raskolnikov 's room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life
1	all the wars of napoleon serve as a confirmation of this rule
1	l'empereur pierre repeated , and his face suddenly acquired a sad and embarrassed expression
1	i was joking , he said softly , smiling
1	general armfelt has suggested a beautiful position , with an exposed rear
1	kutuzov 's face was growing more and more preoccupied and sad
1	but perhaps it was raskolnikov 's fancy , for it all lasted but a moment
1	come sit down , you are tired , i will be bound
1	sounds of music were already coming from behind the closed doors
1	there must be a way from the courtyard ; but how to get in there !
1	really , since yesterday all i ’ ve wanted to do is speak russian
1	no doubt i was at fault , and though , owing to the distance in time and to changes in my character , i ’ ve long regarded my deed as someone else ’ s , i nevertheless continue to regret it
1	anyhow , never mind ; particularly if one is economical … do you intend to enter the service ?
1	among the scattered belongings , in the crowd on the square , she , in her costly satin-covered winter coat and bright purple shawl , which covered her head , resembled a tender hothouse flower thrown out on the snow
1	a woman saw him and said : 'this man was also with jesus , meaning that he , too , should be taken and questioned
1	it could not exist , because it was senseless , and to achieve it was impossible
1	today , he began to whisper , the landlord suddenly brought me photographs , vile photographs of women , all naked women in various oriental guises , and began showing them to me through a glass you see , i praised them reluctantly , but that 's just how they brought vile women to that unfortunate man , to make it easier to get him drunk you keep on about von sohn , but enough , prince !
1	what is awaiting you there ?
1	and seizing dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it , he made her bend down to see that he is all right again
1	she was a woman of forty , not at all bad‐looking , fat and buxom , with black eyes and eyebrows , good‐natured from fatness and laziness , and absurdly bashful
1	april of that same year saw the triumph of his comedy the inspector general
1	oh , you are a just man !
1	the only one left alive to her was the oldest boy , and she doted on him , trembled over him
1	but it ca not be that she loves him !
1	petya silently paced the room
1	at one o'clock , then , behind the luxembourg
1	he was suddenly struck too by the thought that sonia meant to go with him
1	about evgeny pavlovich , ganya again expatiated on his own , without being specially asked , which was very strange , because he inserted him into the conversation with no real pretext
1	it is discussed twice in the novel , the second time at length and in a key passage
1	and kitty , who had never let go of d'artagnan 's hand , led him to a dark and winding stairway and , after going up fifteen steps , opened a door
1	at last he noticed that it was beginning to get light
1	my only excuse is that i am not writing for the same reason everyone else writes , that is , for the sake of the reader 's praises
1	he was in a magic kingdom in which everything was possible
1	who the devil can tell ?
1	and he tried to draw him away , but he tore himself away from his hand , and , beside himself with horror , ran to the horse
1	velchaninov had only just caught in the street that very state councillor and necessary gentleman whom he was now trying to catch by coming upon him by chance at his country house , because this official , barely acquainted with velchaninov , but needed for his case , refused to be caught , then as now , and was hiding as well as he could , not wishing for his part to meet with velchaninov ; rejoicing that he had finally run into him , velchaninov walked beside him , hurrying , peeking into his eyes , and trying as well as he could to guide the gray-haired old fox toward a certain theme , toward a certain conversation in which he might divulge and let drop one much-sought and long-awaited little phrase ; but the
1	how free and fresh the air !
1	she refused to believe her ears
1	sofya semyonovna and i have had a job to find them
1	ganya listened very attentively , but , to his sister ’ s surprise , this striking news did not seem to make any striking effect on him
1	and pyotr petrovitch , as though comforted , went back to clicking his beads
1	well , it 's always pleasant to hear words of wisdom
1	one of the first bullets killed him , the bullets that followed killed many of his soldiers
1	besides ordinary interests , pierre heard talk of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the sovereign entered , when to give the ball for the sovereign , whether it should be done by districts or by the whole province and so on ; but as soon as things touched on the war and what the nobility had assembled for , the talk became indecisive and indefinite
1	take me to her !
1	finally , he could not stand it and at exactly one in the afternoon he himself went galloping to the pokrov
1	the rest of the generals understood that , and , leaving aside the question of moscow , spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat
1	and who was it you wouldn ’ t let see me ?
1	she used to see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard‐room , to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her
1	upon my word , luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably , crimson with confusion , to distort my words in this way !
1	i remember it being here for all of fifteen years , yes … fifteen … ivan petrovich began
1	i will sit and silently wait for what comes
1	i recalled it clearly the other day , and it has since stayed with me like a nagging musical tune that refuses to be gotten rid of
1	do not hurl yourself against such a rock : he will smash you like a glass
1	he did not know and did not think where he was going , he had one thought only : that all this must be ended to‐day , once for all , immediately ; that he would not return home without it , because he would not go on living like that
1	on the way there , he thought , if even the major does not split from laughing when he sees me , then it 's a sure sign that whatever 's there is sitting where it should
1	there was lack of precaution on both sides , however , for porfiry petrovitch seemed to be laughing in his visitor 's face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with which the visitor received it
1	but it 's no use going over that !
1	keep on , planchet , keep on !
1	at that point he was found by a friend who came into the room , himself also a painter , a happy fellow , always pleased with himself , not carried away by any far-reaching desires , who worked happily at whatever came along and was even happier to get down to dining and carousing
1	the packet contained a letter with an enclosed three hundred roubles and the necessary certificates concerning liza
1	he was weeping just now and asking to be taken home
1	all these events were an extreme joy for those inevitable frequenters of social gatherings who delight in making the ladies laugh and whose stock was by then completely exhausted
1	the englishman , his lips thrust out , watched from the side
1	but to him who does not fear it , everything belongs
1	he walked , looking about him angrily and distractedly
1	a proper head‐covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in its own way
1	the same thing all over again , said pierre , glancing around
1	are you afraid of having let out some secret ?
1	i told him everything that had been smoldering in me all that time ; i said he was nothing but a pathetic giftlessness and ordinariness , and that there had never been the least sign of an idea in him
1	the windows on the old lady ’ s side were open as before , rogozhin ’ s were closed , and the drawn white blinds seemed to have become still more noticeable in the twilight
1	i will begin by saying that for me there 's no doubt that he loved mama , and if he abandoned her and unmarried her when he went away , it was , of course , because he had become too bored or something of the sort , which , however , happens with everyone in the world , but which is always hard to explain
1	please go inside , have some rest
1	in short , it 's all been known from prehistoric times
1	but you have only to assume that i , too , am a man et nihil humanum in a word , that i am capable of being attracted and falling in love ( which does not depend on our will ) , then everything can be explained in the most natural manner
1	madame , the young man said , bowing , i am unable to refuse someone who asks me in that way
1	for the ancients , these questions were decided by faith in the direct participation of a divinity in the affairs of mankind
1	he was not thinking of treason , he was trying to do everything in the best possible way , he thought it all over : but that is why he 's unfit
1	why , then , did not you have yourself transported to paris ?
1	oh , what an unbearable child !
1	i understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage , but it 's simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated
1	and if he had done all of it together—caught the fish , and played the fiddle , and towed the barges , and slaughtered the geese—what capital it would have produced !
1	he had apparently met it sometime somewhere
1	and that thought , which occurred to her for the first time , filled her soul with joy
1	was it boring for you ?
1	that 's why they so dislike the living process of life ; they do not want a living soul !
1	no more of your jokes !
1	i have taken you on a charming stroll ; here we have a most succulent lunch
1	in any case , the prince had sooner or later to be introduced into society , of which he had not the slightest idea
1	the soldier shouted out , rolling his eyes at rostov and obviously taking him for a hospital superior
1	the thing was that afanasy ivanovich was about fifty at that time , and he was in the highest degree a respectable and settled man
1	no , i ca not ; it 's more than i can bear
1	but the poor fellow is saved by the criminal 's temperament , worse luck for him !
1	can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning her name ?
1	it pains me to look at her , and to comfort her at least a little i let her say whatever she likes , and even say nothing when she judges people unfairly or chides me for not having a practice or publishing textbooks
1	this russian landowner—let ’ s call him p—in the former golden age the owner of four thousand bonded souls ( bonded souls !
1	the icon split exactly into two pieces
1	this just meant : let me alone , this is sickening
1	polenka , have you got everything ?
1	till then , at least , he was free and must do something for himself , for the danger was imminent
1	he gave just enough money for the wedding and invited all his relations and acquaintances
1	i have allowed myself to speak out , because you addressed me earlier as a mediator between yourself and pavel pavlovich
1	and his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary , feverish , as it were distracted haste
1	and when we were by ourselves , you understand ?
1	i will say that i know this grand lady
1	they could not have refused me so easily !
1	i believe it 's reality , he thought
1	lxiv : the man in the red cloak he and athos exchanged a few words in low voices , then the tall man made a sign that the musketeer could come in
1	once he went into the mountains on a clear , sunny day , and wandered about for a long time with a tormenting thought that refused to take shape
1	i could go into greater detail , but it 's not worth it , for it 's all extraneous now ; all i want to do is finish telling the main thing
1	for no reason , but the sunrise , the bay of naples , the sea—you look at them and it makes you sad
1	if kraft burned it then ?
1	shouted rostov , coming up to the crowd with quick strides
1	precisely , alexander semyonovich picked up , bustling around the patient
1	you do not know what you are saying yourself
1	and she began to languish , brother
1	i have to use different models all the time
1	quite so , but what drove him , or rather perhaps disposed him , to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of mr svidrigaïlov
1	what have i to do with this ?
1	she stopped in front of him
1	there , what is that blockhead laughing at ?
1	yes , he has come in
1	where we have orders to bring you
1	no , i myself lied to her about kraft , i deceived her , because it was also impossible to avoid it , and i lied involuntarily , innocently
1	and what ? —the news did not make the slightest impression on him ; he did not even raise his eyebrows !
1	nikolenka turned to look at pierre ; but there was no longer any pierre
1	it is hard to describe how animated and encouraged the prince became that evening
1	i ’ m not thanking you , i simply … admire you , i ’ m happy looking at you ; perhaps i ’ m speaking foolishly , but i—i need to speak , i need to explain … even if only out of respect for myself
1	count ostermann-tolstoy met the returning hussars , sent for rostov , thanked him , and said that he would report his daring action to the sovereign and request the st george cross for him
1	well , i will give you new hats
1	laughter creates the distance that allows for recognition , without which the book might be a tract , a case history , a cry of despair , anything you like , but not a work of art
1	your excellency , i assumed
1	the old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge , but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor
1	two more minutes , my dear ivan fyodorovich , if you permit , lizaveta prokofyevna turned to her husband with dignity , it seems to me that he ’ s all feverish and simply raving ; i ’ m convinced by his eyes ; he can not be left like this
1	marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement
1	well , what does he know , your alexander semyonych ?
1	he did not want to meet anyone till then
1	that she 's not of the nobility , believe me , has never embarrassed me for a moment , he said to me
1	on the contrary , to console him she promised to find an occasion for conveying the future child to him , assured him that from then on they would have other responsibilities , that their friendship was now sealed forever— in short , there was not much logic , but the goal was the same : that he should deliver her from his love
1	queen of heaven , saints above
1	and these types in any case are still a current matter , and therefore can not be artistically finished
1	m de tréville was in his reception room with his usual court of gentlemen
1	she concluded all but wrathfully , parting from evgeny pavlovich
1	remain free , then , and keep your hatreds and your sympathies
1	it 's the third day he has not eaten
1	however , he certainly knew how to do it , vasin added
1	the officer of the horse guards mounted up and rode to yet another
1	i remember zverev , when he had finished work , giving the sofa a loving flick and saying to me : vous dormirez comme un petit roi
1	i am a contemptible person , dounia
1	yes , he used to get his hair pulled pretty often , roared the commissariat clerk again , swallowing another glass of vodka
1	there are three hundred pistoles in this pouch
1	for if you once knew the truth and saw it , then you know that it is the truth and there is and can be no other , whether you are asleep or alive
1	kutuzov was chewing roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at wolzogen with narrowed , merry eyes
1	if you need the pistol of an honest man , prince , i ’ m ready to exchange a half-dozen noble shots , even before you get up the next morning from your honey bed
1	he had to mount to the third storey
1	all these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness
1	let 's decamp first , interrupted d'artagnan , you will understand later
1	he asked , barely able to control the trembling of his lower jaw
1	no one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything
1	do not torture me , he begged her miserably
1	she had noticed even earlier that his face now lacked something , as if , since he cut his hair , his face had also changed
1	but i did hear something from praskovya pavlovna herself , though she is by no means a gossip
1	i believe only one of your rooms is taken
1	they rode at a walk towards a barn , by which a large crowd of muzhiks was standing
1	awakens him to a truth he had not suspected or had not understood before
1	phew phew phew , he whistled barely audibly , riding into the courtyard
1	they talk of duty , conscience—i do not want to say anything against duty and conscience ; —but the point is , what do we mean by them
1	who will shelter the poor child ?
1	i must be unwell
1	evgeny pavlovich , in a rather incoherent letter from paris , told of her that , after a brief and extraordinary attachment to some émigré , a polish count , she had suddenly married him , against the will of her parents , who , if they did finally give their consent , did so only because the affair threatened to turn into an extraordinary scandal
1	two sons , one of whom already served in the chancellery , and a comely sixteen-year-old daughter with a slightly upturned but pretty little nose , came every day to kiss his hand , saying , bonjour , papa
1	the trim figure of the fair-haired soldier with clear blue eyes stepped from the line
1	there were no letters or papers in my room , and previously i had almost never locked my door when i left
1	i feel that , besides me , above me , spirits live , and that in this world there is truth
1	burned me right through
1	an island , he read , is a piece of dry land surrounded on all sides by water
1	said stepan nikiforovich , seeing his guests off
1	and if he hasn ’ t , he will
1	i do not know how much time passed—an hour , or a few days , or many days
1	a nice set , these authors !
1	yes , and so you need suitable activities
1	why should such a fantasy enter the head of a child , sir , who ought to be playing with toys ?
1	and you know she fancies it 's very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is !
1	he was a man of principle and in good standing with his excellency ; it would be nothing for him , as anya was told , to take a note from his excellency to the principal of the school and even to the superintendent , to keep pyotr leontyich from being dismissed
1	listen , he added , turning to her a minute later
1	having laid marmeladov down , raskolnikov flew to katerina ivanovna
1	if anything happens , i have one request to make of you , he added , dropping his voice
1	it suddenly appeared that katerina ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of which marmeladov had spoken to raskolnikov in the tavern , when he told him that katerina ivanovna , his wife , had danced the shawl dance before the governor and other great personages on leaving school
1	you are my only hope , said petya
1	the house with the mezzanine : an artist 's
1	in the spacious better side of the muzhik andrei savostyanov 's cottage , a council gathered at two o'clock
1	he may very well be in love , because he ’ s a boy !
1	all i hear is insults and offense
1	here he again lost his breath and began to cough
1	yes , do you object ?
1	well , he will do better next time !
1	the third time , which is this one , you may succumb
1	razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table
1	in an abstract love for mankind , one almost always loves oneself
1	behind the groom came a wagon , and behind the wagon an old house serf in a peaked cap , a short coat , and with bandy legs
1	exclaimed lizaveta prokofyevna , letting go of his arm and watching almost with horror as he wiped the blood from his lips
1	for a moment , as he straightened the overcoat , pierre opened his eyes and saw the same sheds , posts , courtyard , but it was all bluish now , bright , and covered with sparkles of dew or frost
1	but there 's no need , it 's all right
1	there happened to be a girl in the house then , parasha , a black-eyed wench , whom i had never seen before—she had just come from another village—very pretty , but incredibly stupid : she burst into tears , wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal
1	in my opinion , then , we must travel together
1	it 's out of spite
1	the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver
1	mikhail ivanych got up and went to the study
1	and , of course … and i … and that ’ s prince-like !
1	please , petrovich , akaky akakievich said in a pleading voice , not hearing and not trying to hear all petrovich 's words and effects , fix it somehow , so that it can serve a while longer at least
1	it was becoming very sultry …
1	we will break down the door , and if he 's in too much of a rage , well , then we will kill him
1	later you will find out what
1	he smiled again , but there was something very unkind in his smile
1	i had already been sitting for an hour and more , and was sitting by the window on one of the two wicker chairs that stood by the window
1	come , come , tréville , be quiet , said the king
1	i suddenly got up from my chair
1	better speak , you ’ ll regret not saying everything
1	they have scarcely the faintest notion of russia , and that does not trouble them at all
1	several officers came together , with soldiers surrounding them
1	wherever i might go , whatever happened to me , you would remain to look after them
1	he brooded with relish , in profound secret , over the image of a girl—virtuous , poor ( she must be poor ) , very young , very pretty , of good birth and education , very timid , one who had suffered much , and was completely humbled before him , one who would all her life look on him as her saviour , worship him , admire him and only him
1	said my enemy in a mocking tone , 'then that is something else
1	asked ilagin , approaching the hunter who had spotted the hare and turning , not without excitement , to whistle up yerza
1	she had met him in staro-kievsky street when she was a schoolgirl and no longer remembered his last name—appeared as if from out of the ground and invited her for the waltz , and she flew away from her husband , and it seemed to her as if she were sailing in a boat through a heavy storm , and her husband had stayed far behind on the shore
1	the account is noted down in my pocket‐book
1	if no food , how live ?
1	now you and you alone are left me as a true friend , sir !
1	the air was so sweet and fragrant , the sky such a deep blue and all spangled with stars !
1	but we shall meet again
1	and you will catch hell ?
1	so now he prays to god in russian
1	n‐no , sonia whispered naïvely and timidly
1	thank god we finished before you came !
1	four weeks had gone by since pierre was taken prisoner
1	now , in the year , it was noticeable for a man living close to the people that these undercurrents were intensely at work and were close to manifesting themselves
1	raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa , but could not close his eyes
1	nadya had heard it all last year and , it seemed , the year before last , and she knew that sasha could not think differently , and it used to make her laugh , but now for some reason she felt annoyed
1	you are here , and i went to your place looking for you , he said to me
1	here he took off his belt , laid his sword down so that it would not clank , and , seizing the branches , climbed up the tree
1	for they read and talk all their lives , filled with bookish sweetness , but they themselves dwell in perplexity and can not resolve anything
1	yes , yes , razumihin agreed , i noticed that , too
1	he became aware of someone standing on the right side of him ; he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head , with a long , yellow , wasted face and red sunken eyes
1	i do not want the money
1	that 's what it means to know how to make acquaintances , thought berg , that 's what it means to know how to behave !
1	the tea stood untouched
1	the passerby who had lost it was already some forty steps ahead of me and soon dropped from sight in the crowd
1	farewell , afanasy ivanovich , merci !
1	what i ca not understand , he said , is that the emperor alexander made all these personal enemies of mine his intimates
1	during the last year he struggled like a fish on dry land , but his life had come full term
1	he scorned the new symbolist movement in literature , but the surface objectivity of his work gives way time and again to a visionary symbolism of his own ( of which the black monk is the most obvious , and least successful , example )
1	said d'artagnan , squeezing her hand more strongly
1	the judge crossed himself
1	she had heard from amalia ivanovna that the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the question : how could she let her daughter sit down beside that young person ?
1	on the night of the first of september , kutuzov 's order was given for the retreat of the russian troops through moscow to the ryazan road
1	listen , i will tell it to you now
1	they did not see each other till they almost knocked against each other
1	maybe you will eat something , pulkheria ivanovna ?
1	the roof was constructed in such a way that one could stand up in the middle , and one could even sit up on the beds if one moved closer to the table
1	but where will you put me in the meantime ?
1	yes he was so kind dounia , i promised luzhin i would throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell rodya , what are you saying !
1	i told him quite humbly , for i did not conceal from myself the bad position i had put myself in by laying the three musketeers hands on one of his majesty 's musketeers , i told him that i was ready to submit to his conditions
1	ah , that 's true , i remember !
1	then you do not know me , monsieur ?
1	why does my reason fully admit all this ?
1	in moscow mikhail averyanych donned a military jacket without epaulettes and trousers with red piping
1	why is she grieving too ?
1	yes , i see myself now that i am almost well , said raskolnikov , giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made pulcheria alexandrovna radiant at once
1	he was finally released and set completely free
1	he raised his head higher , his eyes lit up with a gleam of life , and he followed the maid with quick steps , overtook her , and came out on povarskaya
1	follow this corridor , a little stairway will take you to it
1	she touched his mustache
1	as soon as they parted , each thought of nothing else
1	and what about him ?
1	he only needed to insult her , to insult her senselessly , not even knowing what for , snatching at a pretext , and i gave him a pretext
1	i lived in dreams even before that , lived ever since childhood in a dreamlike realm of a certain hue ; but with the appearance of this main idea that swallowed up everything in me , my dreams consolidated and all at once molded themselves into a certain form ; from stupid they became reasonable
1	at last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor , he suddenly started , and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind him
1	the society may not be secret , if the government allows it
1	who wants to make a bet with me ?
1	my general is just seething , sir ; but i suspect he ’ ll slip away from me in petersburg in order to visit the captain ’ s widow
1	his majesty will certainly wish to see you , but not today
1	and have you , puff , puff , had her long , your excellency ?
1	rostov remembered swienciany because , on the first day they entered this little town , he had dismissed his sergeant major and had been unable to handle all the drunken men of the squadron , who , without his knowledge , had got hold of five barrels of old beer
1	ptitsyn sometimes urged ganya—in a friendly way , naturally—to find a job
1	oh , my god , who knows ?
1	the meeting was over , and on his return home it seemed to pierre that he had come back from some distant journey , where he had spent dozens of years , had changed completely , and had detached himself from the former order and habits of his life
1	my agrafena trofimovna likes them very much
1	it 's past nine , i have brought you some tea ; will you have a cup ?
1	a translation of dostoievski , du double a i'unité ( plon , paris , ) , especially interesting for its analysis of the erotic/mimetic aspects of dostoevsky 's work
1	farewell , do not remember any evil of me !
1	twelve years before , ferapontov , with a bit of a hand from alpatych , had bought a woods from the prince , went into commerce , and now owned a house , an inn , and a flour shop in the provincial capital
1	you heard me say to the prince : it will be as you say
1	oh , oui , answered natasha
1	blood flowed from the horse 's head
1	but , he said , lowering his pike , where indeed is that letter ?
1	he always listened with a pleasant smile to the guests who came to see him , and sometimes spoke himself , but mainly to ask questions
1	i know myself , kitty , and that one is hooked
1	he got up from his chair and took his hat
1	she would write and post letters for them to their relations
1	well , then , monsieur , let us go to him ; let us make him swear by the name of god , before whom he is perhaps about to be summoned , to tell the truth
1	what did i rave about ?
1	to a blackguard , a blackguard , who shouldn ’ t have been paid !
1	the blindfold suddenly fell from his eyes
1	and after that this disgraceful creature goes asking their forgiveness !
1	he was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it
1	these questions are for later , but now i am only talking about the possibility of achieving the goal
1	he had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything
1	you are so skinny to look at , yet i can barely feel your ribs
1	now she was no more than thirty-nine years old , but her dark blond hair was already strongly streaked with gray
1	five times already , with other people , prince andrei had heard exactly the same phrase about the countess zubov and the same laughter from his wife
1	you ought to get acquainted , your excellency
1	he belonged to a mixed society , though naturally of a trumpish sort
1	katerina ivanovna took it and gave him a polite , even ceremonious , bow
1	semyon ivanych hastily took his leave
1	twice they noticed that the french had appeared below , close to them , and then they fired on them with canister shot
1	in the wards , the corridors , and the hospital yard , it was hard to breathe for the stench
1	what a terrible life !
1	for at that time , as writers write and maintain , universal famines visited mankind once every two or three years at least , so that in such a state of affairs man even resorted to anthropophagy , though he kept it a secret
1	no , it seems the sale will go through one of these days , someone said
1	write : i don ’ t negotiate
1	natasha could guess that they were talking about the old prince , working something out , and that disturbed and offended her
1	the sun was there , our new sun was there , that was all i kept saying !
1	davout took the envelope and read what was written on it
1	and here you have considered how and what , but a watchman 's the same as a peasant , he 's got no understanding , he just grabs you by the scruff of the neck and drags you off
1	lebedev , extraordinarily pleased , went on clowning , snatching the books from his daughter
1	and what have you heard ?
1	nevertheless , many times during that evening she had despaired of fate and of herself ; she did not invoke god , as we know , but she had faith in the genius of evil , that immense sovereignty that reigns over all the details of human life , and for which , as in the arabian fable , a pomegranate seed is enough to reconstruct a destroyed world
1	first of all , he ’ s already planning to live in my house ; that ’ s all right , sir , but he ’ s enthusiastic , wants straight off to be like family
1	ah , my dear , what do i care if she kills me !
1	nothing at all no one 's services no one 's sympathy
1	but the night passed without any new attempt from my persecutor
1	frank has also shown that the attack is not limited to part one : two of the three main episodes in the second part of notes — the episode of the bumped officer and the episode with the prostitute liza – are in fact parodic developments of episodes from chernyshevsky 's novel
1	the feast feasted : swords swing , bullets fly , horses whinny and stamp
1	i see some trap has been set here , and i do not understand anything , she said , but if you really have that letter here it is , you can see for yourself !
1	his head was spinning ; the whole room whirled around
1	she got tired over the winter , that 's what
1	these young men are contemptible on that point
1	i waxed pathetic , so much so that i myself was about to have a spasm in my throat , when
1	have they finally come to moscow ?
1	it 's as if i was glad to take advantage of his being alone and dejected
1	but natasha was not asleep , and her fixed , wide-open eyes looked straight ahead from her pale face
1	he got two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home
1	he stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow , then another on the skull
1	finally adelaida observed that there was no need to run like that during a stroll and that there was no keeping up with mother
1	you are mistaken , my dear sir
1	lowering his legs and spreading both hands against the sides of the window , he tried his position , settled himself , let go with his hands , shifted a little to the right , to the left , and took the bottle
1	to fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home , do not you see
1	i will teach you to go ahead back !
1	what did he say ?
1	to understand the degree of exhaustion of the russian army , one need only understand clearly the meaning of the fact that , having lost no more than five thousand wounded and killed since tarutino , and no more than a hundred as prisoners , the russian army , which had numbered a hundred thousand when it left tarutino , numbered fifty thousand when it reached krasnoe
1	he entered the square not without some inadvertent fear , as if his heart had a foreboding of something bad
1	this circumstance was one of the causes of the then heavy mood in the epanchin family , though mrs epanchin said at the time that she would gladly cross herself with both hands
1	here i will not and can not describe anything in detail
1	then another error came over me , seeing you in the company of these gentlemen : i thought you might be gravely ill the two men in black , who understood his intentions , shot d'artagnan an almost threatening look ; but d'artagnan was not troubled by it
1	razumihin caught him up
1	he stood still a minute , grinned and went back to the police office
1	why does not he go on his way ?
1	the letters were full of expressions such as anisim never used in conversation : my gentle mama and papa , i am sending you a pound of chamomile tea for the satisfaction of your physical needs
1	suddenly ippolit jumped quickly from his chair , as if torn from his place
1	but she rode on me , on me myself !
1	i will if you tell me to , only you ’ d better judge for yourself : is it at all possible for me to go now ?
1	as the sun set , the wind died down
1	they have just been dancing , but once they have gathered around the table
1	in print we need everything noble ; we need ideals , but this
1	he shook all over with wrath , jumped up , and , his face red and angry , his eyes popping , rushed to the middle of the room
1	they will fill their glasses and , with a shout , drink my health
1	no , i haven ’ t heard anything from lebedev—if it ’ s lebedev you ’ re speaking of …
1	the two men in black rose , bowed to aramis and d'artagnan , and moved towards the door
1	zossimov made a slight movement , and would have answered , had not razumihin anticipated him
1	but xvi : in which the keeper of the seals séguier searches more than once for the bell in order to ring it the way he used to but what ?
1	a foolish thought , sir , i feel it myself now , an unnecessary one , sir
1	prince andrei was obviously not interested in these abstract conversations
1	a retired clerk of the commissariat department came , too ; he was drunk , had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy—was without a waistcoat !
1	for all this undoubtedly comes to her from d'artagnan
1	is bazin coming with us ?
1	the countess 's health still did not improve ; but it was no longer possible to put off the trip to moscow
1	his hair in front , at the temples , had obviously been hastily slicked down with a brush , but in back it stuck up naively in little tufts
1	so , then , at nine o'clock be ready here at the hôtel ; i will come to fetch you
1	i want to settle here for good , he told her
1	the other day , when he came out of church in full regalia , mikhail sido-rych semyon did not finish , hearing in the still air the clear music of no more than two or three hounds baying in pursuit
1	he felt joyful and happy
1	[ ] prince vassily said to anna pavlovna
1	and suddenly out of the weeds came her gray cat , thin , scrawny ; it was clear that she had had nothing in her mouth for several days
1	some historians say that the cause was the conquering spirit of the french , the patriotism of russia
1	perhaps it suddenly seemed terribly strange and incredible to her that she was now sitting with that woman , in that woman ’ s house , and was in need of her reply
1	he would go to bed at around three and get up at eight
1	all from lack of self-control and from having grown up in a corner
1	prince andrei , who usually spoke easily and well , had difficulty expressing himself now in talking with speransky
1	again he stopped in indecision
1	a room to teniers ' taste , you see—disorder , disorder , a table with a bust on it , an arm , a palette
1	i agree : man is predominantly a creating animal , doomed to strive consciously towards a goal and to occupy himself with the art of engineering – that is , to eternally and ceaselessly make a road for himself that at least goes somewhere or other
1	no , ma ’ am , they ’ re not really nihilists , lebedev , who was also all but trembling with excitement , stepped forward
1	true , one was run over by horses in the street
1	his elder son fyodor works as a senior mechanic in a factory and , as the peasants say of him , has risen so high in the world that nobody can touch him
1	at your mamma 's request , through afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin , of whom i presume you have heard more than once , a remittance is sent to you from our office , the man began , addressing raskolnikov
1	they haven ’ t changed , never , not in anything … but … i go that way now , good-bye !
1	but at the same moment , his two listeners , the three musketeers accompanied by the host , fell upon dartagnan with great blows of sticks , shovels , and tongs
1	natasha glanced at hélène and at her father , as if asking them what on earth it meant , but hélène was taken up by a conversation with some general and did not respond to her glance , and her father 's glance said nothing to her except what it always said : you are enjoying yourself , and i am glad
1	lebedev turned around and , seeing the prince , stood for a time as if thunderstruck , then rushed to him with an obsequious smile , but froze again on the way , nevertheless having uttered :
1	on the one hand , reasoning shows that the expression of the will of man in words is only part of the general activity expressed in an event such as a war or a revolution ; and therefore , without recognizing an incomprehensible supernatural force—a miracle—it is impossible to allow that words could be the immediate cause of the movement of millions ; on the other hand , even if we allow that words can be the cause or an event , history shows that the expression of the will of historical figures in the majority of cases produces no effect at all , that is , that their orders often are not only not carried out , but that sometimes what takes place is even the opposite of what they ordered
1	nevertheless , this news , conveyed in the form of a simple note with an order from kutuzov and received during the night , just as he was falling asleep , astonished and vexed the count
1	yes , yes , to war , he said , no !
1	flashed as it were by chance through raskolnikov 's mind , and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room , trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement
1	why , rodya , this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and dounia and i were just planning to pawn her watch , so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help
1	so , then , tomorrow we go ?
1	but he was already standing by his hotel … how he had disliked this hotel earlier—the corridors , the whole building , his room—disliked them at first sight ; several times that day he had remembered with a sort of special revulsion that he would have to go back there … how is it that , like an ailing woman , i believe in every foreboding today !
1	by the porch of the house occupied by bilibin stood a britzka half filled with things , and franz , bilibin 's servant , dragging a trunk with difficulty , came out the door
1	that is , it 's somebody else walking , but i walk behind on purpose and think : is not it her , there now , i think , is not that my olya ?
1	listen , he added , turning to her a minute later
1	i confess , i was astounded by this outburst
1	naturally , i will run to anna andreevna 's ; i said purposely , out of vexation , that i would not go ; i will run right now
1	prince andrei sighed and said nothing
1	il n ' a pas l'air d'un homme du peuple , [ ] said the interpreter , looking pierre over
1	the prince thought a little , went back up , and showed him the cross without taking it from his neck
1	bonacieux cried out in despair
1	the higher authorities and police took charge of distributing the goods left by the french
1	he paces his rooms and tries to make sense of what has happened , to collect his thoughts to a point
1	marie came through ryazan , said natasha
1	if i do not come to‐morrow , you will hear of it all , and then remember these words
1	the sovereign went to the study
1	here 's what : he knew that the wealthy cossack choub had been invited for kutya by the deacon , and that there would also be the headman , a relative of the deacon 's in a blue frock coat who sang in the bishop 's choir and could hit the lowest bass notes , the cossack sverbyguz , and others ; that besides kutya there would be spiced vodka , saffron vodka , and lots of other things to eat
1	he trembled , remembering that
1	he tarred his boots , carried three quills behind his ear and a glass vial tied to a button with string instead of an inkpot ; he ate nine pies at one go and stuffed the tenth into his pocket , and he could write so much of every sort of calumny on one sheet of stamped paper that no reader could read through it at one go without interspersing it with coughs and sneezes
1	the head clerk took the paper , and turned to attend to others
1	and what , he said , you think his voice died out in a sob
1	and writing it is a thorny problem
1	it was the first time in his life he had shot a gun , but he had been wanting to buy a gun for a long time , still at touchard 's , and we had long dreamed of a gun
1	it was proposed to make a flanking march to the left , to cut off the viceroy and capture him
1	thankless work and lacking in beautiful forms
1	such a decision is , of course , one of the more advantageous for your friend , baron bjoring , and , i confess , you have not surprised me in the least : i was expecting that
1	what does he abuse , prince ?
1	according to d s mirsky ) among the intelligentsia , but not among the peasants from whom chekhov came
1	i will add , however , that i did poorly in the last year , whereas up to the seventh grade i had always been one of the first , and it happened owing to the same idea , owing to a conclusion , maybe a false one , that i drew from it
1	if i refuse the honor of being attached to you , believe me
1	he met katerina nikolaevna suddenly , precisely when he was expecting mama , at the most impatient moment of expectation
1	examining it well at home , he discovered that in two or three places—namely , on the back and shoulders—it had become just like burlap ; the broadcloth was so worn out that it was threadbare , and the lining had fallen to pieces
1	however , before she lay down , a better idea occurred to her
1	put him straight on the sofa , with his head this way , raskolnikov showed him
1	at this amalia ivanovna , lashed to fury , struck the table with her fist , and shrieked that she was amalia ivanovna , and not ludwigovna , that her vater was named johann and that he was a burgomeister , and that katerina ivanovna 's vater was quite never a burgomeister
1	les prussiens sont nos fidèles alliés , qui ne nous ont trompés que trois fois depuis trois ans
1	and all this was accomplished by one glance , by one turn of a pretty head
1	you exhaust all my patience , nastasya filippovna said sharply and vexedly
1	you have been misunderstanding me , i think , rodion romanovitch , he added after a brief pause , that 's why you are so surprised
1	he will know what it means
1	six or more pale , bandaged , and dirty wounded went jolting down the rocky road in each of the long german vorspanns
1	first of all , it had been made by a man totally drunk to a man who was half so , and yet , despite the vagueness that rises to the brain from the vapors of two or three bottles of burgundy , d'artagnan , on waking up the next morning , had athos 's every word as present to his mind as if they had been imprinted there just as they had fallen from his mouth
1	it might be at an inconvenient moment , he‐he !
1	when they drank to the sovereign 's health , pierre , being deep in thought , did not rise or take his glass
1	it was also hard to believe that she would just rash to the unknown lambert at the first summons ; but again , it might happen for whatever reason , for instance , seeing the copy and being convinced that they indeed had her letter , and then—the same trouble !
1	above all , he considered bjoring 's gratitude a much surer thing than the fantastic plan of the inept but hot-tempered lambert and a versilov nearly insane with passion
1	he has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something
1	allow me to give you one piece of advice
1	because , rogozhin suddenly began to go on , as if he had not interrupted his speech , because if it ’ s your illness , and a fit , and shouting now , somebody may hear it in the street or the courtyard , and they ’ ll figure that people are spending the night in the apartment ; they ’ ll start knocking , they ’ ll come in … because they all think i ’ m not home
1	yet he did ask forgiveness , and even sobbed loudly , but nobody paid attention to it , thinking he was drunk
1	alpatych went to them , trying to bring them to reason , but they answered him ( karp did most of the talking ; dron did not appear in the crowd ) that it was impossible to let the princess go , that there was an order about it ; but let the princess stay , and they would serve her as before and obey her in everything
1	he sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in his hands
1	i forgive you pass !
1	the jury went and locked themselves in for the decision , then suddenly they all come out : no , not guilty
1	a woman , that is , a lady—i am speaking of ladies—comes stomping straight at you , without even noticing you , as if it were your unfailing duty to jump aside and yield her the way
1	a vague instinct told pierre that all these reservations and repeated requests to tell the whole truth expressed princess marya 's ill-will towards her future sister-in-law , that she wished pierre to disapprove of prince andrei 's choice ; but pierre said what he felt rather than what he thought
1	we will see our guests off , then we will have a rest
1	to live in order to exist ?
1	it 's my brother setting out again
1	no one can offend you
1	he had kissed her foot and said
1	the document is in my hand
1	he went and brought back the strange reply that anna andreevna and prince nikolai ivanovich were impatiently awaiting me in their rooms—meaning that anna andreevna did not wish to come
1	not only that , i am convinced that you are in favor of tax-farming
1	i should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built
1	her wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever , and indeed out of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home
1	looking at them in society , it seems there 's something there , but there 's nothing , nothing , nothing !
1	having received this news late in the evening , when he was alone in his study , the old prince did not say anything to anyone
1	but do you know that perhaps i might have done ?
1	we wanted to take him abroad for the summer , but tatyana pavlovna insisted that we not take him , and he did not want it himself
1	mainly by knowing how to choose my acquaintances
1	however , since the wound might , after all , be serious , despite his suspicions , he sent a man on horseback that same moment to fetch a doctor
1	a slight cloud passed over bonacieux 's brow , but so slight that d'artagnan did not perceive it
1	that it ’ s as if i keep teaching …
1	or taking us to moscow ?
1	just then a commissariat soldier , a hospital attendant , came out of the next room and , stamping his feet , snapped to attention in front of rostov
1	athos , this woman is the cardinal 's spy , i am sure of it !
1	at that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her
1	and again his eyes acquired their former dry and cold expression
1	there was a sharp feeling of freshness in the air
1	then what is your decision , rodya ?
1	he asked him in a whisper
1	she sat in his box office , looked after things in the garden , recorded the expenses , handed out the pay , and her pink cheeks and sweet , naive , radiant-looking smile flashed now in the box-office window , now backstage , now in the buffet
1	and you go on without a mate , like a cock at the market
1	the story tells about the emergence of a mr golyadkin jr in the government office where the petty clerk golyadkin serves , a parody and rival of himself who eventually drives him mad
1	he narrowed his eyes , showing that he was listening
1	lxii : two sorts of demons truly , they will go so far that we will be obliged to send them to the bastille
1	you did a beautiful thing , said the prince
1	they dghrag the ghregiment here and there all day
1	do go to bed , all of you , she added with vexation
1	will you take it ?
1	forbid him , andrei petrovich , suppress him , and throw him out , tatyana pavlovna snapped
1	my only illness is that in twenty years i have found only one intelligent man in the whole town , and he 's mad
1	my memory has weakened , my thoughts lack consistency , and each time i set them down on paper it seems to me that i have lost the intuition of their organic connection , the constructions are monotonous , the phrasing impoverished and timid
1	he was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him
1	it was even hard for him to believe that this was the same haughty girl sitting before him who had once so proudly and arrogantly read gavrila ardalionovich ’ s letter to him
1	all this time lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the room , anxious not to interrupt the conversation ; when sonia had gone he walked up to pyotr petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand
1	natasha had been in this state of stupor since morning , when sonya , to the countess 's astonishment and vexation , had found it necessary , no one knew why , to tell natasha about prince andrei 's wound and his presence with them in the train
1	i will tell you what to do , and what i do
1	and in an hour zossimov himself will report to you about everything
1	i will find out , though
1	perhaps he really is ill , she said , turned and went out
1	then it was heard that peasants called as witnesses had been sent from the village ; the old hired workman also received a summons , and he left
1	i just need to win back a certain figure , and then tell me , with this three hundred , i owe you about two thousand five hundred , is that right ?
1	she listened without any special surprise , as if to the most usual words
1	liza cried out for the whole house to hear , and it was then that they came running—all that about a minute before my arrival
1	astonishment , inform her of such details as i did not even suspect were still preserved in my memory
1	maybe you think i ’ m incapable of dying the way glebov did ?
1	they sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws , but far from noticing what was the matter , he drew them all the closer to him
1	and as it is in french , people will see at once that you are children of good family , and that will be much more touching you might sing amarlborough s'en va‐t‐en guerre , for that 's quite a child 's song and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses
1	well , so all the moscow ladies are losing their minds !
1	well , since you have decided , added pulcheria alexandrovna , so be it
1	is it olga ivanovna you want ?
1	oksana seemed perfectly pleased and happy ; she chatted , now with this girl , now with that , and laughed all the while
1	the prince looked him up and down intently
1	his majesty is doubtless referring to god , said m de tréville , for i know of no one but god who could be so far above his majesty
1	russian women lose their looks quickly , their beauty is fleeting , and in truth that 's not only owing to the ethnographic properties of the type , but also to the fact that they are capable of loving unreservedly
1	not long ago i was amused by a certain supposition : what if i should suddenly take it into my head now to kill whomever i like , even a dozen people at once , or to do something most terrible , that is simply considered the most terrible thing in the world , what a quandary the court would find itself in before me , with my two- or three-week term and with torture and the rack abolished !
1	sonia , sonia take his money !
1	all this was done in an instant as he passed , and trying not to betray his interest , he walked on more slowly as though waiting for something
1	where could he escape to , he‐he ?
1	and what if it so happens that on occasion man 's profit not only may but precisely must consist in sometimes wishing what is bad for himself , and not what is profitable ?
1	no , i continued to serve her
1	i used to teach her to walk , i would put her in the corner three steps away and call her , and she comes swaying to me across the room , and she 's not afraid , she laughs , and when she reaches me , she throws her arms around my neck and embraces me
1	ferdyshchenko left , you say ?
1	and now let this woman know , in her turn , that i am not carrying out my profession , but my duty
1	milord , milord , you call things for your defense that accuse you still more
1	it was clear that the words do not be jealous for some reason struck him terribly
1	he took money and various things he told all this , word for word , to sofya semyonovna , the only person who knows his secret
1	i did not finish it , but there 's a passage where i could not help crying , said nina ivanovna , and she sipped from the glass
1	it was just light enough for her to recognize those who were coming
1	he drank his glass almost in one gulp and poured more ; in general he began to behave with a hitherto unusual casualness
1	and this hapless lizaveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face , though that was the most necessary and natural action at the moment , for the axe was raised over her face
1	that means it 's all nonsense and vanity , and in essence there 's no difference between the best clinic in vienna and my hospital
1	the frightened and insulted feeling in her face first gave way to rueful amazement
1	he suddenly pressed his hands together before me
1	why , a stupid thing like this , the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan
1	so you are the fiancé ?
1	and again their peaceful , happy life flowed on without sorrows or alarms
1	my ensuing leisure and my old age would have been devoted , in company of the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son , to visiting gradually and as a real country couple , with our own horses , every nook and cranny of the empire , receiving complaints , redressing wrongs , and scattering monuments and benefactions all over and everywhere
1	that he is far from being , or rather from having been , as guilty towards you as he seems
1	if he had long been planning to kill me , he would have made sure to prepare a knife or a pistol beforehand , and not have counted on my razors , which he had never seen until yesterday evening—came to his head , among other things
1	linden-blossom infusions , rubbed him with eau de cologne , and wrapped him in her soft shawls
1	it remains an image of false unity , but is denounced in rather different terms : the underground man puts his tongue out at it , calls it a tenement house and a chicken coop
1	when he finished the first part , dostoevsky still thought that the prince could go on to redeem nastasya filippovna and even to regenerate the dark rogozhin
1	he pulled it off , but reflecting that he had no other socks , he picked it up and put it on again—and again he laughed
1	just then it also happened that my sister 's husband in moscow squandered our small fortune , including my share of it—a tiny share , but i was left penniless in the street
1	about two months before , they had met in the street , but raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed
1	marvelous is the working of our world , i thought as i walked down nevsky prospect two days ago , calling to mind these two events
1	in the middle of a figure , he called out to rostov , who was just passing by
1	you will accept his judgment ?
1	work slowly , said the curate , we leave you in excellent intentions
1	he wanted to destroy all , all of it
1	natasha , he 's no more , no more !
1	on the contrary , in questioning you , he showed great curiosity and concern for the circumstances of your own life , its successes and failures , which always interest all kindly old men , though it somewhat resembled the curiosity of a child who , while talking to you , studies your watch fob
1	dolokhov was a man of medium height , curly-haired and with light blue eyes
1	this is a madhouse !
1	the whole history of the dead father floated before his memory in those moments
1	my voice faltered and would not obey me
1	have a drink , a bite to eat , then hit the sack
1	i mean it ’ s … how shall i tell you ?
1	in this way the estate turns by itself into what is merely a gathering of the best people , in the literal and true sense , and not in the former sense of a privileged caste
1	tell me directly , frankly tell me : you are not drunk today ?
1	if anyone had come into his room then , he would have jumped up at once and screamed
1	but ivan ivanovich began talking about hunting quail , which usually happened when he wanted to change the subject
1	how can they convict him , even if they arrest him ?
1	sacré dieu , c'était beau
1	he has a tongue
1	i am speaking the truth
1	there ’ s nothing better than the poor knight ’ !
1	and porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not known about it before
1	from which may be trustworthily seen the connivance of the said mirgorod regional court and the indisputable sharing of the jewish profits from it by combining mutually
1	karataev was sitting at the edge of the road , by the birch , and two frenchmen were saying something over him
1	again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had just told a fearful lie—that he would never now be able to speak freely of everything—that he would never again be able to speak of anything to anyone
1	do you understand now ?
1	i will still have time , when i want , to occupy myself with love , but right now i am busy
1	god created man for be alive , for be joy , and be sorrow , and be grief , and you want nothing , it means you not alive , you stone , clay !
1	is it that she was with totsky ?
1	and , first of all , it 's not logic , allow me to inform you of that , because even if he were not , he could still preach the truth and , finally , what is this word 'preaches ' ?
1	i work from morning till night
1	wonderful proportions , there 's no disputing it !
1	and how can you discuss my obedience ?
1	although they were well off , the volchaninovs lived permanently in the country , summer and winter , and lydia was a teacher in a zemstvo school in her own shelkovka and earned twenty-five roubles a month
1	not in the least
1	he was known in the hôtel of the musketeers , and everyone held him to be a good comrade
1	i shall make a struggle for it and they wo not do anything to me
1	this is not like before
1	yes , tell them to bring my horse
1	her much too magnificent finery struck the eye , it would have attracted attention on the train , and only later did the girl understand why her worthless old rag had been bought at such profit for her
1	athos held his hand out towards her
1	but , though he did not see his look , velchaninov understood that he had to support pavel pavlovich
1	but it got so dark in the sky , and under the sky , that it was no longer possible to see what went on further between them
1	prince andrei , going back into the shed , lay down on the rug , but could not sleep
1	perhaps it 's even very beautiful
1	yesterday i happened to be with a learned doctor of theology , whom i consult occasionally to do with my studies athos smiled
1	yes , that 's herder 's teaching , [ ] said prince andrei , but that , dear heart , does not convince me ; life and death are what convince me
1	and this one , why is it all black under his nose ?
1	he is pushed into a meeting of the rulers
1	he never drinks much in the mornings ; if you ’ ve come on business , talk to him now
1	but , after all , is it customary for officers of the english navy to put themselves at the orders of their lady compatriots when they approach a british port , and push their gallantry so far as to see them ashore ?
1	lizaveta prokofyevna covered her with the end of her shawl
1	porfiry petrovitch went out to order tea
1	but your excellency what—nobody knows
1	men met in groups , agreed on something , swore to keep together , but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed
1	the prisoners were a still greater burden to the soldiers of the convoy than the saddles of the cavalry depot or junot 's train
1	i do not want anything more to‐day , you can go
1	something of it always remains
1	renouncing the concept of cause , mathematics seeks laws , that is , properties common to all unknown infinitely small elements
1	we can leave , the son said in french
1	dear grandpa , i ca not stand it , it 's simply killing me
1	perhaps i am right in thinking you want me to ; very well
1	lament for your sickness , and god wo not grant you death , said karataev , and he went back at once to the story he had begun
1	petya stepped out of the front hall , looked around in the darkness , and went over to the wagons
1	but suddenly now , when i heard about kraft , i jumped up from the bed , i was all seized as if by a convulsion
1	so i sat like some sort of dress-circle virtue in a box at the french theater , and fled like a wild thing from all the men who chased after me in these five years , and had the look of proud innocence , all because my foolishness ran away with me !
1	but the yard was empty and he could not see who was hammering
1	he wetted the rag and rubbed the boots
1	start again from the beginning , pyotr ippolitovich
1	for the achievement of this goal , we must assure a preponderance of virtue over vice , we must try to make it so that the honest man already attains in this world the eternal reward for his virtues
1	velchaninov was pleased both with the adventure and with its setting
1	mother , whatever happens , whatever you hear about me , whatever you are told about me , will you always love me as you do now ?
1	excuse me , my friend , i say to the visitor , but i can not pass you
1	now there were so many other joys and things to do !
1	in that case , it 's it 's part three but , anyhow , what of it ?
1	believing , perhaps , that there , under a bush , we would embrace each other and weep , in the proximity of innocence
1	so , then , you can also make a sheath , for instance , for a dagger or something else ?
1	and then , one bright morning , at dawn , he suddenly found me freezing under the wall and fell directly onto the trail of the richest , in his opinion , of affairs
1	said porthos , putting a finger to his lips
1	well , that 's perfectly fair !
1	the three musketeers what 's that ?
1	general ivolgin , retired and unfortunate
1	he was sitting in yesterday 's chair , smoking cigarettes , and had just poured himself the fourth and last glass from the bottle
1	no , i have the advantage of your generosity , that 's all
1	everything lit up and glistened
1	she had filled out and broadened , so that it was difficult to recognize in this strong mother the former slender , nimble natasha
1	kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to rodion romanovitch
1	i must tell you that i would heard of this stupid story before you wrote and do not believe a word of it
1	that cured me of beautiful , poetic , and loving women , said athos , straightening up and not thinking of maintaining his fable about the count
1	both ippolit and aglaya epanchin refer them to prince myshkin , but we never actually hear him say them either
1	i bent to his hand and suddenly began kissing it greedily , several times , many times
1	their laughter and talk in mutually incomprehensible languages could be heard
1	instead of looking after your children , you ’ ve been sitting in debtors ’ prison
1	be that as it may , the carefree p raised the orphaned young gentleman in a princely way , hired tutors for him , and governesses ( pretty ones , no doubt ) , whom , incidentally , he brought from paris himself
1	she ’ s a curious one , agreed the prince
1	i sprang after her into the hallway
1	why do you cling to this legality of marriage ?
1	at times he could not believe that it was mme bonacieux , and he hoped to find her at the louvre the next day ; at times he feared she was having an intrigue with someone else , and that the jealous man had caught her and carried her off
1	how could he have left all those things in the hole ?
1	you are not thinking that i will marry you off at once ?
1	all eyes were directed at him
1	at the noise , i raised myself on one hand
1	obviously , the russian nest was devastated and destroyed ; but beyond the destruction of the russian order of life , pierre felt unconsciously that the french had established their own quite different but firm order over this devastated nest
1	let ’ s go , maman , how long must this continue !
1	yes , i have business … the prince began
1	le maréchal se fâche contre l'empereur et nous punit tous ; n'est-ce pas que c'est logique !
1	often an old , re-dyed
1	he guessed that the lady in the black mantilla was the procureuse of the rue aux ours , the more easily as the church of saint-leu was not far from the said street
1	he sat down on the deserted seat
1	give the order , sire , he said , you have the right of pardon
1	why talk about me ?
1	do not worry , gentlemen , i am not saying it so that you will throw yourselves on my neck and we will all start lowing like calves from tenderness !
1	evening was coming on when he reached home , so that he must have been walking about six hours
1	i confess , i would not have gone to the office at all , knowing beforehand what a sour face the section chief would make
1	and altars are set up to him after his death , and so all is permitted
1	two officers of his division joined him
1	this incident made a strong impression on him
1	wait till you are sent for !
1	didn ’ t you look for it together before ?
1	and so the soldiers , after a twenty-mile march , without a wink of sleep , spent the whole night mending and cleaning ; the adjutants and company commanders calculated and counted off ; and by morning the regiment , instead of the straggling , disorderly crowd it had been the day before , during the latest march , was a well-ordered mass of two thousand men , each of whom knew his place , his duty , each of whose buttons and straps was in its place and sparkling clean
1	he was black earth all over
1	so i finally have news of her—she 's alive , she 's safe in a convent , she 's in stenay !
1	he did not say he had been detained by the sovereign
1	you hinted it yourself ; you talked to me of poison i know you went to get it you had it in readiness it was your doing it must have been your doing scoundrel !
1	he said , taking pierre by the elbow ; and in his voice there was sincerity and weakness , such as pierre had never noticed in him before
1	kindly take a cup of tea with me today
1	but now i tried to soften the impression and put the poor prince to bed : you will have a good sleep , and your ideas will brighten up , you will see for yourself !
1	i don ’ t think anybody ’ s going to raise his hand now against someone like me ; even a woman wouldn ’ t hit me now ; even ganechka wouldn ’ t !
1	anatole did not let go of the englishman , and though he had nodded to show he had understood everything , anatole translated dolokhov 's words into english for him
1	suddenly a round , compact puff of smoke was seen , a play of purple , gray , and milky white , and boom ! —a second later came the sound of this smoke
1	cried buckingham , forgetting all except the thought of whom this letter might be from
1	the romans did not survive even fifteen hundred years as a living entity , and they also became material
1	or or there 's something here that i do not know myself , because here , it must be , there 's not just nature
1	what 's more , they suddenly became extraordinarily free
1	only the darkness above seemed to become deeper , and the dark images looked more gloomily from the old carved frames on which gold gleamed here and there
1	well , thanks , if only she 's telling the truth
1	and where have i been then ?
1	tomorrow we are off , i am giving you a place in my carriage
1	the commissary 's brow darkened more
1	but in fact , pavel pavlovich—and i thank him for it—has reminded me of an extremely important matter , which i might have let slip , velchaninov laughed , shaking hands with the host , bowing to the hostess and to the girls , and , as if especially among them , to katerina fedoseevna , which again was noticed by everyone
1	no , it was something else
1	to this mrs epanchin responded that belokonsky had written something of the same sort to her and that this is stupid , very stupid ; but there ’ s no curing a fool—she added sharply , but one could see from her face how glad she was of what this fool had done
1	well , you are the sort of guest who does not need to be entertained , old zakhlebinin cheerily decided at last , getting up from his chair to go to his room upstairs , where , despite the feast day , he had a few business papers ready for going over , and , imagine , i considered you the gloomiest hypochondriac of all our young people
1	i ’ ll visit her myself , maybe today
1	—getting up and backing towards the wall
1	i have studied all this morbid psychology in my practice
1	turning in at the gateway , he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book in his hand
1	the melody grew , passing from one instrument to another , what is known as a fugue was going on , though petya had not the slightest idea of what a fugue was
1	if i were rothschild , i would go about in an old coat and carry an umbrella
1	i analysed , if i remember , the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime
1	he was evidently badly injured
1	but i still go on remembering … and , so to speak , find repose in the cultivated circle of my former comrades and subordinates , who adore me to this day
1	where are you off to ?
1	you must agree that i could have done so without any permission , i snappedif i waited , it was
1	out of a basement ?
1	the ladies demanded that only their soul and character be portrayed in the main , while the rest sometimes should not even be adhered to , all corners should be rounded , all flaws lightened , or , if possible , avoided altogether
1	he behaves like a cad himself , and just look at him , please
1	many voices shouted and talked all at once , so that ilya andreich had no time to nod to them all ; and the group grew in numbers , broke up , came together again , and moved , with a buzz of voices , to the large hall , to the large table
1	and so on , and so on
1	‖ it ’ s something new
1	even philanthropy did not yield the desired results
1	when nikolai and his wife came looking for pierre , he was in the nursery , holding his awakened nursling son on his enormous right palm , dandling him
1	he was the friend of the king , who , as everyone knows , greatly honored the memory of his father , henri iv
1	during our expedition to béthune , my duchess 's husband died , my dear , so that , with the deceased 's coffer holding its arms out to me , i am marrying the widow
1	there isn ’ t any foolishness , only the deepest respect , aglaya suddenly declared quite unexpectedly in a grave and serious voice , having managed to recover completely and overcome her former embarrassment
1	this expression of concern was pleasing to him , parole d'honneur , sans parler de ce que je vous dois , j'ai de l'amitié pour vous
1	it 's good for something , you see , to have been raised somewhere
1	in the garden , toward the end , velchaninov succeeded completely in becoming close with nadya ; she no longer peered at him scowlingly as earlier and seemed to have set aside the idea of studying him more closely , but laughed , jumped , squealed , and even seized him by the hand once or twice ; she was terribly happy , and went on paying not the slightest attention to pavel pavlovich , as if not noticing him
1	when i speak or read , my mouth twists to one side ; when i smile , my whole face is covered with an old man 's deathly wrinkles
1	i am not complaining
1	he had too much confidence in himself , in his power and in the helplessness of his victims
1	she is tearing up all the clothes , and making them little caps like actors ; she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle , instead of music
1	and nikolai kissed her hand once more
1	no one has ever heard a groan or a word of protest from him
1	when i am standing in court as defender of an accused man , i can not help speaking or knowing what i am going to say
1	the more cunning a man is , the less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing
1	and they are very kind and the children , too , often come to see me
1	ah , you know it very well , porthos , said aramis
1	each to his own place
1	but his feeling was stirred ; his heart ached , as he looked at her
1	asked crutch , and he turned around to see how far praskovya was lagging behind
1	at that moment , the clock of the samaritaine struck six
1	i remember only that i woke up in the middle of the deep night and sat up on the bunk
1	but , despite all their attempts to show that the cause of an event lay in intellectual activity , only with great flexibility can one agree that there is something in common between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples , but in no case is it possible to allow that intellectual activity guides the activity of people , for such phenomena as the cruelest murders of the french revolution resulting from the preaching of the equality of man , and the wickedest wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love , do not confirm this supposition
1	god keeps us from that terrible misfortune !
1	just as he was , in his hat , fur coat , and felt boots , he lowered himself onto the bench ; his companion , the coroner , sat down facing him
1	i am unable to understand this strange act on your part
1	and the man told the whole truth
1	listening to bennigsen and the generals discussing the position of the troops at the foot of the hill , pierre fully understood them and shared their opinion ; but , precisely for that reason , he could not understand how the one who had placed them there at the foot of the hill could have made such an obvious and crude mistake
1	he now thought the occasion had come , and turning to his neighbor , said : it 's not surprising that this young man is afraid of a ball , no doubt he 's an apprentice musketeer
1	bronze candlesticks were being sold
1	some woman brought a horse to water , but the horse would not drink
1	the story of how ivan ivanovich quarreled with ivan nikiforovich i am not guilty of any evil designs , said ivan ivanovich , not turning his eyes to ivan nikiforovich
1	he could not remember alone , and looked inquiringly at razumihin
1	austrian column leaders shuttled among the russian troops and served as heralds of the departure
1	you will steal my son
1	i say it , prince , so that there will be no misunderstandings
1	raskolnikov shouted with vexation
1	so there , kiss me
1	how and where he came back he did not remember
1	all i want is for you to be happy and you know that ; i am resigned to fate , but my heart will always be with you , whether we stay together or must part
1	asked sonya , leaning out the window of the carriage
1	the old lady and the girls came out to the porch to see the guests off , and for a long time still they kept bowing to the aunt and nephew peeking out of the britzka
1	at dinner he quickly relaxed , contributed observations on this and that , and ate a rather mature pig almost by himself
1	it seems neither of us is entirely happy , isn ’ t it so ?
1	countess marya wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone , that he ascribed too much importance to this business ; but she knew it was unnecessary and useless to say it
1	the luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing
1	the aunt , however , gave a sign to ivan fyodorovich to stay and said something softly to the old lady
1	could i have seriously set down such a stupid epigraph ? … listen , gentlemen ! … i assure you that in the final end this may all be the most terrible trifles !
1	and you have not been here either ?
1	and what if it does not stick ?
1	and you scorn suffering and are surprised at nothing for a very simple reason : vanity of vanities , external and internal scorn of life , of suffering , and of death , comprehension , the true blessing—all that is a most suitable philosophy for a russian lie-about
1	so you are not angry with me ?
1	what the principle of this harmony is , the underground man can not say ; he has never found it
1	yes , and he did well
1	never , never had she felt anything like this
1	shut up , shut up !
1	but , as far as i know , he should not be
1	probably that in the twelfth century only monks could be eaten , because only monks were fat , observed gavrila ardalionovich
1	did m bonacieux give you anything for his wife or for some other person ?
1	on the contrary , i passionately wanted to prove to all that riffraff that i was by no means the coward i made myself out to be
1	all this happened so quickly that the philosopher barely managed to recover his senses and seize both his knees with his hands in an effort to stop his legs ; but , to his great amazement , they kept moving against his will and performed leaps quicker than a circassian racer
1	in the street the heat was insufferable again ; not a drop of rain had fallen all those days
1	but since it was already a great deal for him to have made this child revolt against his master , he bowed respectfully to the king , and with his permission took leave of him
1	i was forced to add that as well
1	concluding that he had returned to his senses , the landlady closed the door and disappeared
1	he seemed more cheerful than usual and awaited his son with great impatience
1	the singers stood by the windows
1	but look at what he writes , said another , pointing to a printed sheet he was holding in his hand
1	and he generalized from the fact that he did nothing , and saw it as a sign of the times
1	i should like to make a proof , so to say , mathematically clear
1	he paced up and down the room for a long time , muttering something to himself , then stopped and said :
1	he understood that these feelings really were her secret treasure , which she had kept perhaps for years , perhaps from childhood , while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief , in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches
1	we will find out , do not worry
1	but he interested me greatly , and i spent that whole day under the influence of strange thoughts , so that i decided to call on him myself the next day , to return the visit
1	he was a placid man , like a hen , of the oldest cast , nurtured on obsequiousness , and yet a kind man and even a noble one
1	in the course of the first four days , during which he was not called for anywhere , prince andrei rode around the entire fortified camp and , with the help of his knowledge and of conversations with well-informed people , tried to form some idea of it for himself
1	napoleon gave a start ; destiny was being decided
1	she was standing sideways to the table
1	i was sitting in an armchair by the table , and he was pacing the room
1	prince andrei saw that this ippolit , of whom he ( it had to be admitted ) had almost been jealous over his wife , was the buffoon of the company
1	be so kind , masters , as to take me with you !
1	instead of the simple dishes i became accustomed to as a student and a doctor , i am now fed pureed soup with some sort of white icicles floating in it , and kidneys in madeira
1	or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say , ill yes , simpler and more comprehen yes , ill quite so
1	dear natalie , said princess marya , please know that i am glad my brother has found happiness she stopped , feeling that she was saying an untruth
1	they are now living in a wonderful country house ; there are many children , they will love you there , they are kind
1	i don ’ t understand why we never go abroad
1	natasha , animated and alarmed , looked around with wide-open , frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual
1	descending to the bridge , petya and dolokhov rode past the sentry , who gloomily paced the bridge without saying a word , and went down into the hollow where the cossacks were waiting
1	all who were accompanying her froze in amazement , the crowd parted before her , and rogozhin suddenly appeared five or six steps from the porch
1	no , she would not ; girls like that ca not stand things !
1	it was as if natasha 's love , persistent , patient , not as an explanation , not as a consolation , but as a summons to life , enveloped the countess on all sides every second
1	about your affair , prince andrei turned to boris again , we will speak later , and he glanced at rostov
1	though i sat in the same place almost the whole time , in the country
1	he had two horses saddled and took it upon himself to escort the young guard
1	it 's in accordance with your theory !
1	why , his teeth are chattering as he asks , he‐he !
1	and he vividly pictured natasha to himself , not as he had pictured her before , with her loveliness alone , which brought him joy ; but for the first time he pictured her soul
1	let 's go home and read it
1	we are going to the nevsky sonia , sonia !
1	( ) power is that relation of a certain person to other persons in which the person takes the less part in the action the more he expresses opinions , suppositions , and justifications for the jointly accomplished action
1	[ ] was that not a deception ?
1	so he went to meet athos without bringing a second , resolved to content himself with those chosen by his adversary
1	it was like the eve of a battle : their hearts throbbed , their eyes laughed ; they felt that life , which they were perhaps about to leave , was , when all is said , a good thing
1	i exclaimed in intoxication , because i was terribly pleased with this whole conversation and the direction it had taken
1	he became hoarse and exhausted from crying long ago , but he goes on howling , and no one knows when he will quiet down
1	glad or not , welcome the guest
1	his intentions were unmistakable
1	he , too , is a cardinal
1	he came in very pleased with himself , so pleased that he did not find it necessary to conceal his state of mind
1	a woman can ’ t speak like that , if she has any self-respect , in the house of her … mama is also very worried about you
1	of course , replied the jesuit
1	well , come to my room ; you wanted to come and see me , did not you ?
1	you will ask for the host , and you will say 'forward ' to him
1	they all came and eagerly gathered around her
1	it was a letter from princess marya
1	cried the young man again
1	he had already shouted his fill , for the most part fruitlessly , and talked to his heart 's content with the rag seller who stood across the street by the door of his own shop , and , remembering at last that he had a customer in his shop , he turned his back to the people and went inside
1	cried kitty , that 's my mistress summoning me !
1	in moving to the tula road , in a desperate push beyond the pakhra , the commanders of the russian army had in mind staying near podolsk , and there was no thought of the tarutino position ; but a countless number of circumstances , and the reappearance of french troops , who had previously lost sight of the russians , and the plans for battle , and , above all , the abundance of provisions in kaluga , made our army deviate still more to the south , and move to the middle of its supply lines , from the tula to the kaluga road , to tarutino
1	she suddenly jumped up , suddenly trembled all over , and—what do you think ? —
1	but i am a fool , too !
1	the room was in semi-darkness , only two icon lamps burned before the icons , and there was a good smell of incense and flowers
1	sonia with a faint cry ran up , embraced him and remained so without moving
1	so she lives with the prince ?
1	how did it happen that way ?
1	in the middle of the cotillion , natasha , having finished a figure , still breathing hard , was going to her seat
1	yes , if it were true ; but i do not believe it , i have no right to and can not believe it
1	also to have lunch ?
1	and no one , no one dares to come and judge me in my own house and consider me a baby !
1	so you are glad , and i have done right ?
1	it was a winding road , and about a hundred paces further on , it turned to the right to the graveyard
1	the chambermaid approached planchet , whom she took for lubin , and held out a little note to him
1	our means were only so much ; we took this room because it was the smallest , and we saw it was an honorable house , and that was the most important thing for us
1	i am sure that she is a good girl , and that it is all nonsense
1	the prince is here , and your husband , and the whole company
1	but what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india‐rubber , at least is not alive , has no will , is servile and wo not revolt !
1	one bright morning , around half-past ten , varvara ardalionovna ptitsyn , having gone out to visit some of her acquaintances , returned home in great and rueful pensiveness
1	she looked into her fiance 's face and saw there an expression of compassion and bewilderment
1	m athos had gone to visit one of his friends , who happened to be out , m de tréville went on , a young béarnais , a cadet in his majesty 's guards , m des essarts 's company ; but he had hardly settled himself in his friend 's place and picked up a book while he waited , when a swarm of combined writ servers and soldiers came to lay siege to the house , broke down several doors the cardinal made a sign to the king which meant : this was on that business i mentioned to you
1	why , you are all crying again !
1	mightn ’ t it be that you ’ re acting too light-mindedly , that you ought to look around first ?
1	i feel quite distracted , you know
1	since boris left moscow for the army in , he had not seen the rostovs
1	everything had been well done
1	but these recollections scarcely troubled him now ; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings
1	are you just coming from papa ?
1	one of the players said he had hoped he could be trusted
1	and the conversation again became concentrated , the ladies ' at their end of the table , the men 's at theirs
1	on two sides , the black smoke of fires rose and spread
1	this was the superintendent of the district himself , nikodim fomitch
1	the officer , smiling and shaking his head , as if laughing at himself , ran almost at a trot down the empty street towards the yauzsky bridge to catch up with his regiment
1	you will see for yourselves
1	power , power , that 's what i wanted then , the game was what i wanted , i wanted to achieve your tears , your humiliation , your hysterics – that 's what i wanted then !
1	why did you lie here , then ?
1	and you want to get a fortune all at once ?
1	and he used to be a house serf
1	he doesn ’ t understand anything , prince ; he ’ s totally , totally unable to understand !
1	you will perhaps say to me , contemptuously shaking your headsyou thirst for life , yet you yourself resolve life 's questions with a logical tangle
1	i have a feeling that you and i will either be friends or enemies
1	good evening , dear heart !
1	well , m de la porte placed her near her majesty so that our poor queen would have at least someone to trust , abandoned as she is by the king , spied on as she is by the cardinal , betrayed as she is by everyone
1	i fall in love , being a famous poet and court chamberlain ; i receive countless millions and donate them immediately to mankind , and then and there confess before all the world my disgraces , which , of course , are not mere disgraces , but contain an exceeding amount of the beautiful and lofty , of something manfredian
1	go back to gorki , prince andrei said suddenly
1	i do not know how to answer your question , he said , blushing without knowing why himself
1	alexei ivanovich , alexei iva-novich , do not decide yet , sir !
1	and if ever i regretted the death of my father and mother , it is now , and i sometimes think if my parents were living what a protest i would have aimed at them !
1	it 's good , is not it ?
1	now listen : give this letter to mikhail ilarionovich
1	you are a finicky one , said athos
1	but m de tréville knew nothing , except that the last time he had seen the cardinal , the king , and the queen , the cardinal had had an extremely worried look , the king had been upset , and the reddened eyes of the queen had indicated that she had lain awake or wept
1	yes , it was a prison , for i tried in vain to get out
1	the entire household was governed only by the imaginary orders of the husband , that is , by pierre 's wishes , which natasha tried to guess
1	i am drunk , rodya !
1	why , it 's just such trifles that always ruin everything he had not far to go ; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house : exactly seven hundred and thirty
1	the latter , a pretty girl of twenty or twenty-two , alert and lively , the perfect stage soubrette for a grand lady , jumped down from the footboard , which she had been sitting on following the custom of the time , and headed for the terrace where d'artagnan had seen lubin
1	as for mme coquenard , she could not hold back her tears
1	the rest made some show of ceremony on entering and were all but abashed , though they looked grave and were obviously afraid of somehow losing their dignity , which was strangely out of harmony with their reputation as negators of all useless social trivialities , prejudices , and almost everything in the world except their own interests
1	they got to vereshchagin a half-educated little merchant , you know , a piddler-diddler , the adjutant said , smiling
1	about how all this news affected me , i will tell later , in its place , but now—just a few concluding words about him
1	he sat deeply immersed in a folding armchair , constantly groaning and spreading the collar of his tunic , which , though unbuttoned , still seemed to chafe his neck
1	there 's only one thing i ca not understand : what made him risk such a contemptible action
1	yes , i know , said the soldier
1	there began the struggle for separation , for isolation , for the personal , for mine and yours
1	why have you , who do not believe in the truths of the light and do not see the light , why have you come here , what do you want from us ?
1	the young men repeated in chorus
1	at other times you do not pay any attention to rockets , but now any vain thing makes you glad
1	but most likely it wo not happen though he 's capable tell me , as a friend : you did know about it , you had a presentiment ?
1	he was recently married to varvara , who was taken from a poor family : she is a young woman , beautiful , healthy , and smartly dressed
1	now and then he stopped , listened to the gunfire , and peered at the battlefield
1	it had been raining all morning , and had seemed as if it were just about to stop and the sky to clear , when , after a short pause , the rain would come down harder still
1	in their attitude towards him , doubt could still be felt of who he was ( perhaps a very important person ) , and hostility because of the still-fresh personal struggle with him
1	but chiefly , however you shuffle , it still comes out that i always come out as the first to blame for everything and , what 's most offensive , blamelessly to blame , according to the laws of nature , so to speak
1	and the germans seized pirogov by his arms and legs
1	the wounded , that 's who !
1	hard labor in siberia !
1	no , what i find astonishing is that you were informed of my arrival
1	lambert drawled , laughing and triumphant
1	i will never go to your place , and know also that by tomorrow , or the day after without fail , this paper will be in her own hands , because this document belongs to her , because she wrote it , and i will hand it to her personally , and if you want to know where , know that i will do it through tatyana pavlovna , her acquaintance , in tatyana pavlovna 's apartment—i will hand it to her in tatyana pavlovna 's presence , and take nothing from her for it and now—off with you , forever , or else or else , lambert , i will deal with you less politely when i finished , i was trembling all over
1	he would had enough and left without further ado
1	am i capable of that ?
1	and meanwhile this touching moment refused to be caught
1	his legal father , the peasant makar dolgoruky , he has never seen
1	i wouldn ’ t find anything to say
1	i feel my pulse and , not finding it in my wrist , search for it in my temples , then under my chin , then again in my wrist , and it 's all cold , clammy with sweat
1	i beg you , andryusha , for god 's sake , for the sake of your late father , for the sake of my own peace , be nice to him !
1	it 's trishatov whispering to you against me : i saw the two of you whispering there
1	marfa nikitishna , i believe , wanted to enter a convent ; though i won ’ t insist on that ; maybe i heard it about somebody else … yes , i heard it about a doctor ’ s widow the other day …
1	the memory of the fish he had eaten at dinner was unpleasant
1	but katerina ivanovna is absolutely frantic
1	thought velchaninov , and at once dropped the thought , as if fearing some blasphemy
1	there , sir ; and not only money , sir !
1	no , i simply make bold to state it by way of fact , if i took this man or that for a criminal , why , i ask , should i worry him prematurely , even though i had evidence against him ?
1	yes , of an unbelievable flatness !
1	get out , get out , cursed woman !
1	as soon as vasin praised me , i suddenly felt an irrepressible urge to speak
1	as soon as i go home tonight , i ’ ll lie down at once … in two weeks i ’ ll be dead , i know that … last week b—–n told me himself … so , with your permission , i would like to say a couple of words to you in farewell
1	and when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth
1	he became still more irritable than before , and all the outbursts of his groundless wrath fell mainly upon princess marya
1	the terrible word trembled on his lips , like the latch on that door ; in another moment it will break out , in another moment he will let it go , he will speak out
1	and that 's humiliating for a young man of any pride , in our day especially but remorse ?
1	enough , mother , she seized her
1	olympiada semyonovna shrugged at him and raised her eyes to heaven
1	well , you will see she worries me ; but you will see , you will see !
1	athos , porthos , and aramis , after having a good time at my place and becoming quite lively , made so great a racket that the provost of the castle , a very rigid man , has confined them to barracks for several days
1	god would not allow anything so awful !
1	ca not recall the title
1	to please her , they opened the calendar to another place ; again three names came out : trifily , dula , and varakhasy
1	come , my friends , said athos , let 's finish them off with one blow
1	yes , yes god will repay you for it , faltered sonia , gazing intently at pyotr petrovitch
1	i have drowned , frozen—everything 's happened
1	ah , you are right , monsieur !
1	why , you used to reproach me with breadth !
1	du sublime ( he sees something sublime in himself ) au ridicule il n ' y a qu'un pas , [ ] he says
1	he whispered frenziedly—and suddenly recovered himself
1	he saw with horror the truth of their words : half of his hair had indeed turned white
1	those who left , taking along whatever they could , abandoning houses and half their property , acted that way because of the hidden ( latent ) patriotism which is expressed not in phrases , not in the killing of children to save the fatherland , and similar unnatural acts , but inconspicuously , simply , organically , and therefore always produces the strongest results
1	your things , the ring and the watch , were wrapped up together , and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil , together with the date on which you left them with her how observant you are !
1	if you see so poorly , my dear sir , do not allow yourself to speak of what you do not know
1	the voices of the foot-draggers , who advised waiting for something else and not going on the offensive , had been so unanimously stifled and their arguments refuted by the indubitable proofs of the advantages of an offensive , that what was talked about at the council—the future battle and undoubted victory—seemed no longer future but past
1	i am leaving , and that 's the end of it
1	there was a thick mist outside and he could see nothing
1	i know you will shoot , you pretty wild creature
1	you are not completely drunk yet ?
1	and why do not you work , why are not you at your duty , if you are in the service ?
1	she walked away , but after going fifty paces she turned round to look at him again
1	in the evening she quite often had gatherings of five or six acquaintances , not more
1	she gave her maid katka such a shawl of mine that , even if she lived in luxury before , she maybe never saw the like
1	you should not have suspected your negotiant neighbor of smelling bad i just kept quiet and laughed
1	i will swear an oath the headman 's accounts are a pack of lies
1	i have certainly missed my proper career
1	seeing cossacks ( les cosaques ) on the other side and the spreading steppe ( les steppes ) , in the middle of which lay moscou la ville sainte , [ ] capital of that state , similar to the scythian state to which alexander the great had marched—napoleon , unexpectedly for everyone , and contrary to both strategic and diplomatic considerations , ordered an advance , and the next day his troops started crossing the niémen
1	mon cher , you might oh , never mind , never mind , i interrupted , i will tell only a little about touchard
1	but what did you think ?
1	she was gazing at the ceiling and moving her lips , and her expression was happy , as if she could see death , her deliverer , and was whispering to him
1	pierre silently held his fiancee 's hand and looked at her beautiful breast rising and falling
1	if you are killed , english l : a brother chats with his sister justice will , i hope , be somewhat obliged to me for having spared them the trouble
1	silence lasted for some seconds
1	what do you think ?
1	and just then the wife of colonel ferzing—an infantry regiment was stationed in town— was hurrying to catch the ferry
1	oh , don ’ t worry , i interrupted again , taking hold of the door handle , last week b—n examined me ( again i put b—n into it ) and my case is decided
1	the extreme , almost unnatural tension that had so far sustained ippolit had reached that ultimate degree
1	i , too , would wish for nothing except to live through it all over again
1	at the end of her letter she informed him that in a few days she would be arriving in petersburg from abroad
1	you told me nothing about it before the wedding , however
1	it 's none of my business
1	how simple and clear it is , thought pierre
1	if he were to die now—all that 's left is a skimpy pension , sir
1	but you were sick , and sickness weakens the head , so i excuse you for it
1	he would not understand , but anyhow , i think , yes
1	a quarrel broke out one day , he did not know how
1	natasha , who had long anticipated that they would come to fetch her to nurse the baby , heard the nanny call and went to the nursery
1	mlle bourienne , who was in the drawing room , looked at princess marya with bewildered astonishment
1	there you have my biography !
1	that is not my phrase
1	he 's kind towards our family and has even contributed , but i myself , i personally , have never taken money from him
1	the absurd law is completely paralyzed
1	ferdyshchenko tittered , though somewhat astounded by the generally much too unpleasant impression his story had made
1	do not i see that , du train que nous allons , [ ] our fortune wo not last long !
1	to the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery , he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position , his poverty and helplessness , and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding
1	i : ivan fyodorovich shponka it 's four years now that ivan fyodorovich shponka has been retired and living on his farmstead in vytrebenki
1	what do you advise me ?
1	it was one of katerina ivanovna 's characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours
1	we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to pyotr petrovitch
1	he recalled again that in his whole life he had never once pitied marfa or been gentle with her
1	in that case ( so i felt ) , if she had guessed the truth and knew i was not asleep , then i had already crushed her by my readiness to accept death , and her hand might now falter
1	well , then , can i see porthos ?
1	having put on french uniforms and shakos , petya and dolokhov rode to the clearing from which denisov had looked at the camp , and , riding out of the forest in total darkness , descended into the hollow
1	the old woman was a mistake perhaps , but she is not what matters !
1	when do we go , your excellency ?
1	it 's hardly civil , porfiry petrovitch , but perhaps i wo not allow it !
1	almost every time a new carriage drove up , a whisper ran through the crowd and hats were doffed
1	porthos presented his compliments to master coquenard and bade him farewell
1	it was just past four
1	i am foaming at the mouth , but bring me some little doll , give me some tea with a bit of sugar , and maybe i will calm down
1	then how schneider gave me his opinion of my character and urged me …
1	i will drag him to rodya , and then to you , so that you will get two reports in the hour—from the doctor , you understand , from the doctor himself , that 's a very different thing from my account of him !
1	he has changed his mind since last night
1	i am saying that you are a scoundrel !
1	i should think you are fairly starving ?
1	he had not even thought of saying this , but it was suddenly said of itself
1	i took her almost all the way home and gave her my address
1	how did you find me , by the way ?
1	between two and three they have dinner together , in the evening they do his homework together and weep
1	lebeziatnikov saw the point
1	très intelligent et bavard !
1	he remembered his mother 's love for him , his family 's , his friends ' , and the enemy 's intention to kill him seemed impossible
1	have mercy on me , my good friend
1	thus athos found resources in his household that he was not expecting at all
1	whenever he appeared at an auction , everyone despaired beforehand of acquiring a work of art
1	too early or too late frightening !
1	but the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened
1	well , ivan nikiforovich , you fuss over your gun like a fool over a fancy purse ivan ivanovich said vexedly , because he was indeed beginning to get angry
1	he was unable to weep
1	pyotr petrovitch , edging by her , went to the opposite corner where sonia was
1	a nice acquaintance , my friend
1	this theory seems irrefutable precisely because the act of transferring the wills of the people can not be verified , since it never took place
1	i brought it for you , sir , lebedev picked up hotly
1	he fell out of his carriage after dinner … struck his temple on the hitching post and passed away right there , like a baby , like a little baby
1	you reject music and painting
1	besides , she had a thousand precautions to take , a thousand counsels to give her defender , so that he would avoid explanations with the count in front of witnesses
1	before we would gone a quarter of the way , i suddenly heard a shout behind me : someone called my name
1	i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy , and as of tomorrow he will admit you without any payment
1	meanwhile , mousqueton continued on his route , and , crossing the pont-neuf , constantly driving the two nags before him , came to the rue aux ours
1	i ’ ve already told you , my much-esteemed prince , that i not only have a soft spot for him , but even love him , sir
1	left alone , d'artagnan read and reread his note , then kissed and rekissed twenty times those lines written by his beautiful mistress 's hand
1	what about the police office ?
1	where are we now ?
1	meanwhile , nesvitsky , zherkov , and the officer of the suite stood together out of the range of fire and looking at this small bunch of men in yellow shakos , dark green jackets embroidered with cord , and blue breeches , pottering about by the bridge and , on the other side , at blue coats and groups with horses , which could easily be identified as artillery , approaching in the distance
1	this was an extraordinary moment !
1	cried the prince , looking at him with tender reproach and trying to embrace him
1	well , don ’ t triumph , wait a moment , the touchy nephew cried , don ’ t be so glad
1	i sat and listened with half an ear ; they talked and laughed , but in my head was nastasya egorovna with her news , and i could not wave her away
1	but this , too , is chance , that people were standing there and saw it
1	it was a strange face , like a mask ; white and red , with bright red lips , with a flaxen beard , and still thick flaxen hair
1	he asked in alarm
1	at six o'clock i saw sonia get up , put on her kerchief and her cape , and go out of the room and about nine o'clock she came back
1	it ’ s an insulting , false , and inappropriate assumption !
1	excuse me , young man , has it ever happened to you hm well , to petition hopelessly for a loan ?
1	she … do you think she ’ ll really marry rogozhin , as she writes here in these letters ?
1	two hours later the carts stood in the yard of the bogucharovo house
1	well , that 's just it !
1	i mean that you are a slanderer , that 's what my words mean !
1	they left the table and sat on the porch , which took the place of a balcony
1	last night i began reading a story describing an old man and his daughter
1	he had actually wept for three days , while the prince remained in petersburg , but during those three days he had also come to hate the prince for looking upon him much too compassionately , whereas the fact that he had returned so much money was something not everyone would bring himself to do
1	excuse me , monsieur , but i doubt he can receive you at this moment
1	moment the youth arrived with the carriage ; on learning that the carriage was no longer needed , he became terribly frightened
1	so what is our position ?
1	and so on and so forth
1	sonia cried in distress
1	only understand in what position you have placed her and myself in the eyes of the whole of society and even of the court , he added , lowering his voice
1	but others need you to go there
1	the smoke was followed by the sound of a distant shot , and it could be seen how our troops speeded up at the crossing
1	he did not know how to rob ; he could only murder
1	to talk of what would have happened if napoleon had sent in his guard is the same as talking about what would happen if autumn became spring
1	adelaida had just noticed a tree in the park , a wonderful old tree , branchy , with long , crooked boughs , all in young green , with a hole and a split in it ; she had decided that she had , she simply had to paint it !
1	they simply spit in my face
1	i was wrong , it seems , and i ask you to pardon me for that
1	the adversaries had the right to fire at any time while coming to the barrier
1	let my life go , if only my dear ones may be happy !
1	i was not mistaken , he said
1	as you like , ivan nikiforovich , but i do not know what 's holding you back
1	but though by the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of their actions , though they would have been glad to stop , some incomprehensible , mysterious power still went on governing them , and the artillery men , sweaty , covered with powder and blood , reduced to one in three , though stumbling and gasping from fatigue , kept bringing charges , loaded , aimed , applied the slow match ; and the cannonballs , with the same speed and cruelty , flew from both sides and crushed human bodies flat , and the terrible thing continued to be accomplished , which was accomplished not by the will of men , but by the will of him who governs people and worlds
1	he added with extreme fear
1	how is it you said first that you were here on business ?
1	and i could just go on standing before her and never take my eyes off her !
1	they explained the affair to him and told him how urgent it was for him to find a place for kitty among all his high-born acquaintances
1	you know , for some reason i think there ’ s actually something serious in it , even on her part
1	then god will send you life again
1	she set the washstand down and , without further talk , announced that it was absolutely necessary to wash
1	confide my shame to you ?
1	it 's none of your business
1	and he took one of the soldiers by the shoulder and kicked him with his knee
1	do you have any idea , asked d'artagnan , who the leader of this infernal expedition was ?
1	ippolit is at least an untroublesome fool , but anatole is a troublesome one
1	forasmuch as , though your exterior would not command respect , my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking
1	it flashed , but only flashed
1	'you have been so busy to‐day , arkady ivanovitch , you have forgotten to wind the dining‐room clock , she said
1	he did not want to be a hussar or a chevalier of st george like uncle nikolai ; he wanted to be learned and intelligent and kind , like pierre
1	and he did not want to go home
1	he 's still in the cradle and already wants to smoke a pipe
1	all that he had precisely been charged with , all the government property he was supposed to have evacuated , was still in moscow
1	he , too , had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her , but found raskolnikov in his way
1	however , he was smiling , but all his goodnaturedness , all the femininity of expression he had had till then , suddenly disappeared
1	at least he will be looked after at home they will help him at once
1	andrei yefimych lay there with bated breath : he waited in terror to be hit again
1	the floorboy asked if he wanted a bite to eat ; he answered absentmindedly that he did , and on second thought was furious with himself , because eating would take an extra half hour , and only later did he realize that nothing prevented him from leaving the food uneaten on the table
1	katerina ivanovna nodded towards the landlady
1	never mind , i will ask the masters , they will give you a horse
1	i wo not go there anymore , and i assure you that i have absolutely no interest there , he concluded resolutely
1	natasha knew it was not prince andrei moaning
1	but wherever it turns , there will always be a swirl preceding its movement
1	here and there they gathered in groups , on the pavement , especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in the lower storeys
1	you may rest assured !
1	killing her was atonement for forty sins
1	we ran out to the stairs
1	prince andrei entered the dining room
1	after nikolay 's confession , on that very day had come the scene with sonia ; his behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he could have imagined beforehand ; he had grown feebler , instantly and fundamentally !
1	does he really want to distract my attention with his silly babble ?
1	while the sovereign was still in vilno , the army was divided in three : the first army was under the command of barclay de tolly , the second under the command of bagration , the third under the command of tormasov
1	she was a lively , sincere girl , with deep convictions , and it was interesting to listen to her , though she talked a lot and loudly—perhaps because she was used to talking at school
1	do you know the details ?
1	the year , rd of april
1	it was an instant of full , direct , purely instinctive joy
1	on the counter lay some sliced cucumber , some pieces of dried black bread , and some fish , chopped up small , all smelling very bad
1	once outside of town , d'artagnan quickened his pace and caught up with the gentleman as he was entering a little wood
1	and i am drinking it !
1	and yet , had she been a man , she would have attempted all that , and would perhaps have succeeded
1	as if you ’ d say yes !
1	and so , the battle of borodino took place not at all as it is described ( in an attempt to conceal the mistakes of our commanders and thereby diminishing the glory of the russian army and people )
1	dounia crimsoned , razumihin knitted his brows
1	this relation consists in the following :
1	she slipped between the pots to the other side of the plants and stopped , her head lowered
1	what liza liked in vasin was his sympathy with her position , and , as it had seemed to her from the first , his sympathy for the prince as well
1	who do you think you are ?
1	i have the semblance of a beast , but katerina ivanovna , my spouse , is a person of education and an officer 's daughter
1	such a watery place
1	sonia and polenka rushed after them
1	how , with what to make an end ?
1	nadya said worriedly , why do not you go to a doctor , why do not you look after your health ?
1	in the final end i have come to ask you to appoint me an hour for a serious conversation , and in this lies my chiefest hope
1	alexandra , stop by for a minute
1	je vous le ramènerai tout à l'heure , monsieur dessales
1	katerina pays no heed to anyone ; the madwoman has no fear of water nymphs , she runs about late at night with her knife out , searching for her father
1	let 's go to her , i must say good-bye !
1	but the cursed jewess wo not believe us , she will think we stole it ; besides , i just came from the tavern
1	we have just made our calculations with a spartan stinginess , and we will need fifteen hundred livres each
1	and hurrah ! —which , ever growing and swelling , merged into a deafening roar
1	what am i to do ?
1	it seemed to me that this unexpected question was an invitation to one of those
1	ashamed of his tears !
1	indeed he was wearing a shabby old coat that was too long for him
1	if i would seen her before as she is now , thought nikolai , i would have asked her long ago what i should do , and i would have done whatever she told me , and everything would be right
1	i have no reason to defend the man
1	perfectly , said the dragoon
1	darya alexeevna , do you see this bouquet man , this monsieur aux camélias , he ’ s sitting there and laughing at us …
1	once only did i allow myself to smile at her things
1	he thought it , and meanwhile he went on sitting in the same place
1	the three musketeers our gascon advanced without risk , because he knew where he was going
1	you understand , my child , d'artagnan went on , she 's the wife of that ugly ape you saw on the doorstep when you came here
1	the fourth : the viceroy will take the village ( borodino ) and cross its three bridges , proceeding at the same level as the divisions of morand and gérard ( of which it is not said where and when they would move ) , which , under his command , will head for the redoubt and fall in with the other troops of the army
1	leaving the volchaninovs ' that evening , i went away with the impression of a very long , idle day , and the sad awareness that everything in this world , however long , comes to an end
1	sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at svidrigaïlov
1	ask the count to come to me
1	you might let him die in peace , at least , she shouted at the crowd , is it a spectacle for you to gape at ?
1	if you pull it out , it ’ s yours , the whole hundred thousand is yours !
1	to teach us morals , or what ?
1	it 's awfully stupid though
1	so that i may very likely be able to send to you not twenty‐five , but thirty roubles
1	the battle , which consisted merely in the capture of a french squadron , was presented as a brilliant victory over the french , and therefore the sovereign and the whole army , especially while the powder smoke still hung over the battlefield , believed that the french were defeated and were retreating against their will
1	i should have found plenty to tell you
1	my friend , tell me : well , is it possible to imagine that they want to put me in a madhouse ?
1	can we occupy ourselves with education together , if not now , then in the future ?
1	i ca not be
1	slowly as the unknown man had been walking , he had still gotten away ; or perhaps he had gone into some house
1	i locked him in that he should not escape
1	the fourth horse had arrived
1	i do not want to
1	despite so many years of separation , you have now treated my grief and even myself with such perfect sympathy that i naturally feel grateful
1	a perfect child , and even quite pathetic ; he has fits of some illness ; he ’ s just come from switzerland , straight from the train , strangely dressed , in some german fashion , and besides without a penny , literally ; he ’ s all but weeping
1	i like that sort , said dounia
1	finally she heard the creak of the gates being opened
1	but , besides a feeling of respect , pfuel inspired a feeling of pity in prince andrei
1	then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven years ?
1	allow me , madam allow me
1	the son sighed , admitting by this sigh that his father had understood him
1	aramis reflected for a moment and said , blushing : this will really be doing you a service , d'artagnan ?
1	but here the captain 's widow turned up
1	we will have to go there
1	she would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot pincers
1	everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that
1	have we crushed every last one of them ?
1	having done so , he went back to bed more calmly , began thinking about the poverty and pitifulness of the artist 's lot , about the thorny path that lay before him in this world ; and meanwhile his eyes involuntarily looked through the chink in the screen at the sheet-covered portrait
1	maybe i invented it
1	why , he was accused of the murder , razumihin went on hotly
1	a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once for the boyars
1	where has he gone ?
1	well , then everybody stand back , i do as i like !
1	there was no longer any doubt ; felton was convinced ; felton was hers
1	and in any case there was no point in going today ; he knew that
1	i dreamed terribly , i would dream for three months at a time , shrinking into my corner , and , believe me , in those moments i bore no resemblance to that gentleman who , in the panic of his chicken heart , sat sewing a german beaver to the collar of his overcoat
1	nikolai was saying to himself all the while the wolf moved towards him , drawing away from the woods
1	there was a rumor that general ivan fyodorovich and his wife lizaveta prokofyevna were partly responsible for evgeny pavlovich ’ s visit
1	he watched and felt himself at the height of bliss
1	appeased hunger and the wine made the captain still more lively , and he talked ceaselessly during dinner
1	i dressed up in a peasant kaftan and big boots , put on a drunken , boorish mug , and went to the ticket agent : ' gim me a little ticket , your honor
1	he never asked till now !
1	having begun farming out of necessity , he quickly developed such a passion for it that it became his favorite and almost sole occupation
1	may i , louisa ivanovna ?
1	no , listen , if you are going to judge a man , you must know the case
1	you are always thinking of something unpleasant , he cried with aversion
1	kolya came all the way in the door and handed the prince a note
1	nastasya filippovna laughed loudly at him
1	the general with the bandaged head , leaning forward as if fleeing from danger , went up to kutuzov with long , rapid strides of his thin legs
1	i swear to you , it was not me ; i met her by the gate
1	she listened attentively to an account of the workmen 's associations in france , too
1	in the house all was completely asleep ; the coachman had great difficulty finding the valet , who brought his master through the drawing room and handed him over to the chambermaid , following whom chertokutsky somehow reached his bedroom and lay down next to his young and pretty wife , who was lying there looking lovely in her white-as-snow nightgown
1	there 's just been another one , and i thought you were never coming home !
1	his valet , who , by an unforeseen misfortune , had picked a quarrel with some agents of the authorities , who were disguised as stable boys xxvii : the wife of athos ah , you wretch !
1	i am poor , but noble
1	the student answered me with his tir-lir-li
1	ah , it 's that she 's come !
1	oh , you don juan !
1	that is , i am a novice
1	they constantly kissed each other , spoke tender words to each other , and spent most of their time together
1	devil take that sort of beauty , and furthermore , devil take that sort of profit !
1	better imagine—yes , it 's certainly better—imagine that i am vain , envious , malicious , base , vindictive and
1	a day or two after the epanchins moved to the country , prince lev nikolaevich myshkin arrived from moscow on the morning train
1	i didn ’ t need anything else
1	does my father know about it ?
1	he was in a gold-embroidered uniform with a big standing collar ; he had kidskin trousers on ; at his side hung a sword
1	he did not repeat , as then , with morbid shame , the words he had spoken , did not say to himself : ah , why did not i say it , and why , why did i say 'je vous aime ' then ?
1	we had a waterfall there , not a big one , it fell from high up the mountain in a very thin thread , almost perpendicular—white , noisy , foamy ; it fell from a great height , but it seemed low ; it was half a mile away , but it seemed only fifty steps
1	now no word is spoken among us without dolokhov ; they swear by him , they invite people for him as if he was a sterlet , said shinshin
1	a strange and terrible demon had fastened on to him definitively , and would no longer let him go
1	when i said of the lady that she was as beautiful as you are , i was being clever : i pretended that it had escaped me accidentally , as if i had not even noticed ; i knew very well that women value such escaped praise more highly than any polished compliment you like
1	that was all there was in the room
1	i have no idea !
1	hold your tongue ; it is not with this weapon of yours that i have come to fight with you …
1	then she rushed furiously about the yard , tearing down all the laundry , hers or not hers , flinging it to the ground and trampling on it
1	a piece of writing on someone else 's topic , produced under someone else 's guidance , goes by a different name
1	there 's your thousand-ruble dogs for you—right you are !
1	he fell silent , and this silence , so terrible for countess marya , went on for about a minute
1	get in , get in !
1	i had long been intending to do this , for two years or so – solely to prove to him that he dared not get so puffed up over me , and that if i wished i could always not give him his wages
1	the police chief glanced back fearfully at that moment , said something to the coachman , and his horses picked up speed
1	it seemed to him that the houses all turned their countless fiery eyes on him and stared
1	piskarev felt one elderly man of respectable appearance seize him by the button of his tailcoat and present for his judgment some quite correct observation of his , but he rudely pushed him away without even noticing that he had a rather significant decoration around his neck
1	yes , and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness
1	if you say you are weak yourself , you must and your visitors ?
1	she laughed in his face at his declarations of love , at his gestures , at his offers
1	he saw that poor akim petrovich had even lowered his eyes , as if he were guilty of something
1	i can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me , and i want to know it ; and of you , whether i am dear to you , whether you esteem me , whether you are the husband for me
1	he then took me by the shoulders , turned me face to the field , and—really proved to me that he was indeed the strongest one in our high school
1	oh , i want to
1	and no threats , if you please !
1	cher prince , are you bored ?
1	monsieur le duc , said the king , i understand , rest assured
1	wouldo not move , whatever you may hear
1	the old with the old , the young with the young , the hostess by the tea table , on which there were exactly the same cakes in a silver basket as the panins had at their soirée—everything was exactly the same as with everyone else
1	his daughter tucked some down-filled chintz pillows behind his back and under him
1	but what about the ear‐rings ?
1	well , if you want , i ’ ll kiss your hand right now
1	varvara ardalionovna came in
1	from which it obviously follows that the oft-mentioned sow was undoubtedly put up to it by the adversary himself , the self-styled gentleman , ivan , son of ivan , pererepenko , already exposed as a robber , attempted murderer , and blasphemer
1	one cannonball , a second , a third flew over him , landing in front , on the sides , behind
1	i expect you have not talked to anyone for some days ?
1	what do you think ?
1	pierre had been choosing a career for three months already and had done nothing
1	not because he had his hair curled at the barber 's , not because he was in such a hurry to show his wit , but because he is a spy , a speculator , because he is a skin‐flint and a buffoon
1	if akaky akakievich transgressed the order of things by desiring a new overcoat ( by desiring anything at all ) , and is punished most terribly for it in the phantasmal world of petersburg , he also returns as a phantom himself and has his revenge
1	vera and shinshin were playing chess in the drawing room
1	oh , mercy on us—marfa petrovna svidrigaïlov
1	children look that way at someone they love very much , when they are asking for something
1	you ca not help getting pale if you have nothing to eat , he added , with difficulty articulating the words
1	and suddenly i became vexed that i was grumbling : she 's maybe the only one i love , and it 's her that i torment
1	i am the same way myself have you read livingstone 's travels ?
1	oh , i know that , i will remember
1	the calm ilagin , nikolai , natasha , and the uncle flew along , not knowing how or where , seeing only the dogs and the hare , and only fearing to lose sight , even for a moment , of the course of the chase
1	half of it had recently been incorporated into the town , the other half remained a village
1	raskolnikov waved him off
1	and in smolensk he also reasoned correctly that the french might outflank us and that they had the greater force
1	sonia heard raskolnikov 's request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table
1	his clothes were on the dirty side
1	you have one second to make up your mind , he said
1	it 's a fish that likes space
1	maybe you did not know it yourself , but it was so , because you did feel all that
1	several captive officers , in order to see better , climbed the wall of the charred house by which pierre was standing
1	the prince gave lebedev a strange look
1	the walls looked as though they were made of planks , covered with shabby paper , so torn and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable , though the general colour—yellow—could still be made out
1	it 's the moon that makes it so still , weaving some mystery , thought raskolnikov
1	you don ’ t know rogozhin ?
1	certainly , nothing else to be done
1	the next morning they started late and again stopped so many times that they only reached great mytishchi
1	and something trembled in aglaya ’ s voice
1	i have already ordered it cleared on the avenue
1	but how is this possible ?
1	but it was all impudent and careless
1	does that suffice you , athos asked his adversary , and do you find me enough of a nobleman to do me the favor of crossing swords with me ?
1	they will tell me there 's no idea here , and precisely nothing new
1	all 's still , the air 's light ; the grass is growing—grow , grass of god ; a bird 's singing—sing , bird of god ; a baby squeals in a woman 's arms—the lord be with you , little person , grow and be happy , youngling !
1	and a whole bowl of dumplings would be poured into a sack
1	she did not utter a word , she did not even look at her , she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl ( we have a shawl , made of drap de dames ) , put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall ; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering and i went on lying there , just as before and then i saw , young man , i saw katerina ivanovna , in the same silence go up to sonia 's little bed ; she was on her knees all the evening kissing sonia 's feet , and would not get up , and then they both fell asleep in each other 's arms together , together yes and i lay drunk
1	women , pierre said in a low , barely audible voice
1	i have never experienced such hell before
1	two valets were bustling around prince vassily , dressing him ; he himself looked around animatedly and nodded cheerfully to his entering son , as if to say : right , that 's how i need you to look !
1	and we thought you were pavel pavlovich 's friend , but it turns out he was simply boasting
1	what was that about ?
1	god , how guilty i am before you !
1	forgetting his intention not to reveal his knowledge of french , pierre , tearing the pistol away and dropping it , ran to the officer and began speaking to him in french
1	i am staying close here at madame resslich 's
1	he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men
1	said d'artagnan , looking at her for the first time with a certain attention
1	anna sergeevna was touching , she had about her a breath of the purity of a proper , naive , little-experienced woman ; the solitary candle burning on the table barely lit up her face , but it was clear that her heart was uneasy
1	( and his face twisted in spiteful mockery )
1	i don ’ t like this ferdyshchenko of yours : some sort of salacious buffoon
1	the spring , [ ] replied nikolai
1	that 's just what it was not !
1	by evening i had already quite successfully forgotten all the rest , brushed it aside , and i was still perfectly pleased with my letter to simonov
1	but some of the notes he left on the table
1	when she said this to him , he made no reply , but only bowed and once more showed everyone his smile , which said nothing except perhaps this : opinions are opinions , but you see what a good and nice fellow i am
1	let it all be as it has been
1	and even what i am sure of
1	there were soirees on wednesdays
1	only i will get my revenge
1	( she pointed to a man in the crowd )
1	the policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for thirty yards on the road
1	( the lady in mourning had left the office )
1	i saw in the same order that he , bolkonsky ( she uttered that name in a quick whisper ) , is in russia and serving again
1	hugo 's notre dame de paris had also reached a wider public
1	does smolensk lay down the law for us ?
1	you , my dear boy , have been with the regiment next to no time ; here today , tomorrow somewhere else as a little adjutant ; you could not care less if people say : 'there are thieves among the pavlogradsky officers !
1	boris was naming the guests at the table for his new friend pierre , while exchanging glances with natasha , who was sitting across from him
1	wait , that 's not all , pyotr petrovitch detained her , smiling at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners , and you know me little , my dear sofya semyonovna , if you suppose i would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself only
1	when they went out to the drawing room for coffee , the old men sat together
1	) ; as for ganechka , i ’ ll comfort him myself , i ’ ve got an idea
1	be quick with the wedding !
1	tréville had grasped his master 's weak side , and it was to that cleverness that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left behind the reputation of having been very faithful in his friendships
1	oh , nothing—tea , vodka , herrings
1	listen , if you please , little countess , she said to natasha with a smile very much like the uncle 's smile
1	katerina fell silent , looking down into the slumbering water ; and the wind sent ripples over the water , and the whole dnieper silvered like a wolf 's fur in the night
1	but , my lord , if the lord chancellor asks me about the motives that have led your grace to so extraordinary a measure , what shall i reply ?
1	i ran and started shouting to him ; but as i could only shout hey !
1	today i went to town , visited—what 's his name ? —the archpriest sidonsky
1	he was not thinking of anything and did not want to think
1	an officer was sent for
1	all these questions about crime , environment , children , recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time
1	she gave me water , looking at me as if lost
1	alpatych , at a more hurried pace than usual , came into the yard and went straight to the shed for his horses and cart
1	mama is sitting beside him ; he strokes her cheeks and hair and looks into her eyes with tender feeling
1	why , it 's not enough ?
1	you can overturn the world with such beauty
1	forgive me if you can , she stopped in the doorway
1	if you wish , i will move it out a little , it 's a bit dark in here
1	i am not dreaming of any folly
1	without you servants of the higher principle , who live consciously and freely , mankind would be insignificant ; developing in natural order , it would wait a long time for the end of its earthly history
1	understand well that i am devoted to these two all-powerful masters , and that my serious efforts will never have any other end than service to the king and to m le cardinal , one of the most illustrious geniuses france has ever produced
1	some twenty men of the sixth company , who were on their way to the village , joined the haulers , and the wattle wall , about thirty-five feet long and seven feet high , curving , crushing and cutting the shoulders of the panting men , moved on down the village street
1	she was told of it in the morning , when the old man and varvara were sitting under the birch tree by the porch drinking tea
1	at that point there is a great block of buildings , entirely let out in dram shops and eating‐houses ; women were continually running in and out , bare‐headed and in their indoor clothes
1	but he could not bring himself to do this
1	what a way to reason !
1	the prince replied , almost bursting into laughter
1	i suppose you are wondering at my being such an adaptable man ?
1	afterwards i spent a whole day sitting over this paper with the prince , and he argued with me very vehemently , though he remained pleased ; only i do not know whether he submitted the paper or not
1	'good friend , to an englishman , interrupted athos
1	the mason was silent for a long time , evidently thinking something over
1	she looked slightly over prince andrei 's head with that confident , habitual look with which one looks at the place of a familiar portrait
1	and that which in a depraved man would arouse bold thoughts , that same thing , on the contrary , made him still more radiant
1	svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it
1	if anyone happens to forget , i ’ ll remind him !
1	to better show readers the cultivation of the p— infantry regiment , we shall add that two of the officers gambled terribly at faro and would lose uniform , visored cap , greatcoat , sword knot , and underwear to boot—something not always found even among cavalrymen
1	but pralinsky 's absurd hu-humaneness had to pass through the underground of duplicity and silence—the failure of velchaninov to tear the very last word either from pavel pavlovich or from himself in the eternal husband ; the putrefaction of souls leading to the senselessly repeated bobok , bobok that haunts the writer of bobok ; and finally the hell of
1	and what a huntsman he was , you wo not find another like him in the whole world
1	i told you it would not be enough
1	how do i know ?
1	i began putting them together , expecting dmitri to come , and there in the passage , in the corner by the door , i stepped on the box
1	she glanced at me quickly and with great curiosity , in which , however , there was a good deal of childishness :
1	is the movement of people during the crusades explained by studies of the godefroys and louis and their ladies ?
1	it was then that i suddenly fell asleep , something that had never happened to me before , at the table , in the armchair
1	but the general stood as if stunned and only looked around senselessly
1	maybe it will be boring and painful for me to be with people
1	it was hard to believe that ivan fyodorovich , in his venerable old age , with his excellent intelligence and positive knowledge of life , and so on and so forth , should be tempted by nastasya filippovna—and that , supposedly , to such an extent that the caprice almost resembled passion
1	murmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides
1	yes , to make him come to paris , and once he has come to paris , to draw him into some trap
1	i fled from them to avoid further litigation over pavlishchev ’ s land
1	compassion , love for our brothers , for those who love us , love for those who hate us , love for our enemies—yes , that love which god preached on earth , which princess marya taught me , and which i did not understand ; that 's why i was sorry about life , that 's what was still left for me , if i was to live
1	at the same time , d'artagnan felt planchet slip a note into his hand
1	with a movement quick as thought , he tore open the envelope , despite the cry that kitty uttered on seeing what he was about to do , or rather , what he was doing
1	believe me , i understand
1	he did not keep a serving woman for fear people might think ill of him , but he kept a cook , afanasy , an old man of about sixty , drunk and half-crazy , who had served as an orderly and was able to slap a meal together
1	but does the sorcerer know this melancholy ?
1	modern history , in its theory , has rejected both of these propositions
1	he said and rode on
1	however , i must talk with our court clerk first , to see whether we ca not claim it through the court
1	she wanted to explain to him that this was a mistake , that all was not lost yet , that life could still be beautiful and happy , that he was a rare , extraordinary , and great man , and that she would stand in awe of him all her life , worship him and feel a holy dread
1	there ’ s the kind that loves domination
1	tell me the whole truth !
1	i walked into the room , she was sitting in the same place , sewing , her head bent , but no longer singing
1	and the more i drink the more i feel it
1	marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search
1	i confess , i had even called medji over once and said , listen , medji , we are alone now ; i will lock the door if you like , so no one can see—tell me everything you know about the young miss , what and how she is ?
1	is that , ganya hastened to put in
1	the jack watched me with amazement and sighed
1	sergei kuzmich , from all sides , he said , undoing the top button of his waistcoat
1	if they have backed up , it means they have got business back there
1	but has katerina ivanovna been able to manage with such small means ?
1	they passed out of the picture
1	and the fireworker understood that
1	i will not allow you to do so otherwise , and so meanwhile , good‐bye , as we have evidently nothing to keep us now
1	he yelled , enraged at being spat upon , seizing her by the shoulder and showing her the revolver—naturally just to frighten her
1	how can i assist ?
1	akaky akakievich shook his head and chuckled , and then went on his way
1	for the moment , she wanted nothing more
1	once he ( he was the enemy ) starts peppering the bridge , the old soldier said gloomily , addressing his comrade , you will forget about scratching yourself
1	velchaninov mumbled that he would write to him
1	he cried , struck by a sudden idea
1	no noise from outside reached me , enabling me to measure time ; i merely presumed that it might be seven or eight o'clock in the evening , for it was october and pitch dark
1	in that case , do not worry , she will let herself soften
1	that 's excellent , excellent and noble , is not it ?
1	pulcheria alexandrovna stood overwhelmed
1	i expect from you in your next letter a complete description of the costume of a village deacon , from his underclothes to his boots , with the names used by the most rooted , ancient , undeveloped little russians ; also the names , down to the last ribbon , for the various pieces of clothing worn by our village maidens , as well as by married women , and by muzhiks the exact names for clothing worn in the time of the hetmans
1	that too must have something to do with it , he concluded to himself
1	in these songs they expressed all the feelings that the departing day had given them , praised it , and bade it farewell
1	fear gained more and more mastery over him , especially after this second , quite unexpected murder
1	oh , how sonorous , how beautiful the greek language is !
1	the headman , the delegate , and the village clerk , who were waiting in the front hall of the wing , listened at first with fear and satisfaction to the sound of the young count 's rapping voice rising higher and higher , pouring out terrible and abusive words one after another
1	anyuta began to dress
1	and that will come soon , do not count on your youth
1	a big one even , not a little one—that ’ s why i ’ ve wrapped myself in a mantilla , replied nastasya filippovna , who indeed had turned paler and at moments seemed to suppress a violent shiver
1	one could see them moving their jaws ahead of time with frightful aptitude
1	i have become dissolute since the month of march , alexei ivanovich , and this is how it happened , sir , lend me your ear
1	though five minutes earlier prince andrei had been able to say a few words to the soldiers transporting him , now , with his eyes fixed directly on napoleon , he was silent to him at that moment all the interests that occupied napoleon seemed so insignificant , his hero himself seemed so petty to him , with his petty vanity and joy in victory , compared with that lofty , just , and kindly sky , which he had seen and understood , that he was unable to answer him
1	he himself was carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to employ in moscow
1	throughout the army and in headquarters joyful , though incorrect , rumors were rife about the imaginary approach of columns from russia , about some victory won by the austrians , and about the retreat of the frightened bonaparte
1	i will report it to the superintendent
1	the most usual general abstractions , accepted by almost all historians , are freedom , equality , enlightenment , progress , civilization , culture
1	she does not listen and walks on
1	kovrin was too agitated to speak
1	after these aces and the aristocracy of kolomna come the extraordinarily puny and piddling
1	here 's a letter to prince vassily , and here 's some money
1	i sometimes fancy it like that
1	later , in the course of his first day spent in solitude and idleness ( pierre tried several times , but was unable to fix his attention on masonic manuscripts ) , a thought had vaguely presented itself to him several times , the same thought he had had before about the cabalistic connection between his name and the name of bonaparte ; but this thought that he , l'russe besubof , was destined to set a limit to the power of the beast , still came to him only as one of those fantasies that , without cause or trace , flit through one 's imagination
1	do you know to whom you are saying this ?
1	he 's undecided now whom to attack : you or mlle julie karagin
1	allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity : have you ever spent a night on a hay barge , on the neva ?
1	by morning the night 's fog had left only hoarfrost turning into dew on the heights , but in the hollows the fog still spread its milk-white sea
1	as always happens , the men , who had started out cheerfully , began to halt ; displeasure was voiced , confusion was sensed , they began moving back somewhere
1	that may very well be so
1	they do not seem to understand and ca not understand , but are not a bit ashamed
1	suddenly i run into him at eleven in the evening , the night before the birthday and the ball , at marya petrovna zubkov ’ s , a neighbor of the ordyntsevs
1	the pigs here are fed on homebrew mash mixed with a little flat beer
1	there was a jewish orchestra in town that usually played at weddings , conducted by the tinsmith moisei ilyich shakhkes , who took more than half the proceeds for himself
1	nobody did see him , razumihin answered with vexation
1	who is the curly‐headed one who has just peeped out ?
1	the carriage that 's good
1	but all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep it seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing , had prepared nothing yet and meanwhile perhaps it had struck six
1	i will come to see you , but you are a scoundrel
1	to begin with , this would transform everything , even his own position ; he would have at once to confess his secret to dounia
1	milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak , therefore she knew him
1	in the opposite case i shall be compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then you must blame yourself
1	and besides , there 's a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously , but about that i
1	the subject says about this poor knight ’ :
1	she made the sign of the cross over herself and over him , and put the wooden cross on his neck
1	what will happen , if you should really be taken to the hospital to‐morrow ?
1	and indeed he had only to lie down in order to fall asleep at once like a stone , and he had only to shake himself in order to set about doing something at once , without a second 's delay , the way children , on getting up , take their toys
1	three would be too many , and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves !
1	dresses , cavaliers with cigarettes in their teeth flashed by
1	on the eve of his departure from petersburg , prince andrei brought along pierre , who had not once been to the rostovs ' since the time of the ball
1	she looked up at him with a burning , reproachful glance
1	and so , from the very depths of my being , from all my strength , a protest began to rise , and i choked with a feeling of boundlessly exaggerated arrogance and defiance
1	he glanced back hastily at the door , looked around , and , leaning towards me from the sofa , whispered in a frightened voice : cher ami !
1	if , for instance , he was , on top of that , also an official , it was solely because for him the service , too , had turned , so to speak , into one of the duties of his married life ; he served for the sake of his wife and her social position in t— , though he was in himself quite a zealous official
1	you are a kind and charming young man , said mme bonacieux
1	to whomever you order , your majesty
1	avdotya romanovna was remarkably good looking ; she was tall , strikingly well‐proportioned , strong and self‐reliant—the latter quality was apparent in every gesture , though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements
1	now , to his surprise , he discovered that there were no more doubts and perplexities in all these questions
1	the countess was accustomed to this tone , which always preceded something ruinous for their children , like some sort of building of a gallery or conservatory , the organizing of a home theater or musical performances—and being accustomed to it , she considered it her duty always to fight against whatever was expressed in that timid tone
1	take those for yourself , entirely for yourself , and let that be strictly between ourselves , so that no one knows of it , whatever you hear
1	she said , in a concentrated voice
1	good heavens , they have killed him , they have killed a man !
1	at the best someone will make them up somehow for himself out of books or from some old chronicle
1	i did not finish , she hurried on , turning more red
1	sleep , sleep , he repeated in a weak voice
1	i remember a lot
1	he was right when he said to his sister that the sick boy had improved
1	others have lowered themselves so far as to disobey sentries and guards officers , abusing and beating them
1	they each insisted on going ahead of the other
1	now and then he was tempted to swear at them , to jeer at them , while they could not open the door !
1	i did not think there could be two sapphires of so fine a water
1	what is it , liza , what is it ?
1	she was standing sideways to the table
1	pierre acknowledged that it was true , and starting with that question , guided gradually by the questions of princess marya and especially natasha , was drawn into a detailed account of his adventures
1	when he brought the portrait to the door , the eyes stared still more strongly
1	as for the previous word he talks about in his letter and which supposedly lit up his whole life , there he ’ s lying brazenly
1	people are his instruments
1	raevsky , with an impatient expression , twirling the black hair on his temples with a habitual gesture , glanced now at kutuzov , now at the door
1	prince nikolai andreich winced and said nothing
1	the woman would be very frightened and hurriedly walk away , but we would also quicken our pace and— go on with our thing
1	having jumped into the bedroom and stumbled over the bed , i noticed at once that there was a door from the bedroom to the kitchen , which meant a way out of my trouble and a possibility of escape , but—oh , horror ! —the door was locked and the key was not in the lock
1	go on , take it to court !
1	that amalia ludwigovna , ah !
1	lying behind the door ?
1	raskolnikov joined the throng of women , who were talking in husky voices
1	[ ] anna pavlovna said to the arriving guests , and led them quite seriously to a little old lady in high ribbons , who had come sailing out of the next room as soon as the guests began to arrive , called them by name , slowly shifting her gaze from the guest to ma tante , and then walked away
1	until noon on the nineteenth , the movement , animated conversation , running , and sending of adjutants were limited to the emperors ' headquarters ; after noon of the same day the movement spread to the headquarters of kutuzov and the staffs of the leaders of columns
1	and he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov
1	you felt something extraordinary and hot , like that scorching sandy desert with its lions , in which the saint wandered
1	on the fourth floor they stopped outside a low door
1	she blushed all over
1	he said resolutely ; he moved from the bridge and walked in the direction of the police office
1	only then , as if through sleep , did he remember looking for some treasure , being afraid in the forest alone
1	but on the eve of holy monday , late at night , there suddenly came a sinister knocking at the gate ; someone banged on the wicket as on a barrel : boom !
1	so in this way , rodion romanovitch , i reached the furthest limit , and knocking my head against a post , i pulled myself up , asking myself what i was about
1	he fixed a strained intent look on his sister , but did not hear or did not understand her words
1	go on , ninny , you will miss her !
1	he spoke gently , though not without a certain ruefulness in his speech
1	let it all be as you have said , but you , too , will sit there eternally on your horse , and as long as you sit there on your horse , there will be no kingdom of heaven for you !
1	for we are always able to pay up for our little third-class grave
1	how beautiful you are today , liza
1	it often happened when he was with her that he would begin to argue , to think aloud , and she responded to that each time either by a brief but appropriate remark , showing that it did not interest her , or by a silent smile and glance , which showed pierre her superiority most palpably
1	now decide for yourself , as you know best , whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not
1	having played two rubbers , chertokutsky again found a glass of punch under his hand , which he , forgetting himself , again drank off , after first saying , it 's time , gentlemen , really , it 's time i went home
1	yes ; the porter and nastasya were standing there
1	she sighed , lost in thought
1	dumas was bent on having his play performed at the comédie française
1	outside it was still light
1	and it surely has , ganya observed
1	capitaine , ils ont de la soupe et du gigot de mouton dans la cuisine , he said
1	she asked herself in perplexity : what is he looking for in me ?
1	that means she wanted to herself … well , good-bye , it ’ s time for us both
1	he said , seeing ivan fyodorovich
1	why , then this strapping lad is the devil in person !
1	go get the clothes ready
1	i respond to pain with cries and tears , to meanness with indignation , to vileness with disgust
1	after another five days , the young prince nikolai andreich was baptized
1	was this ivan ivanovich ?
1	the empress , who did in fact have very shapely and lovely feet , could not help smiling at hearing such a compliment from the lips of a simple-hearted blacksmith , who , in his zaporozhye outfit , could be considered a handsome fellow despite his swarthy complexion
1	each feeling and thought lives separately in me , and in all my opinions about science , the theater , literature , students , and in all the pictures drawn by my imagination , even the most skillful analyst would be unable to find what is known as a general idea or the god of the living man
1	with her , he was always very patient , considerate even
1	and some of them said , could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
1	she gets up and paces in agitation
1	you are in a government office , too , cried raskolnikov , and you are smoking a cigarette as well as shouting , so you are showing disrespect to all of us
1	before him sat a totally different woman , not at all like the one he had known till then and had left only that july in the village of delight
1	at first he was for making up to sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity : 'how , said he , 'can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that ?
1	il jette feu et flamme contre tout le monde , s'empare des lettres , les décacheté , et lit celles de l'empereur adressées à d'autres
1	akaky akakievich walked along in a merry state of mind , and even suddenly ran , for some unknown reason , after some lady who passed by like lightning , every part of whose body was filled with extraordinary movement
1	a young doctor comes in , wearing a new black two-piece suit , gold-rimmed spectacles , and , sure enough , a white tie
1	remembering , sketchily , the main outlines of his recent scene with porfiry , he could not help shuddering again with horror
1	then you have doubly offended me , said porthos , disengaging the procureuse 's arm from his own , for if you are rich , mme coquenard , then there is no more excuse for your refusal
1	we must take off his clothes
1	she felt somehow ashamed
1	the door opened and razumihin came in
1	he thus resolved to defend the door bravely ; and since , having been betrayed by the mistress of the inn , he could not say that aramis was not there , he tried to prove to the new arrival that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in the pious conference he had entered upon that morning , which , according to bazin , could not possibly end before evening
1	both were pale , and the expression or their faces—one of them glanced timidly at pierre— had something in it similar to what he had seen in the young soldier at the execution
1	certainly to porfiry , razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement
1	i have just been with the priest 's son
1	then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole : but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen
1	as a matter of fact , we do not know precisely with what offers he wrote , but he wrote every day , every hour , letter after letter !
1	it 's not a matter of permission or prohibition
1	you know , marie , natasha said suddenly with a mischievous smile , which princess marya had not seen on her face for a long time
1	and though the fact with the teacher 's wife was not repeated , though he did not set anyone on a peg leg , the mere thought that this would certainly have to be repeated , if the circumstances were such , nearly killed him at times
1	the crimea i mean , the caucasus
1	and so , while the others would go in hired carriages to visit small landowners , he sat at home and exercised himself in occupations dear only to a meek and kindly soul : polishing his buttons , reading a fortune-telling book , setting mousetraps in the corners of his room , and , finally , taking off his uniform and lying in bed
1	that , too , is a lie !
1	pavel pavlovich said with a humbly submissive smile at himself
1	the face of this young woman was completely unknown to her
1	i know it very well , because prince vassily told me himself
1	though she had invented it herself , she believed in it firmly by this time
1	i lay down , and there was nothing in my thoughts
1	you could take the housekeeper 's little room for a while
1	they agreed on fifteen kopecks
1	ho-o-ow 's that you are standing ?
1	no , he has not made dounia any presents yet
1	there is a captive princess , there is a prince who is called upon to save her , and there is a dark force that threatens them both
1	thank god , her sufferings are over , but i will tell you everything in order , so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you
1	it ’ s probably just outrageous talk , murmured ganya , also somewhat bewildered
1	countess marya turned pale from fright and began making signs to her son
1	the man ’ s suspiciousness seemed to be increasing more and more ; the prince was too far from fitting into the category of everyday visitors , and though the general had rather often , if not daily , at a certain hour , to receive sometimes even the most varied sorts of visitors , especially on business , still , in spite of habit and his rather broad instructions , the valet was in great doubt ; the secretary ’ s mediation was necessary for the announcement
1	now he , this real russian prince , had come
1	see , even the officer got shoved aside , the halted crowds were saying on different sides , looking at each other , and still pressing forward towards the exit
1	first of all , he felt sorry that natasha , whom he loved most of all in the family , would be leaving home ; second , from his hussar point of view , he was sorry he was not there to show this bolkonsky that connection with him was by no means so great an honor , and that if he loved natasha , he could do without the permission of his crackbrained father
1	ce qu'ils font , ce qu'ils font !
1	with a shriek she rushed like a fury at katerina ivanovna , considering her to blame for everything
1	but m de tréville is a skillful physiognomist , who can judge men at first sight , and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law , m des essarts , while letting you hope that one day or another you would enter the musketeers
1	aramis went on : vanity of vanities !
1	having run to the front hall , natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf
1	she would spend hours at a time making fun of the prince and all but turning him into a buffoon
1	i saw it in your eyes
1	before , he had still sought to give some new pose , to impress with force , with effects
1	everyone has his own plans
1	the pain caused by the transfer to the cottage had made prince andrei moan loudly and lose consciousness again
1	i should like to know one thing more : how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since ?
1	in this village , and in the manor house , and all over the knoll , in the garden , by the wells and the pond , and along the road uphill from the bridge to the village , no more than four hundred yards away , crowds of men could be seen through the undulating mist
1	but i no longer had any wish for their love ; on the contrary , i constantly thirsted for their humiliation
1	but when i finished , he still did not quite agree : that 's all so , he sighed deeply , but how many are there who will endure and not get distracted ?
1	the explainer said and laughed
1	but you remember them all so clearly , and and stupid !
1	raskolnikov looked at him with surprise , not understanding where he had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd
1	you said that porthos was wounded
1	it 's ready , it 's ready , little falcon !
1	no , i never stopped loving liza but , on the contrary , loved her still more , only i did not want to approach her first , though i understood that she would not come to me first for anything
1	now he is off , beating the drum !
1	his eyes glittered as though he were mad , sonia thought , in her turn
1	he called out as i went down the stairs : he was so pleased i was leaving
1	but she ’ s never lived near the bolshoi theater , and my father has never been to nastasya filippovna ’ s , if you want to know
1	excuse me , my dear m bonacieux , if i impose on you unceremoniously , but nothing makes one so thirsty as lack of sleep , and i have a raging thirst
1	but the stairs , too , were quite deserted ; all the doors were shut ; he met no one
1	non , vrai , avez-vous quelque chose contre moi ?
1	now , i am ridiculously attached to my head , seeing that it seems to go rather well with my shoulders
1	i understood her , thought prince andrei
1	well , granted such chances may even be extremely rare ; all the same , my main rule will be not to risk anything , and the second—to be sure to earn at least something each day over and above the minimum spent on my subsistence , so that the accumulation does not stop for a single day
1	but the pain got its own back and overcame weariness and sleep ; an hour later he awoke and with suffering got up from the sofa
1	i did not wish to change it in any way and tell it almost as simply as i heard it
1	and , followed by his lackey , he set out for the governor 's country house
1	when pierre himself wanted to be unfaithful to his wish , she fought him with his own weapons
1	oh , what an unbearable child !
1	so i really am a princess !
1	and where is lise ?
1	it makes no sense , your honor , it 's not right
1	ah , a fine spot !
1	i have been told positively that people in the last stages of consumption sometimes lose their minds temporarily
1	if only he lives !
1	what had he to look forward to ?
1	as soon as nikolai took her hand , she was unable to restrain herself and began to weep
1	he despised me so much that he talked about me with stebelkov , and yesterday he told me himself that he wanted to throw both me and versilov out
1	but they just laughed at me and in the end began to consider me some sort of holy fool
1	and , of course , i am not rich in patients
1	dear lady , said mme bonacieux , forgive me for interrupting you , but what do you advise me to do ?
1	but then akim petrovich was finished and began to gather up the papers
1	even as it is , she was quite right : she was suffering and that was her asset , so to speak , her capital which she had a perfect right to dispose of
1	ah , ma bonne , ma bonne , he said , rising and taking her by both hands
1	it was still , and once in a while from that hill floated the sounds of bugles and the shouts of the enemy
1	incidentally , with regard to the eldest , alexandra , lizaveta prokofyevna did not know whether to fear for her or not
1	his hair was terribly black , his face white and red-cheeked like a mask , his nose long and aquiline , such as frenchmen have , his teeth white , his eyes black
1	she ’ d never spoken with me like that before !
1	nastasya filippovna could not help hearing both the question and the answer , but it seemed to increase her gaiety still more
1	i ca not understand why pyotr petrovitch has not come ?
1	but you know the reason why
1	if i am happy by an error , do not have the cruelty to take it from me
1	in those two months he had had time to think it over and decide , promising himself that he would try at all costs to cancel his father at least for a time , and even to efface him from petersburg , if possible , whether his mother agreed to it or not
1	go kiss your sow !
1	pierre was the only man before whom he would venture to speak himself out ; but then he spoke everything that was in his heart
1	raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the cemetery
1	ptitsyn , help me out , you percentage soul , charge whatever you like , get me a hundred thousand by evening : i tell you , i won ’ t stint !
1	sonia clasped her hands
1	after the adjutant , a commissary comes asking where to transport the food supplies , and the head of the hospitals asking where to transport the wounded ; and a courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign that does not admit the possibility of abandoning moscow , and the commander 's rival , the one who tries to undermine him ( there are always rivals—not one , but several ) , suggests a new plan , diametrically opposed to the plan of going to the kaluga road ; and the commander 's own forces require sleep and fortification ; and a venerable general , overlooked for a reward , comes to complain , and the inhabitants beg for protection ; and an officer sent to survey the terrain comes and reports the complete opposite of what an officer sent out before him had said ; and a spy , a prisoner , and a general who did some reconnoitering all describe the position of the enemy army differently
1	if this man had been endowed with at least some ability to understand the feelings of other people and had guessed pierre 's feelings , pierre would probably have left him ; but this man 's lively imperviousness to everything that was not himself won pierre over
1	he carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages
1	none of them , incidentally , was very drunk ; but they all seemed quite tipsy
1	and the main reason is—i love you like a son
1	you are not really afraid of me !
1	go back to them—be with them be with them to‐morrow and always i perhaps i shall come if i can
1	the rostovs assumed that the address russian guards abroad was a perfectly definite address , and that , if the letter reached the grand duke who was in command of the guards , there was no reason to think it would not reach the pavlogradsky regiment , which should be in the vicinity ; and therefore it was decided to send the letters and money through the grand duke 's courier to boris , and boris would have to deliver them to nikolushka
1	without trying to explain the strange event to himself , pleased merely at having seen not only the black clothes but even the face and eyes of the monk so closely and clearly , feeling pleasantly excited , he returned home
1	surprising there ’ s no doorkeeper , but … it ’ s a holiday , and the doorkeeper is away
1	some two ladies peeped into the front hall from the stairs , hesitating to come in
1	he 's still a young lad , she used to say , despite the fact that ivan fyodorovich was just shy of forty , he ca not know everything !
1	she asked quickly , catching at a straw
1	hello , said the monk and , after some silence , he asked : what are you thinking about now ?
1	the room – narrow , small , and low , encumbered by a huge wardrobe , and littered with cartons , rags , and all sorts of castoff clothing – was almost totally dark
1	the face of the regimental commander , after the happily passed-off review , expressed irrepressible joy
1	no sign of you
1	never mind that i myself have just rejected the crystal edifice , for the sole reason that one can not taunt it with one 's tongue
1	once these dispositions were made , the four valets retired in their turn
1	psyche began to come to life , and the barely glimpsed idea gradually began to be clothed in visible flesh
1	when , at the ball , by the old habit of a courtier of catherine 's time , kutuzov , on the sovereign 's entrance into the ballroom , ordered the captured standards thrown down at his feet , the sovereign winced unpleasantly and spoke some words , among which some heard : old comedian
1	besides princess belokonsky , a certain lady was expected , the wife of a very important gentleman and a dignitary
1	i will tell about myself first of all
1	she said to her son and smiled
1	what , have i dropped words like that ?
1	i admit i have been disposed to that opinion myself , judging from your stupid , repulsive and quite inexplicable actions , and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister
1	he asked in alarm
1	versilov shouted to me
1	however , this happened to me only once
1	count ilya andreich rostov , hurried , preoccupied , paced in his soft boots from dining room to drawing room , greeting in a hasty and perfectly identical manner both important and unimportant persons , all of whom he knew , and , occasionally seeking out his trim , dashing son with his eyes , joyfully rested his gaze on him and winked to him
1	put him straight on the sofa , with his head this way , raskolnikov showed him
1	he was silent for a moment
1	this supposition is the more natural and necessary in that , as we follow the development of historical science , we see that the view of what the good of mankind is changes with each new year , with each new writer ; so that in ten years what seemed good looks like evil , and vice versa
1	they will sneak up on the garden
1	he gave his word
1	if kutuzov decided to stay in krems , the one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-man army of napoleon would cut him off from all communications , surround his exhausted forty-thousand-man army , and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm
1	only life 's adversities can show us its vanity and contribute to our innate love of death , or rebirth into a new life
1	he rode into that space in which the most men fleeing from pratz had been killed
1	her husband 's deaf and stupid , yakov went on , not listening to crutch , a fool of fools , the same as a goose
1	so you are renouncing the world forever ?
1	you see , once again : well , let it be only a dream !
1	it 's past one o'clock
1	breathless with fear , he expected the old man to look behind the screen at any moment
1	and yet they say he 's dishonest and profits from it
1	his excellency ivan afanasyvitch , do you know him ?
1	the empress maria feodorovna , concerned with the welfare of the almshouses and orphanages in her charge , made arrangements to move all the institutions to kazan , and the belongings of these establishments had already been packed
1	this little girl was later mme de sévigné
1	i have only come to find out once for all whether it 's a fact that you are mad ?
1	and boils with rage : katerina 's father appears to him
1	what papers do you mean ?
1	varvara ardalionovna , who must accompany you without fail , knows the place very well
1	he even began to say how dare you , do you realize who is before you ?
1	that ’ s clear from the fact that she invited him to come every day from one till two , and the man drags himself there every day , and she ’ s still not sick of him , mrs epanchin concluded , adding that through the old woman the prince was now received in two or three good houses
1	yes they live there , through that door ?
1	he is a rogue and no mistake
1	zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner
1	aglaya , allow me to kiss your prince !
1	but the wine was gone , the bottle was empty
1	there was probably no one in the park now ; it was certainly at least half-past eleven

1	and you ’ re a fine one , too , papa dear !
1	this is that basis owing to which it is obvious that the drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than a man standing on dry land ; that basis owing to which the actions of a man living in close connection with other people in a densely populated area , the actions of a man who is connected with family , work , enterprises , appear unquestionably less free and more subject to necessity than the actions of man who is single and solitary
1	she was some miraculous blend of our northern beauty with mediterranean beauty , a diamond that rarely occurs in the world
1	instead , the casual collaborator on the firebrand came closer still and , it seemed , was intending to sit down somewhere nearby
1	felton held the weapon out to milady , who tested its temper attentively and tried the point on the tip of her finger
1	he had managed to make himself absolutely necessary in certain quarters , his own department among others

1	how could i go to sleep again with nothing done ?
1	the usefulness may , in one case , consist in a moral ; in another , in some practical advice ; in a third , in a proverb or maxim
1	the gentlemen feel it and even printed something about me in a magazine
1	amarmeladov , once already you have deceived my expectations i will take you once more on my own responsibility'—that 's what he said , aremember , he said , 'and now you can go

1	the man , moreover , was very unpleasant , evidently depraved , undoubtedly cunning and deceitful , possibly malignant
1	it was in the name of the comte de wardes
1	oh , lord , what 's with him and his little moments !
1	before , too , he had always seemed surprised at my coming
1	the count was at the other end of the room ; the countess , sonya , and she stood alone , as if in a forest , in this crowd of strangers , of no interest or need to anyone
1	and in some of her gestures , this childishness seemed almost absurd
1	consider for yourself : fedosei petrovich has eight girls , and only one little son
1	lord , what drivel i ’ m spouting !
1	and here i , her own father , here i took thirty copecks of that money for a drink !
1	all these twenty years , your mother and i have lived in complete silence , he began his palaver ( affected and unnatural in the highest degree ) , and all that has been between us has taken place in silence
1	she ran to the window and opened it
1	with slow faltering steps , with shaking knees , raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret , feeling chilled all over
1	he thought , listening to her timid account
1	the prince fell silent
1	now the door opens without a creak
1	the whole world knows that you are a learned man
1	you know , it 's very likely i will be offered a post as assistant professor of general pathology
1	prince , nastasya filippovna suddenly addressed him sharply and unexpectedly , these old friends of mine , the general and afanasy ivanovich , keep wanting to get me married
1	the general , who hates barclay , goes to his friend , the commander of a corps , spends the whole day with him , returns to barclay , and condemns point by point the future battlefield , which he has not seen
1	it smelled of gaslights and soldiers
1	he had already given a sweet time to two wives and was looking for a third , and so he cast an eye on her : quiet , he thought , grew up in poverty , and i am marrying for my orphans
1	it 's no joke , yesterday they gave the first-year students a fable to learn by heart , and a latin translation , and a problem
1	aksinya , her hair curled , with no dress on , in a corset and creaking new boots , rushed about the yard like a whirlwind , and only her bare knees and breast kept flashing
1	i need time to cut through your bars
1	i was lying at the time well , what of it !
1	god bless you , the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice
1	stand off , mikolka screamed frantically ; he threw down the shaft , stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar
1	would you love me , then , if you were not one yourself , madame , tell me , would you love me then ?
1	vous êtes de fiers ennemis , tout de même
1	there 's where the juice is !
1	at last he opened it ; it was a thick heavy letter , weighing over two ounces , two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting
1	he did not sit down , nor did he invite me to sit down
1	tanya , dear tanya , you are an extremely sympathetic being
1	for the first moment he thought he was going mad
1	and everything seemed so nice to me , everything was so easy
1	the young dostoevsky , in his first novel , poor folk , challenged gogol 's unfeeling treatment of his petty clerk
1	do not accuse me of slavophilism ; i am saying it just so , from misanthropy , because my heart feels heavy !
1	she added , lowering her long eyelashes
1	no matter what you say , i ca not , i said with an air of unshakable resolution
1	but all the same , as i was leaving the court , i made an arrangement with a lawyer , gave him an advance
1	[ ] he said gaily , smiling and looking around him
1	the steward , a very stupid but cunning man , understood the intelligent but naïve count perfectly and played with him as with a toy
1	what 's he doing , getting married ?
1	that must be mikhail fyodorovich
1	he said that , on the contrary , a young and beautiful woman always produces an impression of indignation and wrath in a young man your age anna andreevna suddenly laughed
1	as a matter of fact , our conversation yesterday began on the occasion of this … strange article in the archive
1	you are a strange man and i have listened to you from simple curiosity
1	even now our nobility , having lost its rights , could remain a higher estate as the guardian of honor , light , science , and the higher idea , and , above all , without shutting itself up in a separate caste , which would be the death of the idea
1	cried the police chief , casting one of those looks at ivan ivanovich that a giant casts at a pigmy or a learned pedant at a dancing master
1	after that andrei yefimych began to notice a certain mysteriousness around him
1	i asked you to go , i believe , he turned to the staff officer on duty
1	but what are these people of god ?
1	versilov did not see him off
1	and the things he said yesterday !
1	coming up to the fire and hearing platon 's weak , sickly voice and seeing his pitiful face brightly lit by the fire , pierre felt something stab his heart unpleasantly
1	the cardinal had leaflets thrown over in which he pointed out to the rochelois how unjust , egotistical , and barbaric the conduct of their leaders was
1	the blow would certainly have landed on her face
1	he knew very well that nothing but confusion would come of this battle begun against his will , and , as far was in his power , tried to hold back the troops
1	poorly mounted as the two friends were , they soon got ahead of their valets and arrived at crèvecoeur
1	you do not understand at all , not at all , she said
1	she , too , flushed , and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes
1	but his secret is not hard to guess
1	but i ca not drop her like that !
1	grease our boots and bring the horses from the hôtel
1	you do not think so ?
1	and if we start judging and reasoning about everything , then there will be nothing sacred left
1	well , that was a bad sign raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room , still pondering
1	how she sings today !
1	a piece of meat
1	he 's an honest and very precise german
1	but i forgot myself
1	very well , that 's enough for today
1	m d'artagnan is a young man of barely nineteen or twenty , and monsieur is at least thirty
1	no , it 's not a dream
1	stay , he roared , as raskolnikov was about to move
1	she was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible german
1	then why did he write ?
1	the way you put it is especially intelligent
1	then they crossed the ravine to semyonovskoe , where soldiers were pulling down the last logs of the cottages and barns
1	come in , gentlemen , come in , cried d'artagnan
1	then that same night , as you heard , judas kissed jesus and betrayed him to the executioners
1	but but what if it was impossible to avoid ?
1	she sank back on her haunches , but lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force , tugged first on one side and then on the other , trying to move the cart
1	again they were both silent
1	return with confidence to your dwellings : you will soon find ways to satisfy your needs !
1	he was sullen and distracted
1	russia is present in the novel not as a place but as a question — the essence of russia , the role of russia and the russian christ in europe and in the world
1	but if it was your chest , you should have gone to ecke , not to schulz
1	i mean that you are a slanderer , that 's what my words mean !
1	zossimov is a first‐rate fellow !
1	he stopped at shops , bought a newspaper , called at his tailor 's and ordered some clothes
1	but her excitement did not flag , and every moment her irritation grew more intense
1	je suis votre faithful slave , et à vous seule je puis l'avouer
1	it 's in your stomach , uncle !
1	well , yes , yes , you ’ ve really got me worried , the prince interrupted him absentmindedly and with displeasure
1	and are any of them young ?
1	close to the guardhouse , he could see the black outlines of the cossacks ' lean-tos and the horses tethered together
1	we are two brothers , he began , i am ivan ivanych , and he 's nikolai ivanych , some two years younger
1	there wasn ’ t any love here
1	you are my friend today , tomorrow you will be no more than a shade for me ; or , rather , you wo not exist at all
1	show him in , i order
1	it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it
1	yes , a commensurate vehicle !
1	but as soon as one is ill , as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is broken , one begins to realise the possibility of another world ; and the more seriously ill one is , the closer becomes one 's contact with that other world , so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that world
1	i could not talk to her otherwise than on a certain subject , and i was afraid to distract myself from the goals i had set myself by some new and unexpected impression
1	he took the purse , too
1	but all the same i stand up for the ass : an ass is a kind and useful fellow
1	generally , i conducted things too hotly this morning and yesterday
1	he paused and hung his head as if in perplexity
1	the workman shouted , going out to him
1	only konev , vassily vassilyich , rescued me
1	he pondered at times in gloomy rapture
1	however , the bars on the windows and the bolts on the outside of the door decided the case in favor of a prison
1	do you know m de tréville , their captain ?
1	hm he said pensively and as if figuring something out for himself , meaning that it happened precisely an hour before a certain other talk
1	of the four young visitors , however , one was about thirty years old , the retired lieutenant from rogozhin ’ s band , a boxer , who himself used to give fifteen roubles to petitioners
1	i come in and think : they consider me an idiot , but i ’ m intelligent all the same , and they don ’ t even suspect it … ’ i often have that thought
1	but some day i will stop
1	he felt that he was asleep and heard his own snoring
1	they were small factories , and in all employed about four hundred workers , not more
1	versilov , naturally , did not believe then , on first decree of fate
1	the general spoke with aplomb and even drew the words out slightly
1	did no one else wake me up except you ?
1	abandoning that soldier , who was obviously drunk , rostov stopped the horse of an orderly or groom of some important person and began questioning him
1	listen , you are a man of culture and education ?
1	no , my child , no one will touch even one hair on your head
1	his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face
1	she was not such an old woman , about forty-five or -six , no more
1	it also worried him that in the last three days the old man had even stopped drinking entirely
1	ukrainian tales having said that , he was already annoyed with himself for it
1	that is all very praiseworthy , but , forgive me , what ever happened to the friend who told you all those horrors … his punishment was changed , which means he was granted that infinite life
1	but i wo not let anyone here even lay a finger on you !
1	julie became offended and said that it was all true , that a woman needed diversity , that one and the same thing all the time would bore anyone
1	can he really be saved ?
1	it even seemed sad when , after all the previous noise , the old voices were heard singly , one saying , i agree , and another , for the sake of variety , and i am of the same opinion , and so on
1	worse than her master !
1	she mended a shirt for you , too
1	would you believe it , she talks of the silliest trifles and—man is a strange creature—it makes me angry
1	akaky akakievich was about to shout help !
1	in the further wall there was a closed door , beyond it there were no doubt other rooms
1	i was even beginning to find it all amusing
1	pyotr petrovitch waved her off
1	your old method again
1	once , when in the dark room , by the light of the icon lamp , fedosyushka was telling about her life , the thought that fedosyushka alone had found the right way of life suddenly came to princess marya with such force that she herself decided to go wandering
1	but to die was also frightening
1	i would never have believed it , but this feeling is stronger than i am
1	and so the return to la rochelle was profoundly sad
1	he lay facing the back of the sofa and languished while his friend amused him with conversation , or rested while his friend was absent
1	to translate the scullery verb vyskoblit ' ( to scrape out ) as eradicate or expunge , as has been done , to exchange the collar of lard the narrator bestows on the wretched clerk in part two for one that is merely greasy , is to chasten and thus distort the voice of this man who is nothing but a voice
1	i do not understand landscapes and operas , but i think like this : if some intelligent people devote their entire lives to them , and other intelligent people pay enormous amounts of money for them , then it means they are needed
1	it seemed to them that what they had lived through and felt could not be expressed in words
1	open , you stupid , wake up !
1	but shestov means something very different
1	[ ] and napoleon quickly went to the door
1	we must value the ideal !
1	he never blessed his children , but , offering her his bristly , as yet unshaven cheek and giving her a stern and at the same time attentively tender look , merely said :
1	that may be the only chance i will get to see the sovereign
1	what do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me ?
1	getting back to my ring , then , or rather to yours : you will take half of the amount we get for it , or i will throw it into the seine , and i doubt whether , as with polycrates , any fish will be so obliging as to return it to us
1	the gentry rode together
1	you wo not make it , i will carry you
1	he asked , suddenly raising his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair
1	he went in and asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room
1	that 's impossible , said prince andrei , as if the matter had long been decided
1	greetings to you , master philosopher !
1	and only when he understood the tastes and strivings of the muzhik , learned to speak his language and understand the hidden meaning of his speech , when he felt akin to him , only then did he begin boldly to manage him , that is , to fulfill in relation to the muzhiks that very duty the fulfillment of which was demanded of him
1	and the two friends began telling each other—the one about his hussar carousing and life at the front , the other about the pleasures and advantages of serving under the command of highly placed persons , and so on
1	stay , he roared , as raskolnikov was about to move
1	and to be called a fool yourself for putting up with the lie ; to endure insults , humiliations , not daring to say openly that you are on the side of honest , free people , and to have to lie yourself , to smile , and all that for a crust of bread , a warm corner , some little rank that 's not worth a penny—no , it 's impossible to live like that any longer !
1	before the fire the black figures of people flitted ; talking and shouting could be heard through the ceaseless crackling of the flames
1	but , once again , where is this gentleman ?
1	i hate and despise , i feel indignant , outraged , afraid
1	he quickly ran up the stairs , knocked at the door : the door opened , and who should come out to meet him ?
1	ordinarily , and even almost always , he was incomparably more fresh and hearty
1	that it was indeed beauty and prayer , that it was indeed the highest synthesis of life , he could not doubt , nor could he admit of any doubts
1	petro gave a start
1	now i have it all worked out and was waiting for you , to ask you all about life abroad
1	some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men , but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will
1	and do you remember , prince , who it was who announced that there will be no more time ’ ?
1	i believe i understood that you have suffered at the hands of the cardinal , milady went on
1	she said unexpectedly , seriously now , suddenly remembering her question earlier
1	the humble hegumen pafnuty here sets his hand to it
1	the countess shook her head disapprovingly and crossly at each solemn phrase of the manifesto
1	( ) the said supplies will be purchased from them for the price agreed upon between the buyer and the seller ; but if the seller does not obtain the fair price he demands , he is free to take them back to his village , and no one can prevent him by any means from doing so
1	and she 's such a grande dame , such a sweet lady , and she clearly loves me with all her heart , thought natasha
1	i ca not help agreeing with you , but
1	i came in with the same stern look on my face , and the old man , instantly noticing it , gave a start , and the smile on his face quickly gave way to decided alarm
1	why have not you done so ?
1	suddenly a pretty little pocketbook dropped from her hand and fell on the ground ; she got in ; the valet bent down to pick up the little thing , but i ran over quickly , picked it up , and handed it to the lady , tipping my hat
1	why are you so pale ?
1	i would be sorry to leave the regiment
1	in the end he coughed up blood
1	'sit there a bit , he said
1	and at the moment when prince andrei ( not with that peevish expression and manner he assumed in drawing rooms , but with the same animated face he had when he talked with pierre ) came to his father 's , the old man was sitting in his dressing room , on a wide morocco-upholstered armchair , in a powdering mantle , entrusting his head to tikhon 's hands
1	pierre looked at him in surprise , unable to grasp what he wanted
1	she scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat , but wo not allow herself to be treated with disrespect
1	nous prenons fait et cause pour eux
1	washing hastily and dressing humbly in the poorest of her dresses and an old mantilla , shivering in the fresh air , natasha would go out into the deserted streets , transparently lit up by the glow of dawn
1	me , whom everybody loves so ?
1	long after she had undressed
1	no , listen , she said , you are quite a man now
1	by heaven , said d'artagnan , you are well named , gentlemen , and my adventure , if it causes some stir , will prove at least that your union is not based on contrasts
1	velchaninov glanced at him with scorn and again started pacing the room
1	meanwhile , the uhlan was jostled in the crush by a little merchant , also on a spree , and even outrageously so
1	no , i am asking you
1	and still more terrible for princess marya was the fact that , since the time of her father 's illness ( if not even earlier , when , expecting something , she had stayed with him ) , all her personal desires and hopes , forgotten and dormant in her , had reawakened
1	may i be so bold as to ask your excellency to move over a little for this gentleman ?
1	nastasya filippovna occupied a not very large but indeed magnificently decorated apartment
1	the teacher ’ s widow urged him to come in and sit down , which the prince did
1	he added suddenly , looking at her
1	sonya came into the drawing room with an alarmed face
1	well , then prince andrei answers himself , i do not know what will happen then , i do not want to know and i ca not know ; but if i want this , want glory , want to be known to people , want to be loved by them , it 's not my fault that i want it , that it 's the only thing i want , the only thing i live for
1	the merest peasant hires himself out to work – yet his bondage is not total ; besides , he knows there 's a term to it

1	le duc ! —and the well-fed convoy had no sooner passed than a carriage rumbled by , drawn by gray horses in tandem
1	i left t— at the beginning of september , on the twelfth of september ; i remember it well
1	surely i must also have told you then about the document ?
1	in his ignorance of the matter , he exaggerated it , as happens to many , and therefore began to consider it his right to be unceremonious in the highest degree
1	the general , the colonel , and even the major had their uniforms completely unbuttoned , so that their noble silk suspenders showed slightly , while the gentlemen officers , observing due respect , remained buttoned up except for the bottom three buttons
1	human reason asks , what was the cause of this movement , or according to what laws did it occur ?
1	she glanced haughtily at the prince
1	you heard , no doubt , avdotya romanovna , when you were with them the story of the servant philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago , before the abolition of serfdom
1	i , for instance , simply ca not live without spare cash

1	it contained half a line , in a very british hand and of a very spartan brevity : thank you , be easy
1	individual goodness will always abide , because it is a personal need , a living need for the direct influence of one person on another
1	there was , however , not a word in it about marriage , but generals , colonels , and even court dignitaries kept flitting through the story , with zverkov among them and all but at their head
1	most ungainly , said the colonel , absolutely nothing good about it
1	yes , indeed , sir , he is of more weight than i am
1	olga ivanovna worriedly anticipated blood poisoning and prayed to god at night , but nothing bad happened
1	what did i know ?
1	and you know , lambert , she loves him !
1	who has forbidden you ?
1	he turned everything over to the last threads and rags , and mistrusting himself , went through his search three times
1	now i know you personally , i am convinced of it
1	as soon as he had said this again , the same familiar sensation froze his heart
1	in his memoir chekhov with us , written not long after chekhov 's death in , kornei chukovsky called this now-famous letter a gauntlet flung in the face of an

1	i fancy i shall have to see him more than once again , he said to dounia

1	the mason looked at pierre attentively and smiled , as a rich man , holding millions in his hands , would smile at a poor man who has said to him that he , the poor man , did not have the five roubles that would make his happiness

1	four of them took him away , i do not know where , to the bastille or the fort-l'évêque ; two stayed with the men in black , who ransacked the place and took all the papers
1	more now , more now !
1	what did svidrigaïlov say to you ?
1	she did not say anything , but glanced around anxiously , as if looking for something
1	nothing about himself nothing !
1	evidently , great names are created so as to live by themselves , apart from their bearers
1	you ca not set out so late on such a long journey !
1	where to get the other forty roubles ?
1	and d'artagnan clinked the rest of the pistoles in his pocket
1	i will leave here tomorrow , get hired as a telegraph girl
1	dounia smiled and held out her hand , but the look of anxiety did not leave her face
1	razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down the stairs
1	the angry assistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted
1	listen , rodion romanovitch , my dear fellow
1	allow me to ask what are you alluding to , began the clerk , that is to say , whose about whom did you say just now but i do not care !
1	and you must have spent quite a bit of it by now
1	that is a question for jurisprudence
1	the philosopher became frightened , especially when he noticed that her eyes flashed with some extraordinary light

1	the prince noticed that aglaya suddenly left her place and came over to the table
1	second line have you written that ?
1	i ’ d throw out all those people from yesterday and keep him , that ’ s what kind of man he is ! …
1	you see , alexei ivanovich , it 's only a week that i
1	the three musketeers he 's considering by what sort of execution he will have me die , d'artagnan said to himself
1	he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes , but this was not easy
1	that morning natasha had told him that she had refused bolkonsky
1	' i found them on the pavement
1	well , on my word of honor , that ’ s just what i do think about , especially as i ’ m falling asleep , laughed the prince , only it ’ s not napoleon i crush but the austrians
1	mama , she whispered to her , not pausing for a second
1	if man has not become more bloodthirsty from civilization , at any rate he has certainly become bloodthirsty in a worse , a viler way than formerly
1	and perhaps she really did not have a kopeck
1	since you have taken such a step , you must harden your heart
1	do not question him too much about anything if you see him frown ; do not ask him too much about his health ; he does not like that
1	god , how beautiful my birthplace is !
1	i must admit , he went on calmly , that such cases certainly must arise
1	i trust our acquaintance , he said , addressing raskolnikov , may , upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware , become closer
1	he felt , so to speak , renewed ; again the struggle , so a means of escape had come
1	god keep your majesty till then !
1	it will be useless
1	and the germans were the first he attacked
1	it 's a sin to say it , and god punishes that sort of talk
1	of course you do
1	however , i am sure you again think i am laughing
1	and do not forget , dear heart , to tell the master that i know there are good fish to be had on his farmstead , especially sturgeon , which he can send whenever there 's a chance : at the markets here it 's expensive and no good
1	it was the most boring time of the day
1	it 's not a province , your excellency , but a district
1	do you hear , do you hear ?
1	he did not hear what varenka said , nor did he see anything
1	they are at their country house now
1	cried buckingham , pouring all his thought and all his love into the question
1	bagration stopped and , without replying , tried to make out rostov 's face in the mist
1	cried the chairman himself , the general , in an all but offended voice
1	is it true that moscou is called moscou la sainte ?
1	but how could she not know ?
1	for my part , my much-esteemed prince , though i used to be honored by your trustfulness towards me in a certain point , which is known to you , sir , but only to a certain degree , and by no means further than the circumstances that essentially concern that same point … i realize it and am not complaining in the least
1	eh bien , qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
1	i beg you , i implore you on my knees : let me die , and my last sigh will be a blessing on my savior
1	again the sleigh is driving , again vanka laughs , and foolish akulka has opened her coat and shows her legs : look , good people , my boots are not like vanka 's , they are new
1	it ’ s as if you ’ ve appropriated me , the way you keep me under lock and key , the prince protested
1	he added suddenly , looking at her
1	an involuntary chill ran down his spine
1	what did he do there ?
1	and once i was at home , strong , cheerful , loved
1	i do not know why they wo not come , ivan ivanovich said , as if not listening to ivan nikiforovich
1	i am bringing you , and that 's enough
1	the three musketeers so you insist on pursuing this thesis ?
1	as the bishop was getting into his carriage to go home , the whole moonlit garden was filled with the merry , beautiful ringing of the expensive , heavy bells
1	how could the officers lead their troops to a battlefield they considered impossible ?
1	he asks you to come at once on very important business
1	but there was something very strange in him ; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intelligence , but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness
1	it was impossible to make out the words , only the voices could be heard : two tenors and a bass
1	oh , let me look like a paltry little brat to her , who spied on her and plotted a conspiracy , but let her recognize that i conquered myself and placed her happiness higher than anything in the world !
1	she took the uncle 's guitar and at once found the chords for the song
1	sire , i beg you
1	returning home at seven o'clock , he did not find pavel pavlovich there , which first caused him great surprise , then wrath , and then even despondency ; finally , he began to be afraid
1	in short , i hid , and barely had time to jump there as they came in
1	do you at least know how to load a pistol ?
1	but i looked upon you as the sun , liza , and how could anything have occurred to me ?
1	time passes quickly when it comes to attack and defense
1	i only have ten days , and as of tonight two will have gone by
1	cried sonia weakly , and she stood rooted to the spot
1	i will go and deliver the letter to the sovereign myself : so much the worse for drubetskoy , who drove me to it
1	so it means that nastasya filippovna invited you to her place straight off ?
1	he quietly opened the door and saw natasha in her violet dress , which she had worn to church , strolling about the room and singing
1	can he really be saved ?
1	looking at things as he did , he took the news of his being sent to voronezh to remount the division not only with no regret at not taking part in the coming fight , but with the greatest satisfaction , which he did not conceal , and which his comrades understood perfectly well
1	i ’ ll have to see what it is and consult with someone
1	he had married young , while still a second-year student , and now his wife seemed half again his age
1	at the table were his mother , the old mrs below who lived with her , his wife , his three children , the governess , the tutor , his nephew with his tutor , sonya , denisov , natasha , her three children , their governess , and old mikhail ivanych , the prince 's architect , who was living in retirement at bald hills
1	he pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle
1	i remember nikolenka , too , i do , she said
1	a bloody razor lay on the floor
1	outside it was clear , fresh , dewy , and cheerful
1	it 's merely the accepted thing to say it 's boring here
1	i am surprised that mama could say it to me
1	vi : his majesty king louis the thirteenth at once , if you please
1	let 's strip and get naked !
1	i told them everything , i didn ’ t hide anything from them
1	i am never going to drink
1	listen , do you like music ?
1	but i was not put out , i did not even stir , and again in the same calm voice declared to her directly that from then on i was depriving her of her participation in my concerns
1	the three musketeers yes , lovely lady !
1	i also saw him in the theater once , in the third circle , now wearing aiguillettes
1	excuse me , excuse me , gentlemen , but again you haven ’ t understood me !
1	but i can go and warn m de la porte , said d'artagnan
1	unquestionably , i am counting most of all on your influence , arkady makarovich ; you love him so much and who else loves him except you and i ?
1	but why did not you tell me , dronushka ?
1	nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him
1	if you can imagine it , i , too , had an appointment at the green bench today
1	why do not you stay home , anisim , the old man said , you would be priceless in the business !
1	milord , cried the queen , you forget that i have never told you i loved you
1	louis xiv was a very proud and presumptuous man ; he had such-and-such mistresses and such-and-such ministers , and he ruled france badly
1	my comrades will also laugh at me do not you want to take them , maybe you will eat them ?
1	something groaned deeply , the groaning went across the field into the forest
1	he could turn directly to the chief clerk with his story , necessarily taking him as an acquaintance and even a close one , and pseldonymov meanwhile could simply keep silent and tremble with awe
1	at last i was left alone in my study
1	the guests talked , moved chairs
1	prince andrei felt sad and downhearted
1	later he also dropped that and went abroad again , this time for a long period , for several years
1	how thin you are !
1	the very word 'trial '
1	you are forgetting that beautiful handkerchief embroidered with a coat of arms
1	to be sure , i myself have just made up all these words of yours
1	he shouted from the window
1	while kutuzov , a man who , from the beginning to the end of his activity in , from borodino to vilno , while always being true to himself in all his acts and words , shows an example uncommon in history of self-denial and awareness in the present of the future significance of the event—kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pathetic , and when they speak of kutuzov and the year twelve , it is as if they are always slightly embarrassed
1	you would better say straight out what you want !
1	the staff captain repeated , as if beginning to call him by his title on account of his acknowledgment
1	and i do not blame her for it , no , i do not blame her !
1	the innkeeper came down from the upper room , apparently on purpose to listen to the funny fellow and sat down at a little distance , yawning lazily , but with dignity
1	the young officer was very tipsy , and the lady , in all probability an older relative , would not let him go , surely for fear he would rush straight to the buffet for a drink
1	what do you mean , imbecile ?
1	what are you thinking ?
1	they were all looking at him in perplexity
1	as the wheels of the carriage rumbled softly over the straw spread under the windows , anna mikhailovna , turning to her companion with words of comfort , discovered that he was asleep in the corner of the carriage , and woke him up
1	this bothered the doctor and interfered with his thinking and concentration
1	she said , to change the subject , studying his hand , on which there was a signet ring with the head of laocoön
1	yes , rooms a disgusting place—filthy , stinking and , what 's more , of doubtful character
1	raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor
1	i ca not offer you coffee here ; but why not spend five minutes with a friend ?
1	between each kind of troops was a sort of street
1	and how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit—eleven roubles , fifty copecks , i ca not guess
1	in the hall there was a group of generals in gold-embroidered uniforms
1	but why the devil did not anybody wake me up ?
1	even with tatyana pavlovna there are certain things i keep silent about
1	you , uncle , spread a greatcoat under him , he turned to his favorite soldier
1	i was not able to intercede for her , but only felt a longing , when i saw her sadness , to draw her to me and pity her in the tone of an old nanny : my dear little orphan !
1	if we give her time to catch her breath , she will have me killed by the lackeys
1	just then the watchmen in the yard began striking two : derr
1	and their job is on the same staircase as the murder , on the second floor
1	oh , all right , thank god , i live well
1	we had already reached the front door , and i was still walking behind him
1	had tea with him i doan like him !
1	c'est un fou , un malheureux qui ne savait pas ce qu'il faisait
1	the two armchairs there … what ’ s the matter with them , don ’ t they want to ?
1	she shouted at her brother , ran to a chair , fell on it , and burst into such sobbing that she could not stop for a long time
1	maman was ill for the whole day ; and the next day alexandra and papa told me i didn ’ t understand what i was babbling myself and what kind of words i ’ d spoken
1	that was the question
1	mme bonacieux went on , seeing that she was regaining some influence over her husband
1	but he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture , too , she added with dignity
1	it seems to me that it 's nothing of the sort
1	velchaninov spat and again began pacing the room , still quicker than before
1	she woke up , listened to what was happening behind the door , and , hearing his groaning , said to herself with a sigh that everything was still the same
1	dessales wrote a letter to the governor for princess marya , she signed it , and this letter was given to alpatych with orders to deliver it to the governor and , in case of danger , to return as soon as possible
1	and how did the thing come about , eh ?
1	lord , who ’ d have thought it ?
1	at least many people have explained their impression that way , and there are many whom the sight of a man in a falling fit fills with a decided and unbearable terror , which even has something mystical in it
1	the old countess sat with a happily sad smile and tears in her eyes , shaking her head from time to time
1	that smile pyotr petrovitch noticed , and at once set it down against his young friend 's account
1	the gist of it was that he made me a proposition to acquaint him with mr dergachev , since you do go there !
1	falling in with the line of carriages , its wheels squeaking slowly over the snow , the rostovs ' carriage drove up to the theater
1	it seemed quite a singular thing to me , a princess living on the rue aux ours
1	the witnesses must have come back
1	i myself arranged for my own ruin , she thought
1	ah , cried anne d'autriche , leave off these vague attacks , sire
1	i ca not forget that
1	the sun had just gone down and the warmth of the day was still in the air
1	do not be uneasy , rodion romanovitch , if i were working for my own advantage , i would not have spoken out so directly
1	or when he calls out his last words to his mother : dear mother , save your poor son !
1	in the first place i decided to be polite and candid with everybody ; no one can ask more of me
1	the beggar hesitated for a moment , but on seeing the silver piece shining in the darkness , he made up his mind and went ahead of athos
1	it may be a coarse satisfaction , but still a satisfaction
1	who would have dreamed of his going out , indeed ?
1	with him were the chief of the imperial staff , the quartermaster general prince volkonsky , generals , imperial adjutants , diplomatic officials , and a large number of foreigners , but there was no army staff
1	wait for it ; no one is going to intercede for you
1	luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm
1	but the deacon 's real apprehensions were of another sort : he feared still more that his better half might find out , who even without that had turned his thick braid into a very thin one with her terrible hand
1	what are they about ?
1	glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop , he saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven
1	she had long been wishing to get married
1	one after another , and sometimes two together , pressed up against the high backs of the chairs by the pushing crowd behind , the orators spoke
1	craftsmen and labor-loving artisans !
1	seeing his father 's insistent demand , prince andrei , reluctantly at first , but then with more and more animation , and inadvertently switching from russian to french , out of habit , in the middle of his discourse , began to explain the plan of operations for the proposed campaign
1	they sat side by side , both mournful and dejected , as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore
1	as if on purpose , the nag crawled on for an unnaturally long time , though i had promised a whole rouble
1	i only wanted to say how constantly i have been afraid for you here almost all this time
1	zherkov touched his horse with his spurs ; it shifted its footing three times excitedly , not knowing which leg to start with , worked it out , and galloped off , going ahead of the company and catching up with the coach , also in time with the song
1	in that sense i take after andrei petrovich
1	suddenly on the lower floor , under the balcony , a violin started playing and two tender women 's voices began to sing
1	and there 's no one to ask , he said softly and seriously
1	though very often you are somehow strange , yet you sometimes became so animated that you were always able to say an apt word , and you were interested in precisely what interested me
1	oksana had not yet turned seventeen , but already in almost all the world , on this side of dikanka and on the other , the talk was of nothing but her
1	before going to bed , she had already commented upon , analyzed , turned over on all sides , examined from every angle the words , steps , gestures , signs , and even the silence of her jailers , and from this profound , skillful , and learned study it resulted that felton was , all things considered , the more vulnerable of her two persecutors
1	the old man became insecure , began noticing something in everyone 's eyes
1	uncle pierre you no if papa were alive he would agree with you ?
1	on reaching the seminary , the whole crowd settled by classes in low-ceilinged but rather spacious rooms with small windows , wide doors , and dirty desks
1	so it is , stepan varlamovich !
1	he went over to prince vassily
1	but anyhow , god willing , all will be well , she concluded each time
1	kuzka 's hat had disappeared
1	evidently this was the watchman banging out eleven o'clock
1	i remember them holding a special council for several days ; davout used to come in the morning and in the evening , and often they even argued ; in the end , it seemed that napoleon began to agree
1	i followed him inside ; everything there seemed as before , but i noticed a strange disorder in it all , some tangible absence of something or other ; in short , i sensed in myself those strange feelings that come over us when for the first time we enter the dwelling of a widower whom we had known before inseparable from his lifelong companion
1	i sneeze on your head , ivan ivanovich !
1	sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket , untied a corner of it , took out the ten‐rouble note and gave it to luzhin
1	all through the journey , he experienced the joy of a schoolboy on vacation
1	supposing that the failure of the petersburg plan for the berezina would be attributed to him , they expressed their dissatisfaction with him , their contempt for him and mockery of him more and more strongly
1	but again you will ask a question : why did i not save her from evildoing ?
1	mr jackson , he said to him , you will go at once to the lord chancellor and tell him that i entrust him with the carrying out of these orders
1	i will get in !
1	yes , look , he 's for certain what is this ?
1	it 's curious , tatyana pavlovna , ever since childhood i have loved nuts , you know , the simplest kinds
1	anna andreevna 's escapade seemed to me too resolute , even cynical : despite my refusal to assist her , she , as if not believing me a whit , was sending me straight to lambert
1	so , sonya , here you were saying all kinds of stupid things about him , natasha began in a meek voice , the sort of voice in which children speak when they want to be praised
1	the squadron commander , captain denisov , known to the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov , was assigned the best quarters in the village
1	man needs , not six feet of earth , not a country place , but the whole earth , the whole of nature , where he can express at liberty all the properties and particularities of his free spirit
1	hesitation over which plan of all those proposed was to be accepted increased still more after the emperor 's one-month stay at headquarters
1	and what am i to have so much ambition ?
1	sonia said this as though in despair , wringing her hands in excitement and distress
1	here , of course , he was also speaking of our university men
1	tomorrow maybe everything will be over for me , all these memories will be no more , all these memories will simply have no more sense for me
1	and on the millennium of russia , he counted seven hundred people
1	are not you ashamed now , sister ?
1	found in any of these external events , not even the break in his career caused by ten years of prison and exile
1	were you kept very busy then by your service to the … emperor ?
1	let it be , natasha
1	he will come in that day and he will ask : 'where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross , consumptive step‐mother and for the little children of another ?
1	she added after a pause
1	they got into the carriage and rode for several minutes in silence
1	at the beginning of the battle , they merely stood on the way to moscow , shielding it , and they went on standing in the same way at the end of the battle as they had at the beginning
1	he was convinced , to his horror , that he was sure to hear ambiguous whispers behind his back , to see ambiguous faces , to reap the most malignant smiles
1	here it is , the decisive moment has come !
1	one , taking off his shako , carefully undid and redid the gathers ; another , crumbling some dry clay between his palms , polished his bayonet ; a third worked the leather and readjusted the buckle of his bandolier ; yet another carefully spread out his footcloth , wound it up again , and put his boot back on
1	everyone has his plans , raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently
1	he was a clerk and had almost always something wrong with his eyes
1	ptitsyn explained , mainly addressing ivan fyodorovich , that the prince ’ s aunt , whom he had never known personally , had died five months ago
1	but what can i tell you ?
1	the cares of moving , worry about her brother , organizing life in a new home , new faces , her nephew 's upbringing—all this stifled in princess marya 's soul that feeling of temptation , as it were , which had tormented her during the illness and after the death of her father , and especially after meeting rostov
1	whether the prince wants it , whether anna andreevna wants it , whether the old prince wants it
1	denis yawns and makes a cross over his mouth
1	i am describing and want to describe others , and not myself , and if i keep turning up all the time , that is a sad mistake , because i simply ca not avoid it , however much i wish to
1	in short , hecuba is nothing to him
1	and he had hardly thought it when , somewhere near , a clock on the wall , ticking away hurriedly , struck three
1	the commander in chief gave a sign for the men to go on marching freely , and his face and all the faces of his suite expressed pleasure at the sounds of the song , at the sight of the dancing soldier and the merrily and briskly marching soldiers
1	here choub rubbed his back and set out in the other direction
1	there 's an obvious misunderstanding here , like it or not
1	how nice it is to look at you today
1	whether it 's very comforting or something—i do not know , sir ; but it must be for the sake of pleasant memories
1	vasin was working temporarily in a joint-stock company , and i knew that he brought work home
1	all at once the creak of a door swinging on its hinges made me start
1	as they were driving up , prince andrei , smiling , drew pierre 's attention to the bustling that was going on by the back porch
1	but that same evening and the next day , reports came in one after another about unheard-of losses , about the loss of half the army , and a new battle turned out to be physically impossible
1	but evidently the french officer was more inclined to the thought that he had been taken prisoner , because pierre 's strong hand , moved by involuntary fear , squeezed his throat more and more tightly
1	natasha said with a happy and frightened face
1	on the march from vyazma to tsarevo-zaimishche , napoleon rode on his bob-tailed light bay ambler , accompanied by his guards , bodyguard , pages , and adjutants
1	how did it happen that the russian army , which , weaker in numbers than the french , gave battle at borodino , how did it happen that this army , surrounding the french on three sides and having the aim of capturing them , failed to do so ?
1	what will she have by the time she gets to petersburg ?
1	who is asking for me ?
1	i held out with fifteen thousand men for more than thirty-five hours and beat them ; but he did not want to stay even fourteen hours
1	in that corner there was a dense crowd of peasants
1	then , i remember , i maintain in my article that all well , legislators and leaders of men , such as lycurgus , solon , mahomet , napoleon , and so on , were all without exception criminals , from the very fact that , making a new law , they transgressed the ancient one , handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people , and they did not stop short at bloodshed either , if that bloodshed—often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law—were of use to their cause
1	but today i decided not to think about it
1	however , i thought to myself then , as i was going to bed , it turns out that he gave his 'nobleman 's word ' to marry mama in case she was left a widow
1	and listen , my dear : i believe god brought you to petersburg from switzerland precisely for me
1	what an ardent man you are , he muttered with some especially nasty smile
1	and to think of who—of what nonentities—can be the cause of people 's unhappiness !
1	olga ivanovna had always called her husband , as she did all the men she knew , not by his first but by his last name
1	it was somehow unnatural that these two eyes had only decided precisely now to begin peering at me
1	but i precisely wanted to ask you whether , as an acquaintance , you might not get me into nastasya filippovna ’ s this evening ?
1	said mistress katerina to the old serving woman who was wiping the wooden bowls
1	well , that makes it opportune that i did not and do not invite you
1	never mind , come on
1	they came to the high priest , he went on , jesus was questioned , and the servants meanwhile made a fire in the courtyard , because it was cold , and they warmed themselves
1	there , beyond this field , and the tree , and the roof lit by the sun ?
1	these were russians : bagration , ermolov , who was at the beginning of his rise , and others
1	everyone was talking , shouting , exclaiming ; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating : what a misfortune !
1	do not touch me , unheard-of sinner , go quickly !
1	according to his observations the patient 's illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months , but it had partly also a moral origin , was , so to speak , the product of several material and moral influences , anxieties , apprehensions , troubles , certain ideas and so on
1	as for the money , you need it to go carousing , right ?
1	after the resolute refusal he had received , petya went to his room and , locking himself in , wept bitterly
1	from all that he writes , you should rejoice and not cry
1	when i got up to lock the door after him , i suddenly remembered the picture i had seen that day at rogozhin ’ s , in one of the gloomiest rooms of his house , above the door
1	they say the sun gives life to the universe
1	just then two women and a man in a white hat appeared on the road from the manor house , walking towards the officers
1	judge how grateful i must be to marfa petrovna for having repeated to avdotya romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me
1	yes , that 's how it would be if any other general walked in , but not i
1	an enormous crowd of factory workers , servants , and muzhiks , mixed with clerks , seminarians , and noblemen , went out to the three hills early in the morning of that day
1	and why do you want to know , why do you want to know so much , since they have not begun to worry you ?
1	will you never kiss me from the heart , as a child , as a son kisses his father ?
1	to him it was all completely the same at that moment who was standing over him or what he said about him ; he was only glad that people had stopped over him and only wished that those people would help him and bring him back to life , which seemed so beautiful to him , because he now understood it so differently
1	but no , it ca not be , he thought
1	what does this mean ?
1	how could it happen that in the course of more than twenty years he had not known and had not wanted to know it ?
1	eight days later , she had seduced the jailer 's son and escaped
1	as if he doesn ’ t know !
1	milady went on , do you still suffer from your wounds ?
1	you see well ach , damn it !
1	here ’ s your wretched little hat , let ’ s go !
1	gloomy , disgruntled , he sat down like a wet rooster on his tattered couch , not knowing himself what to undertake , what to do , and finally recalled the whole of his dream
1	in the house on the left he saw some open windows ; on the window‐sills were pots of sickly‐looking geraniums
1	i must tell you , i once had a cockroach sitting in my left ear
1	but raskolnikov , who had expected something quite different , gazed blankly and dreamily at him , making no reply , as though he heard the name of pyotr petrovitch for the first time
1	he turned very pale
1	the thing was that about a week earlier he had managed to win some twelve thousand in one evening , and he was triumphant
1	please do not think it too familiar here , on the sofa
1	how can i tell whether they have a farthing ?
1	on december , the eve of the new year , for le réveillon , [ ] a ball was given by a grand dignitary of catherine 's time
1	but wanting is very often , and even for the most part , completely and stubbornly at odds with reason , and
1	why is it , or can it be my fancy ?
1	fourth , it was senseless to wish to take prisoner the emperor , the kings , the dukes—people whose capture would have hampered the actions of the russians in the highest degree , as was recognized by the most skillful diplomats of that time ( joseph de maistre and others )
1	so what if it 's broken ?
1	ivan ivanovich went up to the gates and clanked the latch : inside , the barking of dogs arose ; but the motley pack soon ran off wagging their tails , seeing that the face was a familiar one
1	i received a letter from him , she replied
1	why such a profusion of churches ?
1	and all that he said—for instance , that they should wait for provisions , that the men had no boots—all that was so simple , while all that they proposed was so complex and clever , that it was obvious to them that he was old and stupid , and they , though not in authority , were commanders of genius
1	indeed , the reader will notice that in the third paragraph the crystal edifice ceases all at once to represent the ideas of the narrator 's opponents and becomes instead something that he himself has possibly invented as a result of certain old nonrational habits of our generation , something , he says , that exists in my desires , or , better , exists as long as my desires exist
1	don ’ t you believe he ’ s capable now of killing a dozen souls ?
1	that is why the superior is proposing this subject , which has never been treated before , and in which i acknowledge there is material for magnificent development : utraque manus in bene-dicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est
1	surrounded by shouting children , the mummers , covering their faces and altering their voices , bowed before the hostess and took their places in the room
1	about fifteen years ago a gentleman was sent here from russia
1	i will die , waiting a year : it 's impossible , it 's terrible !
1	needles of ice reached over the puddles , and the forest became inhospitable , forsaken , desolate
1	he decided that he would go the next day and leave her a letter in which he would announce his intention to part with her forever
1	when we quarrelled , i usually held my tongue and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its object , it influenced her , it pleased her , indeed
1	you gave us everything yesterday , sonia said suddenly , in reply , in a loud rapid whisper ; and again she looked down in confusion
1	he added that it was perhaps because of anton the wretch that he had come to the estate then—and he added it extremely seriously
1	once he stood still and counted his money ; he found he had thirty copecks
1	you lecture for a quarter , a half hour , and then you notice that the students have started looking up at the ceiling , at pyotr ignatievich , one feels for his handkerchief , another tries to settle more comfortably , a third smiles at his own thoughts
1	she quickly jumped up , but with extraordinary strength i held her back by both hands
1	his life in prison had been very sad , i assure you , but certainly worth more than a kopeck
1	how are you , ivan nikiforovich ?
1	nothing will happen to him , mama , nothing will ever happen to him , and nothing can , he 's that kind of man !
1	i think you are tight , she said , shivering from the night 's dampness
1	well , that 's the whole story
1	that 's all conventional , that 's all relative , merely a way of looking at it , he thought in a flash , but only on the top surface of his mind , while he was shuddering all over , there , i have got it on !
1	he opened the door ; the wind burst in at once and blew out my candle
1	the noise grew louder , the horses could not have been more than a hundred and fifty paces away ; if they still could not be seen , it was because of a bend in the road
1	however , i endeavored to calm her down and assured her in gracious words of my benevolence and that i was not at all angry that she sometimes polished my boots poorly
1	andrei yefimych became embarrassed and kissed the icon , while mikhail averyanych pursed his lips and , nodding his head , prayed in a whisper , tears coming to his eyes again
1	kutuzov fell back towards vienna , destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn ( in braunau ) and traun ( in linz )
1	i will give you the brown sow , the one i fattened in the pen
1	your wife the devil
1	not only were none of them there , but i even had difficulty finding our room
1	'future mover , but i do not understand a thing
1	i was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me
1	he said in the same voice
1	anatole , as shinshin rightly said of him , had driven all the moscow ladies out of their minds ever since his arrival , especially by neglecting them and apparently preferring gypsy women and french actresses , with the foremost of whom , mlle george , he was said to be in intimate relations
1	athos took the letter from d'artagnan 's hands , brought it to the lamp , and set fire to it , and did not let go of it until it was reduced to ashes
1	he also did not appear even once in general epanchin ’ s house , so that the general , too , had to hire another clerk
1	this merchant had been stuck at the station for two days already , drinking and squandering money , surrounded by all sorts of comradery , and kept being late for the train to continue his journey
1	there is a stench of pickled cabbage , charred wicks , bedbugs , and ammonia ,
1	dessales said something about vitebsk
1	varvara ardalionovna spread her arms
1	it 's my mistress you love , you just told me so
1	i know that you can cause me considerable unpleasantness , she said , as if warding off his words , but i have come not so much to persuade you not to persecute me , as to see you yourself
1	in 'society ' there is only 'society ' and nothing more ; katerina nikolaevna ( his daughter ) is a brilliant woman , and i am proud of it , but she often offends me , my dear , very , very often well , and these girls ( elles sont charmantes ) and their mothers , who come on birthdays— they only bring their embroidery , but they do not know how to say anything
1	as he came through the main gate to the street , the wind blew open the cloak he was wrapped in , though it was the month of august , and tore at his hat , which the traveler grasped with his hand just as it was about to leave his head and pulled down sharply over his eyes
1	in her eyes this marriage to makar ivanovich had long been a decided thing , and she found all that happened to her then excellent and the very best ; she went to the altar with the calmest air possible on such an occasion , so that tatyana pavlovna herself called her a fish then
1	what are you thanking me for ?
1	the tears flowed still more abundantly from the countess 's eyes
1	everyone in the house understood the old woman 's condition , though no one ever spoke of it , and everyone made every possible effort to satisfy her needs
1	vasin was extremely polite and amiable , but it was somehow hard for me to see him going to such trouble on my account
1	i ’ ll bring it to you right now …
1	impossible , said milady , you are so valiant a man and so keen a sword
1	i am not beating you !
1	our right flank was disposed on a rather steep elevation , which dominated the positions of the french
1	he felt convinced that svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth
1	here there is no doubt that timidity and a total lack of personal initiative have always been regarded among us as the chiefest and best sign of the practical man—and are so regarded even now
1	the young priest was sentenced to branding and ten years in irons
1	why do not you turn to them , if you need support ?
1	pierre was precisely the husband necessary for this brilliant society woman
1	with a most noble air and even with feeling , he offered her his hand
1	when at the last ball at the marshal 's princess bezzemelny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father and i were married , polenka—she asked at once 'is not that the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking‐up ?
1	i cried in frenzy
1	stebelkov , he went on , sometimes trusts all too much in his practical sense , and because of that rushes to a conclusion in accordance with his logic , which is often quite perspicacious ; yet the event may in fact have a much more fantastic and unexpected coloration , considering the characters involved
1	the servant who opened the door for the prince led him without announcing him and led him a long way ; they passed through one reception hall with faux-marbre walls , an oak parquet floor , and furniture from the twenties , crude and heavy , passed through some tiny rooms , turning and zigzagging , going up two or three steps and then down the same number , and finally knocked at some door
1	why such pride all of a sudden , sir ?
1	just think that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe , and consider that what you are about to do , you are doing for him
1	stand on your feet , the soldier with the sling says softly
1	what was her indignation , her anger , when she learned that they wanted to put on her nuptial bed a man sick with something like cholerine !
1	and you stay a minute
1	yes , a seasoned one , your excellency , replied danilo , hastily doffing his hat
1	luzhin stood still , waiting with a defiant and offended face
1	she turned pale when she saw her father-in-law
1	he reached that goal by his persistent accusations
1	but this is what the french call bonne guerre , and the most innocent form of deception !
1	the house with the mezzanine : an artist 's
1	his father and mother were also most lawless people , and both were unimaginable drunkards
1	maybe my dear one is weakening now—and i lie here !
1	i promised you i would come , said felton , and i have come
1	rostov felt himself perfectly happy
1	well , now , mr khoma , it 's time we went to the deceased , said the gray-haired cossack , turning to the philosopher , and the four of them , spirid and dorosh included , went to the church , swinging their knouts at the dogs , of which there were a great many and which angrily bit at their sticks
1	only the girlfriends , sir !
1	marmeladov was in the last agony ; he did not take his eyes off the face of katerina ivanovna , who was bending over him again
1	send for gavrila ardalionovich at once !
1	the person wanted to say something
1	he raised his head
1	he went to tver , to see the widow of iosif alexeevich , who had long ago promised to give him the deceased 's papers
1	do you know , my dear young one , he began again , as if continuing his former speech , do you know that there 's a limit to the memory of a man on this earth ?
1	when they were clean , he took out the axe , washed the blade and spent a long time , about three minutes , washing the wood where there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap
1	having cut the loaf in two , he looked into the middle and , to his surprise , saw something white
1	i stopped short on the spot
1	well , now it ’ s quite enough !
1	but that 's the whole trick , that it 's simple , and it did not occur to you fools !
1	in the past year , by tatyana pavlovna 's observation , he had gone very much to seed in his dress ; his clothes were always decent , but old and without refinement
1	here i am , suppose , going in : they are amazed , interrupt their dancing , stare wildly , back away
1	you are shameless , tatyana pavlovna , you have always despised me
1	the more diverting his letters were , the more vexed she felt
1	so i still have my diamond ?
1	and i suppose you know who i am ?
1	he asked , going into a very spacious and positively clean restaurant , consisting of several rooms , which were , however , rather empty
1	she began , trying squeamishly and vexedly to recall
1	i thank you all !
1	prince andrei wondered , looking at them
1	take my word for it , kutuzov said , becoming animated and beating his chest , they will eat horseflesh for me !
1	he was an elderly , imposing man , who occupied himself part of the time with tailoring
1	the two tall muzhiks were having their say
1	i went to the cemetery along with the others ; they snubbed me and put on airs
1	there were not so many people there , he would be less observed , and it would be more convenient in every way , above all it was further off
1	at the torzhok posting station there were no horses , or else the postmaster did not want to give them to him
1	catch them it 's for your sakes i she stumbled as she ran and fell down
1	everybody laughs and knows that it 's to get money from me—can you imagine
1	this power can not be the direct power of physical domination of a strong being over a weak , a domination based on the application or threat of the application of physical force , like the power of hercules ; nor can it be based on the domination of moral force , as some historians think in the simplicity of their hearts , when they say that historical figures are heroes , that is , men endowed with a special force of soul and mind which is called genius
1	i had proposed , in concert with dumas , to draw an important work from the first volume of the memoirs of d'artagnan
1	it was not like that at all , it was quite different
1	natasha said in a whisper
1	his face wore a look of genuine sympathy
1	she cried , seeing raskolnikov and rushing up to him
1	he was not thinking about anything
1	you behaved as befits a man who cherishes his honor ; perhaps too hastily , but we wo not discuss that
1	this son of mars stopped us at the most interesting place , it seems
1	unobservant and unsuspecting as the prince was , he had been worried by the thought that nastasya filippovna might venture upon some scandal in order to drive aglaya out of pavlovsk
1	it may be that you have completely forgotten me now
1	the three musketeers you are right , my dear m bonacieux , my friends and i went on a little journey
1	she exclaimed in fear , quickly pulling her hand away
1	we are philosophizing , said natasha , glancing at him for a moment , and continuing the conversation
1	he was in that degree of vexation in which the most restrained people sometimes start saying unnecessary things
1	that is why i ask it , and not out of depravity
1	only on horseback and in the mazurka did denisov 's small stature not show , and he looked like the fine fellow he felt himself to be
1	sighed bazin , i know , monsieur , everything is turned upside down in the world today
1	oh , i did anticipate how trivial all the objections would be , and how trivial i myself would be , explaining the idea : well , what have i said ?
1	and natasha got up on tiptoe and walked out of the room as ballet dancers do , but smiling as only happy fifteen-year-old girls do
1	in fact , it began on my side with a most irresistible physical desire
1	i think , i think for a long time , and ca not think up anything else
1	despite all , i embraced mama tenderly and asked at once about him
1	later anisim and the old man had tea and a bite to eat , while varvara fingered the new roubles and asked about local people who were living in town
1	the mere influences of climate mean so much
1	not in the slightest , and indeed it 's an absurdity !
1	lebedev , who had already settled down , suddenly got up , seized the candles , and moved them closer to ippolit , so that there would be enough light to read by
1	i asked after you and came straight up
1	but later on he got used to it
1	a couple of words about him : he began his career as a fortuneless petty clerk , quietly endured the drag for forty-five years on end , knew very well how far he would be promoted , could not bear having stars in his eyes , though he was already wearing two of them , and particularly disliked expressing his own personal opinion on any subject whatsoever
1	the great point is that everything now is going to be different , is going to be broken in two , he cried , suddenly returning to his dejection
1	that was what his sudden idea consisted in
1	you promised to prove it
1	varya suddenly cried out , trembling with wrath
1	i was going to ask if you had any news of them
1	as an honest man , i must warn you , anna andreevna , that your expectations concerning me may prove vain in the highest degree i expect you to stand up for me , she looked at me firmly , for me , who am abandoned by everyone your sister , if you want that , arkady makarovich !
1	make ten bows and go
1	for some reason he imagined the next day as fatal and
1	all the horrors of the reign of terror [ ] were based only on concern for public tranquillity
1	you can make inquiries
1	how trivial it all must be , what i am fretting about now !
1	but can that be true ?
1	sasha helped her into the cab , and covered her legs with a plaid
1	i am from gascony , it 's true , and since you know that , i need not tell you that gascons are not very forbearing ; so that , when they have excused themselves once , even for some stupidity , they are convinced that they have already done half more than they ought
1	velchaninov chose a certain romance by glinka , which almost no one knows anymore : when you do ope your merry lips , my love and coo to me more sweetly than a dove
1	but even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal
1	why are you blushing ?
1	why not dolokhov answered distractedly , peering into the face of the french drummer boy
1	pierre looked around with bloodshot eyes and did not reply
1	stay , i will tell of you to‐day
1	occasionally , amidst the monotonous waves of soldiers , like a spray of white foam on the waves of the enns , an officer pushed his way through , in a cape , with his physiognomy distinct from the soldiers ' ; occasionally , like a chip of wood swirled along by the river , a dismounted hussar , an orderly , or a local inhabitant was borne across the bridge by the waves of infantry ; occasionally , like a log floating down the river , a company 's or an officer 's cart floated across the bridge , surrounded on all sides , loaded to the top , and covered with leather
1	i tell katya about my past and , to my great
1	ah , you are a dear , ah , you are so kind !
1	when anyone drops a button or a spoon , he quickly jumps from his bed and picks it up
1	i am at your service
1	why are you glad that evgeny pavlych will come ?
1	his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice , stressing each syllable : it is by my orders and for the good of the state that the bearer of this present has done what he has done
1	il leur faut une victime [ ] occurred to him as he looked at the tall fellow swinging his arm
1	sonya , darling—it 's all like before
1	have the right to kill ?
1	he took them and immediately settled down to copying them
1	it sometimes seemed to him that they were all rejoicing as he was , and only tried to conceal their joy , pretending to be occupied with other interests
1	pierre looked at her through his spectacles
1	no , i don ’ t think so
1	now i beg your special attention : consider : if he had now succeeded in proving that sofya semyonovna was a thief , he would have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his suspicions , that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with sofya semyonovna , that , in attacking me , he was protecting and preserving the honour of my sister , his betrothed
1	we will go at once
1	pierre sat for so long that evening that princess marya and natasha kept glancing at each other , obviously waiting for him to go
1	when , on the first day , having gotten up early in the morning , he went out of the shed at dawn and saw the at first dark cupolas and crosses of the novode-vichye convent , saw the frosty dew on the dusty grass , saw the heights of the sparrow hills , and the wooded bank meandering along the river and disappearing into the purple distance , when he sensed the touch of the fresh air and heard the noise of jackdaws flying across the field from moscow , and when the light then suddenly sprayed from the east and the rim of the sun floated majestically from behind a cloud , and the cupolas , and the crosses , and the dew , and the distance , and the river , everything began to play in the joyful light—pierre felt a new , never yet experienced feeling of the joy and strength of life
1	when it comes to that , i will need stout fellows from the city and the country
1	anna mikhailovna asked a girl who walked past them with a carafe on a tray ( calling her dear and sweetheart ) about the princesses ' health , and drew pierre further down the stone corridor
1	neither our laughter nor our jokes were the least bit spiteful or jeering , we were simply merry
1	by her husband , who was a lord of your acquaintance , d'artagnan went on , looking fixedly at athos
1	but this notion had no sooner flashed in everyone at once , than they all immediately insisted at once that they had perceived the whole thing long ago , and it had all been clearly foreseen ; that it had all been clear since the poor knight , and even before , only then they had not wanted to believe in such an absurdity
1	it almost never happened with her that she would sit like that , without work
1	anyhow , brother , my legs wo not hold me up , and it 's stifling here
1	captain , said felton , here is the person i spoke to you about , who is to be taken to france safe and sound
1	though there was certainly some purpose in this impudent pestering , this advertising of an acquaintance and an intimacy that did not exist , and there could now be no doubt of it—evgeny pavlovich had thought first to get rid of her somehow or other , and did his best to ignore the offender
1	here , of course , there 's a special view his own disposition of ideas undoubtedly , i interrupted warmly
1	the general heaved his shoulders
1	there were two or three dishes obviously in addition to what was usually served , rather sophisticated ones , and one of them something altogether unfamiliar , so that no one could even put a name to it
1	d'artagnan told him how he had found porthos in bed with a sprain , and aramis at a table between two theologians
1	the sting of indignation pierced my heart , and in a single instant i made a tremendous decision
1	the thing is this , my dear sit down and listen to me
1	carriage stopped at a house newly painted gray ; there was a front garden with dust-covered lilacs , and a strong smell of paint on the yellow porch
1	your excellency , they have come from the department of records , from the director , for instructions from the consistory , from the senate , from the university , from the foundling hospital , the auxiliary bishop has sent
1	i simply turned and here you are
1	milady asked in surprise
1	you leave me alone too , for goodness ' sake !
1	i feel as if everything is looking at me and listening in on how i am going to die
1	everything is about to begin over again
1	princess marya did not finish listening and , continuing with the thread of her thoughts , turned to her sister-in-law , her gentle eyes indicating her stomach
1	two doctors—one was pale and trembling— were silently doing something to the man 's other leg , which was red
1	eight years passed and he was recalled to russia , and now he was installed as an auxiliary bishop , and the past had all withdrawn somewhere into the distance , the mist , as if it had been a dream
1	out of his mind ?
1	it contained my fortune
1	you are my aunt 's son , and consequently my cousin ; you come from noyon in picardy ; you have several court cases in paris and no procureur
1	here , nastasya , take it please , he said , fumbling in his pocket ( for he had slept in his clothes ) and taking out a handful of coppers—run and buy me a loaf
1	god willing , he will get himself established somewhere in time
1	in short , i will omit the details , but from all this later came a very complex and vile piece of gossip
1	razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings
1	god forbid he should be a human being and come to love or pity someone , or start thinking about what is just and what is not
1	she hardly ever went anywhere
1	i read it almost trembling with excitement
1	give me a dumpling , a big ring of sausage , a bowl full of porridge !
1	she looked at him with unutterable reproach , tried to say something , but could not speak and broke into bitter , bitter sobs , hiding her face in her hands
1	yes … yes , i should have … but she would have died !
1	it was already night when they entered port
1	they felt that they could not express what they understood in words
1	voyons , à quoi pensez-vous ?
1	varvara danced , while the old man just waved the handkerchief and shifted from one heel to the other , but those who were hanging over each other there in the yard , peeking through the windows , were delighted and for a moment forgave him everything—his wealth and his offenses
1	lebedev ended up with what he wanted
1	velchaninov suddenly burst into nervous and irritated laughter
1	god knows what concerns and plans you may have , or what ideas you are hatching ; so it 's not for me to keep nudging your elbow , asking you what you are thinking about ?
1	he controlled himself and , as if with a certain strain , began
1	the council of war , at which prince andrei had not managed to speak out his opinion as he had hoped to , left in him a vague and disturbing impression
1	no , khalyava , we ca not , he said
1	tell me , porfiry petrovitch , tell me once for all and make haste !
1	lebedev , who happened to be near by , came closer with his curious little eyes and gazed at the envelope , trying to guess what it was about
1	her partner seized her and began whirling her round and performing before her ; everyone laughed and—i like your public , even the cancan public—they laughed and shouted , 'serves her right—serves her right !
1	i only learned that the marriage , which only failed to take place through the girl 's death , was not at all to praskovya pavlovna 's liking
1	he could not recall the face of the speaker , and even now he did not recognise it , but he remembered that he had turned round and made him some answer
1	but what am i to do ?
1	it made no difference whether everything was left or only half
1	the king cut through the crowd and , without a mask , the ribbons of his doublet barely tied , approached the queen and said to her in an altered voice : madame , if you please , why are you not wearing your diamond pendants , when you know it would have given me pleasure to see them ?
1	do you know what sort of man that suits ?
1	i also knew perfectly well , even then , that i was monstrously exaggerating all these facts ; but there was nothing to be done : i could no longer control myself , i was shaking with fever
1	felton was leaning on a chair , and milady saw with devilish joy that he would perhaps lose strength before the end of the story
1	and when they start fooling and pulling tricks
1	something may turn up even today , this same evening , ganya smiled to the general
1	lord de winter took an armchair , drew it to her side , and sat down by her
1	and what are we doing now ?
1	it is a great misfortune that i have experienced , my much-esteemed prince , yesterday evening or today at dawn … i hesitate to specify the exact time
1	he called to her across the room
1	and among external sensations the only one possible for me was reading
1	all this was spoken with a special sort of pride—we all know how such things are said
1	would you take it upon yourself , prince , to deliver it to aglaya ivanovna , right now , but only to aglaya ivanovna , that is , so that nobody sees—understand ?
1	yes , dead , he 's dead smeared with something
1	in that case , if you wish , i ’ m done , that is , i am forced to convey only briefly those facts which , in my conviction , it would not be superfluous to know in all their fullness , he added , noticing a general movement that looked like impatience
1	i ’ ll make a little list for you of which books you should read first ; want me to , or not ?
1	full-stock , half-stock , she laughed , pippin , rennet , borovinka , budding , grafting
1	you are general pervoedov ?
1	i am an old man , i have been teaching for thirty years , but i do not see any paltriness or lack of ideals , nor do i find it worse now than before
1	i hated my face , for example , found it odious , and even suspected that there was some mean expression in it , and therefore every time i came to work i made a painful effort to carry myself as independently as possible , so as not to be suspected of meanness , and to express as much nobility as possible with my facelet it not be a beautiful face , i thought , but , to make up for that , let it be a noble , an expressive , and , above all , an extremely intelligent one
1	'play me for him ?
1	say what you want
1	some hussars galloped up to him , freed his foot , and sat him in the saddle
1	everything went as mme bonacieux had foretold
1	why am i so uneasy at having put in that ' i believe ' ?
1	i will get on top it wo not matter before the officer finished , the orderly came up to the count with the same request for his master
1	it was growing light
1	now everything he said came out as charmant
1	after five o'clock it was only at the dam of augesd that the hot cannon fire of the french alone could be heard , from numerous batteries lined up on the slopes of the pratzen heights and firing at our retreating troops
1	the prince listened to this with eyes shining with rapture and tenderness
1	on top of this rubbish , always with a pipe in his mouth , lies the caretaker nikita , an old retired soldier with faded tabs
1	my mother has just said it is like a tomb
1	as for felton , he 's hesitating
1	they engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes—what a thing to trust to a casual stranger !
1	entering a small corridor with two doors on each side of it , velchaninov met a very fat and tall woman , disheveled in a homey way , and asked her about pavel pavlovich
1	and even in my oblivion there had still constantly remained some point , as it were , in my memory that simply refused to be forgotten , around which my drowsy reveries turned heavily
1	mind your woman 's business !
1	it happens to everybody , his son said in a careless , brazen tone , while in his soul he considered himself a villain , a scoundrel , whose whole life would not be enough to redeem his crime
1	yes , prince , we meet here under such sad circumstances well , how is our dear patient ?
1	i must have said too much , brother
1	i got the clothes before
1	and last evening he came back
1	however , having calmed himself by deciding to confess it to the priest the next week and to start that same day making fifty bows a day for a whole year , he peeked into the cottage ; but no one was home
1	( directive from barclay de tolly to the civil governor of smolensk , baron asch ,
1	the three musketeers the king , quite joyful , inquired whether the cardinal was still in the louvre
1	said one of the cossacks , getting up on the box along with the coachman , who had a rag wrapped around his head instead of his hat , which he had already left in the tavern
1	so let it be a dream , let it be , but this life , which you extol so much , i wanted to extinguish by suicide , while my dream , my dream—oh , it proclaimed to me a new , great , renewed , strong life !
1	so it 's a sword stroke that 's keeping him in bed ?
1	( pierre responded affirmatively by inclining his head )
1	then he took the hook and softly , noiselessly , fixed it in the catch
1	when i was there he behaved well to the servants , and they were actually fond of him , though they certainly did blame him for philip 's death
1	i do not understand what makes your sister love me ; but , of course , without her maybe i would not be living in the world now
1	mlle bourienne said he asked about you as soon as she began to speak of it , her lips trembled and tears began to fall
1	—i would not have been able to answer , because everything became clouded in me
1	the balloon was not ready yet , but , as pierre learned , it was being constructed at the wish of the sovereign
1	that is , since i now have such a crazy look ?
1	she forgot all her fear of her father , went up to him , took him by the hand , pulled him to her , and embraced his dry , sinewy neck
1	it ’ s not what you think , but i ’ m very surprised at your extreme assurance …
1	this but suddenly occurs often in stories
1	nothing bad has happened to the queen ?
1	then , too , that you wanted to avoid thanks and that , as the saying is , your right hand should not know
1	i have the feeling that once upon a time i lived at home with a real family , but now i am the dinner guest of someone who is not my real wife and am looking at someone who is not the real liza
1	i do not even understand how he dared
1	lambert went on still more irritably
1	during this interruption , pierre noticed that prince vassily came from behind the back of his chair and with that same look which showed that he knew what he was doing , and so much the worse for the others if they did not understand him , did not go up to the sick man , but passing by him , joined the eldest princess and together with her made for the depths of the bedroom , to the high bed under the silk canopy
1	when , having bought a kaftan ( only with the aim of participating in the people 's defense of moscow ) , pierre had met the rostovs , and natasha had said to him , you are staying ?
1	he 's sworn to injure me as long as i live
1	with the hundred pistoles , we will feast till the end of the month
1	after that , of course , everything 's over !
1	weep , said athos , weep , heart filled with love , youth , and life !
1	i asked , with tender curiosity
1	there will be a game of proverbs this evening , one girlfriend , whom he had scarcely noticed till then and had not yet exchanged a word with , whispered confidentially to velchaninov , and this evening everybody will laugh at pavel pavlo-vich , so you must , too
1	scrambling into the wagon , they drove off , urging their horses on and singing a song , the words and meaning of which could hardly be made out
1	oh , yes ; polenka , that is the little girl
1	for god 's sake , go and look at liza
1	you should teach us
1	sighed nevyrazimov , looking down the street , where human shadows flitted one after another past the lighted lamps
1	he took offense at shinshin 's words
1	you should have said , you know about the letter , why are you pretending ?
1	there 's a dull pain in my cheek—the tic is beginning
1	lord de winter asked coldly
1	meanwhile people were crowding to the grille
1	later on , with her husband ’ s increasing wealth and significance in the service , she even began to feel somewhat at home in this high circle
1	it will be an answer to your first question indeed , for the woman was your sister
1	wait , i will tell you i ca not
1	the old prince , not abandoning his order , went to his rooms after dinner
1	do me a favor , count , allow me for god 's sake to take refuge somewhere on one of your carts
1	svidrigaïlov treated katia and the organ‐grinder and some singers and the waiters and two little clerks
1	it was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind , at least
1	believe me , sonya , i have come to you now as to an angel , and not at all as to an enemy : what sort of enemy , what sort of enemy are you to me !
1	madame schoss and sonya , who had not undressed yet , went with him
1	and he began to explain the reasons why he could not bear his daughter 's muddleheaded character
1	though you have made me marvel all day today !
1	he felt as if he were tumbling down a mountain , falling , falling , falling , that he must hold on , get a grip on something , but there was no opportunity for that
1	on the first landing , this pillar turned out to have a depression in it , like a niche , no more than one pace wide and a half-pace deep
1	the monitors , as they heard the lessons , looked with one eye under the desk , where a roll or dumpling or pumpkin seeds stuck out of their subordinate 's pocket
1	this general was ivan fyodorovich ’ s immediate superior in the service , whom he , from the fervor of his grateful heart and even from a sort of self-love , also considered his benefactor , while he by no means considered himself ivan fyodorovich ’ s benefactor , treated him with perfect equanimity , though he liked to take advantage of his manifold services , and would at once have replaced him with some other official , if certain considerations , even of a not very lofty sort , demanded it
1	they are holding me prisoner
1	well , then , i want you to hear about me every day !
1	she went about just as we do , only she did not eat pork , said it was somehow forbidden by their law
1	lizaveta prokofyevna went straight in the opposite direction from the one they took every day
1	she frightened us last night , i ca not get over it
1	i did not understand— what are 'geneva ideas ' ?
1	but where and when shall i see you again ?
1	pulcheria alexandrovna was surprised to find that she , too , was glad : she had only that morning thought rupture with luzhin a terrible misfortune
1	she says goodness knows what she says , she does not explain her object !
1	voices whispered to lazarev , who did not know where to go
1	en général ils regardent smolensk comme le point où ils doivent se refaire
1	i do not know what to say
1	said porthos , drawing out his lips in disdain
1	on the contrary , i constantly reproach myself ; but that is a quite uninteresting and cheerless subject
1	of all that napoleon might have done : to winter in moscow , to go against petersburg , to go against nizhni novgorod , to go back more to the north , or to the south the way kutuzov went later— whatever one thinks up , nothing stupider or more destructive than what napoleon did , that is , to stay in moscow until october , to allow his troops to loot the city , then , hesitating whether or not to leave a garrison , to quit moscow , to approach kutuzov without starting a battle , to turn to the right , reach maly yaroslavets , again without trying his chances of breaking through , to go , not by the road kutuzov had taken , but back to mozhaisk down the devastated smolensk road—nothing stupider than that , or more destructive for his troops , could possibly have been thought up , as the consequences showed
1	that is , i ’ d like to know to what extent …
1	how she spat in ganka ’ s mug !
1	it 's all that cuckoo 's fault !
1	she talks a lot , likes to argue , and accompanies every phrase , even the most insignificant , with expressive looks and gestures
1	allons doucement , il faut la surprendre , [ ]
1	someone was standing stealthily close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly listening within , and seemed to have her ear to the door he moved a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have the appearance of hiding , then rang a third time , but quietly , soberly , and without impatience , recalling it afterwards , that moment stood out in his mind vividly , distinctly , for ever ; he could not make out how he had had such cunning , for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and he was almost unconscious of his body
1	he asked her about mutual acquaintances : the princess became still more animated and started talking away , giving the prince greetings and town gossip
1	as for m de tréville , when the king 's eyes rested a moment on him , he endured that gaze with such firmness that it was the king who looked away ; after which , grumbling all the while , the king went to his apartments
1	having loaded the guest with all this pharmacy , she would lead him to a multitude of plates
1	tatyana pavlovna looked at her with decided indignation
1	i ’ ll leave presently , you may be sure
1	two roubles forty-three kopecks !
1	raskolnikov pulled away his hand
1	your excellency , dearest , replied alpatych , instantly recognizing the voice of his young prince
1	he did not have tea in the morning , did not go to the hospital , and spent the whole time lying on the turkish divan in his study
1	then , shifting his eyes from milady to the paper , he read : order to convey to_____ the name of the place is left blank , de winter broke off
1	the general was coming down , pink and fresh after his bath
1	sonya , listening , thought of what an enormous difference there was between her and her friend , and how impossible it would be for her to be ever so slightly as bewitching as her cousin
1	how disgusting , he thought with annoyance
1	pipe in his teeth , he lay looking at them all with extraordinarily sweet eyes and kept spitting to the side
1	yes , that should be so , thought pierre , when , after these words , the rhetor went away again , leaving him to his solitary reflections
1	in fact , it does happen that a deeply sleeping man suddenly opens his eyes , even raises his head for a second and looks around the room , and then , after a moment , unconsciously lays his head back on the pillow and falls asleep , remembering nothing
1	at that moment the dog ran in , barking ; i wanted to seize her , but she , vile thing , almost seized me by the nose with her teeth
1	still less did he think of doing people harm in order to profit from it
1	i earnestly beg it
1	and the more lifelike the image , the more perplexing the question
1	an arm , osip nikiforovich !
1	once , about a month ago , we were all laughing together after dinner and , as usual , suggesting a subject for adelaida ivanovna ’ s future painting
1	that ’ s jealousy for you
1	she would open her big eyes , listen , look , and keep silent
1	and , taking him under the arm , with a happy face she slowly walked beside him to the sitting room
1	these words about a father from a son had most certainly confirmed in her all her suspicions about versilov and about his having insulted her
1	one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloody apron and with small , bloody hands , in one of which , between the thumb and the little finger ( so as not to stain it ) , he was holding a cigar
1	then porthos and aramis instantly closed ranks with him , while jussac lined up his soldiers
1	ah , yes , your business
1	you ca not imagine how we felt !
1	that is our whole mistake , that we ’ re still unable to see that this is not only an exclusively theological matter !
1	she said , and tears , bitter , abundant tears , poured from her big eyes
1	from whom would i have borne such a look and such an insolent smile without an immediate protest , even the stupidest—it makes no difference—on my part ?
1	with horror it was told how many books they had read
1	to milord the duke of buckingham , london
1	but can it be that he was received in my mother 's house ?
1	as soon as the dinner was over , the two former friends left their places and began looking for their hats , so as to slip away
1	that means it was her i saw in church !
1	you ’ re a terrible skeptic , prince , kolya added after a couple of minutes
1	on his way , alpatych met and passed baggage trains and troops
1	their fathers and relations all got angry with me , because the children finally couldn ’ t do without me and kept gathering around me , and the schoolmaster finally even became my worst enemy
1	the accident was as follows
1	sit , sit a while , must be your legs do not stand firm yet , he invited me affably , pointing to the place next to him and continuing to look into my face with the same radiant gaze
1	the past is banal and uninteresting , the future insignificant , and this wondrous night , unique in their life , will soon end , will merge with eternity—why then live ?
1	pavel pavlovich hastily waved his hand
1	no , i wo not get my nose smashed
1	we must try to imagine what would have transformed the chicken coop into a mansion , what would have made it more than a phalanstery in a brothel , what would have turned it from an embodiment of the laws of nature into a contradiction of those very laws , and how from all this the need of faith and christ was deduced
1	do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that i too oh , my dear sir how could i ?
1	yes , yes , please , or it will get late , he said , and , nodding his head , lowered it and again closed his eye
1	just come , if you need something , the staff can always be helpful said zherkov
1	here suddenly , while i was standing and coming to my senses—suddenly my revolver flashed before me , ready , loaded—but i instantly pushed it away from me !
1	the best thing in your situation would be to run away from here
1	prince andrei , in a cloak , astride a black horse , was standing behind the crowd and looking at alpatych
1	but they only flash ; and what ’ s needed is a full embodiment , which always comes about unexpectedly and suddenly , but it is impossible to calculate precisely when it will come about ; then , once you have received the full image in your heart , you can set about its artistic realization
1	ah , so he ’ s kept his word , just look !
1	what business is she of yours , my good sir ?
1	after petya joined obolensky 's cossack regiment and left for belaya tserkov , where the regiment was being formed , the countess was overcome with fear
1	maybe ferdyshchenko won ’ t take you , nastasya filippovna , i ’ m a candid man , ferdyshchenko interrupted , but the prince will !
1	my familiarity with the natural sciences and the scientific method has always kept me on my guard ; i have tried wherever possible to take scientific data into account , and where it has not been possible i have preferred not writing at all ( letter of october , )
1	the bishop listened to his mother and remembered how , many years ago , she used to take him and his brothers and sisters to visit relatives whom she considered wealthy ; she was solicitous for her children then , and for her grandchildren now , and so she had brought katya
1	in it the unforgettable nikolai semyonovich , as requested , gives his reflections on arkady 's notes - that is , on dostoevsky 's novel , minus the epilogue
1	soon , however , the same thing that used to happen in exclusively nighttime hours began to repeat itself in the mornings , but with greater bile than at night , with anger instead of repentance , with mockery instead of tenderheartedness
1	i am hungry as a dog
1	milady held out her hand to him
1	in one place he stopped , listening
1	she only felt a gentle hand firmly take hold of her hand , and barely touched the white forehead with beautiful , pomaded blond hair above it
1	perhaps , to‐day even but never mind to‐morrow evening i shall take him for a walk , said razumihin
1	the prince and lebedev decided not to tell anyone , even kolya doesn ’ t know
1	the bracelet was taken out and handed around ; but they all looked at it silently , and some even mockingly
1	dreadful cries , weeping and howling , were coming from behind the neighbors ' door
1	the one i have chartered for you
1	before , too , when he came home , he had often forgotten to lock the door for the night , considering it a matter of no importance
1	there was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes ; he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud
1	in the midst of the conversation going on in the sitting room , dimmler came in and went to the harp that stood in the corner
1	we all know what 's evil for us
1	don ’ t interrupt me , we ’ re not such fools as you think , mister lawyer , lebedev ’ s nephew exclaimed with spiteful vexation
1	when they prayed for those who hate us , she invented enemies and those who hated her in order to pray for them
1	he did not know how long he was unconscious
1	the noise behind the door increased , and suddenly the door was opened a little
1	are you dreaming , athos ?
1	and it was at this work that the arrival of his lady acquaintances found him
1	alas , you see it yourself !
1	some built little houses from the clods of the field or plaited little baskets out of straw
1	so what if he 's a kammerjunker
1	it 's either for you or for me
1	if there is still a mimicry of traditional storytelling in a number of the earlier ukrainian tales , in others we see much more clearly this shift to a process of objectless intent , to speech about nothing —particularly in ivan fyodorovich shponka and his aunt , the last written of the evenings , and in old world landowners and the story of how ivan ivanovich quarreled with ivan nikiforovich from mirgorod
1	but that is all folly !
1	but maybe indeed i grew angry all at once and drove him out because of the sudden guess that he had come to me hoping to find out whether any more of andronikov 's letters had been left to marya ivanovna ?
1	this reply was too flattering for me to insist on his departure
1	three months later olenka was returning from church one day , sad , in deep mourning
1	the images it produces are too deeply ambiguous to bear any social message
1	the cardinal listened , smiling , to this brilliant display of master bonacieux 's enthusiastic feelings ; then , when bonacieux 's cries were lost in the distance , he said : good
1	the mother was still lying in bed opposite the door , and to her right stood the godfather , a most excellent man , ivan ivanovich yeroshkin , who served as a chief clerk in the senate , and the godmother , the wife of a police officer , a woman of rare virtue , arina semyonovna belobriushkova
1	what could i have against you , the only just , good , and compassionate being i have met !
1	at the very beginning of the trial raskolnikov 's mother fell ill dounia and razumihin found it possible to get her out of petersburg during the trial
1	dounia said this , speaking hurriedly , and for an instant the colour rushed to her face
1	the unexpected news of the french crossing the niémen was particularly unexpected after a month of unfulfilled expectation , and that at a ball !
1	this is not m
1	i confess , it came to me suddenly in a flash of lightning
1	she positively pounced upon him , and made him sit on her left hand ( amalia ivanovna was on her right )
1	i wish you wouldn ’ t come to see us all day tomorrow , but come in the evening , when these … guests have gathered
1	keller insisted later that ippolit had kept that hand in his right pocket before as well , while he was talking with the prince and clutching at his shoulder and collar with his left hand , and this right hand in the pocket , keller insisted , had supposedly aroused a first suspicion in him
1	if you don ’ t drop these loathsome people at once , i ’ ll hate you alone all my life , all my life !
1	it 's you i am calling !
1	i had to wait : the next train came through at eleven o'clock at night
1	everybody got up , began to move , to talk , again the dressmakers came , again marya dmitrievna came out , and tea was served
1	in their church there are also representatives who are worthy of all respect and vir-tu-ous men …
1	the days were busy in tsybukin 's house
1	but why , he was always asking himself , why had such an important , such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the hay market ( where he had moreover no reason to go ) at the very hour , the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny ?
1	come , my dear porthos !
1	the monotonous , cold , eternally tidied and , so to speak , buttoned-up faces of the officials , military and civil , did not offer much space for the brush : it began to forget luxurious draperies , strong gestures and passions
1	well , let me tell you that i have no feeling of love now , not the slightest , so that i wonder myself indeed , for i really did feel something through idleness and depravity , raskolnikov put in
1	i never saw such terrible fits of inner suffering , such furious , scorching anguish , such devouring despair as shook the unfortunate lover
1	there is the temperature of boiling water , and there is the temperature of red-hot iron
1	i know that porthos was well on his way , said d'artagnan , and , as for aramis , to tell the truth , i was never seriously worried about him
1	and my eyes have only now been opened !
1	but his excellency tried this time not to hear
1	then the dark avenue of firs , the collapsed fence in the field where rye was flowering then and quail were calling , cows and hobbled horses now wandered
1	suddenly a sense of happiness came over him
1	well , and such men are most often good souls
1	give me their books , give me their tracts , their memoirs , and i undertake , without being a literary critic , to write a most persuasive literary critique , in which i shall make it clear as day that every page of their books , pamphlets , and memoirs has been written first of all by a former russian landowner
1	anyway i could not bring myself to it !
1	this meant that tikhon had not handed him the waistcoat he wanted
1	it 's quite simple , replied athos
1	and if you were suddenly slapped with paralysis or , say , some brazen fool , taking advantage of his position and rank , insulted you publicly , and you knew he would go unpunished—well , then you would understand how it is to fob others off with comprehension and the true blessing
1	riding behind one of the lines of the infantry guard regiments , he heard a voice call him by name
1	i know you have , he answered
1	now he had been sitting for half an hour , an hour , and he was sick of it to the point of anguish
1	do put down your cap , it looks as if you were just going , it makes me uncomfortable i am so delighted raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of porfiry petrovitch
1	d'artagnan was going to make some observations about that , but athos placed his hand on his shoulder , smiling , and d'artagnan understood that it was fine for a little gascon gentleman like him to haggle , but not for a man who had the airs of a prince
1	the three musketeers and with a slow , accusatory gesture , the baron pointed to milady 's left shoulder , which he almost touched with his finger
1	a péché véniel or a péché mortel ?
1	katia drank off her glass of wine , as women do , without putting it down , in twenty gulps , took the note and kissed svidrigaïlov 's hand , which he allowed quite seriously
1	the beekeeper opens two central frames so as to see into the nest
1	believe me , i am happy to see you
1	i must observe , lebedev interrupted him with feverish impatience and in a sort of creeping voice , while the laughter spread more and more , that i corrected only the first half of the article , but since we disagreed in the middle and quarreled over an idea , i left the second half of the article uncorrected , sir , so all that ’ s illiterate there ( and it is illiterate ! )
1	and you murdered her !
1	osip , it ca not be !
1	some columns halted , stacked their muskets , and lay down on the cold ground , assuming they had gotten where they were supposed to go ; some columns ( the majority ) marched all night and obviously did not get where they were supposed to go
1	xxxv : at night all cats are gray d'artagnan , as usual , appeared at milady 's towards nine o'clock
1	katya says with vexation
1	and you won ’ t have tea and won ’ t eat dinner again ?
1	they were led up to the porch and brought into the house one by one
1	i bet you never thought of that
1	you got me into it , and kniff cheated
1	the droshky finally pulled up , and kovalev , breathless , ran into a small reception room , where a gray-haired clerk in an old tailcoat and spectacles sat at a table , holding a pen in his teeth and counting the copper money brought to him
1	suddenly she covers her face with her hands
1	petya , having left his family on their departure from moscow , had joined his regiment , and soon after that was attached as an orderly to a general in command of a large detachment
1	go , or you ca not even imagine what will happen !
1	athos walked off in the direction indicated and reached the outskirts at the opposite end of town from the one by which he and his friends had entered
1	how can a throne be vacant ?
1	pulcheria alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her
1	please go in , it 's so hot here my shirt 's soaking wet
1	but i ran out of the apartment , not leaving her a word of hope
1	there was something heavy , strained , unspoken , quarrelsome ; everyone scowled
1	within a year ivan dmitrich was completely forgotten in town , and his books , which the landlady dumped into a sleigh in the shed , were pilfered by street boys
1	pavel pavlovich narrowed his eyes pleasantly
1	all this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction
1	then puffing and panting he bent down and began looking at the keyhole : but the key was in the lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen
1	someone called her name in a tender and soft voice from the garden side and kissed her on the head
1	but that was not all
1	dostoevsky 's response had to take artistic form
1	with this shriek she expressed everything the other hunters had expressed with their simultaneous talk
1	here everything was usually talked about : someone who was having new trousers made for himself
1	grimaud stretched out his hand in the direction of the lys
1	he cried in a voice accustomed to command
1	at this pronouncement from aramis , athos frowned and bit his lips
1	come here , dorosh , till i embrace you !
1	the most immediate result of it was and had to be—for the russians , that we came nearer to the destruction of moscow ( which we feared more than anything in the world ) ; and for the french , that they came nearer to the destruction of their whole army ( which they also feared more than anything in the world )
1	some of them were talking ( he heard russian speech ) , others were eating bread , the most seriously wounded gazed at the courier galloping past them silently , with a meek and sickly childish interest
1	you want to stop at home ?
1	she sat down on a chair , whispering something
1	or at least to be in his own home , on the terrace , but so that nobody else was there , neither lebedev nor his children ; to throw himself on his sofa , bury his face in his pillow , and lie there like that for a day , a night , another day
1	olya even burst out laughing , only so spitefully , and this gentleman , i see , takes her hand , puts it to his heart
1	she ’ s placid as a fool , and really a perfect wet hen , there ’ s no shaking her up , yet she ’ s sad , there are times when she looks so sad
1	when modest alexeich came into her room , without his frock coat , a half hour before going to the ball , in order to put his decoration on his neck in front of her pier glass , he was enchanted by the beauty and splendor of her fresh , airy costume , brushed out his side-whiskers smugly , and said :
1	the hurry the young woman had been in to bring the queen this excellent news of the fortunate return of her messenger had made it so that the two lovers barely exchanged a few words
1	the first thing he saw on riding out into the space occupied by tushin 's cannon was an unharnessed horse with a shattered leg that was whinnying near the harnessed horses
1	he is already of the rank of a counsellor , pyotr petrovitch luzhin , and is distantly related to marfa petrovna , who has been very active in bringing the match about
1	however , i will say all : even to this day i do not know how to judge her ; indeed god alone could see her feelings , and besides , a human being is such a complex machine that in some cases there 's no figuring him out , and all the more so if that being is—a woman
1	nina ivanovna wanted to say something but was unable to utter a word , sobbed , and went to her room
1	i could in no way understand why he did that
1	he still made her uneasy , as though he was competent and good‐natured , was he capable of carrying out his promise ?
1	i have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years
1	looking at the cold face of davout , who , like a stern teacher , agreed to be patient for a time and wait for an answer , pierre felt that every second of delay might cost him his life ; but he did not know what to say
1	anyway , perhaps it might be possible to consult him !
1	to conceal as little as possible
1	the idiot is dostoevsky ’ s most autobiographical novel
1	the prince cried in anxiety
1	my reason 's deserting me—simply !
1	each of them retired to his own room
1	saying good-bye , i kissed her for the first time in my life and all that would have been fine , but there was one thing that was not fine : one oppressive idea had been throbbing in me since nightfall and would not leave my mind
1	he stopped to see me on his way ; i was on duty !
1	if he keeps on coming , we fire again
1	the general had promised yesterday to come here and spend the night , but he didn ’ t
1	there 's no room for you here !
1	i wo not let you go like that
1	to the poison she pours out , there is no antidote
1	it – it – it 's
1	she added in surprise
1	her lapdog did not manage to get through the door into the shop and was left in the street
1	if the old woman wept , it was not because he was able to tell it movingly , but because peter was close to her and she was interested with her whole being in what had happened in peter 's soul
1	and how would you like a bit of this ?
1	( ) the names of characters—bolkonsky , drubetskoy , bilibin , kuragin , and others—resemble well-known russian names
1	so he remained on the bench , his back leaning against the wall and his arms hanging down , just where his guards had deposited him
1	you can see for yourself what has happened to semyon zaharovitch ; he is dying
1	don ’ t swear , i won ’ t believe you !
1	he shrugged his shoulders and spread his arms
1	only the expression of the will of a divinity not dependent on time can pertain to a whole series of events that are to take place over several years or centuries , and only a divinity , without cause , by its will alone , can determine the direction of mankind 's movement
1	but all eyes were demanding that he submit
1	when the weather 's gray and overcast , there are no morning frosts
1	of course people like that are always possible
1	the first morning i came back from the office i found katerina ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—soup and salt meat with horse radish—which we had never dreamed of till then
1	i said , somewhat agitated , apparently even offendedif you count me , it 's twenty-eight roubles , not twenty-one
1	i have this one , he replied
1	you warm your back and your belly gets cold
1	the prince quickly moved close to him , almost touching him , and made out the pale face of rogozhin
1	what a charming boy !
1	d'artagnan , for all the pains he took , could find out nothing more about his three new friends
1	do you love sister sonia ?
1	he at once raced ahead another stretch , rubbed his horse down with heather and leaves , and placed himself in the middle of the road about two hundred paces from the camp
1	and , to be sure , we avoided talking to him about his sister varenka marrying 'alias the spider
1	i have sworn off it
1	it was a warm , clear day
1	father does not want it , because he wants a more aristocratic and wealthy marriage for andrei
1	then he remembered the sock about which razumihin had just been telling him
1	damnation , these thoughts again !
1	qu'ont-ils fait pour louis xvi , pour la reine , pour madame elisabeth ?
1	and does that keep you from telling me the second reason ?
1	it 's out of my way
1	and when i pictured how the earth is a heavy substance and in sitting down may grind our noses into flour , i was overcome with such anxiety that , putting on my stockings and shoes , i hurried to the state council chamber to order the police not to allow the earth to sit on the moon
1	wo not you have some tea now ?
1	i should think so !
1	besides the velvety baritone laugh and the laugh that resembles a harmonica , the maid who serves us also hears an unpleasant , cracked laughter , like that of a vaudeville general : haw , haw , haw
1	oh , tell me , who first announced , who was the first to proclaim that man does dirty only because he does not know his real interests ; and that were he to be enlightened , were his eyes to be opened to his real , normal interests , man would immediately stop doing dirty , would immediately become good and noble , because , being enlightened and understanding his real profit , he would see his real profit precisely in the good , and it 's common knowledge that no man can act knowingly against his own profit , consequently , out of necessity , so to speak , he would start doing good ?
1	then it would take off , take right off
1	what 's one to do with such children ?
1	of his purity of heart and lack of malice i wo not speak : it 's not for us to get started on that theme to finish with the characterization of makar ivanovich , i shall tell one of his stories from his own private life
1	n'est-ce pas qu'il est admirable—duport ?
1	( ) however much the difficulty of comprehending causes may increase , we will never arrive at the notion of total freedom , that is , the absence of cause
1	and , anyhow , you ’ re clowning and making fun of me in your usual way , to make yourself more interesting
1	porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window
1	i like what you are saying , dmitri prokofitch !
1	in any case , this will be decided very soon
1	looking down over the railing , prince nesvitsky saw the swift , noisy , low waves of the enns , which , merging , rippling , and swirling around the pilings of the bridge , drove on one after the other
1	she is herself before you—she herself here declared just now before everyone that i gave her only ten roubles
1	go along with you !
1	avdotya romanovna , luzhin declared huffily , your words are of too much consequence to me ; i will say more , they are offensive in view of the position i have the honour to occupy in relation to you
1	du hast die schonsten augen madchen , was willst du mehr ?
1	and yet , in all this , the cardinal had still not said a word about the duke of buckingham
1	there is one fact but it 's a long story and there 's no need to discuss it
1	can i raise my arm ?
1	seeing the young master , the older girl , with a frightened look on her face , seized her younger friend by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree , having no time to pick up the spilled green plums
1	and you , ganechka , you ’ ve missed aglaya epanchin ; did you know that ?
1	there is justice in it
1	( i am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talking too much )
1	i hope that you yourself , prince , are progressive enough not to deny that …
1	yes , those moments were the light of my soul
1	an hour and a half later , most of the players looked upon their own game as a joke
1	i did not mean that at all !
1	touchard , with increased importance , replied humanely that he made no distinction among the children , that here they were all his children , and he their father , and that he held me on almost the same footing with princely and senatorial children , and that that should be appreciated , and so on , and so forth
1	the days are almost autumnal , but clear , sometimes so fresh , you hide in the thicket , you wander off into the forest , there 's a smell of leaves do i see something sympathetic in your look , arkady makarovich ?
1	come , i will make peace between you
1	one day he would order his camp bed made up in the gallery , then he would remain on the sofa or the voltaire armchair in the drawing room and doze off without undressing , while , instead of mlle bourienne , the boy petrusha read to him , then he would spend the night in the dining room
1	i repeat out of humaneness : reflect , force yourself to reflect well for at least once in your life
1	it seems his eminence wants to keep someone from getting to england
1	besides , he had a strange preoccupation , which was to believe that the very causes of his sadness aroused the gaiety of strangers
1	i do not want to know , hang it !
1	at last , i saw the lamp rise quietly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling
1	athos remained a musketeer under d'artagnan 's command until , at which time , following a trip to the touraine , he also left the service , under the pretext that he had just come into a small inheritance in rousillon
1	the upshot of it all was that i was the only stupid one , and nobody else
1	indeed so , monsieur , said planchet , and i will leave whenever you like
1	to return to england this very instant , and to inform him right away if the duke leaves london
1	well , that was clear , he said after some thought , so , it ’ s over !
1	and everybody there waxed tearful—she had taught them so well
1	how much do you understand ?
1	what struck him , you see , was that only that subject seemed to interest you ; now it 's clear why it did interest you ; knowing all the circumstances and how that irritated you and worked in with your illness i am a little drunk , brother , only , confound him , he has some idea of his own i tell you , he 's mad on mental diseases
1	i hasten to tell you all about the matter , and though it has been arranged without asking your consent , i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account , for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you
1	the explanation of this strange phenomenon as russian military historians give it—that kutuzov prevented the attack—is groundless , because we know that kutuzov 's will could not keep the troops from attacking at vyazma and tarutino
1	good evening , he said
1	and apparently she had also made an impression on him , because shortly afterwards an elderly lady with whom she was barely acquainted came to have coffee with her , and had only just sat down at the table when she immediately began talking about pustovalov , what a good , solid man he was , and how any bride would be pleased to marry him
1	i do not understand it
1	now , she happened to be there yesterday at the same time i was , by chance , and i had to show her to her carriage
1	true , afterwards , for the next couple of days , everyone was a bit cross ; ivan petrovich was even offended , but not greatly
1	so you ’ re also a relation ?
1	tatyana cried , trembling all over in a terrible fit of anger , ferocious anger
1	he kept imagining that in revenge for it his hateful neighbor would at the very least set fire to his house
1	be a friend , one little cup !
1	there was a slight smell of vodka in his vicinity ; but his manner was showy , somewhat studied , and with an obvious wish to impress by its dignity
1	whole or in a candlestick ?
1	but in spite of this scornful reflection , he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden : and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room
1	you see , liza – i will speak about myself !
1	i was a wicked official
1	it was dark—they were still riding
1	oh , it 's just a momentary delay , replied aramis
1	everything showed that the master of the house liked to make merry and that the yard often resounded with the noise of feasting
1	there were no ladies , because olga ivanovna considered all ladies , except for actresses and her dressmaker , to be boring
1	now that one can talk to you , i should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary , so to speak , fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition : in that case you will be cured , if not , it will go from bad to worse
1	you see , my friend , i have been thinking about you , said prince andrei , when they came to the big room with the pianoforte
1	bagration rode around the ranks that had gone past him and dismounted
1	there was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with american leather , full of holes , before which stood an old deal kitchen‐table , unpainted and uncovered
1	it was scarcely the document restrained me
1	is not he thin though !
1	prince andrei talked incessantly and argued now with his father , now with the swiss tutor dessales , and seemed more animated than usual—an animation the moral cause of which pierre knew so well
1	it ’ s clear that we must reject it with contempt and double our respect for evgeny pavlych
1	kutuzov was awarded a maria theresa with large cross , and the whole army received rewards
1	look at the stars , burning away something awful !
1	again in his sleep he remembered the zemstvo agent , dark-haired , pale , in tall , dusty boots , coming up to the accountant 's desk
1	could not see , it 's so dark , brother
1	he had his work on vassilievsky , and came home strictly at certain hours , among others almost always before twelve
1	in his letter i found two gross errors in grammar
1	but i knew for certain that he had acquaintances ; lately he had even renewed many former connections in high society circles , which he had abandoned during that last year ; but it seems he was not especially tempted by them , and many were renewed only officially , while he preferred coming to me
1	their every action , which to them seems willed by themselves , in the historical sense is not willed , but happens in connection with the whole course of history and has been destined from before all ages
1	as a criminal led out to execution knows that he is about to die , yet still looks around and straightens the hat he has put on askew , so moscow involuntarily went on with her usual life , though she knew that the time of her destruction was near , when all the conventions of life , which people were accustomed to obey , would be broken
1	the countess never missed an opportunity to make an insulting or cruel hint to sonya
1	thought petro , and gooseflesh crept over him
1	and how long was the queen out of the room ?
1	he 's a poor man , lonely , timid , and of course it would be a sin to deny him our sympathy
1	there was lika mizinova , with whom he was nearly in love , but then failed to keep a rendezvous while traveling abroad in
1	you mean you and natalia
1	they have a psychology of their own , brother
1	he received bolkonsky drily and coldly , and said with his german accent [ ] that he would report his arrival to the sovereign so as to determine an assignment for him , and meanwhile he invited him to stay with his staff
1	he asked , with a constrained smile
1	but first the reader should learn where the one half would come from
1	the exquisite pair of lavender gloves , real louvain , told the same tale , if only from the fact of his not wearing them , but carrying them in his hand for show
1	before evening , a sergeant of the guards came into the church with two soldiers and announced to pierre that he was pardoned and would now go to the barracks of the prisoners of war
1	my word , he has been going it !
1	rostov did not remember and did not feel how he ran to his place and mounted his horse
1	hm damn it all !
1	they barely understood me when i asked them about eternal life , but they were apparently so convinced of it unconsciously that it did not constitute a question for them
1	look , he 's jumped up and is making his bows , they must be quite starved , poor things
1	in front of the house was a pretty porch with a roof supported by two oak posts—unreliable protection from the sun , which at that season in little russia does not joke but leaves the walker streaming with hot sweat from head to foot
1	i have noticed more than once in my life that husbands do not quite get on with their mothers‐in‐law , and i do not want to be the least bit in anyone 's way , and for my own sake , too , would rather be quite independent , so long as i have a crust of bread of my own , and such children as you and dounia
1	papa and the prince are in petersburg
1	suddenly a man of strange , terrible appearance rushed in
1	where is alexander now , and what is he thinking ?
1	moreover , the room had been furnished to receive a woman , and the most complete coquette could not have formed a desire which , in looking around the room , she did not find already satisfied
1	they are like that , authors , literary men , students , town‐criers pfoo !
1	if so , what did you come for ?
1	at this shout— the gentleman turned , paused for a moment , became flustered , smiled , was about to say something , to do something—for a moment , obviously , was in terrible indecision , and suddenly— turned and ran away without looking back
1	generally , this bloodthirsty soldier , said bilibin , needs to be converted to more humane views
1	but i have spoken truly , it 's the truth
1	there were only three glasses ; the water was so dirty that it was impossible to tell whether the tea was strong or weak , and the samovar only held water enough for six glasses , but the more pleasant it was to receive one 's glass in turn and by seniority from the plump little hands of marya genrikhovna with their short , none-too-clean nails
1	raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently ; his eyebrows did not quiver , his face did not flinch
1	to leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt , but also to spare the feelings of marfa petrovna , whose suspicions would have been aroused : and then dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family
1	deux fois le quartier général a été attaqué par des troupes de maraudeurs et le général en chef a été obligé lui-même de demander un bataillon , pour les chasser
1	yes , he used to get his hair pulled pretty often , roared the commissariat clerk again , swallowing another glass of vodka
1	but so long as i live and desire – let my hand wither [ ] if i bring even one little brick for such a tenement house !
1	on the contrary , she was terribly struck , but only till home
1	it may be that he had guessed the whole truth in supposing that the reason he was received was that from the first his presence had become impossible for totsky
1	ah , he 's eating , then he 's not ill , said razumihin
1	he could scarcely breathe
1	thought about his mother
1	ah , my god , but why did you do it ?
1	seems like somebody 's coming down the road
1	perhaps he had daughters growing up like that , looking like ladies and refined with pretensions to gentility and smartness
1	i hesitated before , but now i ’ ve decided for certain : first put me in a coffin and bury me in the earth , then marry off my daughter , that ’ s what i spelled out to ivan fyodorovich today
1	i am afraid of them even now
1	he clearly saw the figure of a red-haired gunner , his shako knocked askew , pulling a swab from one side , while a french soldier pulled it towards him from the other side
1	and the only such concept known to historians is power
1	i will say nothing of the mnishki with sour cream , nor the tripe served with the borscht , nor the turkey with plums and raisins , nor the dish that looked very much like boots soaked in kvass , nor the sauce that was the swan song of an old-style cook—a sauce served all enveloped in a spiritous flame , which greatly amused and ukrainian tales at the same time frightened the ladies
1	you simply want to make me lose my head , to work me up beforehand and so to crush me
1	nikolai turned and looked back
1	well , you are smitten !
1	so , brother , you are throwing a ball for the whole petersburg side ?
1	i never have anything to do with the police !
1	they liked to compose songs about each other and praised each other like children ; these were the most simple songs , but they flowed from the heart and penetrated hearts
1	where will she live here ?
1	i lowered my eyes
1	first , some stationery , do you hear ?
1	raskolnikov asked , as though startled
1	if i step on the ledge below , i reflected further , i can get hold of the top of the gate and climb onto the wall—and nobody will notice , there 's nobody here , silence !
1	his whole company had already crowded into the drawing room
1	the thought of putting something aside from his salary proved a dream
1	can such words come from the lips of a … dead man , with a dried-up heart and talent ?
1	napoleon 's historian thiers , like his other historians , says , trying to justify his hero , that napoleon was lured to the walls of moscow involuntarily
1	what 's he doing here ?
1	spit on your gladly , only you seem to know everything here
1	in the evening , when they all began to disperse after supper , anatole kissed princess marya 's hand
1	he added to himself
1	then , too , when one has walked for a long time , hunger comes ; d'artagnan had noticed that some time ago
1	for the recovery of money due , from the student , the head clerk interfered hurriedly , tearing himself from his papers
1	above you there is the king , and above the king there is god
1	ivan suddenly jumped up from his place and rushed to help him off with his cape
1	if the prince had been alone—that is , without us— i am sure he would have been more dignified and resourceful ; now , though , something peculiarly tremulous in his smile , maybe much too amiable , and some strange distractedness betrayed him
1	not stupidly put , but do not nag
1	( about mirth in our time—that was versilov 's observation , chapter one and i remembered it )
1	well , so you see
1	perhaps you ’ ll still kill me before that … ’ she said it and fell to thinking
1	of course , c'est un parti très brilliant , mais le bonheur , ma chère [ ]
1	then i would take all seven roubles from the drawer , to show him that i had them and had deliberately set them aside , but that i did not , did not , simply did not want to give him his wages , did not want to because that 's how i wanted it , because such was amy will as the master , because he was irreverent , because he was a boor ; but that if he asked reverently , perhaps i would relent and pay him ; otherwise he would have to wait another two weeks , wait three weeks , wait a whole month
1	the day before , the thought had occurred to me that it was versilov there , the more so as he had come to my room soon afterwards , though i knew for certain from their own conversations that versilov had moved somewhere to another apartment during the time of my illness , and spent his nights there
1	you did not spend long with us , she said
1	king stepan made war on the turks
1	he did not remember how long he lay there
1	her face was burning , and to conceal her agitation , she bent low to the table , as if she were nearsighted , pretending to read the newspaper
1	but how do you know ?
1	so you , however , do not consider them capable of receiving a person with the notion that he should die without fail and as soon as possible ?
1	he turned away his eyes , and walked past as though he noticed nothing
1	a minute later the door opened and in came , or , rather , heaved himself , a fat man in a green frock coat
1	well , brother arkashka , now i have learned all i needed to know
1	i was acquainted with these narrow little rooms , hardly filled with furniture , and yet with pretensions to a comfortable look ; here was the inevitable soft sofa from the flea market , which it was dangerous to move , the washstand , and the iron bed behind a screen
1	knight of such-and-such orders
1	they were coming from the setch with papers for the tsaritsa
1	otherwise it may be very , very bad for him , and not by my will ; is that so or not ?
1	the blow fell ; the mare staggered , sank back , tried to pull , but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log
1	the thought of today 's meeting with this woman suddenly brought a flush of shame to my face
1	nothing could be seen yet , only the hoofbeats could be heard coming closer and closer
1	the man whom he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by the shoulder ; he was a warder ; but nikolay pulled his arm away
1	it 's not exactly that she stammers , but she ca not speak plainly
1	this thought made me drop a book more than once
1	the triumphant englishman did not even bother to shake the dice ; he threw them on the table without looking , so sure he was of victory
1	i was two steps away from you , monsieur , replied the procureuse , but you did not notice me because you only had eyes for that beautiful lady to whom you just offered holy water
1	[ ] in africa a whole series of villainies is committed upon the all-but-unarmed inhabitants
1	it was very dark and empty in the passage , as though everything had been removed ; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight
1	and the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not
1	d'artagnan repeated , squeezing her hand still more strongly
1	strange , too , is their look : is it that the eager sea overflowed its shores in a storm , heaved up its shapeless waves in a whirl , and they , petrified , remained motionless in air ?
1	to the question of what he was doing when they arrested him , pierre answered somewhat tragically that he was carrying a child qu'il avait sauvé des flammes [ ] to her parents
1	how changed you are !
1	when i was making merry at his
1	prince n , evgeny pavlovich , prince shch , the girls—everybody broke off their conversation and listened
1	i want to judge myself and so i do
1	why , you yourself said you do not even wish to see her
1	just as if , along with the portrait , a burden had fallen from his soul
1	i myself confess with all my heart that , to this day , when everything has already passed , i absolutely do not know how or at what to ultimately evaluate this unfortunate man , who set us all such a problem
1	however , the chase was profitable to him in this sense , that as the sweat drenched his forehead , his heart cooled down
1	when the general 's steps died away , andrei khrisanfych looked through the mail and found a letter addressed to him
1	kovrin was glad and very adroitly started a conversation with yegor semyonych and tanya about something that would interest the monk ; the black visitor listened and nodded affably , and yegor semyonych and tanya also listened and smiled cheerfully , not suspecting that kovrin was not talking to them but to his hallucination
1	the german tutor tried to memorize all the kinds of dishes , desserts , and wines , in order to describe everything in detail in his letter to his family in germany , and was quite offended that the butler with the napkin-wrapped bottle bypassed him
1	let me worship you like this all my life i do not know , i do not remember—and suddenly she began sobbing and shaking ; a terrible fit of hysterics came
1	all that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria , and with his morbid exceptional vanity !
1	i just wanted it so much for verushka
1	yes , i am glum , i am continually closed , i often want to leave society
1	liv : third day of captivity felton had come , but there was one more step to be taken : he had to be kept , or rather , he had to stay on his own
1	only by following at a certain distance could they make shortcuts in the zigzag path the french took
1	pavel pavlovich even swayed ; he turned pale , but a sarcastic smile at once forced itself to his lips
1	as soon as they descended into the gully , the smoke of the cannon and musket fire on the flèches became so thick that it obscured the whole ascent up the other side of the gully
1	freedom , release from sonya
1	really , since that time ; i am not lying , sir !
1	aramis had no more reason to keep him away ; he let him come in
1	it will burn still better from the cold , all i have to do is take one birch log and there 's even no need to take a log : chapter nine simply sit on the wall , peel some bark off a birch log with my hand , and set fire to it with a match , set fire to it , and shove it between the logs—and there 's your fire
1	incidentally , there are actually an awful lot of people nowadays who , out of habit , still consider themselves the younger generation , because yesterday they still were , and they do not notice that they are already verbannte
1	thousands of voices roared
1	i have studied all this morbid psychology in my practice
1	no , not very , svidrigaïlov answered , calmly
1	you are right : i shall drink
1	the date of prince andrei 's return and marriage was approaching , and his request that she prepare their father for it had not only not been fulfilled , but the matter , on the contrary , seemed to have deteriorated completely , and any reminder of countess rostov put the old prince beside himself , and he was almost always in a bad mood as it was
1	i have always sympathized with you , andrei petrovich , and all of yours , and have been a friend of your house ; but , though the princes are strangers to me , by god , i feel sorry for them
1	this quite delighted the pockmarked one , and he sniggered maliciously
1	she asked , suddenly blushing
1	now i can have a look
1	ah , do as you like !
1	this is some sort of misunderstanding said andrei
1	formerly , going into action , rostov had been afraid ; now he did not feel the least fear
1	two times two will be four even without my will
1	i am oppressed by the peace and quiet , i am afraid to look in the windows , because there 's no more painful spectacle for me now than a happy family sitting around a table and drinking tea
1	i ’ ve been waiting especially for you , he added , significantly stressing the fact that he had been waiting
1	but that is simply because i do not respect myself
1	this one was dressed in a long frieze coat , dark blue trousers , and big , torn jackboots
1	posterity will have difficulty understanding this character , which history explains only by deeds and never by reasoning
1	he said to her in a whisper
1	good , good , the tartar muttered , shrinking from the chill
1	i had imagined how i would be noble , proud , and sad , maybe even in the company of prince v—sky , and thus would be introduced straight into that world—oh , i am not sparing myself , and so be it , so be it : it must be written down exactly in these details !
1	instead of solid rows of bees covering all the spaces between the combs and warming the brood , he sees the artful , complex workmanship of the combs , but no longer in the virginal form they used to have
1	wait a minute , i will fetch zossimov
1	denisov winced still more
1	i am sorry there wo not be any priests at it
1	yesterday 's apartment , the one with the little baby , is rented in my name now , and tatyana pavlovna pays ah , well , it makes no difference to me !
1	raskolnikov thought to himself
1	but how pale you are , to be sure and your hands are trembling too ?
1	raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile
1	why don ’ t you look around the rooms once more and in all the drawers !
1	and i repeat that you are wrong
1	please do , she said , she wanted them so much
1	i would not go saving a german or a chink , but i would go in after a christian
1	the wrath that shone in the musketeer 's eyes , despite the restraint he imposed on himself , frightened his sensitive lady love
1	then they sat and wept silently
1	they prepared everything ; pyotr stepanovich started painting , then suddenly he comes : no , he says , it 's impossible to paint it like that
1	he ’ s a bit simple , but he keeps his own counsel , in the most noble fashion , to be sure
1	the french had ensconced themselves there behind the wattle fence , in a garden densely overgrown with bushes , and were firing at the cossacks crowding in the gateway
1	i sprawled on the sofa and , looking at his back , thought long and about much
1	how did you dare ?
1	his situation was especially bad because he not only had to support himself , sonya , and his mother on his twelve-hundred-rouble salary , but had to support his mother in such a way that she did not notice they were poor
1	this artist was one of his former comrades , who from a young age had borne within himself a passion for art , and with the ardent spirit of a laborer had immersed himself in it with his whole soul , had torn himself away from friends , from family , from cherished habits , and rushed to where under beautiful skies a majestic hothouse of the arts was ripening—to that wonderful rome , at the name of which the ardent heart of an artist beats so deeply and strongly
1	as the owner of a spinning mill , having put his workers in their places , strolls about the establishment , watching out for an idle spindle or the odd one squealing much too loudly , and hastens to go and slow it down or start it up at the proper speed—so anna pavlovna strolled about her drawing room , going up to a circle that had fallen silent or was too talkative , and with one word or rearrangement set the conversation machine running evenly and properly again
1	and how did you know it was me ?
1	but you live in the most unfavorable circumstances : it 's crowded , dirty , nobody looks after you , there 's no money for treatment
1	the old ladies were glad of the presents he would be bringing , and above all that natasha would come to life again
1	allow me to talk it over
1	sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits , had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming , unwilling to talk and rude to her
1	with the awkwardness of a dignified man unused to dealing with women , modest alexeich touched her waist and patted her shoulder , while she thought about money , about her mother and her death
1	you never brought the knife to pavlovsk with you ?
1	there ends , at least for the present , the charge i had to fulfill regarding you ; the rest is another person 's concern
1	but at the time of pierre 's arrival , he was not there , and there was almost no one from his staff
1	the figure of pierre with the child in his arms was now even more noticeable than before , and several russian men and women gathered around him
1	there were still people in it , there was still a fiftieth part of all the former inhabitants left in it , but it was empty
1	i was once his guardian a very nice young man and advanced
1	he longed to forget himself altogether , to forget everything , and then to wake up and begin life anew
1	i turned to her with loathing ; i was no longer reasoning coldly
1	when the reading , which lasted more than an hour , was over , langeron again stopped the snuffbox and , without looking at weyrother or anyone in particular , began speaking about the difficulty of following such a disposition , in which the position of the enemy is assumed to be known , when that position may not be known to us , since the enemy is on the move
1	but it 's all terribly painful
1	where should i go ?
1	one ran each side
1	my suitcase had long been ready , i only had to pack several things into a bundle
1	he can still be saved
1	ganya prompted the faltering general
1	he felt utterly broken : darkness and confusion were in his soul
1	she would get tired at night and go to sleep , and he would wake up and start kissing her and making the sign of the cross over her while she slept
1	when the other one put a fist the size of a clerk 's head right to his mouth and said , just try shouting !
1	belikov fussed about nervously and quickly began to dress , with a look of horror on his face
1	i need to question
1	the two friends had been talking for a few moments when a servant of m de tréville 's came in carrying a sealed packet
1	so you are conscious , brother ?
1	it was my own doing , not leaving the country , and nearly a year ago marfa petrovna gave me back the document on my name‐day and made me a present of a considerable sum of money , too
1	said berg , glancing at natasha and smiling at her , as if trying to placate her , in response to her stubborn gaze 'russia is not in moscow , she is in the hearts of her sons !
1	it seemed that these puffs of smoke now raced along , now stood still , and past them raced woods , fields , and gleaming bayonets
1	it seemed they were ready to make merry all night long
1	the other one , in the woman 's coat , stood in front of the beautiful armenian girl and looked at her silently , fixedly , with his hands in his pockets
1	all our classmates liked him , except for me alone
1	they will think it 's an allusion to the queen mother !
1	ils l'ont passé sans coup férir
1	no , you don ’ t offer a lady your arm like that , don ’ t you know how to take a lady ’ s arm ?
1	[ ] and the whistling sounds of two tin canisters rang out one after the other
1	she almost shrieked , as earlier , and flung a wad of banknotes on the table
1	you must fulfil the demands of justice
1	and this visit of the sovereign to moscow triples the forces of the russian army
1	refused to see each other , broke all ties , though before they had been known as the most inseparable of friends !
1	but this head swayed helplessly from the uneven steps of the carriers , and the cold , indifferent gaze did not know where to rest
1	said anna pavlovna , closing her eyes and pointing to hélène with a sad gesture
1	prince vassily suddenly burbled something and left
1	but no , but no catch up with him !
1	i will take the dogcart you sometimes go hunting in
1	as you know , it all ended in smoke
1	the zaporozhtsy who passed through dikanka in the fall are staying here somewhere
1	i have no idea ; i wasn ’ t there ; it must be some kind of joke
1	though , incidentally , there was no reason for any of it , because the dozen or so clerks who constituted the entire administrative machinery of the office were properly filled with fear even without that ; seeing him from far off , they set their work aside and waited , standing at attention , until their superior passed through the room
1	i wanted to speak to them , but they started throwing stones at me
1	asked the astonished athos
1	when varya was gone , ganya took the note from the table , kissed it , clucked his tongue , and performed an entrechat
1	well , so my fact consists in this , that russian liberalism is not an attack on the existing order of things , but is an attack on the very essence of our things , on the things themselves and not merely on their order , not on russian order , but on russia itself
1	he began feeling his pulse
1	sonia sat down , looked about her— at lebeziatnikov , at the notes lying on the table and then again at pyotr petrovitch and her eyes remained riveted on him
1	the tragedy of liza 's death is the hidden heart of the story , hidden precisely by the ongoing duel of her two fathers
1	said dounia , approaching him
1	she goes on nervously
1	velchaninov began talking again , suddenly stopping in front of him—just as if suddenly struck by the thought
1	i realized that i had said too much
1	it must be supposed that she was seriously ill afterwards , because the next letter i received was from yalta , where , in all likelihood , the doctors had sent her
1	these women never fall before marriage : the law of their nature is that they must be married first
1	you think it ’ s praiseworthy , but it ’ s disgusting
1	there was not the slightest cause , no sort of ground it 's a lie , a lie !
1	we do not hope to make it !
1	i am purposely not leaving out the slightest stroke from all that petty nonsense , because every little stroke of it later went into the final bouquet , where it found its proper chapter nine place , as the reader will ascertain
1	one day after dinner avdotya romanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and with flashing eyes insisted on my leaving poor parasha alone
1	there was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him
1	i would hang all the brigands
1	the officer said vexedly and grasped the door as if intending to leave
1	ah , it 's you , d'artagnan , it 's you , athos !
1	from the landlady , indeed !
1	five minutes later lebeziatnikov came in with sonia
1	[ ] no one had read the manifesto yet , but everyone knew of its appearance
1	they came to the rue saint-honoré , and on the place du palais cardinal they found the dozen musketeers they had summoned pacing up and down while waiting for their comrades
1	i do not try to guess anything , madame
1	and i sometimes dreamed so much that i ’ d go out of my mind … and then this one would come : he ’ d stay for two months a year , dishonor me , offend me , inflame me , debauch me , leave me—a thousand times i wanted to drown myself in the pond , but i was base , i had no courage—well , but now … rogozhin , are you ready ?
1	but though i was wrathful , i still went completely at ease about my goal
1	and once you got frightened by a wolf , ran to me all trembling , and there was not any wolf
1	we will talk more with you later , landsman ; right now we are on our way to the tsaritsa
1	then he too went hurriedly out of the room
1	here it comes this one 's for us again !
1	the first category , generally speaking , are men conservative in temperament and law‐abiding ; they live under control and love to be controlled
1	he worried and tormented himself trying to remember , moaned , flew into a rage , or sank into awful , intolerable terror
1	yes , it wo not do without renovation , andrei yefimych said , after some reflection
1	and they really were eager to have a look at it in town
1	but in this very loathing for everything around him , pierre took a sort of irritating pleasure
1	no , it 's impossible for me to hand him a petition myself , it 's too bold !
1	i could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money , i assure you , without the faintest conscience‐prick , the student added with warmth
1	today , for instance , as you were presenting the bracelet—that you were at least a little bit younger
1	he wrote letters to his daughters and to mme de staël , read novels , enjoyed the society of beautiful women , joked with generals , officers , and soldiers , and never contradicted people who wanted to prove something to him
1	the french who had taken the battery fled
1	i understand that , and he 's a scoundrel who explains it by serfdom and lowliness alone !
1	[ ] i trust only in god and in the lofty destiny of our dear emperor
1	for one instant the thought floated through his mind shall i go back ?
1	but you would not believe what a special feeling i have for you after we have been parted
1	the woman who kept the tavern was in no way prepared to give him credit ; he had ukrainian tales waited in hopes some pious squire might come and treat him ; but , as if on purpose , all the squires stayed home like honest christians and ate kutya in the bosom of their families
1	and here was that object worth sixty kopecks
1	during the few minutes he had spent on the terrace with the epanchins , he had behaved modestly , with dignity , and had not been taken aback in the least by the determined glances of lizaveta prokofyevna , who had twice looked him up and down
1	that is , higher with regard to all conventions and even the very unpleasantnesses that may come of it
1	and to write this way is like raving or a cloud
1	and it was at this same moment that the quadrille began , the last one before supper , to which the medical student had hastened so
1	for that he kept several distant female relations around him : his own sister , ailing and shrewish ; his wife 's two sisters , also wicked and multiloquent ; and then his old aunt , who had broken a rib on some occasion
1	you should have left it to me , who do know , madame
1	i ought to have been in the army , upon my word i ought
1	the man has only illegitimate children
1	and then , beyond all that , this extreme method , which the king , as a good catholic , found in no way repugnant , always ran aground on this argument of the besieging generals : la rochelle is impregnable , except by starvation
1	can you imagine why he went to petersburg they are setting up
1	having told me the news , nikolai puts a solemn expression on his face , and we begin to talk business
1	she said , blushing all over
1	in the religious respect , napoleon gave orders to ramener les popes [ ] and resume church services
1	comment me prouverez-vous la vérité de ce que vous me dites ?
1	we called tchebarov , flung him ten roubles and got the i o u back from him , and here i have the honour of presenting it to you
1	his kind and honest eyes , with tears welling up in them , at that time when she herself , weeping , had spoken to him of her loss , would not leave her imagination
1	since then she had not seen boris once
1	i keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights
1	and will you love me ?
1	obviously you value your works highly
1	yes , i fell at her feet
1	for some reason he was feeling merrier and merrier
1	i was in seminary at that time , and the adventure seemed to me cruel for the king
1	how many did we crush ?
1	there was dignity , even a great deal of it , even quite unsuited to him ( so that , in truth , it was quite comical ) , but there was no anger
1	it was obvious that she was only passing through the room , from one door to the other , not thinking at all of finding anyone there
1	obviously , that dreadful storm cloud he had been calling up with all the powers of his soul and which at the same time aroused an involuntary terror in him—obviously , that storm cloud was approaching
1	there 's some horrible mystery behind all this
1	his wife wept in the corner , the baby began squealing again
1	to my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal cleverer , anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with drink , but you know , these foreigners are always so well behaved and serious look how she sits glaring !
1	on the contrary , it is
1	having crossed the krymsky ford , the prisoners moved on several steps , then stopped , then moved on again , and on all sides the people and vehicles grew more and more dense
1	palls of various prices ; there were even two catafalques : for a general , and for some lady
1	dmitri prokofitch was here , came to see me yesterday—i know , i know , i have a nasty , ironical temper , but what they made of it !
1	from the other side the battalion commander rode up
1	wo not you come in ?
1	( prince lev nikolaevich had not arrived yet )
1	the old men got together on village business , the muzhik replied , stepping away from him
1	he stood still , thought a moment , and a suffering smile came for a moment on to his lips
1	this way , this way
1	only a long time afterwards did he see clearly and become convinced of how seriously his affair with such an innocent and strange being as aglaya might have turned out
1	i drink tea and coffee with cream
1	and therefore they had to take turns , so that in every house she was expected before she arrived , and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it , even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people 's
1	do you really think i didn ’ t foresee all this hatred ?
1	i regret not having informed you of this circumstance earlier
1	the wagon was returning empty to paris , and in exchange for their transportation , the two lackeys had promised to quench the wagoner 's thirst on the way
1	let them say of each of you : he was in the great battle of moscow
1	after the battle of borodino , the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its burning , historians recognize as the most important episode of the war of the movement of the russian army from the ryazan to the kaluga road and towards the tarutino camp—the so-called flanking march beyond krasnaya pakhra
1	my guards shouted that they were sure of it
1	the gentleman approached the prince unhurriedly , with an affable smile , silently took his hand and , holding it in his own , peered into his face for some time , as if recognizing familiar features
1	yes , yes , pierre agreed
1	please , princess the prince dunyasha said in a faltering voice
1	but , to his surprise , the ringing of the bell also turned out to be a dream
1	his face seemed ugly and unpleasant to tanya
1	and then , we will never have the three hundred pistoles to give him , so we are just losing two hundred pistoles on the deal
1	do you think they would not ?
1	no , says the colonel 's wife , he 's frightened of something
1	he 's waiting for the queen to produce an heir to the crown of france
1	and what of it ?
1	he stood still before her
1	( note this : the revolver was familiar to her
1	the shoes alone , just think what that will add up to !
1	a commander in chief is never in those conditions of the beginning of some event , in which we always consider events
1	the peasant drivers , shouting at the horses and whipping them with knouts , kept running from one side to the other
1	under his feet he found the open razor lying on the rug ; he picked it up , closed it , put it in the razor case , forgotten that morning on the little table just next to the sofa on which pavel pavlovich had slept , and locked this case in his bureau with a key
1	what was that knocking , nadya ?
1	you know we ’ ve hardly said a word to each other for a whole month now
1	look : across the street , the lopukhins cleared everything out two days ago
1	katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears ; she prayed , too , now and then pulling straight the boy 's shirt , and managed to cover the girl 's bare shoulders with a kerchief , which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray
1	through the crack they were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs , at the level of the landlady 's door , and they could , as a fact , see from below that there was a light in raskolnikov 's garret
1	and i am on good terms with sofya semyonovna to this day , which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her
1	on entering the door of my petersburg novel , with all my disgraceful adventures in it , i find this preface necessary
1	the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and bore a coronet and a coat of arms at one of its corners
1	mirrors prepared by dunyasha since evening stood on natasha 's table
1	the prince wanted to say something , but he was so much at a loss that nothing came out , and , holding the coat , which he had picked up from the floor , he went towards the drawing room
1	a little window would be raised , and the lean arm of an old woman—they were the only ones to stay inside now with the grave fathers—would reach out with a sausage or a piece of pie
1	she enters my room in a petticoat , her hair not yet done , but already washed , smelling of flower cologne , and with the air of having come in by chance , and each time she says one and the same thing :
1	and this one 's distilled with peach stones ; here , take a glass , what a wonderful smell !
1	your goodness overwhelms me , monseigneur , replied d'artagnan , and i acknowledge a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me small as a worm ; but , finally , since your eminence permits me to speak frankly d'artagnan paused
1	tell me , how was she when you left ?
1	i went back to my window
1	he learns in the course of the novel that it is very difficult to judge something as complex , as many-storied , as another person , that what he — and we , too , of course — would have considered a moral failing may in fact be a higher kind of virtue
1	what , have you got a lot of money ?
1	she said nothing in reply to the medical student 's words , only her lips began to tremble
1	that 's a good thing , said the man , whom petya took for a hussar
1	to the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion , the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself
1	said franz , loading the trunk into the britzka with difficulty
1	lebedev picked up , coming back in wearing his tailcoat , blinking his eyes and pulling a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his tears
1	i , too , was in such a condition before i left for switzerland ; i , too , babbled incoherent words—you want to express yourself and can ’ t … i understand it ; i can sympathize very much , because i ’ m almost like that myself , i ’ m permitted to speak !
1	pierre , as one of the most honored guests , had to sit down to boston with ilya andreevich , the general , and the colonel
1	d'artagnan obeyed like a child , without resistance and without any objection , which showed that he really was in love
1	he crossed himself several times
1	nikolai , no longer racing , drove smoothly on the way back and , in that strange moonlight , kept peering at sonya , seeking , in that ever-changing light , behind the eyebrows and mustache , the former and the present sonya , from whom he had now resolved never to be parted
1	and he considered it necessary to be interested in it and questioned pierre about it
1	from words he let fall about his father and natasha , from the excitement with which pierre spoke of the dead man , and from the cautious , reverential tenderness with which natasha spoke of him , the boy , who was only beginning to suspect about love , put together the notion that his father had loved natasha and had bequeathed her , upon dying , to his friend
1	two months ago , after the return of the inheritance , i ran over to her to chat about versilov 's act , but i did not meet with the least sympathy ; on the contrary , she was awfully angry : it displeased her very much that it had all been returned , and not just half
1	the doctor treats his patients with water
1	it did not occur to him that he was in love with miss rostov ; he was not thinking of her ; he only pictured her to himself , and owing to that his whole life appeared to him in a new light
1	why did i say those words !
1	i dreamed that you might perhaps not want to say no to me in this
1	and you will know the happiness of forgiveness
1	meanwhile someone quickly lighted a candle , and they all beheld an unexpected sight
1	i do not remember much indeed
1	he 's the guilty one , mama , it 's he who is guilty of everything ; he never loved us
1	a third time he denied it
1	the pain started again , and marya bogdanovna advised prince andrei to leave the room
1	i will only mention that the main feature of their method consisted in finding out certain secrets of people , sometimes very honest and highly placed people ; then they went to these persons and threatened to reveal the documents ( which they sometimes did not have at all ) , and demanded a ransom to keep silent
1	i do not know if you are his wife , but you should know that this gentleman cuts out newspaper advertisements that governesses and teachers publish with their last money , and goes to these unfortunate women , looking for a dishonorable profit and getting them into trouble through money
1	sonia was silent a long while , as though she could not answer
1	above all , i found it strange that he not only had not smiled , but had not shown the smallest reaction in that sense , when i had told him directly earlier that i wanted to challenge him to a duel
1	anticipating a clear , long , happy day , kovrin remembered that it was still only the beginning of may and the whole summer still lay ahead , just as clear , long , and happy , and suddenly a joyful young feeling stirred in his breast , such as he had experienced in childhood running about in these gardens
1	know then that my wife was educated in a high‐class school for the daughters of noblemen , and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit
1	when they knew that for half an hour i belonged not to science , not to my students , but to them alone and no one else
1	if there had been just one person to whom he could talk , unburden his soul !
1	he made some ten leaps , not quickly , letting the dogs get closer to him , and finally , choosing his direction and realizing the danger , laid his ears back and dashed off as fast as his legs would carry him
1	the torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night
1	there was firmness , calm , and a lively readiness in the expression of his eyes , such as had never been there before
1	this young man is the count 's son , she added in a lower voice
1	the countess went to the icon room , and sonya found her there , kneeling before the few remaining icons that hung here and there on the wall
1	we have agreed that tonight will be a dinner for pleasure and not a word about business
1	ah , dear nadya , sasha began his usual after-dinner conversation , if only you would listen to me !
1	( i took it out of the drawer )
1	they say he beat her dreadfully
1	pyotr petrovitch , do be kind and go !
1	i do not know , my dear sir
1	she cried as she rushed to the cradle
1	let 's skip a page , maybe it will get better :
1	he had to work from morning till night , giving penny lessons , doing copying work , and still go hungry , because all his earnings went to support his mother
1	d'artagnan profited from the occasion to speak with m de tréville about the letter with the big red seal and the ducal arms
1	it was clear that this and so referred to many things they both understood without naming them
1	you were talking to her yesterday i should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that other fool , raskolnikov
1	though a delight in the absurd and a sharp eye for human folly remained central to his work , he was no longer merely a humorist
1	what could all that mean in comparison with the predestination of god , without whose will not one hair falls from man 's head
1	i told her all about me and about her
1	i would rather go to my friend , the explosive lieutenant ; how i shall surprise him , what a sensation i shall make !
1	well , he can ask as much interest as he likes , devil take it !
1	but i confess that after many attempts i even began to despair : we simply could not bump into each other – and that was that !
1	you saw him clearly ?
1	and it all happened as was said : to this day a wondrous knight stands on horseback in the carpathians , gazing on the dead men gnawing the dead man in the bottomless chasm , and he feels the dead man lying under the ground growing and gnawing his own bones in terrible torment and shaking all the earth terribly
1	pray when you eat
1	here he turned to one of the oarsmen , who knocked hot ashes from his pipe and transferred them to his master 's pipe
1	suffering , too , is a good thing
1	why , for his sake we would not shrink even from sonia 's fate
1	i was frowning deeply
1	no one had given tushin any orders about where to shoot or with what , and , having consulted his sergeant major zakharchenko , for whom he had great respect , he had decided that it would be good to set fire to the village
1	i have met some already
1	why , that 's a veritable fortune , my friend
1	xlii : the wine of anjou and he handed the note to his comrades
1	power is the sum total of wills transferred to one person
1	nothing could be found of his enormous wealth , either ; but seeing the slashed remains of lofty works of art whose worth went beyond millions , its terrible use became clear
1	when he was alone , he had not gone twenty paces before he sank , as usual , into deep thought
1	and he writes the famous order of the day to general bennigsen
1	i have lost two , but i still have this one , whom i am sure to keep for several days at least
1	well , then accept his proposal
1	what if they think that i shaved on purpose to ?
1	would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and sister ?
1	svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk , the wine had affected him for a moment , but it was passing off every minute
1	general ivolgin and prince myshkin !
1	for him there was no doubt that she was the victim of the cardinal 's vengeance , and , as we know , the cardinal 's vengeance was terrible
1	natasha was looking in the mirror , but did not see herself
1	he had a burning in his head ; he felt that he was losing blood , and he saw above him that distant , lofty , and eternal sky
1	he kissed the tips of his fingers
1	they rode to the opposite hill
1	it was i , he shouts ,
1	vain and indiscreet , he could be seen through like a crystal
1	what joy i will bring to the one whose wife i become !
1	the gloomy pines with their shaggy roots , which had seen him there last year so young , joyful and lively , now did not whisper but stood motionless , mute , as if they did not recognize him
1	tell me , why should i necessarily be noble , especially if it all lasts no more than a minute ?
1	pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart
1	aramis was mumbling some verses , and porthos tore a few hairs from his mustache now and then in a sign of despair
1	( ) what force produces the movement of peoples ?
1	the queen bowed as a sign of submission and followed the ladies who were to lead her to her dressing room
1	the most awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost , had almost done for himself on account of such a trivial circumstance
1	he 's not been here since yesterday he quarrelled with everyone on leaving in the rudest way
1	with his sighing , his whining , his dark glasses on his pale little face—you know , a little face , like a weasel's—he crushed us all , and we gave in , lowered petrov 's and yegorov 's marks for conduct , locked them up , and finally expelled them both
1	what sort of visitors ?
1	( it almost gave him pleasure to admit this )
1	he was about to mount his horse
1	he cried , looking at her like a half-wit , timid and suddenly taking heart to the point of insolence , here ’ s eighteen thousand !
1	are you telling the truth ?
1	how do i explain them ?
1	the prince asked suddenly
1	the young man did not dispute it and took the money
1	they have gone over to the pockmarked one now
1	his feelings towards versilov began to change , as it were
1	it was a big room , high , darkish , cluttered with all sorts of furniture—mostly big desks , bureaus , bookcases in which ledgers and papers were kept
1	listen : when i went then to the old woman 's i only went to try you may be sure of that !
1	she made haste to smile , afraid that he might not like the reproach
1	so that the post office has long since acquired the reputation of an institution one fears to visit
1	a certain darkening of the mind , sir
1	indeed , the door opened , and the mother superior came in
1	another time—this was a little earlier—i announced that professor perov had died
1	she cried , remember that i loved you !
1	thrice they killed me , thrice i rose from the dead
1	forgive me , i am not a wise man or a philosopher , ivan dmitrich went on irritably , and i understand nothing about it
1	far down the sidewalk i made out the black figures of passersby in the darkness ; i started running after them and , catching up with them , looked each one in the face as i ran past
1	i gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler 's for a rouble and a half
1	the quarrels began with her suddenly deciding to lend money in her own way , to appraise things above their value , and she even deigned a couple of times to enter into a dispute with me on the subject
1	so beautiful , so young !
1	walking outside the city gates one day , he positively fancied that they had fixed a meeting there , that he was waiting for svidrigaïlov
1	in poland he all but killed a jew , if you want to know
1	there were sounds of singing , of clarionet and violin , and the boom of a turkish drum
1	he suddenly embraced the prince
1	suddenly something strange happens to one of the cardplaying soldiers
1	she 's begging not to be brought out , velchaninov thought
1	he shouted , and then i retain my right to give my opinion as well
1	but no one is there
1	and the hope of relief and the show of compassion comfort him , while his mother rubs his bump
1	he talked about something only with lambert , and then almost in a whisper , and then it was almost only lambert who talked , while the pockmarked one just got off with fragmentary and angry ultimatums
1	i tell you , he didn ’ t want to …
1	whatever they say to me , however kind they are to me , still i ’ m always oppressed with them for some reason , and i ’ m terribly glad when i can go quickly to my comrades , and my comrades have always been children—not because i ’ m a child myself , but simply because i ’ m drawn to children
1	and he once more tugged at the door‐handle
1	the cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he began to shiver
1	there were no labor-loving artisans , and the peasants caught the commissaries , who ventured too far afield with this proclamation , and killed them
1	oh , i would recognize him just by the feather in his hat or the tip of his cloak !
1	no , on my honor and faith as a gentleman , i bought it myself , and out of my own pocket , replied the one who had just been called by the name of porthos
1	oh , it makes no difference to me !
1	he was obviously thinking of nothing at that moment but the fine figure he would cut as he marched past his superior
1	velchaninov flew into a rage , having already parted from the official and ascribing all his failure with him to the sudden appearance of this impudent fellow
1	because when i ’ m not home , i take the key with me , and nobody comes in for three or four days , even to tidy up , that ’ s how i set it up
1	he looked at the singing natasha and something new and happy occurred in his soul
1	later she told me : ' i asked the caretaker , she says , 'where apartment number such-and-such was
1	do not buy anything from that one !
1	suddenly he got up
1	misfortunes never come singly : vasya was summoned to the office to draw lots
1	will you eat it or not ?
1	he had visited moscow several times , had passed by not far from otradnoe , but had never once been to the rostovs '
1	and now , when he had already lost all hope , i suddenly come on my own , and in such madness—precisely the state he needed
1	i speak thus as a judge , and i know that i am guilty
1	several fantastic and extremely strange ideas that he uttered then have remained in my heart forever
1	here are the fruits of your work , i said to her , pointing to the old man
1	alpatych was not at home : he had gone to the authorities
1	one cup , repeated the judge
1	zhak and so on near all the buildings and then beyond the barracks and the gates

1	what do you want of me ?
1	they would gone to the estate outside moscow
1	but it was very dark in the room ; the petersburg white summer nights were beginning to turn darker , and if it had not been for the full moon , it would have been difficult to see anything in rogozhin ’ s dark rooms with the blinds drawn
1	napoleon himself , noticing her in the theater , asked who she was and praised her beauty
1	yes , i saw him and became convinced that he is afraid of a general battle more than anything in the world , dolgorukov repeated , obviously cherishing this overall conclusion which he had come to after his meeting with napoleon
1	well , here 's a chance , at least
1	let us not seek to penetrate what they contain of the mysterious , for how should we dare aspire , miserable sinners that we are , to initiate ourselves into the terrible and sacred secrets of providence , so long as we wear this fleshly husk , which raises an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal ?
1	the regimental commander said that the attack had been beaten off , coming up with this military term to describe what had happened in his regiment ; but in reality he did not know himself what had happened in that half hour among the troops entrusted to him , and he could not say for certain whether the attack had been beaten off or his regiment had been crushed by the attack

1	wincing vexedly at the efforts that had to be made in order to take off his kaftan and trousers , the prince undressed , lowered himself heavily onto the bed , and seemed to lapse into thought , looking contemptuously at his yellow , shriveled legs
1	what , you weren ’ t expecting parfyon rogozhin ?
1	institution of great national significance , because it is , so to speak , a step into a new era of the russian economy and russian industry

1	illness is nobody 's friend , i realize
1	she 's capable of anything
1	may i not serve as your maid ?

1	but those who knew him intimately could see that some great change had taken place in him that day
1	the student turned sharply to him , pulled some sort of grimace , and , bringing his face indecently close to his excellency 's , gave a loud cock-crow
1	he shouted , that 's no evidence
1	oh , it 's not for me , not for me , but for a poor old man , who alone loved you sincerely , who managed to become attached to you in his heart as to his own son , and who longs for you even to this day !

1	everywhere curses were heard on the enemy of the human race bonapartius ; militia and recruits were being gathered from the villages , and divergent news kept coming from the theater of the war , false as usual and therefore reinterpreted in various ways

1	of him still greater precautions were demanded—that he stand by the gazebo and turn his face fully toward the fence
1	ivanushka , sipping from the saucer , looked at the young men from under his brows with his sly feminine eyes
1	this visitor will cure her !
1	she jumped up , shouting with all her might , trembling : 'let me go , let me go !
1	pierre could no longer make himself turn away and close his eyes
1	varvara grumbled , walking off
1	then he walked to the front row and sat down next to dolokhov , nudging with his elbow in a friendly and casual way that same dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly
1	a single candle‐end lighted up the scene
1	why do you think so ill of me ?
1	the laughter increased around him ; the officer , who must have been a man who laughed easily , simply burst with laughter
1	who told you that ?
1	the insult was terrible , and , unknown though it was to the rest of the world , i felt it living and stirring in the bottom of my heart
1	i do not know
1	a disposition for bagration
1	with a swelling heart , with glittering eyes , pierre gazed into the mason 's face , listened to him , did not interrupt him , did not ask anything , and believed with his whole soul what this stranger was telling him
1	what did he mean by that ?
1	i am looking round
1	modern history has not done that
1	the uncle strapped up the hare , flipped it nimbly and deftly across his horse 's croup , as if reproaching them all by this flipping , and , mounting his chestnut with such a look as though he did not even want to speak with anyone , rode off

1	i knew that andronikov had already been transferred to petersburg , so i decided to find mme
1	the disorder of his mind , the terror that spurred him on , the shouts of some patrols that set off in pursuit of him , and the hoots of some passersby who , despite the late hour , were going about their business , only quickened his pace
1	i will make up for it by some good deed
1	right , right , he would say , looking over the enormous , opened-out table
1	as though that godless calumny was not enough—this vile creature attacks me !
1	would they have any supper tonight ?
1	felton waded into the water up to his waist , not wishing to entrust his precious cargo to anyone
1	i took comfort in that even then , and am of the same mind now
1	he began to pace the room rapidly , ruffling his hair , now sitting down on a chair , now jumping up and moving to the couch , constantly picturing himself receiving visitors , men and women , going up to a canvas and making dashing gestures over it with a brush , trying to impart graciousness to the movement of his arm
1	but you ’ re on a completely false track !
1	a sister-in-law is a sharp claw , but this one would not hurt a fly
1	mme coquenard , i gave you the preference
