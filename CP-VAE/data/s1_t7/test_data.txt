0	he had successfully managed to avoid meeting his landlady on the staircase .
0	his small room , more like a closet than an apartment , was tucked under the roof of a tall five-story building .
0	the landlady of the apartment , who rented him this room and provided both dinner and a servant , lived below in a separate apartment on the same staircase ; every time he left to go out , he had to pass the landlady ’ s kitchen door , which was almost always left open onto the landing .
0	every time the young man passed , he felt a painful and fearful sensation , one that he was ashamed of and that made him wince .
0	he was deeply in debt to the landlady and was afraid to face her .
0	it wasn ’ t that he was so fearful and cowed ; in fact , it was just the opposite ; but for some time he had been in an irritable and anxious state , similar to hypochondria .
0	he had become so absorbed in himself and so isolated from others that he was afraid of meeting anyone , not only his landlady .
0	he was crushed by poverty , but even his constrained circumstances had ceased to burden him of late .
0	he was not actually afraid of his landlady , no matter what she intended to do to him . but to stop on the staircase , put up with all sorts of nonsense about ordinary rubbish that didn ’ t concern him at all , her constant pestering about payment , her threats and complaints , and , in the face of it all , to have to dodge her , make excuses , tell lies—no thank you ; it was better to slip past somehow , like a cat on a staircase , and steal away unnoticed .
0	however , this time the fear of meeting his creditor surprised even him as he made his way out to the street .
0	what sort of feat am i about to attempt , yet at the same time i ’ m afraid of such nonsense !
0	everything lies in a man ’ s hands , and still he lets it slip by , solely out of cowardice . that ’ s an axiom .
0	it would be interesting to know what people fear the most .
0	most of all they fear taking a new step , uttering a new word of their own .
0	but i ’ m babbling too much .
0	it ’ s because i ’ m not doing anything that i ’ m babbling .
0	and it ’ s in the last month i ’ ve learned to prattle , lying for days and nights in my corner , thinking about .
0	well , why am i going out now ?
0	can i really be capable of doing that ?
0	no , it ’ s not serious at all .
0	so , i ’ m amusing myself for the sake of fantasy : games !
0	yes , that ’ s it , games ! it was stiflingly hot outside ; moreover , the stuffiness , the crush of people , lime plaster everywhere , scaffolding , bricks , dust , and that particular summer stench , so familiar to every petersburg resident lacking the means to rent a summer dacha—all this suddenly and offensively struck the young man ’ s already distraught nerves . the unbearable stench of cheap taverns , which were particularly numerous in this part of the city , and the drunkards encountered constantly , despite its being a weekday , completed the repulsive and grim scene .
0	for a moment , a feeling of the deepest loathing flashed across the young man ’ s delicate features .
0	incidentally , he was remarkably handsome , with splendid dark eyes and dark brown hair ; he was taller than average , slender , and well built .
0	but soon he seemed to slip into profound pensiveness , even , it would be more accurate to say , into a state of oblivion . he walked along not noticing his surroundings , not even wanting to take notice of them .
0	from time to time he merely muttered something to himself , from his penchant for monologues , which he immediately acknowledged to himself .
0	at that moment he himself was aware that at times his thoughts were confused and that he was feeling very weak : it was the second day he ’ d eaten hardly anything at all .
0	he was so poorly dressed that someone else , even someone used to seeing such , would be ashamed to appear on the street during the day wearing such ragged clothes .
0	however , the district was one where it was difficult to shock anyone with one ’ s apparel .
0	the proximity of the haymarket , the abundance of certain establishments , and , primarily , the population of tradesmen and craftsmen , all crowded into these streets and lanes of central petersburg , sometimes filled the general panorama with such subjects that it would be strange to be surprised at all on meeting another such figure . but so much malicious contempt had already accumulated in the young man ’ s soul that , in spite of all his own sometimes very immature squeamishness , when he was out on the street he was not in the least embarrassed by his tattered clothes . it was another matter altogether when he met some of his acquaintances or former comrades , whom , in general , he didn ’ t much like seeing .
0	however , when one drunkard , who for some unknown reason was being transported somewhere along the street in an enormous cart harnessed to a huge dray horse , suddenly shouted to him , in passing , hey , you , you german hatmaker ! and roared as loud as he could , pointing his finger at him—the young man suddenly stopped and violently grabbed his own hat . it was a tall , round top hat bought at zimmerman ’ s shop , but already worn out , and now of a completely faded reddish-brown color , with many holes and stains , lacking a brim , and leaning to one side at a most unattractive angle .
0	however , it was not shame that seized him but a completely different feeling , more resembling fear .
0	he muttered in confusion .
0	that ’ s exactly what i thought !
0	details , details are the main thing !
0	at the time he himself still didn ’ t believe in his dreams and was merely irritating himself with their repugnant , though seductive audacity .
0	now , however , a month later , he ’ d begun to regard them in a different light , and in spite of all his mocking monologues about his own powerlessness and indecisiveness , he ’ d grown accustomed , even against his will , to considering this repulsive dream something of a feat , although he still didn ’ t believe in it himself .
0	if i ’ m so afraid now , what would happen if i somehow managed to commit the actual deed ?
0	it must have been that the young man glanced at her with some special sort of look , because her former distrust suddenly flashed in her eyes again .
0	i was here about a month ago , the young man hastened to mumble with a slight bow , recalling that he should be more courteous .
0	but there was nothing special in there .
0	what do you want ?
0	the month ended two days ago .
0	the young man took it and was so angry that he was just about to leave ; but then he reconsidered , remembering that he had nowhere else to go , and that he ’ d come for a different reason .
0	and there ’ s one key that ’ s bigger than all the others , three times bigger , with a notched tip ; it ’ s not for the dresser , of course .
0	he looked at the old woman and was in no rush to leave , just as if he wanted to say or do something else , but it seemed as if he himself didn ’ t know precisely what .
0	the feeling of infinite revulsion that had begun to oppress and torment his heart as he ’ d been coming to see the old woman had now reached such proportions and was so palpable that he didn ’ t know where to hide from his anguish .
0	in spite of this contemptuous disdain , he seemed cheerful already , as if suddenly liberated from some terrible burden , and he cast his eyes amicably over those present .
0	there sat : one fellow who looked like a tradesman , drunk , but not too , nursing his beer ; his large , fat pal , wearing a short jacket , sporting a gray beard , very intoxicated , dozing on the bench ; from time to time this fellow would suddenly , as if half asleep , start snapping his fingers , fling his arms out wide , and jerk the top half of his body around without getting up from the bench , meanwhile warbling some nonsense as he tried to recall a few lines , something like :
0	he was so exhausted from his whole month of concentrated melancholy and gloomy agitation that he felt like taking a breath in another world , wherever it was , and in spite of the filth of his surroundings , he now remained in the tavern with pleasure .
0	even though you don ’ t appear to be a person of consequence , my experience tells me that you ’ re an educated man and not accustomed to drink .
0	dear sir , a month ago a certain mr. lebezyatnikov gave my wife a beating ; but my wife is not like me !
0	and it was true that here and there some small strands of hay were sticking to his clothes and even to his hair .
0	his hands were especially grimy , greasy , and reddish , and his fingernails were black .
0	his conversation seemed to arouse general , though listless attention .
0	the boys behind the counter started giggling .
0	in some drunkards this habit becomes a necessity , primarily among those who receive harsh treatment at home and who are ordered about .
0	why don ’ t i serve , my dear sir ?
0	don ’ t you think my heart aches over the fact that i grovel to no avail ?
0	but what do you mean without hope ?
0	i mean completely hopelessly , knowing in advance that nothing will come of it .
0	for example , you know beforehand , absolutely , that this most well-intentioned and most useful citizen won ’ t give you money under any circumstances because why , i ask , why should he ?
0	after all , he knows i won ’ t pay it back .
0	but mr. lebezyatnikov , who ’ s a follower of the latest ideas , was explaining to me just the other day that in our era compassion has even been prohibited by science and that this is already being done in england , where they ’ ve developed political economy . why then , i ask , should he give me anything ?
0	yet , knowing beforehand that he won ’ t , you still set off on your way and . why do you set off ?
0	what if there ’ s no one else to see , nowhere else to go ?
0	everyone has to have somewhere to go .
0	because there comes a time when it ’ s absolutely essential to go somewhere .
0	when my only daughter went out for the first time with a streetwalker ’ s yellow ticket , † then i went out , too . ( my daughter makes her living by streetwalking , sir . ) , he added in parentheses , regarding the young man with some anxiety .
0	he hastened to declare immediately , even with apparent calm , when the two lads standing at the bar chuckled and the tavern keeper smiled . i don ’ t take offense at their heads nodding , because everyone knows everything already ; nothing ’ s secret , that shall not be made manifest ; i regard all this not with contempt , but with humility .
0	‡ allow me , young man , can you . but no , it should be explained more powerfully and imaginatively : looking at me at this very moment , it ’ s not a matter of can you , rather it ’ s dare you state positively that i am not a swine ?
0	well , sir , the speaker continued steadfastly , even with a reinforced sense of self-respect , having paused to let another outburst of laughter in the room die down .
0	well , sir , i may be a swine , but she is a lady !
0	i am made in the image of a beast , but my wife , katerina ivanovna , is an educated person , born the daughter of a field officer .
0	i may be a scoundrel , but she ’ s been raised with a noble heart and brought up with magnanimous feelings .
0	oh , if only she pitied me !
0	my dear , dear sir , every man needs to have at least one place where he ’ s pitied !
0	and while katerina ivanovna is a generous woman , she ’ s unjust . while i myself understand that when she pulls tufts of my hair , she ’ s doing so from a feeling of pity in her heart ( for , i repeat without embarrassment , she does pull tufts of my hair , young man ) , he confirmed in a dignified tone after hearing laughter once again , but , my god , what if even once she .
0	for more than once have i got what i wanted , more than once have i been pitied , but . but such is my nature , i ’ m a born beast ! that ’ s for sure !
0	marmeladov resolutely banged his fist on the table .
0	such is my nature !
0	do you know , sir , do you know , that i even pawned her stockings ?
0	not her shoes , sir , since that would have resembled the normal course of events , but her stockings , i pawned her stockings , sir !
0	i also hocked her mohair shawl , a gift , an earlier one , her own , not from me . we live in a chilly corner , and this past winter she caught a cold and began coughing , even spitting up blood .
0	we have three small children , and katerina ivanovna works from morning to night , scrubbing and washing and bathing the children , since she ’ s used to cleanliness from early childhood , but she has a weak chest and is predisposed to consumption—that i feel . how can i not feel it ?
0	and the more i drink , the more i feel it .
0	that ’ s why i drink , because i ’ m seeking compassion and feeling in this drinking . it ’ s not joy i seek , only sorrow . i drink because i genuinely want to suffer !
0	and then , as if in despair , he rested his head on the table .
0	young man , he continued , raising his head again , i can read some sorrow in your face .
0	i saw it when you entered , and that ’ s why i turned to you right away . in telling you the story of my life , i don ’ t wish to parade my disgrace before these idlers here , who know it all already ; i ’ m seeking a sensitive , educated man .
0	do you know that my wife was educated in a provincial school for children of the nobility , and at the award ceremony she was chosen to perform the shawl dance§ in the presence of the governor and other distinguished guests , for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit ?
0	well , we sold that medal . a long time ago . the certificate ’ s still in her trunk , and she recently showed it to our landlady .
0	even though she has endless quarrels with the landlady , she wanted to show off to someone and tell her about those happy days in the past .
0	i don ’ t condemn her , i don ’ t , because these things are preserved in her memory , and all the rest has turned to dust !
0	yes , yes ; she ’ s a hot-tempered woman , proud and obstinate .
0	she washes the floor herself and has only black bread to eat , but she won ’ t tolerate any disrespect .
0	that ’ s why she wouldn ’ t tolerate mr. lebezyatnikov ’ s rudeness , and when he gave her a beating , she took to her bed more as a result of her feeling than from the actual blows .
0	she was already a widow when i married her , with three children , each smaller than the other .
0	her first husband was a cavalry officer , and she married him for love and ran away from her parents ’ house with him .
0	she loved her husband dearly , but he took to gambling , ended up in court , and soon died .
0	he ’ d begun beating her toward the end ; although she didn ’ t let him get away with it , about which i have detailed documentary evidence ; she weeps to this day when she remembers him and reproaches me . i ’ m glad , very glad that even in her imagination she can see herself as being happy for a while . after his death she was left with three young children in a distant and dreadful provincial town , where i was also staying at the time ; she was living in such hopeless poverty—even though i ’ ve had many different experiences , i can ’ t even begin to describe her situation .
0	her family refused to help her . besides , she was proud , extremely proud . and then , my dear sir , then , being a widower myself , and having a fourteen-year-old daughter , i proposed to her because i couldn ’ t bear to see such suffering .
0	you can judge for yourself the degree of her misfortune , that she , an educated and well-brought-up woman from an eminent family , agreed to marry the likes of me !
0	weeping and wailing , wringing her hands , she did !
0	because she had nowhere else to go .
0	do you understand , do you really understand , dear sir , what it means when a person has nowhere else to go ?
0	you don ’ t understand it yet . for one whole year i fulfilled my obligation devotedly and devoutly and never touched the bottle—he pointed to the bottle—because i do have feelings .
0	but even then i couldn ’ t please her , even with that ; it was afterward , when i lost my job , which wasn ’ t my fault , but it happened because of changes in the department that i turned to drink !
0	it ’ s already been about half a year , after our wanderings and numerous misfortunes , since we finally turned up in this splendid capital with all of its many monuments . and i found a job here . i found one and then i lost it .
0	this time it was my own fault , because i had reached the end of my rope . now we live in a little corner , at our landlady ’ s , amaliya fedorovna lippevekhsel , but i don ’ t know how we manage to live and pay her .
0	many others live there besides us .
0	it ’ s sodom , sir , of the most hideous kind . meanwhile my daughter from my first marriage has grown up ; i won ’ t describe what she had to suffer while growing up , my daughter , from her stepmother . because although katerina ivanovna is filled with kindly feelings , she ’ s a hot-tempered and irritable lady , and she can snap .
0	there ’ s no reason to recall it !
0	as you can well imagine , sonya received no education . about four years ago , i tried to read some geography and world history with her ; but since i myself was weak in those areas and we had no suitable textbooks , and the books we did have . well , we don ’ t even have those books now , all our reading ended then and there .
0	we stopped at the persian king cyrus the great.¶ then , once she was older , she read some books of romantic content as well as several others , given to her by mr. lebezyatnikov . one was lewes ’ s physiology. # do you happen to know it , sir ? she read it with great interest and even read some passages aloud to us : and that was her entire education .
0	now i ’ m turning to you , my dear sir , on my own behalf , with a confidential question of my own : in your opinion , can a poor but honest girl earn a living by honest work ?
0	she can ’ t earn even fifteen kopecks a day , sir , if she ’ s honest , since she possesses no special skills , and that ’ s even if she works all the time ! besides , the state councillor ivan ivanovich klopshtok—have you ever heard of him ? not only hasn ’ t he paid her yet for the half dozen fine cotton shirts she made him , but he even drove her out with insults , stamping his feet and calling her names , claiming that the collars were the wrong size and had been sewn in crooked .
0	and then katerina ivanovna , wringing her hands , paces the room , her face flushed with the red blotches that always accompany that illness : you live here with us , she says , like a sponger ; you eat and drink and enjoy the warmth , but what ’ s there to eat and drink when these little ones haven ’ t seen a crust of bread for three days ? i was lying there at the time . why not say it ?
0	i was a little drunk , sir , and i heard my sonya ( she ’ s very meek and has such a soft voice . she ’ s fair-haired and her face is always so pale and thin ) , say : oh , katerina ivanovna , must i really go out and do that ? meanwhile , darya frantsevna , a malevolent woman well known to the police , had reported her to the landlady several times .
0	replied katerina ivanovna , with a mocking laugh , what are you saving yourself for ?
0	but don ’ t blame her , don ’ t , dear sir , don ’ t blame her ! she wasn ’ t in her right mind when she said it ; she was agitated , sick , and the children were crying because they hadn ’ t eaten , and she said it more as an insult than as what she really meant . because katerina ivanovna is the sort of person who , as soon as the children begin crying , even when they ’ re hungry , begins to beat them right away .
0	and then i saw how sonechka , around six o ’ clock , got up , put on a kerchief , her hooded cloak , and left the apartment ; she came back at nine . she walked in and went straight up to katerina ivanovna and silently put thirty silver rubles down on the table in front of her .
0	she didn ’ t utter one word as she did , didn ’ t even look at her , but merely picked up our large green shawl ( we have one that we use ) , covered her head and face completely , and lay down on the bed , facing the wall , but her whole body and her little shoulders were trembling . meanwhile , sir , i lay there , in the same condition as before . and then i saw , young man , i saw how katerina ivanovna , also without saying a word , went up to sonechka ’ s bed and knelt there all evening , kissing her feet ; she was unable to stand , and then , embracing , they both fell asleep together .
0	then he suddenly filled his glass , drank it down quickly , and grunted . since then , sir , he continued after a brief pause , since then , as a result of one unfortunate incident and the fact that some ill-intentioned people informed the authorities , which darya frantsevna had encouraged because she felt as if she hadn ’ t been treated with appropriate respect , since then my daughter , sofiya semyonovna , was compelled to obtain the yellow card of a prostitute , and as a result has no longer been able to reside with us . it was the landlady , amaliya fedorovna , who wouldn ’ t allow it ( darya frantsevna had previously encouraged her in this ) , as well as mr. lebezyatnikov .
0	at first he himself tried to have his way with her , and then he suddenly became very touchy : how can i , such a cultured person , he says , continue to live in the same apartment with a person like her ?
0	katerina ivanovna wouldn ’ t tolerate it and got involved .
0	and now sonechka stops by mostly after dark , comforts katerina ivanovna , and leaves whatever money she can .
0	she lives in the apartment of the tailor kapernaumov , renting a room from them ; he ’ s lame and afflicted with a speech defect and his entire large family has the same defect .
0	his wife has it , too .
0	one morning i ’ d just woken up , sir , put on my ragged clothes , raised my hands to heaven , and set off to see his excellency , ivan afanasevich .
0	do you happen to know his excellency , ivan afanasevich ?
0	then you don ’ t know such a virtuous man !
0	wax before the face of the lord ; he melts like wax !
0	well , marmeladov , he says , you ’ ve disappointed my expectations once before . i ’ ll take you on again as my own responsibility , that ’ s what he said . remember this , he said , and now go away !
0	i kissed the dust at his feet , mentally , because he wouldn ’ t have allowed it , being a person of such high rank and modern ideas about public service ; i returned home , and when i announced that i ’ d been reinstated in my job and would be receiving a salary , lord , what a commotion it caused !
0	marmeladov paused again , overcome with strong emotion . just then a whole group of men entered from outside , already quite drunk , with the sound of a rented accordion and the soft , cracked voice of a seven-year-old child singing the little farm .
0	the tavern keeper and the waiters attended to the new arrivals . marmeladov , who didn ’ t pay any attention to these people , continued his story .
0	he already seemed very weak , but the more intoxicated he grew , the more talkative he became .
0	his recollections of his recent successes at work seemed to invigorate him , and some were even reflected in his face by a sort of radiance . this took place , good sir , about five weeks ago .
0	they ’ d both just found out , katerina ivanovna and sonechka , good lord , and it was as if i ’ d been admitted to the heavenly kingdom . it used to be that i ’ d lie around like a beast , and receive only abuse !
0	but that day : they walked around on tiptoe and kept the children quiet : semyon zakharych is tired from his work ; he ’ s resting : shh !
0	they ’ d serve me coffee before i went off to work , and they ’ d even heat up some cream ! they began to buy real cream , do you hear ? i have no idea how they scraped the money together to provide me with a decent uniform , eleven rubles and fifty kopecks .
0	boots , the finest calico shirtfronts , and a uniform : they threw it all together splendidly for eleven and a half rubles .
0	the first day , i arrived home from work in the morning and saw that katerina ivanovna had prepared two courses , soup and salted beef with horseradish , something we ’ d never even dreamt of before .
0	that is , none at all , sir , and now she looked as if she were going out visiting ; she was all dressed up ; it wasn ’ t as if she had anything to use , she did it all from nothing ; her hair was done up , she had a clean white collar and sleeve covers ; she looked like a completely different person , much younger and prettier . sonechka , my little sweetheart , had merely provided the money , while for the time being , she said , she thought it wouldn ’ t be proper for her to visit us too often , except after dark , so no one would see her .
0	you hear , do you hear ?
0	you hear , do you hear ?
0	of course , he says to him , i remember your service , semyon zakharych , and although you displayed a fondness for that trivial frailty , now , since you ’ ve made a promise , and besides , without you things had started to go badly .
0	( you hear , do you hear ? )
0	i hope , he says , now on your word of honor , —that is , all of it , i tell you , she made up the whole story , not as a result of thoughtlessness , sir , but so she could boast a bit !
0	when , six days later , i brought my first wages home—twenty-three rubles and forty kopecks—when i brought it all home , she called me a sweetie : you ’ re such a sweetie , she said ! we were all alone , sir , do you understand ? well , it ’ s not for my looks , and besides , what sort of husband am i ?
0	no , she pinched my cheek : you ’ re such a sweetie !
0	marmeladov paused , was about to smile , but suddenly his chin began to quiver , though he restrained himself .
0	this tavern , his debauched appearance , his five nights on a hay barge , his bottle , and , at the same time , this painful love for his wife and family disconcerted his listener . raskolnikov attended intensely , but with painful emotion .
0	marmeladov exclaimed after recovering . oh , sir , you may find all this amusing , as do the others , since i ’ m only upsetting you with the foolishness of all these petty details of my domestic life , but i don ’ t find it amusing in the least !
0	that ’ s because i can feel it all . i spent the rest of that entire heavenly day of my life and all that evening in fleeting dreams : that is , how i ’ d arrange everything , outfit the children , provide peace of mind to my wife , and return my only begotten daughter to the bosom of the family from her disgrace . and more , much more .
0	well , sir , my good sir—marmeladov suddenly seemed to shudder , raise his head , and stare at his listener—well , sir , the next day , after all these daydreams , that is , exactly five days ago , toward evening , by clever stealth , like a thief in the night , i stole the key from katerina ivanovna ’ s box , took out what was left of the money i ’ d brought home , i don ’ t recall how much it was , and now , look at me , all of you !
0	i ’ ve been away from home five days ; they ’ re looking for me , it ’ s the end of my job , and my uniform is left in some tavern near the egyptian bridge ; i traded it for these clothes . and it ’ s the end of everything !
0	marmeladov struck his fist on his forehead , clenched his teeth , closed his eyes , and placed his elbow firmly on the table .
0	but in a moment his face suddenly changed ; he glanced at raskolnikov with some sort of assumed cunning and feigned insolence , started laughing , and said : i visited sonya today . i went to ask her for some money to buy a drink so i could get rid of my hangover !
0	someone who ’ d just come in cried , then burst out laughing .
0	this bottle was bought with her money , sir , marmeladov uttered , addressing raskolnikov exclusively .
0	she gave me thirty kopecks , with her own hands , her last coins , all there was , i could see for myself . she didn ’ t say a word , merely looked at me in silence . that doesn ’ t happen here on earth , but up there .
0	they grieve over people , they weep , but they do not reproach them , they don ’ t !
0	but she needs them herself now , doesn ’ t she ?
0	what do you think , my dear sir ?
0	now she has to keep herself clean .
0	this extra cleanliness costs money , do you understand ?
0	well , she also has to buy makeup , doesn ’ t she ? starched petticoats , the kind of stylish shoes that display her little feet when she has to step over a puddle . do you understand , do you , sir , what this cleanliness means ?
0	well , sir , i , her own father , took those thirty kopecks to ease my hangover ! and i ’ m drinking , sir !
0	well , who would feel sorry for the likes of me ?
0	do you feel sorry for me now , sir , or not ?
0	tell me , sir , do you feel sorry or not ?
0	he wanted to refill his glass , but there was nothing left .
0	the bottle was empty .
0	why should anyone feel sorry for you ?
0	there was a burst of laughter and even some cursing .
0	the listeners laughed and cursed , and even those who weren ’ t listening joined in , simply looking at the sorry sight of the former civil servant . why feel sorry for me ?
0	marmeladov cried suddenly , standing up , his arm outstretched , now genuinely inspired , as if he ’ d been waiting for those words .
0	no , there ’ s no reason to feel sorry for me !
0	i should be crucified , nailed to a cross , not pitied .
0	but crucify me , oh judge , crucify me , and after having crucified me , then feel sorry for me !
0	i myself will come and ask to be crucified , for it ’ s not joy i seek , but sorrow and tears !
0	do you think , oh , shopkeeper , that your bottle has afforded me any pleasure ?
0	sorrow , sorrow is what i sought in its depths , sorrow and tears , and i found them and tasted of them ; but he who has pitied all men and who has understood everyone and everything , he will take pity on us ; he and no one else ; he is the judge .
0	he will come on that day and he will ask : where is thy daughter who sacrificed herself for her wicked and consumptive stepmother and for a stranger ’ s little children ?
0	where is thy daughter who pitied her earthly father , a useless drunkard , and who was not dismayed by his beastliness ? and he will say : come forth !
0	thy many sins are now also forgiven , for thou hast loved much . and he will forgive my sonya , he will ; i know that he will forgive her . just a little while ago when i was with her , i felt this in my heart !
0	and he will judge and forgive everyone , both the good and the evil , the wise men and the humble . and when he has finished with everyone , then he will summon us , too : come forth , he will say , even ye ! come forth , ye drunkards , come forth , ye weaklings , come forth , ye shameless ones !
0	and we will all come forth , without shame , and we will stand before him .
0	ye are made in the image of the beast and ye bear his mark ; but ye also shall come forth !
0	and the wise men and the learned men will exclaim , lord !
0	wherefore do you receive these people ? and he will say , i receive them , oh , ye wise men , i receive them , oh , ye learned men , because not one of them hath ever considered himself worthy .
0	and he will stretch forth his arms to us , and we will kiss his hands . and we will weep . and we will understand all things !
0	then will we understand all things !
0	and everyone will understand . she , too , will understand . oh , lord , thy kingdom come !
0	deep in thought , he sank down on the bench , weak and exhausted , looking at no one , oblivious of his surroundings .
0	his words made quite an impression ; silence reigned for a moment , but soon the previous laughter and curses resumed .
0	and so on and so forth .
0	let ’ s go , sir , marmeladov said suddenly , raising his head and turning to raskolnikov .
0	to kozel ’ s house , in the courtyard .
0	raskolnikov had been wanting to leave for some time ; he himself had even thought about helping the other man get home .
0	marme­ladov ’ s legs were much weaker than his words , and he leaned heavily on the young man .
0	they had only about two or three hundred paces to walk .
0	the closer they got to his house , the more and more the drunken man was overcome by embarrassment and fear .
0	i ’ m not afraid of katerina ivanovna now , he muttered in agitation . it ’ s not that she ’ ll begin tearing out my hair .
0	what do i care about my hair ?
0	that ’ s what i say !
0	i ’ m also afraid of the red blotches on her cheeks .
0	i ’ m also afraid of the children ’ s crying .
0	i just don ’ t ! but i ’ m not afraid of a beating . you should know , sir , not only are such beatings not painful , i even enjoy them .
0	for i myself couldn ’ t do without them . it ’ s better that way . let her beat me ; it relieves her soul .
0	he ’ s a locksmith , a german , he ’ s rich .
0	they entered from the courtyard and went up to the fourth floor .
0	the farther they climbed , the darker the stairs became .
0	it was almost eleven o ’ clock , and even though at that time of year there ’ s no real night in petersburg , it was very dark at the top of the stairs .
0	the small sooty door at the end of the stairway , at the very top , was open . a candle stub lit the poorest of rooms , only ten paces long ; it was entirely visible from the hallway .
0	everything was thrown about and in disarray , especially the children ’ s clothing . a bedsheet with holes in it had been hung across the back corner . behind it , most likely , stood a bed .
0	there were only two chairs in the room itself and a very tattered oilcloth sofa , in front of which stood an old kitchen table made of pine , unpainted and uncovered .
0	at the edge of the table was a partially burned tallow candle stub in an iron candlestick .
0	it turned out that marmeladov lived in a separate room , not in that corner ; his room was one through which people had to pass . the door to the farthest rooms or cells , into which amaliya lippevekhsel ’ s apartment had been divided , stood slightly ajar . there was a great deal of noise and shouting .
0	it seemed that people were playing cards and having tea .
0	raskolnikov recognized katerina ivanovna immediately .
0	she was a terribly emaciated woman , thin , rather tall and elegant , with lovely dark brown hair still , and real red blotches on her cheeks .
0	she paced back and forth in her little room , arms folded across her chest , lips parched , gasping unevenly for breath . her eyes were shining as if she had a fever , but her glance was sharp and steady , and her consumptive and agitated face made a morbid impression in the last light of the flickering candle end quivering on her face .
0	she seemed to raskolnikov to be about thirty years old and was certainly no match for marmeladov . she didn ’ t hear and didn ’ t see the men entering ; she seemed to be in some sort of stupor in which she neither saw nor heard anything .
0	it was stuffy in the room , but she hadn ’ t opened the window ; there was a stench emanating from the staircase , but the door stood open ; waves of tobacco smoke wafted in from the inner rooms through the open door ; she was coughing but hadn ’ t closed the door .
0	the youngest girl , around six years old , was asleep on the floor , sitting up somehow , hunched over , her head resting on the sofa . the little boy , a year older than her , was trembling in the corner and crying . he ’ d probably just been beaten .
0	the eldest daughter , around nine years old , was as tall and slim as a matchstick , wearing only a wretched , very tattered blouse , and draped over her bare shoulders a decrepit cotton shawl that had probably been made for her about two years ago , because now it didn ’ t even reach her knees ; she stood in the corner next to her younger brother , embracing his neck with one long arm , desiccated as a matchstick .
0	she seemed to be comforting him , whispering something to him , doing all she could so he wouldn ’ t start whimpering again , while at the same time she followed her mother with her very , very large dark eyes , which seemed even larger on her emaciated and frightened little face .
0	the woman , noticing a stranger , paused distractedly in front of him ; having returned to her senses momentarily , she seemed to be wondering why he ’ d come in . but most likely she imagined that he was heading into the other rooms , since theirs served as the passageway . realizing this and not paying any more attention , she went to the hall door to close it ; then , catching sight of her husband kneeling on the threshold , she suddenly screamed .
0	she cried in a rage .
0	where ’ s the money ?
0	what ’ s left in your pocket ?
0	where are your clothes ?
0	where ’ s the money ?
0	marmeladov obediently and calmly raised both his arms to the sides to make it easier to search his pockets .
0	there wasn ’ t a kopeck left .
0	where ’ s the money ?
0	oh , lord , did he really spend it all on drink ?
0	there were twelve silver rubles left in the box !
0	suddenly , in a rage , she grabbed hold of his hair and dragged him into the room .
0	marmeladov himself made it easier for her , crawling on his knees meekly behind her .
0	even this gives me enjoyment ! even this isn ’ t painful , but en-joy-ab-le , my dear-est kind sir , he cried , being shaken by his hair and even bumping his forehead once on the floor .
0	the child who was asleep on the floor woke up and began crying .
0	the little boy in the corner couldn ’ t restrain himself , began shaking , burst into tears , and , in a terrible fright , almost a fit , rushed to his sister .
0	the older girl , half awake , trembled like a leaf .
0	all of it , he drank it all up !
0	the poor woman shouted in despair . and those aren ’ t his clothes !
0	they ’ re hungry , hungry ! ( wringing her hands , she pointed to the children . )
0	and you , aren ’ t you ashamed ?
0	were you drinking with him ?
0	were you drinking with him , too ?
0	the young man hastened to leave without saying a word .
0	besides , the interior door swung open , and several curious onlookers peeked in . impudent people in skullcaps were stretching their heads forward , laughing and smoking cigarettes or pipes . there were people wearing bathrobes , some left completely unfastened , or wearing almost indecent summer clothes ; others held cards in their hands .
0	they laughed especially heartily when marmeladov , being dragged by his hair , cried that he found it enjoyable .
0	they even began coming into the room ; at last one could hear a sinister screech : it was amaliya lippevekhsel forcing her way through to impose a sort of order and to frighten the poor woman for the hundredth time with her insulting command to vacate the apartment by the following day .
0	as he left , raskolnikov managed to shove his hand into his pocket , grab the change left from the ruble he ’ d cashed at the tavern , and place it on the windowsill unobserved . then , once on the staircase , he reconsidered and wanted to return . what a foolish thing i just did , he thought .
0	they have sonya , and i need the money myself . but after some thought , he realized that it was already impossible to take it back and he wouldn ’ t do it , anyway ; he gave up and returned to his own apartment . sonya also has to buy makeup , he went on , grinning sarcastically as he walked along the street .
0	but maybe sonechka won ’ t make any money today , because there ’ s always risk involved , hunting for valuable game , prospecting for gold .
0	what a gold mine they ’ ve discovered !
0	and they mine it !
0	and they ’ ve gotten used to it .
0	man ’ s a scoundrel : he can get used to anything ! but what if i ’ m wrong ? he suddenly cried inadvertently .
0	what if man ’ s really not a scoundrel , in general—that is , the whole human race ; that would mean that all the rest is prejudice , merely imagined fears , and there are no boundaries , and that ’ s how it should be !
0	it was already late in the day when he awoke after a disturbed sleep , but the sleep hadn ’ t fortified him .
0	he woke up feeling aggravated , irritable , and spiteful and looked around his small space with contempt .
0	it was a tiny closet of a room , some six paces long , and it had the most pitiful appearance , with dusty yellowish wallpaper peeling away in many places . the ceiling was so low that even a slightly tall man would find it unnerving , and it always seemed to him that at any moment he might bump his head against it . the furniture suited the room : there were three old chairs , not in good condition , and a painted table in the corner holding a few books and notebooks .
0	finally , a large , ungainly sofa took up almost the entire wall and about half the width of the whole room ; at one time it had been covered in chintz , but now it was in tatters and served as raskolnikov ’ s bed . he often slept on it just as he was , without undressing , without a sheet , covering himself with his old shabby student ’ s overcoat , with one small pillow at the head of the bed , under which he would place all the linen he owned , both clean and dirty , so that his head was raised a bit .
0	a small table stood in front of the sofa .
0	it was hard to sink lower or become more slovenly , but raskolnikov found this aspect even pleasant in his current frame of mind .
0	he had definitely withdrawn from everyone , like a turtle into its shell , and even the face of the servant , who was obliged to wait on him and who would sometimes enter his room , aroused his bile and occasioned tremors .
0	that sometimes happens with those monomaniacs who are too focused on something .
0	the landlady had stopped providing him with food about two weeks ago , and up to the present he hadn ’ t taken it upon himself to have it out with her , even though he went without his dinner .
0	the cook nastasya , the landlady ’ s only servant , welcomed the lodger ’ s mood and had completely stopped sweeping and straightening his room , except that about once a week she would sometimes take a broom to it , as if by accident .
0	it was she who had just awakened him .
0	why are you sleeping ?
0	she yelled at him .
0	it ’ s past nine o ’ clock . i brought you some tea . do you want it ?
0	the lodger opened his eyes , shuddered , and recognized nastasya .
0	is that tea from the landlady or what ?
0	he asked , slowly and painfully raising himself up a bit on the sofa .
0	she placed her own cracked teapot in front of him , with its diluted tea and two yellow lumps of sugar .
0	here , nastasya , take this , please , he said , fumbling in his pocket ( he ’ d been sleeping in his clothes ) , and he pulled out a handful of copper coins .
0	and get me a little sausage from the sausage maker , the cheapest sort .
0	i ’ ll bring you a roll in a moment , but wouldn ’ t you like some cabbage soup instead of sausage ?
0	i saved you some , but you came home late .
0	it ’ s good cabbage soup .
0	when she ’ d brought in the soup and he ’ d set about eating it , nastasya sat down on the sofa next to him and started chatting . she was a peasant woman and very talkative .
0	praskovya pavlovna wants to complain to the police about you , she said .
0	what does she want ?
0	you don ’ t pay her any money and you won ’ t vacate the room .
0	it ’ s clear what she wants .
0	oh , hell , that ’ s all i needed , he muttered , grinding his teeth . no , that ’ s not . a good thing right now .
0	she ’ s a fool , he said aloud .
0	i ’ ll go see her today . i ’ ll talk to her .
0	she may be a fool , just like i am , but what about you ?
0	are you clever , lying here like a sack , with nothing to show for it ? before , you said , you used to teach children ; why don ’ t you do anything now ? raskolnikov said reluctantly and harshly .
0	what do you do ?
0	what kind of work ?
0	i think , he replied seriously after a little pause .
0	nastasya simply collapsed in laughter .
0	she was easily amused , and when she found something funny , she laughed inaudibly , her whole body rocking and shaking until she felt sick .
0	have you thought up a lot of money ?
0	she was finally able to utter .
0	without boots , you can ’ t go teach .
0	he continued reluctantly , as if replying to his own thoughts .
0	you want all your capital at once ? he regarded her with a strange look .
0	yes , all my capital , he replied firmly , after a slight pause .
0	well , better to go slowly , or you ’ ll scare me ; i ’ m already very frightened .
0	should i get you a roll , or not ?
0	a letter came for you yesterday while you were out .
0	i don ’ t know from whom .
0	i paid the mailman three kopecks .
0	will you pay me back ?
0	bring it to me , for heaven ’ s sake , bring it ! raskolnikov cried in great excitement .
0	a minute later , the letter appeared .
0	just as he thought : it was from his mother , in ryazan province .
0	he even turned pale as he took it .
0	he hadn ’ t received any letters in some time ; but now something else suddenly took hold of his heart .
0	nastasya , go away , for heaven ’ s sake ; here ’ s your three kopecks , only go away right now , for heaven ’ s sake !
0	the letter trembled in his hands : he didn ’ t want to open it in her presence : he wanted to be alone with the letter .
0	after nastasya left , he quickly raised the letter to his lips and kissed it ; then for a long time he gazed at the handwriting of the address , at his mother ’ s familiar , beloved , tiny slanted writing , she who ’ d once taught him how to read and write .
0	he took his time ; he even seemed afraid of something .
0	he finally opened it : the letter was long , thick , and weighed almost a full ounce ; two large pieces of writing paper were covered with tiny script . my dear rodya , his mother wrote . it ’ s been more than two months since i ’ ve written you a letter , as a result of which i ’ ve suffered , at times even lost sleep , wondering about you .
0	but most likely you won ’ t blame me for my unintended silence .
0	you know how i love you ; you ’ re all we have , dunya and i , you mean everything to us , all our hope , all our aspiration .
0	i was so upset when i learned that you ’ d left the university several months ago because you were unable to support yourself , and that your lessons and other sources had ended !
0	how could i help you with my pension of only one hundred and twenty rubles a year ?
0	as you well know , i ’ d borrowed those fifteen rubles i sent you four months ago from our local merchant afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , on the promise of my pension .
0	he ’ s a good man and was your father ’ s acquaintance .
0	but in giving him the right to receive my pension for me , i was obliged to wait until i repaid my debt , and that ’ s only just happened , so all this time i haven ’ t been able to send you anything . but now , thank god , it seems i can send you some more ; in general , we can even boast of good fortune now about which i hasten to inform you .
0	in the first place , could you guess , dear rodya , that your dear sister has been living with me for the last month and a half , and we ’ ll no longer be separated in the future .
0	praise the lord , her torments have ended , but i ’ ll tell you everything in order , so you ’ ll know what ’ s happened and what we ’ ve been keeping from you up to now .
0	when you wrote to me about two months ago that you ’ d heard from someone or other that dunya had to endure much rudeness in mr. svidrigaylov ’ s house and you asked me for a more detailed explanation—what could i write to you at that time ? if i ’ d told you the whole truth , you ’ d probably have dropped everything and rushed to see us , even come on foot , because i know your character and your feelings , and you wouldn ’ t have allowed your sister to be insulted .
0	i myself was in despair , but what could i do ?
0	even i didn ’ t know the whole truth then .
0	the main difficulty was that dunya , who ’ d entered their household last year as a governess , had received an advance of one hundred rubles , on the condition that a certain amount would be deducted from her salary each month ; therefore , she couldn ’ t leave her position until she ’ d repaid her debt .
0	this amount ( i can now explain it all to you , precious rodya ) she ’ d accepted mostly so she could send you sixty rubles , which you needed then and which you received from us last year .
0	at the time we deceived you , writing that it had come from dunya ’ s savings , but that wasn ’ t so . now i ’ m telling you the whole truth because everything ’ s suddenly changed , by the will of god , for the better , and so you ’ ll know how much dunya loves you and what a precious heart she has .
0	as a matter of fact , right from the start mr. svidrigaylov treated her very rudely and made various impolite remarks and insults to her at the table .
0	but i don ’ t want to dwell on these agonizing difficulties and upset you for no reason , since all of that ’ s stopped .
0	in brief , in spite of the kind and generous treatment by marfa petrovna , mr. svidrigaylov ’ s wife , and all the servants , dunechka had a very difficult time , especially when mr. svidrigaylov , following old regimental custom , was under the influence of bacchus .
0	but what happened afterward ?
0	just imagine that this madman had conceived a passion for dunya sometime earlier , but had been concealing it under the guise of rudeness and contempt for her .
0	perhaps he himself was ashamed and horrified to see that he himself , at his age and as the father of a family , harbored such frivolous hopes ; therefore , he inadvertently took his anger out on dunya .
0	perhaps by his rude treatment and mockery he wanted to hide the whole truth from other people .
0	but , in the end , he couldn ’ t restrain himself and dared make an open and vile proposition to dunya , promising her various rewards ; moreover , he said he would forsake everything and go to another village with her or , perhaps , even abroad .
0	you can imagine her suffering !
0	it was impossible for her to leave her position at that time , not only because of her financial obligation , but because she wanted to spare marfa petrovna , who might suddenly conceive a hatred for her , and consequently arouse discord in the household . it would create a huge scandal for dunechka ; she ’ d never be able to escape it . there were many other reasons why dunya couldn ’ t consider removing herself from this horrible house earlier than six weeks .
0	of course , you know dunya , you know how clever she is and what a strong character she has .
0	she can tolerate many things and find so much generosity within herself even in the most extreme circumstances , so as not to lose her strength .
0	she didn ’ t even write to me about all this so as not to upset me , though we often exchanged news .
0	the finale was unexpected .
0	marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dunechka in the garden . misinterpreting the whole affair , she blamed dunya for everything , thinking that she was the cause of it all .
0	it occasioned a terrible scene right there in the garden : marfa petrovna even struck her , and didn ’ t want to listen to reason . she shouted for a whole hour and finally ordered that dunya be sent back to me in town on a simple peasant ’ s cart , onto which they tossed all her things , linens , dresses , in any which way , untied and unpacked .
0	then it began to pour down rain ; dunya , insulted and disgraced , had to make the trip , all eleven miles , with a peasant in an open cart .
0	now just imagine , how and what could i write in reply to your letter that i ’ d received two months ago ?
0	i myself was in despair . i dared not tell you the truth because you ’ d be so unhappy , bitter , and angry . and what could you do ?
0	you might have gotten yourself into trouble ; besides , dunya wouldn ’ t allow it . i couldn ’ t just fill my letter with nonsense about this and that , when i felt such sorrow in my soul . rumors about this episode circulated through the whole town for an entire month , and it reached the point where dunya and i couldn ’ t even go to church because of all the contemptuous looks and whispers .
0	all of our acquaintances shunned us , and everyone stopped greeting us . i learned for certain that some merchants ’ shop assistants and some office clerks wanted to insult us in the worst possible way by tarring the gates of our house so that the landlord would demand that we vacate our apartment . the cause of all this was marfa petrovna , who ’ d managed to denounce and slander dunya in every household .
0	she was acquainted with everyone in town , and during that month she visited town continually . she ’ s somewhat talkative and loves to go on about family matters , especially complaining about her husband to each and every person , which is not a good thing ; so she spread the whole story in a very short time , not only in town , but throughout the district . i fell ill , but dunya was stronger than i was ; if you ’ d only seen how she endured it all and how she consoled and reassured me !
0	but , by god ’ s grace , our torments ended . mr. svidrigaylov thought better of it , repented , probably taking pity on dunya , and presented to marfa petrovna clear and complete evidence of dunya ’ s innocence , namely this : a letter that dunya had felt compelled to write and convey to him , even before marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden , one that remained in his possession after dunya ’ s departure . the note asked him to cease these personal declarations and secret meetings that he ’ d insisted on .
0	in this letter she reproached him in the most impassioned way and with total indignation for his dishonorable treatment of marfa petrovna . she reminded him that he was a father and the head of a household , and , finally , she said how vile it was for him to torment and distress a young woman who was already in distress and defenseless .
0	in a word , dear rodya , this letter was so nobly and poignantly written that i sobbed while reading it and to this day can ’ t do so without shedding tears .
0	contributing to dunya ’ s exoneration came the testimony of those servants who saw and knew much more than mr. svidrigaylov supposed , as always happens .
0	marfa petrovna was completely astounded and once again crushed , as she herself acknowledged ; on the other hand , she was fully convinced of dunechka ’ s innocence .
0	the very next day , sunday , heading directly to church , she tearfully implored our lady to give her the strength to bear this new ordeal and carry out her duty .
0	then , right after church , without making any stops , she came to us and told us everything . she wept bitterly and , with full repentance , embraced dunya and begged her forgiveness .
0	that same morning , without tarrying , she set off right from our house to all the households in town , and in each one , shedding tears , she restored dunya ’ s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and behavior in the most flattering terms .
0	she showed everyone dunechka ’ s handwritten letter to mr. svidrigaylov , read it aloud , and even allowed people to make copies of it ( which , it seems to me , was going too far ) .
0	in this way it took her several days to visit everyone in town , so that some people felt offended that she was partial to others . lines were formed since she was expected in advance at every household and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would read the letter there . at each reading , people would line up who ’ d already heard the letter read several times in their own homes and in those of their other acquaintances .
0	in my opinion , much of this , very much , was unnecessary ; but such was marfa petrovna ’ s character . at least she fully restored dunechka ’ s honor . all the vileness of this affair left an indelible disgrace on her husband as the main culprit , so that i even began to feel sorry for him .
0	soon dunya was invited to give lessons in several households , but she refused .
0	all of this served principally to further the unexpected circumstance by which , one can say , our entire fate is now being altered . you should know , dear rodya , that a suitor has proposed to dunya and she ’ s already given her consent , which i ’ m writing to inform you about immediately .
0	even though this matter was conducted without your advice , you probably won ’ t bear any grudge either against me or your sister , since you yourself will see , from the facts , that it was impossible to delay or wait for your answer to arrive .
0	besides , you yourself couldn ’ t have judged it accurately without being here .
0	this is how it happened .
0	he ’ s already a court councillor , this petr petrovich luzhin , a distant relative of marfa petrovna ’ s , who herself helped a great deal in this affair .
0	it all began with his expressing a desire through her that he wished to make our acquaintance ; he was received properly , had some coffee , and the next day sent a letter in which he very politely stated his proposal and asked for a swift and definitive answer .
0	he ’ s a practical , busy man , just about to leave for petersburg , so he values every minute .
0	of course , at first we were very surprised , since all this took place so swiftly and unexpectedly . all that day we pondered and considered it together .
0	he ’ s a reliable , well-to-do person , works in two places , and has already amassed some capital . it ’ s true that he ’ s forty-five , but he has a rather pleasant appearance and can still be attractive to women ; he ’ s also an extremely solid and decent man , only a little gloomy and a bit arrogant . but perhaps it only seems that way , at first glance .
0	i advise you , dear rodya , when you meet him in petersburg , which will happen quite soon , not to judge him too quickly and heatedly , as you sometimes do , if at first glance you think something about him is not quite right . i say this just in case , although i ’ m sure that he ’ ll make a pleasant impression on you .
0	besides , in order to determine what sort of person he is , one must deal with him gradually and carefully , so as not to fall into error or prejudice , which is difficult to correct or smooth over afterward .
0	and petr petrovich , at least from many indications , is an extremely respectable man .
0	on his first visit , he stated that he was a positive person ; he shares to a large extent , as he himself explained it , the convictions of our younger generation , and he is an enemy of all prejudices . he said a great many other things because he seems a bit vain and very much likes to be listened to , but that ’ s almost not a fault .
0	of course , i understood very little , but dunya explained to me that although he is not a well-educated man , he is clever and , it seems , kind .
0	you know your sister ’ s character , rodya .
0	she ’ s a strong young woman , sensible , patient , and generous , although she has an impassioned heart , as i ’ ve come to know well . of course , there ’ s no particular love involved , either on her side or on his , but dunya , in addition to being a clever young woman , is also a lofty creature—an angel . she ’ ll consider it her duty to make her husband happy , and he , in turn , will concern himself with his wife ’ s happiness , which , for the time being , we have no major reason to doubt , even though , i must admit , this whole affair was concluded rather quickly .
0	besides , he ’ s a very prudent man and of course will realize that his own conjugal happiness will be more assured the happier dunechka is with him .
0	as for the fact that there are some irregularities in his character , some old habits , even some disagreement in their views ( which can ’ t be avoided even in the happiest of marriages ) , on that count dunechka told me that she ’ s relying on herself and there ’ s no reason to be concerned , that she can tolerate a great deal on the condition that their future relations will be fair and honest . for example , he seemed a bit harsh to me at first ; but that could be precisely because he ’ s such a straightforward man , and it ’ s absolutely so .
0	for example , during his second visit , after he ’ d already received her consent , he expressed in our conversation that previously , even before he knew dunya , he ’ d intended to marry an honest young woman , but one without a dowry , and certainly one who ’ d already experienced poverty ; because , as he explained , a husband should in no way be obligated to his wife , and that it ’ s much better if the wife considers her husband to be her benefactor .
0	i ’ ll add that he expressed himself a little more gently and affectionately than i described , but i ’ ve forgotten his exact words , and recall only the idea ; besides , he said it without any premeditation . obviously it just slipped out in the heat of conversation , so that afterward he even tried to correct himself and soften it . but it still seemed somewhat harsh to me , and i conveyed this to dunya later .
0	but she replied , even somewhat annoyed , that words are not the same as deeds , and of course that ’ s fair .
0	before deciding , dunechka didn ’ t sleep the whole night ; supposing that i was already asleep , she got out of bed and spent the whole night pacing back and forth in the room . finally she knelt down and prayed fervently in front of the icon for a long time ; in the morning , she announced to me that she ’ d made a decision .
0	i ’ ve already mentioned that petr petrovich is now heading to petersburg . he has important business there , since he wants to open a public lawyer ’ s office in the capital . he ’ s been engaged for a while in various legal actions and lawsuits , and a few days ago he won an important case .
0	he has to go to petersburg because he has an important matter pending in the senate .
0	thus , dear rodya , he might prove extremely useful for you in all sorts of ways ; dunya and i have already supposed that you , even from this day forward , might definitely launch your future career and consider your fate now clearly determined .
0	oh , if only this were to come to pass !
0	it would be such a benefit that one would have to regard it as nothing other than a gift to us directly from the almighty .
0	we even dared mention a few words on this account to petr petrovich . he expressed himself cautiously and said that of course , since he wouldn ’ t be able to get along without a secretary , naturally it would be better to pay a salary to a relative , rather than to a stranger , if that person turns out to be competent to carry out his duties ( as if you could turn out to be incompetent ! ) .
0	then he expressed his doubt that your studies at the university would allow you time to work in his office .
0	the matter was left there for the moment , but now dunya can think about nothing but this .
0	for the last few days , she ’ s simply been in a sort of excited state and has devised an entire scheme about how you could become petr petrovich ’ s comrade and even his partner in his legal affairs , all the more so since you yourself are studying law .
0	i ’ m in complete agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , seeing their complete likelihood .
0	in spite of petr petrovich ’ s present , extremely understandable evasiveness ( because he doesn ’ t know you yet ) , dunya ’ s quite sure that she ’ ll manage it all by means of her good influence over her future husband , and she ’ s convinced of that .
0	of course , we were careful not to let anything slip out about these future dreams of ours , especially about your becoming his partner . he ’ s a pragmatic person and might take it very coolly , since all this might seem to him to be only dreams .
0	similarly , neither dunya nor i have said a word to him about our strong hope that he would help us support you financially while you ’ re at the university . we didn ’ t talk about it , first because it might happen later of its own accord ; probably , he himself , without unnecessary words , will propose it ( as if he could refuse this to dunya ) , all the more so since you yourself might become his right-hand man in the office and then you would receive this assistance not in the form of charity , but as earned income .
0	that ’ s what dunya wants to arrange and i agree with her completely .
0	the second reason we didn ’ t say anything was because i particularly wanted to put you on an equal footing with him at our impending meeting with him . when dunya told him about you with such enthusiasm , he replied that one must first take a close look at anyone to form a judgment about him , and that he would reserve for himself the right to form his own opinion of you until he made your acquaintance .
0	you know , my precious rodya , it seems to me , for several reasons ( however , by no means related to petr petrovich , but just so , for some of my very own , personal , perhaps even old-womanish whims ) —it seems to me that perhaps i ’ d be better off if , after their wedding , i were to live on my own , as i do now , and not with them . i ’ m absolutely sure that he ’ d be so generous and considerate as to invite me and propose that i not be separated from my daughter . if he hasn ’ t said so up to now , naturally it ’ s because that ’ s what he intends even without words ; but i ’ ll refuse .
0	i ’ ve noticed more than once in life that husbands are not very fond of their mothers-in-law ; not only do i not want to be the slightest burden to anyone , but i myself want to be completely free , while i still have my own crust of bread to eat and children such as you and dunechka .
0	if possible , i ’ ll settle somewhere near both of you , because , rodya , i saved the most pleasant news for the end of my letter : you should know , my dear , that very soon we may all be together again and the three of us will embrace after our separation of almost three years !
0	it ’ s definitely been decided that dunya and i will leave for petersburg , i don ’ t know exactly when , but , in any case , very , very soon , perhaps even in a week .
0	everything depends on the instructions of petr petrovich , who will let us know as soon as he gets his bearings in petersburg .
0	for several reasons he wants to hasten the marriage ceremony and even , if possible , hold the wedding before the next church fast , and if that doesn ’ t work , then as soon as possible after the fast of the assumption .
0	oh , i ’ ll take you to my heart with such happiness !
0	dunya ’ s excited and elated at the prospect of seeing you , and once she said , as a joke , that she ’ d marry petr petrovich for that reason alone .
0	she ’ s an angel !
0	she has nothing to add for you now , but she told me to write only that she has so many things to talk over with you , so very many things , that she won ’ t even pick up a pen now because she couldn ’ t convey it all in just a few lines , and she ’ d only upset herself ; she told me to send you her warmest embrace and countless kisses .
0	but , in spite of the fact that we may very soon be meeting in person , i ’ ll still be sending you some money in a few days , as much as i can .
0	now that everyone has learned that she ’ ll be marrying petr petrovich , my credit has suddenly improved , and i know for sure that afanasy ivanovich will trust me , on account of my pension , even up to seventy-five rubles , so i may be able to send you twenty-five or thirty rubles .
0	i ’ d send you more , but i ’ m concerned about our expenses for the trip . although petr petrovich was kind enough to take upon himself a portion of the cost of our journey to the capital , namely , he offered to convey at his expense our baggage and a large trunk ( somehow through his acquaintances there ) , we still have to consider our arrival in petersburg , where we can ’ t show up without a kopeck , if only for the first few days .
0	meanwhile , dunechka and i have calculated everything precisely , and it turns out that the trip will cost us very little . we ’ re only sixty miles from the railroad station , so just in case , we ’ ve made an agreement with a peasant driver here whom we know . and after that , dunechka and i will happily travel in a third-class railway car .
0	thus , i may manage to send you not twenty-five rubles , but more likely thirty .
0	enough : i ’ ve completely filled two entire sheets , and there ’ s no space left ; it ’ s our whole story : so many events have accumulated !
0	and now , my precious rodya , i embrace you until our upcoming meeting and i give you my maternal blessing .
0	love dunya , your sister , rodya ; love her as she loves you , and know that she loves you without limit , more than she loves herself .
0	she ’ s an angel ; and you , rodya , you mean everything to us , all our hope , all our aspiration .
0	are you still saying your prayers to god , rodya , as you did before , and do you still believe in the goodness of our creator and savior ?
0	i ’ m afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the latest fashionable disbelief . if that ’ s so , then i pray for you .
0	remember , my dear , how in your childhood , when your father was still alive , you mumbled your prayers on my lap and how happy we all were then !
0	good-bye , or , rather , till we meet !
0	yours till the grave , almost all the while raskolnikov was reading , from the very beginning of the letter , his face was bathed in tears . however , after he ’ d finished , his face was pale , distorted by a spasm , and a painful , angry , spiteful smile curled on his lips .
0	he lay his head down on his meager , worn-out pillow , and he thought ; he thought for a long time . his heart was pounding , and his thoughts were violently agitated .
0	at last he felt stifled and cramped in that little yellow room of his , which resembled a cupboard or a trunk .
0	his gaze and his thoughts demanded space .
0	he grabbed his hat and left , this time no longer afraid of meeting anyone on the staircase ; he ’ d forgotten all about that . he took a route across voznesensky prospect toward vasilievsky island , as if hastening there on business , but , as was his custom , he walked without noticing the street , whispering and even talking aloud to himself , which fact greatly astonished the passersby .
0	many people thought he was drunk .
0	his mother ’ s letter tormented him . but as far as the basic , most important point was concerned , he had no doubts even for one moment , even while he was reading the letter .
0	the very heart of the matter was resolved in his mind , resolved once and for all : this marriage will never take place as long as i live , and to hell with mr. luzhin !
0	because this matter is obvious , he muttered to himself , smirking and maliciously celebrating in advance the triumph of his decision .
0	no , mama , no dunya , you can ’ t deceive me !
0	and what makes it even worse , they apologize for not asking my advice and for deciding the matter without me !
0	they think it ’ s impossible to break it off now ; we ’ ll see if it ’ s possible or not ! what a splendid excuse : petr petrovich , they say , is such a businesslike man that he can ’ t possibly get married in any other way than in a hurry , almost en route on a train .
0	no , dunya , i can see everything , and i know what those many things are that you want to talk over with me ; i also know what you worried about all night , pacing the room , and what you prayed about before the icon of our lady of kazan , the one that mama has in her bedroom .
0	so , in other words , it ’ s been decided once and for all : you ’ re pleased , avdotya romanovna , to marry that practical , rational man who ’ s amassed his capital ( who ’ s already amassed his capital ; that ’ s more impressive , more imposing ) , who ’ s working in two places , who shares the convictions of our younger generation ( as mama writes ) , and who seems to be a kind man , as dunya herself says . that word seems is the most splendid of all !
0	and this same dunechka is planning to marry that seems !
0	however , i ’ m curious : why did mama write to me about our younger generation ’ ? simply to characterize that man or with some future goal in mind : to persuade me to look kindly on mr. luzhin ?
0	i ’ m curious to resolve one more aspect : to what extent were they both open with each other that day and night , and then during the following days ? were all the words spoken honestly between them , or did they both understand that each of them felt the same thing in her heart and mind , and there was no reason to utter it aloud or to talk about it .
0	most likely , that ’ s part of what happened ; it ’ s clear from the letter : he seemed a bit harsh , and naïve mama let her views slip out to dunya , while she , of course , got angry and replied somewhat annoyed .
0	who wouldn ’ t be enraged when the matter ’ s so clear even without such naïve questions , when it ’ s all been decided , and there ’ s nothing more to say ?
0	then she writes to me , love dunya , rodya ; she loves you more than she loves herself ’ ; isn ’ t that a feeling of remorse secretly tormenting her for having agreed to sacrifice her daughter for her son ?
0	you ’ re our hope , you ’ re our everything !
0	spite was seething in him more and more intensely , and if he ’ d encountered mr. luzhin at that very moment , he might just have killed him !
0	hmm , it ’ s true , he continued , pursuing the vortex of thoughts spinning in his head .
0	it ’ s true that one must deal with him gradually and carefully to determine what sort of person he is , but mr. luzhin ’ s character is obvious .
0	the main thing is he ’ s a businesslike man ’ and seems to be kind ’ : what a joke that he took the conveyance of their baggage upon himself and that he ’ s shipping a large trunk at his own expense !
0	meanwhile , both of them , his fiancée and her mother , hire a peasant and will ride in his cart , covered with bast matting !
0	it ’ s only sixty miles and then we ’ ll happily travel in a third-class railway car ’ another six hundred miles .
0	that ’ s sensible : you must cut your coat to fit your cloth ; and you , mr. luzhin , what about it ?
0	how could you not know that her mother ’ s borrowing money in advance against her pension to cover the cost of their journey ?
0	of course , here you have a common commercial transaction , an undertaking for mutual profit with equal shares ; in other words , he ’ s splitting their expenses in half ; bread and salt in common , but bring your own tobacco , as the proverb says .
0	but here that efficient man has hoodwinked them a bit : the baggage costs less than their passage and might even go for free .
0	why don ’ t they both see it , or do they take no notice of it on purpose ?
0	but they ’ re content , content !
0	just think , these are the flowers : the real fruit lies ahead !
0	it ’ s not his stinginess or miserliness that ’ s important here , but the tone of it all .
0	it ’ ll become the tone of their future marriage , it ’ s a prophecy .
0	what ’ ll she have left after she arrives in petersburg ?
0	three silver rubles or two little paper bills , as that .
0	why , she ’ s already managed to guess for whatever reasons that it ’ ll be impossible for her and dunya to live together after the marriage , even at first .
0	that nice man , most likely , somehow let it slip , he gave himself away , even though mama brushes it off completely , i , she says , i ’ ll refuse .
0	well then , what will she rely upon : on her hundred and twenty ruble pension , after she deducts the money she owes afanasy ivanovich ?
0	she ’ ll knit little winter scarves or sew little sleeve covers , and ruin her aging eyes .
0	but those little scarves will add only twenty rubles a year to her hundred and twenty , that much i know .
0	that means they ’ ll still have to rely on mr. luzhin ’ s noble generosity : he himself , she says , he ’ ll propose it , he ’ ll entreat me .
0	it ’ s always the same with these schilleresque beautiful souls : ‡ up to the last moment they dress a person in peacock feathers , until the last moment they hope for the good , not the bad ; and although they have a feeling about the other side of the coin , they won ’ t utter a single word about it to themselves for any reason .
0	i ’ m curious as to whether mr. luzhin has received any official decorations ; i ’ ll bet he has the order of saint anna§ and that he wears it at dinners with contractors and merchants .
0	he might even put it on for his wedding .
0	but to hell with him !
0	well , never mind mama , she can think what she wants—that ’ s who she is ; but what about dunya ?
0	dear dunechka , i know you so well !
0	you were almost twenty the last time we saw each other : i understood your character already .
0	mama writes that you can tolerate many things .
0	i knew that two and a half years ago and have been thinking about it since then , precisely about this , that dunya can tolerate many things .
0	if she can bear mr. svidrigaylov and all the aftermath , that means she really has a high tolerance .
0	now she imagines , together with mama , that she can even tolerate mr. luzhin , expounding his theory regarding the advantage of wives rescued from poverty and husbands who do them such a great honor and make it clear at their very first meeting .
0	it must have been clear to her what sort of person he was and with whom she ’ d have to live .
0	she would eat only black bread and drink only water rather than sell her soul or give up her moral freedom in exchange for comfort ; she wouldn ’ t trade it for all of schleswig-holstein , ¶ let alone for mr. luzhin .
0	no , that wasn ’ t the dunya i knew , and .
0	that ’ s for sure !
0	it ’ s hard to spend your whole life as a governess earning only two hundred rubles and traipsing around the provinces ; but still i know my sister would sooner go work with negroes on a plantation or with latvian peasants for a baltic german # than defile her spirit and her moral feelings by a relationship with a man she doesn ’ t respect and with whom she has nothing in common—forever , merely for personal gain !
0	why is she agreeing now ?
0	what ’ s the point ?
0	what ’ s the answer ?
0	it ’ s clear : she wouldn ’ t sell herself on her own , for her own comfort , even to save herself from death , but she would sell herself for someone else !
0	she ’ d sell herself for a dear , beloved person !
0	that ’ s the crux of the matter : she ’ s selling herself for her brother and for her mother !
0	she ’ ll sell everything !
0	oh , with such an opportunity we ’ ll suppress moral feeling ; we ’ ll bring our freedom , serenity , even our conscience , everything , everything to the flea market .
0	as long as our beloved creatures are happy .
0	moreover , we ’ ll devise our own casuistry , we ’ ll learn from the jesuits , and perhaps we ’ ll reassure ourselves for a while , persuade ourselves that it ’ s necessary , really necessary for a good cause . that ’ s just how we are and it ’ s clear as day .
0	it ’ s clear there ’ s no one else involved except rodion romanovich raskolnikov , standing front and center .
0	yes , indeed , we can arrange for his happiness , support him at the university , make him a partner in the law office , guarantee his entire future ; perhaps afterward he ’ ll become wealthy , honored , and respected , maybe end up famous .
0	why here ’ s her rodya , her precious rodya , her firstborn !
0	how could she not sacrifice a daughter for such a firstborn son ?
0	oh , loving , unjust hearts !
0	perhaps we wouldn ’ t even reject sonechka ’ s fate !
0	sonechka , sonechka marmeladova , eternal sonechka , as long as the world lasts !
0	the sacrifice , have you both measured the enormous sacrifice ?
0	are you strong enough ?
0	do you realize , dunya , that sonechka ’ s fate is no worse than yours would be with mr. luzhin ?
0	there ’ s no particular love involved , mama writes .
0	but what if there ’ s disgust , contempt , loathing—then what ?
0	then it turns out , once more , of course , that you have to keep yourself clean .
0	isn ’ t that right ?
0	do you understand , do you really understand what that cleanliness entails ? do you understand that luzhin ’ s idea of cleanliness is just the same as sonechka ’ s , perhaps even worse , nastier , filthier , because you , dunechka , can count on a life of luxury , whereas with sonya , it ’ s simply a matter of life and death !
0	well , and if you ’ re not up to it , will you repent ?
0	so much sorrow , grief , curses , and tears hidden from everyone , so much , because you ’ re no marfa petrovna , are you ?
0	why , even now she ’ s distraught , she ’ s suffering ; but what about then , when she sees everything as it really is ? what did you really think of me ?
0	i don ’ t want your sacrifice , dunya ; i don ’ t want it , mama !
0	it won ’ t take place as long as i live , it won ’ t , it won ’ t !
0	i won ’ t accept it !
0	he suddenly came to his senses and stopped .
0	it won ’ t take place ?
0	what ’ ll you do so that it won ’ t ?
0	what right do you have ?
0	what can you promise them in return to have such a right ?
0	to devote your whole destiny to them , your future , when you complete your course of studies and attain a position ?
0	we ’ ve heard all that before , and it ’ s just an attempt to frighten us , but now ?
0	you have to do something right now , do you understand ?
0	what are you doing in the meantime ?
0	they get their money as credit against that hundred-ruble pension or as an advance from the svidrigaylovs ! how will you protect them from those svidrigaylovs or from afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , you future millionaire , you , you zeus , disposing of their fates ?
0	but in ten years , mother will have managed to go blind from knitting scarves and perhaps from shedding tears ; she ’ ll waste away from fasting ; and my sister ?
0	well , just think what can happen to her in ten years or during that time ?
0	that ’ s how raskolnikov tortured and teased himself with these questions , even deriving some enjoyment from it .
0	besides , all these questions weren ’ t new or unexpected , but old ones , painful , and persistent .
0	all this current anguish had taken root in him ages ago ; it had grown , accumulated , and of late matured and intensified , having assumed the form of a terrible , wild , fantastic question that tormented his heart and mind , irresistibly demanding a solution . now the letter from his mother had suddenly struck him like a thunderbolt . clearly it was unnecessary to be dejected now or to suffer passively , merely considering these questions insoluble ; instead , it was absolutely necessary to do something right now , as soon as possible .
0	no matter what , he had to decide to do something , or else .
0	or renounce life altogether !
0	submit to fate as it is , once and for all , and stifle everything in me , rejecting any right to act , live , or love !
0	do you understand , do you really understand , dear sir , what it means when a person has nowhere else to go ?
0	all of a sudden he recalled marmeladov ’ s question from the day before . because everyone has to have somewhere to go . he suddenly shuddered : one thought , also from the day before , flashed through his mind again .
0	but he hadn ’ t shuddered because of that thought . he ’ d known , he ’ d had a premonition , that it would flash through his mind and he ’ d already been expecting it ; and this thought was not from the day before at all .
0	but the difference was that a month ago , even as recently as yesterday , it had been only a daydream , but now . now it suddenly appeared not as a daydream , but in some new , awe-inspiring , completely unfamiliar form , and all of a sudden he himself became aware of it . his head throbbed , and things grew dark before his eyes .
0	he glanced around hurriedly ; he was looking for something . he wanted to sit down and was searching for a bench . just then he was making his way along konnogvardeisky boulevard .
0	a bench was visible in the distance , about a hundred paces ahead . he walked as quickly as he could , but along the way he had a little adventure that attracted all his attention for a few minutes .
0	looking for a bench , he noticed just in front of himself , some twenty paces ahead , a woman walking along the street . at first , he paid her no attention , just as he hadn ’ t focused on other things appearing before him up to now . many times it had happened that he was walking home and didn ’ t recall the route he ’ d taken ; he ’ d grown used to that .
0	but there was something strange about this woman that caught his eye from the first glance , so that gradually his attention began to be focused on her—reluctantly at first , as if with annoyance , but then it grew stronger and stronger . suddenly he wanted to understand precisely what was so strange about her . first of all , she must have been a very young woman ; she was walking along bareheaded in the heat , without parasol or gloves , waving her arms in a ludicrous manner .
0	she was wearing a silk dress made of some light fabric ( some kind of cloth ) , but in a very odd way , scarcely fastened , and torn at the waist in the back , a large piece of material detached and hanging loose ; a little scarf had been tossed over her bare neck , but it protruded crookedly to one side . to top it all off , the young woman was walking unsteadily , stumbling , even swaying from side to side .
0	he caught up with the young woman at the bench , but , upon reaching it , she collapsed into one corner , threw her head against the back of the bench , and closed her eyes , obviously from extreme exhaustion .
0	examining her closely , he guessed at once that she was completely drunk .
0	it was a strange and absurd sight to behold .
0	he even wondered whether he might be mistaken .
0	before him was an extremely young face , about sixteen , perhaps even only fifteen—a little face , under fair hair , pretty , but quite flushed and seemingly swollen . the young woman seemed to understand very little ; she had crossed one leg over the other and was displaying more of it than was proper , and , by all indications , she had very little awareness that she was outside on the street . raskolnikov didn ’ t sit down and didn ’ t want to walk away ; he stood in front of her in a quandary .
0	this boulevard was always deserted , and now , after one o ’ clock and in such heat , there was almost no one there at all .
0	however , just to one side , about fifteen paces away , at the edge of the street , stood a gentleman , who , by all appearances , also very much wanted to approach the young woman for some purpose . he , too , had probably seen her from a distance and was trying to catch up with her , but raskolnikov had hindered him .
0	the gentleman cast angry glances at him , trying , however , not to make them too obvious , waiting his turn impatiently until the annoying vagabond left .
0	the matter was clear . this gentleman was about thirty , stout , plump , hale and hearty , with pink lips , a little mustache , and very foppishly dressed . raskolnikov got very angry ; he suddenly wanted to insult this fat dandy .
0	for a moment , he left the young woman and approached the gentleman .
0	what do you want here ?
0	he cried , clenching his fists and laughing , his lips foaming with rage .
0	what ’ s the meaning of this ?
0	the gentleman asked sternly , frowning in haughty astonishment .
0	clear off , that ’ s what !
0	how dare you , you scum !
0	raskolnikov threw himself at the man with his fists , without even considering that the plump gentleman could easily get the better of two men his size .
0	but just at that moment someone grabbed him forcefully from behind : a policeman now stood between them .
0	enough , gentlemen , we ’ ll have no fighting in public places , if you please .
0	what do you want ?
0	he asked raskolnikov sternly , noticing his tattered clothes .
0	raskolnikov looked at him attentively .
0	he had a manly soldier ’ s face , with a gray mustache , sideburns , and an intelligent expression .
0	you ’ re exactly what i want , he cried , grabbing him by the arm .
0	i ’ m a former student , raskolnikov . you should know that , too , he said , turning to the gentleman . please come along with me ; i ’ ll show you something .
0	after taking the policeman by the arm , he pulled him over to the bench .
0	here , look , she ’ s completely drunk and was just walking along the boulevard ; heaven knows who she is or where she ’ s from , but she doesn ’ t look like that ’ s her profession .
0	then they turned her loose onto the street .
0	look , her dress is torn ; you can see how it was put on : someone else dressed her , she didn ’ t do it herself , and it was by someone ’ s clumsy hands , men ’ s hands . and now look over here at this dandy , with whom i was just about to fight ; i ’ m not acquainted with him ; this is the first time i ’ ve seen him . he , too , must have noticed along his way that she was drunk and unaware of where she was and now he very much wants to go up and grab her—since she ’ s in such a state—and take her off somewhere .
0	i myself saw him observing and following her , but i interfered , and now he ’ s waiting until i leave .
0	he ’ s just withdrawn a little , as if to roll a cigarette . how can we get her away from him ? how can we get her home ?
0	the policeman understood everything in an instant and thought about it .
0	the fat gentleman ’ s intention , of course , was easily explicable , but there was the girl .
0	the officer bent over to get a closer look at her , his features reflecting genuine compassion .
0	ah , what a shame !
0	he said , shaking his head . she ’ s still just a child .
0	they tricked her , that ’ s for sure .
0	listen here , miss , he said to her .
0	where might you live ?
0	ah , dear me , this is bad !
0	he said , shaking his head again , feeling embarrassed , compassionate , and indignant . he said , turning to raskolnikov , right there and then looking him over rapidly from head to toe . raskolnikov must have appeared a bit strange to the policeman : he was in tatters , yet was giving away his own money !
0	did you come upon them far from here ?
0	i tell you , she was walking ahead of me , swaying , right here along the boulevard .
0	when she reached this bench , she collapsed .
0	ah , what shameful things occur nowadays in this world , oh lord !
0	such a simple girl , and drunk already !
0	she ’ s been tricked , that ’ s for sure .
0	there are many young women just like her nowadays . she looks delicate , too , as if she might be a lady .
0	he bent over her once more .
0	perhaps he had daughters of his own like her—as if she might be a lady and looks delicate , well mannered and already imitating all the latest fashions .
0	what a scoundrel , and he won ’ t go away !
0	the man heard him and was about to get angry again , but reconsidered and limited himself merely to a contemptuous glance .
0	we may be able to get her away from him , sir , replied the police officer thoughtfully .
0	he said , leaning over her .
0	she walked quickly , swaying violently as she had before .
0	the dandy followed her , but along the opposite side of the boulevard , and didn ’ t take his eyes off her .
0	he repeated aloud with a sigh .
0	he yelled after the mustachioed policeman .
0	what ’ s it to you ?
0	let him amuse himself .
0	( he pointed at the dandy . ) what ’ s it matter to you ?
0	the policeman didn ’ t understand and stared at him wide-eyed .
0	raskolnikov burst into laughter . said the officer , waving his arm , and followed the dandy and the girl , probably thinking that raskolnikov was insane or something far worse . he ’ s made off with my twenty kopecks , raskolnikov muttered spitefully when left alone .
0	well , let him get some money from that fellow , too , and then he ’ ll let the girl go off with him , and that ’ ll be the end of it . why am i getting involved here , trying to help ?
0	what right do i have to help ?
0	let them devour each other alive—what ’ s it to me ?
0	how did i dare part with those twenty kopecks ?
0	in spite of these strange words , he felt very wretched .
0	he sat down on the deserted bench .
0	his thoughts were scattered . in general , it was hard for him at that moment to think about anything at all .
0	he wanted to sink into forgetfulness , to forget everything , then wake up and start all over again .
0	she ’ ll come to her senses , weep for a while , and then her mother will find out . at first she ’ ll beat her , then whip her , severely and shamefully , and then , perhaps , drive her away . and if she doesn ’ t drive her away , darya frantsevna will get wind of it , and then my little girl will start scurrying from place to place .
0	then right to the hospital : that ’ s always how it is with those girls who live with their virtuous mothers and who fool around on the sly ; well , and then to the hospital again . back to the hospital . in two or three years—she ’ ll be a cripple , and all in all she ’ ll get to live only to eighteen or nineteen .
0	how have they all turned out ?
0	that ’ s the way it has to be , they say .
0	a certain percentage , they say , has to go away every year . probably to the devil , so as to invigorate the rest and not interfere with them .
0	they really have such fine words : they ’ re so comforting and erudite . once stated , a percentage , there ’ s nothing more to worry about . if it had been some other word , well then .
0	it might be more troubling .
0	what if dunechka somehow winds up in that percentage ?
0	if not that one , then a different one ?
0	where am i going ?
0	he wondered to himself .
0	razumikhin was one of his former comrades at the university .
0	it was remarkable that raskolnikov , who ’ d been at the university , had hardly any comrades , avoided everyone , visited no one , and received them only unwillingly . soon everyone turned away from him .
0	somehow he took no part whatsoever in general gatherings , conversations , amusements , anything .
0	he studied diligently , unsparingly , and for that they respected him , but no one liked him .
0	he was very poor and somehow arrogantly proud and uncommunicative ; it was as if he were concealing something inside .
0	to some of his comrades it seemed that he regarded them , everyone , from on high , as children , as if he ’ d surpassed them in his development , knowledge , and convictions , and regarded their convictions and interests as beneath him .
0	for some reason , he ’ d become friends with razumikhin—that is , not exactly friends , but he was more sociable with him , more honest .
0	but it was impossible to be in any other relationship with razumikhin .
0	he was an unusually cheerful and sociable fellow , good-natured to the point of innocence . nevertheless , beneath this innocence were concealed both depth and dignity .
0	his best friends realized this , and everyone liked him .
0	he was very clever , although sometimes really naïve .
0	his appearance was expressive—tall , thin , always badly shaven , and he had black hair .
0	sometimes he got into brawls , and he was reputed to be a very strong man .
0	one night , in a group , he floored all six and a half feet of an officer of the law with one blow . he could drink without limit , but could also abstain totally ; at times he could be unacceptably mischievous , but he could also refrain from mischief completely . razumikhin was also remarkable in that no failures ever troubled him and no adverse circumstances could ever seem to weigh him down .
0	he could be lodged even on a rooftop and endure intolerable hunger and extraordinary cold .
0	he was very poor and he alone supported himself completely , earning money by some sort of work .
0	one year he didn ’ t heat his room all winter and maintained that it was even more pleasant because a person can sleep better in the cold . at the present time , he had also been forced to leave the university , but not for long ; with all his might he was hastening to improve his circumstances so that he could continue his studies .
0	raskolnikov hadn ’ t been to see him for the last four months or so , and razumikhin didn ’ t even know where his friend ’ s apartment was .
0	once somehow , about two months ago , they were about to meet on the street , but raskolnikov turned away and even crossed over to the other side of the street so he wouldn ’ t be noticed .
0	but razumikhin , even though he did notice him , passed him by , not wishing to disturb his friend .
0	as a matter of fact , for some time i ’ ve been wanting to ask razumikhin for work , to arrange some lessons or something else for me .
0	suppose he does arrange some lessons , suppose he even shares his last kopecks with me , if he has any to share , so that i could even buy some boots , have my clothes mended , and offer some lessons .
0	well , and then what ?
0	what can i do with a few five-kopeck pieces ?
0	the question of why he ’ d just set out for razumikhin ’ s agitated him more than he himself even realized ; he searched anxiously for some sinister meaning for himself in this seemingly most ordinary action . so , did i really want to resolve this whole matter with razumikhin alone and find a way out through him ?
0	he asked himself in astonishment .
0	he reflected , rubbed his forehead , and then , strange to say , after considerable thought , a very curious idea somehow unexpectedly , suddenly , almost of its own accord , entered his head .
0	to razumikhin , he uttered suddenly with total composure , as if a definitive solution was contained within this idea , i ’ ll go to razumikhin , of course i will . but—but not now .
0	on another day , i ’ ll go after that , when that ’ s already been done and everything will begin anew . all of a sudden , he came to his senses .
0	after that , he cried , jumping up from the bench . will that actually happen ?
0	will that really and truly occur ? he abandoned the bench and set off walking , almost running ; he wanted to turn back , head home , but suddenly felt terribly repulsed by the idea of going home : it was there , in his corner , in that awful cupboard of a room , that that had been ripening for more than a month ; he set off wherever his legs would carry him .
0	his nervous trembling had become somewhat feverish ; he even started shivering ; he felt a chill , in spite of the great heat .
0	he began , with a kind of effort , almost unconsciously , according to some inner necessity , to examine all the things he was encountering , as if urgently seeking diversion , but he didn ’ t succeed very well and continually lapsed into thought .
0	when , shuddering , he once again lifted his head and glanced around , he immediately forgot what he ’ d been thinking about and even where he ’ d been going . in that way , he walked all across vasilievsky island and came out to the little neva , crossed a bridge , and turned toward the islands .
0	at first his tired eyes , accustomed to the dust of the city , the lime plaster , and the huge , crowded , oppressive buildings , took pleasure in the verdure and freshness .
0	there was no stuffiness , no stench , no taverns .
0	but soon these new , pleasant sensations also became painful and annoying .
0	at times he stopped in front of some dacha adorned with greenery , looked through the fence , and in the distance , on the balconies and terraces , glimpsed fashionably dressed women and children running around in the garden .
0	the flowers interested him particularly ; he looked at them longest of all .
0	he also encountered luxurious carriages and men and women on horseback ; he followed them attentively with his eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from sight .
0	once he stopped and counted his money : it turned out that he had about thirty kopecks .
0	i gave twenty to the policeman and three to nastasya for the letter—so yesterday i must have given the marmeladovs forty-seven or fifty kopecks , he thought , calculating for some reason , but soon even forgot why he ’ d taken the money out of his pocket .
0	he remembered why as he was passing an establishment , something like an eating house , and felt that he wanted to have a bite to eat . upon entering the building , he downed a shot of vodka and ate a little pie with some sort of filling .
0	he finished it along the way . he hadn ’ t had any vodka for a long time and it had an immediate effect , although he had only one shot .
0	his legs suddenly grew heavy , and he began to feel a strong urge to sleep .
0	he started for home ; but when he reached petrovsky island , he paused in complete exhaustion , turned off the road , walked over to some bushes , dropped down on the grass , and immediately fell sound asleep .
0	in a morbid condition , our dreams are often distinguished by their extraordinary clarity , intensity , and a heightened resemblance to reality .
0	sometimes an outrageous scene takes shape , yet its setting and its entire course of development are so plausible and possess such subtle , unexpected details artistically corresponding to the total picture , that the dreamer couldn ’ t possibly conceive of them while awake , even if he were an artist like pushkin or turgenev .
0	such dreams , morbid dreams , are always remembered long afterward and produce a powerful impression on a person ’ s distraught and already overwrought organism .
0	raskolnikov had a terrible dream .
0	he dreamt of his childhood , while they were still living in their little town . he was a boy of about seven and was walking along with his father outside town late one holiday afternoon . it was a gray day ; the weather was stifling , and the place looked exactly as he remembered it : when compared , it was much more obscure even in his memory than it now appeared in his dream .
0	he could see the town very clearly , as if he held it in the palm of his hand ; there were no trees nearby ; somewhere very far away , on the edge of the horizon , was a small , dark thicket .
0	a tavern stood a few paces beyond the last garden of the town ; it was a large building and always made a very unpleasant impression on him ; it even frightened him whenever he happened to walk past it with his father .
0	there was always such a large crowd of people in front of it , shouting , laughing , cursing , howling in such dreadful , hoarse voices , and often brawling ; people with such drunken and dreadful mugs were always lingering outside .
0	whenever he encountered them , he always pressed up against his father and trembled . the country road that ran past the tavern was always so dusty and black .
0	it was a winding road ; after about three hundred paces it curved to the right , toward the cemetery .
0	a stone church with a green cupola stood in the middle of this cemetery ; he used to go there once or twice a year with his father and mother when a requiem was being sung for his grandmother who ’ d died a long time ago and whom he ’ d never known .
0	they always brought along a special dish on a white plate under a napkin ; it was made of sweetened rice with raisins arranged on top in the shape of a cross .
0	he loved this church and its ancient icons , most of which were lacking frames , and the old priest , with his quivering head .
0	next to his grandmother ’ s grave , marked by a stone , was the small grave of his younger brother , who ’ d died at the age of six months , and whom he also hadn ’ t known and couldn ’ t remember ; but he ’ d been told that he ’ d had a younger brother , and every time he visited the cemetery , he crossed himself devoutly and respectfully over the grave , bowing and kissing it .
0	and this is what he dreamt : he ’ s walking along the road with his father toward the cemetery and going past the tavern ; he ’ s holding his father ’ s hand and glancing over at it fearfully . this time something in particular draws his attention : it seems to be some special occasion with a motley crowd of townsfolk , peasant women and their husbands , and all sorts of riffraff . they ’ re all drunk and singing songs ; next to the tavern porch stands a strange kind of cart .
0	it ’ s one of those large ones to which they harness big draft horses to pull wares and barrels of wine . he ’ s always liked looking at these enormous horses , with their long manes , their heavy legs clomping along calmly at a steady pace , pulling mountainous loads , never straining , as if it were even easier for them to pull a load than an empty cart .
0	but now , strange as it seems , a peasant ’ s small , scrawny , light brown nag is harnessed to such a large cart , one of those horses—he ’ s seen it often—that sometimes strain to pull some huge load of firewood or hay , especially if the cart has gotten stuck in the mud or a rut . the peasants always whip the horse so terribly , so very painfully , sometimes even across its muzzle and eyes , and he would always feel so sorry , so very sorry to witness it that he would feel like crying , and his mother would always lead him away from the window .
0	now things are getting extremely boisterous : some very large and extremely drunken peasants in red and blue shirts , their heavy coats slung over their shoulders , come out of the tavern shouting , singing , and playing balalaikas .
0	git in , everyone git in ! shouts one peasant , a young lad with a thick neck and a fleshy face , red as a beet , i ’ ll take ya all .
0	but there is a burst of laughter and shouting :
0	hey , mikolka , you must be outta yer head to hitch that ol ’ mare to yer cart !
0	git in , i ’ ll take ya all ! mikolka shouts again , jumping in first , taking hold of the reins , and standing up straight in the front of the cart . matvei went off with the bay , he cries from the cart , and as for this ol ’ mare here , lads , she ’ s only breakin ’ my heart : i don ’ t give a damn if it kills ’ er ; she ain ’ t worth her salt .
0	git in , i tell ya !
0	i ’ ll make ’ er gallop !
0	she ’ ll gallop , all right !
0	and he takes the whip in his hand , getting ready to thrash the horse with delight .
0	i bet she ain ’ t galloped in ten years .
0	don ’ t pity ’ er , lads ; everyone , bring yer whips , git ready !
0	they all clamber into mikolka ’ s cart with guffaws and wisecracks .
0	there are six lads and room for more .
0	they take along a peasant woman , fat and ruddy .
0	she ’ s wearing red calico , a headdress trimmed with beads , and fur slippers ; she ’ s cracking nuts and cackling .
0	the crowd ’ s also laughing ; as a matter of fact , how could one keep from laughing at the idea of a broken-down old mare about to gallop , trying to pull such a heavy load ! two lads in the cart grab their whips to help mikolka .
0	the mare strains with all her might , but not only can ’ t she gallop , she can barely take a step forward ; she merely scrapes her hooves , grunts , and cowers from the blows of the three whips raining down on her like hail .
0	laughter redoubles in the cart and among the crowd , but mikolka grows angry and in his rage strikes the little mare with more blows , as if he really thinks she ’ ll be able to gallop .
0	take me along , too , lads ! shouts someone from the crowd who ’ s gotten a taste of the fun .
0	she ’ ll take everyone .
0	papa , what are they doing ?
0	papa , they ’ re beating the poor horse !
0	let ’ s go , let ’ s go !
0	they ’ re drunk , misbehaving , those fools : let ’ s go .
0	he tries to lead his son away , but the boy breaks from his father ’ s arms ; beside himself , he runs toward the horse .
0	gasping for breath , she stops , and then tries to pull again , about to drop . beat ’ er to death ! that ’ s what it ’ s come to .
0	aren ’ t you a christian , you devil ?
0	shouts one old man from the crowd .
0	just imagine , asking an ol ’ horse like that to pull such a heavy load , adds another .
0	you ’ ll do ’ er in !
0	she ’ s mine ! † i can do what i want with ’ er !
0	git in , all of ya !
0	i ’ m gon na make ’ er gallop !
0	suddenly a roar of laughter rings forth and drowns out everything : the little mare couldn ’ t bear the hail of blows and had begun kicking feebly .
0	even the old man can ’ t resist , and he starts laughing .
0	two lads from the crowd grab whips and run up to the little horse to start beating her flanks .
0	one stands on each side .
0	let ’ s have a song , lads ! someone cries from the cart , and everyone joins in . a riotous song bursts forth , tambourines jingle , and whistles sound in the chorus .
0	the peasant woman ’ s still cracking nuts and laughing .
0	the boy runs along the horse ’ s side , rushes ahead , and sees how they ’ re beating her across the eyes , right across her eyes !
0	one of the men holding a whip lashes the boy across the face ; he doesn ’ t feel it ; he ’ s wringing his hands , shouting , and then hurls himself at the gray-haired old man with the gray beard , the one who ’ d been shaking his head before and condemning it all .
0	one peasant woman takes him by the hand and tries to lead him away ; but he breaks free from her and runs up to the horse again .
0	the mare ’ s almost at her last gasp but begins kicking again .
0	he throws his whip away , bends down , and pulls a long , thick wooden shaft from the bottom of his cart ; he grabs hold of one end with both hands and raises it ominously above the mare .
0	he ’ ll crush ’ er !
0	he ’ ll kill ’ er !
0	there is the sound of a heavy thud .
0	thrash ’ er , go on !
0	why ’ d ya stop ?
0	cry several in the crowd .
0	shout several voices in the crowd .
0	still , she didn ’ t gallop !
0	yells mikolka , the crowbar still in his hands , his eyes bloodshot .
0	he stands there as if feeling sorry that there ’ s nothing more to strike .
0	with a shout he pushes his way through the crowd and runs to the mare , embraces her bloody , lifeless muzzle , and kisses her , kisses her eyes , her lips . then he suddenly springs up and in a rage hurls himself at mikolka to pummel him with his little fists .
0	at that moment his father , who ’ d been chasing him , finally grabs hold of him and leads him away from the crowd .
0	let ’ s go home !
0	the poor little horse ?
0	he sobs , but his breath falters , and his words emerge as screams from his constricted chest .
0	they ’ re drunk , acting up ; it ’ s none of our business .
0	the boy puts his arms around him , but his chest feels tight .
0	he wants to catch his breath , cries out , and wakes up .
0	raskolnikov awoke in a sweat , his hair drenched from perspiration ; he was panting and raised himself up on his elbows in horror .
0	he said , sitting up under the tree and taking in a deep breath .
0	but what ’ s this all about ?
0	is it a fever beginning ?
0	such a hideous dream !
0	he felt as if his whole body had endured a beating ; his soul seemed confused and wretched .
0	he sat up and rested his elbows on his knees , supporting his head with both hands .
0	will i really do it , will i really take an axe , hit her over the head with it , crush her skull ? i ’ ll slip in the warm , sticky blood , break the lock , steal , and tremble ; then i ’ ll hide , all covered in blood . oh , lord , will i really do it ?
0	as he said this , he trembled like a leaf .
0	but what am i thinking ?
0	he continued , exclaiming again as if in deep amazement .
0	i knew that i wouldn ’ t endure it , so why am i still tormenting myself ? why just yesterday , yesterday , when i went to conduct that .
0	test , even then i understood perfectly well that i wouldn ’ t endure it .
0	why am i still in doubt ?
0	only yesterday , going down the stairs , i realized how mean , vile , base , how base it all is . when i lay awake i felt nauseous and horrified by the idea alone .
0	no , i can ’ t go through it , i can ’ t ! even if there ’ s no doubt whatsoever in all my calculations , even if everything i ’ ve decided this past month is clear as day , as correct as arithmetic . i still can ’ t do it !
0	i can ’ t endure it , i can ’ t ! why , why have i been tormenting myself ?
0	he stood up , looked around in astonishment , as if wondering why he had come here , and set off for tuchkov bridge .
0	he was pale , his eyes burning , all his limbs exhausted , but he suddenly seemed able to breathe more easily .
0	he felt that he had gotten rid of a terrible burden , one that had been oppressing him for so long a time , and his soul suddenly seemed light and peaceful .
0	show me the way , and i will renounce this cursed .
0	crossing the bridge , he calmly and peacefully looked at the neva , at the bright setting of the burning red sun .
0	in spite of his weakness , he didn ’ t even feel the least tiredness .
0	it was as if an abscess on his heart that had been coming to a head all month had suddenly burst .
0	now he was free from all those evil charms , sorcery , witchcraft , and delusions .
0	afterward , when he recalled this moment and everything that happened to him during these days , minute by minute , point by point , piece by piece , one circumstance always struck him as a superstitious occurrence , even though in essence it wasn ’ t all that unusual , but later it constantly seemed to be a kind of premonition of his fate .
0	namely : he could never understand or explain to himself why , so tired and worn out , when it would have been most advantageous for him to go home by the shortest , most direct route , instead he headed home across haymarket square , which was completely unnecessary .
0	the detour was not long , but obvious and totally unneeded .
0	of course he had returned home dozens of times without recalling the route he took .
0	but why , he always asked himself , why did such an important , such a decisive meeting and , at the same time , such an extremely accidental meeting on the haymarket ( where he had no reason at all to be ) , why did it take place then , at that hour , at that moment of his life , precisely when he was in that mood , precisely in those circumstances , when only it , that meeting , could have had the most crucial , most decisive impact on his entire fate ? it was as if it had been waiting to ambush him !
0	it was almost nine o ’ clock when he passed through the haymarket .
0	all the merchants at their tables , stands , shops , and stalls were locking up their establishments , removing and packing up their wares , and dispersing to their homes , just as their customers were . around the eating houses on the filthy , stinking lower floors of the buildings on haymarket square , and especially in the taverns , were gathered all sorts of craftsmen and ragpickers .
0	raskolnikov loved these places primarily , just as he did all the nearest lanes , when he would walk the streets aimlessly . here his tattered clothes attracted no unwarranted attention and he could make his way in any apparel without creating a scandal .
0	at konnyi lane , on the corner , stood a tradesman and his wife , a peasant woman , at two tables with wares they were selling : threads , braids , calico head scarves , and so on .
0	they were also packing to go home , but lingered as they chatted with a passing acquaintance . this acquaintance was lizaveta ivanovna , or simply lizaveta , as everyone called her , the younger sister of that very same old woman , alyona ivanovna , the widow of a collegiate registrar and moneylender , where raskolnikov had been the day before when he had gone to pawn his watch and conduct his test .
0	she was a tall , awkward , timid , humble unmarried woman , almost feebleminded , thirty-five years old , living as a complete slave in her sister ’ s house , working for her day and night , trembling in her presence , even enduring beatings from her . she was standing deep in thought with a bundle in front of the tradesman and the peasant woman , listening to them attentively .
0	they were explaining something to her with particular passion .
0	when raskolnikov suddenly caught sight of her , some sort of strange feeling , similar to deepest astonishment , seized him , even though there was nothing astonishing about the meeting .
0	you really should decide on your own , lizaveta ivanovna , the tradesman was saying loudly .
0	come back tomorrow , around seven o ’ clock .
0	they ’ ll be here , too .
0	lizaveta replied slowly and pensively , as if unable to make up her mind .
0	i look at you and see that you ’ re just like a little child .
0	she ’ s not even your real sister , but your half sister , and she ’ s got you under her thumb .
0	this time don ’ t say anything to alyona ivanovna , her husband interrupted her . that ’ s my advice . come see us without asking her .
0	then your sister will figure it out , too . seven o ’ clock tomorrow ; they ’ ll be here , too , and you ’ ll decide on your own .
0	we ’ ll put up the samovar , the wife added .
0	all right , i ’ ll come , said lizaveta ivanovna , still pondering , and slowly started on her way . raskolnikov passed by just then and didn ’ t overhear any more .
0	he walked by quietly , unnoticed , trying not to miss a single word .
0	he had found out , he had suddenly , abruptly , and completely unexpectedly found out that tomorrow , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , lizaveta , the old woman ’ s sister and the only person who lived with her , would be away from home , and , as a result , the old woman , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , would be at home alone . there were only a few paces left to his apartment .
0	he entered like a person condemned to death .
0	he wasn ’ t thinking about anything , nor could he even think ; he suddenly felt with his entire being that he no longer possessed any freedom of thought or willpower , and that everything had been decided once and for all .
0	of course , even if he ’ d had to wait years for a convenient opportunity , even then , having a plan , it would most likely have been impossible to reckon on a more apparent step toward fulfilling his plan than that which had suddenly been presented now .
0	in any case , it would be difficult to discover the day before and for certain , with greater precision and the least amount of risk , without any dangerous inquiries or investigations , that tomorrow , at such and such a time , such and such an old woman , on whose life an attempt would be made , would be at home alone , absolutely alone .
0	afterward raskolnikov happened to learn somehow precisely why the tradesman and his wife had invited lizaveta to visit .
0	the matter was most ordinary and didn ’ t involve anything unusual at all .
0	an impoverished family that had recently arrived was selling some items , dresses and so on , all women ’ s goods .
0	since it was unprofitable to sell them at the market , they were looking for a trader , and lizaveta engaged in that kind of commerce .
0	she took a commission , went about on business , and had a large clientele because she was so honest and always set the best price : whatever price she stated , she stuck to it .
0	in general she said very little and , as already indicated , she was very humble and timid . but lately raskolnikov had become superstitious .
0	he retained traces of it for a long time afterward , almost indelibly . and in this entire affair he was always inclined subsequently to see some strangeness , as it were , some mystery , as though particular influences or coincidences were in evidence .
0	last winter , pokorev , a student he knew , had been about to leave for kharkov and mentioned , in passing , the address of an old woman , alyona ivanovna , in case he needed to pawn something . he didn ’ t look her up for a long time because he was giving lessons and managing somehow . about a month and a half ago , he remembered her address ; he had two items suitable for pawning : his father ’ s old silver watch and a small gold ring with three little red stones , given to him by his sister as a gift , a keepsake , at their parting .
0	he decided to take the ring ; after locating the old woman , right from the first glance , without knowing anything in particular about her , he conceived an insurmountable loathing for her ; he received two small notes from her and on his way home dropped by a shabby little tavern .
0	he ordered tea , sat down , and lapsed into deep thought .
0	a strange idea had emerged in his head , like a baby chick pecking its way out of its egg , and it interested him greatly . at another table close to his sat a young officer and a student with whom he was not acquainted and whom he was unable to recall later .
0	they had been playing billiards and were now drinking tea .
0	all of a sudden he heard the student say something to the officer about the moneylender , alyona ivanovna , the widow of the collegiate registrar , and he mentioned her address to him . that alone seemed somehow strange to raskolnikov : he ’ d just come from there , and here they were talking about her .
0	of course it was a coincidence , but he couldn ’ t shake off the extremely extraordinary impression , and now it seemed that someone was trying to nudge him in that direction : the student suddenly began telling his comrade various details about this alyona ivanovna .
0	she ’ s well known , he said .
0	you can always get some money from her .
0	she as rich as a yid , can lend you five thousand just like that , but she doesn ’ t balk at taking a pledge worth a single ruble , either .
0	many of our students have been to see her .
0	but she ’ s an awful bitch . he started describing how nasty she was , how willful , and said that if you were even one day late in redeeming your pledge , the item would be gone . she gives you four times less than the pledge is worth , he said , deducts five or even seven percent interest a month , so on and so forth .
0	the student got carried away blabbing and , in addition , said that the old woman has a sister , lizaveta , whom she beats constantly and keeps totally enslaved , like a little child , even though she herself is small and vile , while lizaveta ’ s at least six feet tall .
0	they began talking about lizaveta .
0	the student did so with some particular enjoyment and kept laughing , while the officer listened with great interest and asked the student to send this lizaveta around to him to mend some linen .
0	raskolnikov didn ’ t utter a word during this conversation , yet he learned everything all at once : lizaveta was the old woman ’ s younger half sister ( they had different mothers ) and was already thirty-five years old .
0	she worked for her sister day and night and served at home in place of a cook and a laundress ; she also sewed to order , washed other people ’ s floors , and turned all the money over to her sister . she dared not accept any orders or work without the older woman ’ s permission .
0	the old woman had already drawn up her will , which lizaveta herself knew , as well as the fact that she wouldn ’ t receive even half a kopeck , except for personal property , chairs , and so forth . all the money was to be left to a monastery in the novgorod province , for the eternal remembrance of her soul . lizaveta was a woman of the lower middle class , not like her sister , who had married an official ; she was terribly unattractive , extremely tall , with long , large , apparently turned-out feet , always wore worn-out goatskin shoes , and kept herself neat and clean .
0	the main thing , however , that astonished and amused the student was that lizaveta was continually pregnant . but didn ’ t you say she ’ s a freak ? yes , so dark-skinned , as if she ’ s a disguised soldier , but you know , she ’ s not really a freak .
0	she has such a kind face and eyes .
0	the proof is that many men find her attractive . she ’ s quiet , gentle , meek , and agreeable , agreeable to everything .
0	she even has a very nice smile .
0	because of her strangeness .
0	no , but here ’ s what i can tell you .
0	i could kill and rob that cursed old woman , and can assure you , feel no pangs of conscience , the student added passionately . the officer burst out laughing once again , but raskolnikov shuddered .
0	allow me to pose a serious question to you , the student said , growing excited .
0	i was joking just now , of course , but look : on the one hand , here ’ s a stupid , mindless , worthless , spiteful , sick old hag , needed by no one—on the contrary , causing harm to everyone ; she herself doesn ’ t know what she ’ s living for , and she ’ ll die of her own accord tomorrow . well , i do , replied the officer , staring attentively at his impassioned comrade . on the other hand , there are young , fresh forces , going to waste for lack of support , by the thousands , all over the place .
0	a hundred , even a thousand good deeds and undertakings could be planned and performed with the old woman ’ s money that ’ s being left in her will to a monastery !
0	hundreds , maybe thousands of beings could be set on the right path ; dozens of families could be rescued from poverty , kept from dissolution , from ruin , debauchery , and venereal hospitals—all this with her wealth . murder her and take her money and then use it to dedicate yourself to the service of all humanity and to the common good : what do you think , wouldn ’ t thousands of good deeds make up for one little , tiny crime ?
0	thousands of lives saved from wrack and ruin—for one life ?
0	one death and a hundred lives in exchange—it ’ s a matter of arithmetic !
0	what ’ s the life of that consumptive , stupid , spiteful old woman worth on the common scale ?
0	no more than that of a louse , a cockroach—not even that much , because the old woman ’ s harmful .
0	she consumes other people ’ s lives : just the other day she bit lizaveta ’ s finger out of spite ; they almost had to amputate !
0	of course she doesn ’ t deserve to live , observed the officer , but that ’ s nature .
0	hey , friend , nature can be rectified and directed ; without that , one would drown in prejudices .
0	without that , there wouldn ’ t be even one great man .
0	they say , duty , conscience . i don ’ t want to speak against duty and conscience—but how are we to understand them ? wait , i ’ ll pose one more question to you .
0	no , you wait ; i ’ ll pose a question to you .
0	now you ’ re ranting and raving , but tell me this : would you yourself kill the old woman or not ?
0	this has nothing to do with me . in my opinion , if you won ’ t dare to do it yourself , it ’ s not a matter of justice !
0	of course , all this was the most ordinary , most common run of ideas and conversation of young people , the sort he had heard many times before in other forms and with other themes .
0	but why precisely now did he happen to overhear just such a conversation and such ideas when in his own mind . exactly the same ideas had recently arisen ? and why precisely at this moment , just as he was carrying the germ of this idea away from the old woman ’ s apartment , had he just happened upon this conversation about her ?
0	this coincidence always seemed strange to him .
0	this insignificant conversation in the tavern had an extraordinary impact on him during the further development of this affair : it was as if it really was a premonition , a sign .
0	after returning from the haymarket , he threw himself down on his sofa and sat there motionless for a whole hour .
0	meanwhile , it grew dark ; he didn ’ t have any candles , and it never even occurred to him to light one .
0	he couldn ’ t recall a thing : was he really thinking about anything at that time ?
0	finally he felt the return of his recent fever and chills , and surmised with pleasure that he could also lie down on the sofa .
0	soon a heavy , leaden sleep settled upon him , as if oppressing him . he slept for an unusually long time and had no dreams . nastasya , who came in at ten o ’ clock the next morning , roused him with difficulty .
0	she brought him some tea and bread .
0	the tea was weak once again and supplied in her own teapot .
0	look at him , he ’ s asleep !
0	he ’ s constantly sleeping !
0	he raised himself up with effort .
0	his head ached ; he tried to stand up , turned around in his little room , and fell back down on the sofa .
0	going back to sleep !
0	are you ill , or what ?
0	he made no reply .
0	later , he said with effort , closing his eyes once more and turning toward the wall .
0	nastasya stood over him for a while .
0	maybe he really is ill , she said , turned away , and left .
0	she came in again at two o ’ clock with some soup .
0	he was lying there just as before .
0	the tea was untouched .
0	nastasya was offended and began shaking him angrily .
0	she cried , regarding him with disgust .
0	he raised himself and sat up , but said nothing to her and looked at the floor .
0	are you sick or what ?
0	nastasya asked and once again received no reply .
0	at least you ought to go outside , she said after a brief pause , and get some fresh air .
0	are you going to eat something ?
0	later , he said weakly .
0	she stood there a little while longer , regarded him with compassion , and left the room .
0	a few minutes later , he raised his head and stared at the tea and soup for a long time .
0	then he picked up the bread , picked up a spoon , and started to eat .
0	he ate a little , without much appetite , three or four spoonfuls , as if automatically .
0	his head ached less .
0	after this , he stretched out again on the sofa , but couldn ’ t fall asleep ; he lay there without moving , facedown , buried in his pillow .
0	he kept having daydreams , and they were very strange , indeed : most often he imagined that he was somewhere in africa , in egypt , on some sort of oasis .
0	a caravan was taking a rest ; camels were lying down peacefully ; all around , palm trees grew in a complete circle ; everyone was having dinner .
0	he kept drinking water , right from the stream that was there beside him , flowing and murmuring .
0	it was cool there and the water was so marvelously blue and cold , running over multicolored stones and over such pure , golden , glistening sand . suddenly he heard a clock clearly chiming . he shuddered , came to , raised his head , looked out the window , guessed the time , and jumped up , having come to his senses completely , as if someone had torn him away from the sofa .
0	he approached the door on tiptoe , opened it very quietly , and listened for any noise on the staircase below .
0	his heart was pounding dreadfully .
0	but all was quiet on the staircase , as if everyone was asleep . it seemed reckless and bizarre that he could have been sleeping in such oblivion since yesterday , and that he hadn ’ t yet done anything , made any preparations . meanwhile , perhaps the clock was chiming six o ’ clock .
0	an unusual , feverish , bewildering burst of activity suddenly overtook him , replacing his sleep and stupor .
0	however , there wasn ’ t much preparation to be done .
0	he made every effort to remember everything and forget nothing ; his heart was still pounding , thumping so hard that it became hard for him to breathe .
0	first , he had to make a loop and sew it into his coat—that would take only a minute or so .
0	he groped under his pillow and found among the linen stuffed there an old , ragged , unwashed shirt .
0	he tore off a strip from its tatters , about two inches wide and about fourteen inches long .
0	he folded the strip in two , took off his loose , sturdy summer coat made out of a thick cotton material ( it was his only outside coat ) , and began sewing both ends of the strip together under the left sleeve .
0	his hands shook as he sewed , but he overcame that , so that nothing would be visible from the outside when he put his coat on again .
0	he had long ago prepared a needle and thread , and they had lain wrapped in paper in the little table .
0	as for the loop , that was his own very clever idea : it was designed to hold the axe .
0	after all , he couldn ’ t walk along the street carrying an axe in his hands . and if he were to hide it under his coat , he ’ d still have to hold it with his hand , but that would be noticeable .
0	now , with a loop , he merely had to insert the head of the axe and it could hang there comfortably , inside under his armpit , for the whole way there . if he put his hand into his side pocket , he could grasp the handle to make sure it didn ’ t swing ; and since the coat was very loose , a genuine sack , the fact that he was keeping hold of it with the hand in his pocket wouldn ’ t be noticed from outside .
0	he had conceived of this loop two weeks ago .
0	after finishing his sewing , he thrust his fingers into a small opening between his turkish sofa and the floor , groped around inside the left corner , and pulled out the pledge he ’ d prepared long ago and hidden there .
0	this pledge , however , wasn ’ t really a pledge at all , but simply a smoothly fashioned wooden block , no larger than a silver cigarette case in size and thickness . he ’ d come upon this block by chance on one of his walks , in a certain courtyard where a workshop was located in one wing of the building .
0	then he ’ d added a smooth thin metal strip to the block , most likely broken off from something , which he ’ d also found on the street at the same time . after putting the two pieces together , the metal smaller than the wooden one , he ’ d tied them together with string , fastened tightly crosswise ; then he ’ d wrapped them neatly and smartly in clean white paper and tied them with a thin ribbon , also crosswise , and made the knot so that it would be difficult to untie .
0	this was done in order to divert the old woman ’ s attention for a while , since she would begin to struggle with the knot and thus he could seize the moment .
0	the iron plate had been added to give the pledge weight , so that at first the old woman wouldn ’ t guess that the object was made of wood .
0	all of this had been kept hidden under the sofa in his room until the right moment .
0	suddenly , just as he ’ d picked up the pledge , he heard a voice coming from somewhere in the courtyard below shouting :
0	it ’ s way past six !
0	he rushed to the door , listened cautiously , grabbed his hat , and started down the thirteen steps , carefully , inaudibly , like a cat . the most important matter lay ahead—stealing an axe from the kitchen . he had long ago decided that he had to use an axe to do the deed .
0	he also had a folding garden knife , but he couldn ’ t rely on a knife or , particularly , on his own strength ; therefore , he had settled definitively on an axe .
0	let us note , by the way , one peculiarity regarding all his definitive decisions already reached in this affair . they shared one strange trait : the more definitive they were , the more outrageous , the more absurd they immediately became in his own eyes .
0	in spite of all his tormenting inner conflict , he never , even for one moment , could believe in the feasibility of his plans during all this time .
0	and even if it sometimes happened that everything was understood and definitively resolved and that no further doubts remained—in that case , it seems , he would have renounced all of it as an absurdity , a monstrosity , and an impossibility . an enormous number of unresolved points and doubts still remained . as for where he could acquire an axe , that detail didn ’ t faze him in the least , since there was nothing easier .
0	especially in the evenings , nastasya was frequently away from the house : either she ran off to the neighbors or to a shop , and the door was always left wide open .
0	the landlady quarreled with her only about this oversight .
0	and so , when the time came , all one had to do was enter the kitchen on the sly and grab the axe , then later , an hour later ( when everything was finished ) , go in and put it back .
0	but doubts still remained : let ’ s suppose he returned an hour later to put it back , but nastasya was also there .
0	of course , he ’ d have to pass by and wait until she left again .
0	what if during that time the axe was needed , she began looking for it , and started yelling—that would arouse suspicion or , at least , grounds for suspicion .
0	but all of these were just trifles he hadn ’ t even begun to worry about , and there was no time to do so .
0	he thought about the main point and put off the details until such time as he himself would be sure of everything .
0	but that seemed decidedly unrealizable .
0	at least , that was how he saw it .
0	he couldn ’ t , for example , imagine that at some time he would stop thinking , get up , and—simply go there . even his recent test ( that is , his visit with the intention of definitively scoping out the place ) had been no more than an attempt at a test , far from the real thing , merely : let me go , he says , and attempt it ; why just dream about it ? and right away he couldn ’ t stand it , spat in disgust , and ran away , furious with himself .
0	meanwhile , it would seem , he had already completed his entire analysis , in the sense of resolving the question morally : his casuistry had been sharpened like a razor , and he himself could no longer find any conscious objections . in the last instance , he simply no longer trusted himself and stubbornly , slavishly , looked for objections everywhere , gropingly , as if someone were forcing him to do it and dragging him there .
0	from the beginning—or , rather , for a long time before—he ’ d been preoccupied by one question : why are almost all crimes so conspicuous , so easily discovered , and the traces of almost all criminals revealed so obviously ?
0	little by little he arrived at diverse and curious conclusions ; in his opinion , the main reason was contained not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime , but in the criminal himself : the criminal himself , almost every one of them , at the very moment of the crime , is subject to some failure of willpower and reason , which are replaced , instead , by phenomenal childish thoughtlessness , precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed .
0	according to his conviction , it turned out that this eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness , develop gradually , and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime ; they continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for some time afterward , depending on the individual ; then they pass away , as does any illness . the question remains : does the illness give birth to the crime itself , or is the crime , somehow by its own nature , always accompanied by something like an illness ? he still felt it was beyond his power to resolve this question .
0	after arriving at these conclusions , he decided that in his own case , in this affair , there could be no such morbid reversals , that he would retain his reason and his willpower , essentially , all during the implementation of his plan , for the sole reason that what he had planned—was not really a crime . we will omit the long process by which he arrived at this last conclusion ; even without that , we have raced too far ahead . we will merely add that in general the factual , purely material difficulties of this affair played a very secondary role in his mind .
0	one must simply exercise one ’ s willpower and all one ’ s reason over these difficulties , and they will all be overcome in their time , when one becomes familiar with all the details of this affair in all of its precision . but the affair hadn ’ t begun . he continued to believe least of all in his final decisions , and when the time came , everything turned out differently , somehow unintentionally , almost unexpectedly .
0	one extremely insignificant circumstance landed him in an impasse , even before he went down the stairs .
0	having reached the landlady ’ s kitchen , its door wide open as usual , he carefully peeked in to have a look around beforehand : by any chance was the landlady herself in there during nastasya ’ s absence , and if not , was the door to her room firmly closed so that she couldn ’ t look out when he entered to take the axe ?
0	imagine his astonishment when he suddenly saw that not only was nastasya home this time , and in the kitchen , but that she was busy working : she was taking the laundry out of a basket and pinning it up to dry !
0	seeing him , she stopped hanging the linens , turned to him , and regarded him all the while he was passing .
0	he looked away and walked by , as if not noticing anything .
0	but that spelled the end of the whole affair : he had no axe !
0	what on earth gave me the idea , he wondered as he approached the entranceway , what gave me the idea that she wouldn ’ t be home precisely at this moment ?
0	why , why , why did i decide this with such certainty ?
0	he was crushed , even somehow humiliated .
0	he paused in the entryway to reflect . to set off along the street , just so , as if to take a stroll , just for appearance ’ s sake , was repulsive ; to go back home was even more repulsive .
0	what an opportunity has been lost forever !
0	he muttered , standing aimlessly in the entrance , directly opposite the door to the caretaker ’ s small dark lodgings , also left open .
0	from the caretaker ’ s room , only two paces away , under a bench on the right , something gleamed before his eyes . he looked around cautiously—no one was there .
0	he approached the lodge on tiptoes , went down two steps , and in a low voice called the caretaker .
0	just as i thought , he ’ s not home !
0	he must be close by , however , in the courtyard , because the door ’ s wide open .
0	he rushed at the axe ( it was an axe ) and pulled it out from under the bench , where it had been lying between two logs ; right there , before he left , he secured the axe in the loop , thrust both hands into his pockets , and left the lodge ; no one noticed him !
0	if not by reason , then with the devil ’ s help , he thought , chuckling strangely .
0	this chance occurrence bolstered him enormously .
0	he walked along the street quietly and steadily , without hurrying , so as not to arouse any suspicions .
0	he didn ’ t look at any passersby , even trying not to glance into their faces at all , and to be as unnoticeable as possible .
0	then he suddenly remembered his hat !
0	i even had some money a few days ago and could have bought myself a cap !
0	a curse burst forth from his soul .
0	glancing by chance with one eye into a shop , he noticed that there , on the wall clock , it was already ten minutes past seven .
0	he needed to hurry and , at the same time , to make a detour : he wanted to approach the building in a roundabout way , from the other side . previously , when he had imagined all this , he ’ d sometimes thought he ’ d feel very afraid .
0	but now he didn ’ t feel very afraid ; in fact , he didn ’ t even feel afraid in the least .
0	he was even preoccupied at the time by some extraneous thoughts , but not for very long .
0	passing the yusupov garden , he was about to consider the idea of placing tall fountains there , thinking how well they would refresh the air in all the squares .
0	little by little he came to the conviction that if the summer garden could be extended to include the entire field of mars and even connect it with the gardens at the mikhailovsky palace , that it would be a splendid and most useful thing for the city .
0	then suddenly something caught his interest : why exactly was it that in all large cities people were somehow inclined to live and settle , not out of necessity alone , precisely in those parts of town where there were no gardens , no fountains , and where filth and stench prevailed , as well as all sorts of vileness .
0	then he recalled his own strolls through the haymarket , and a moment later he came back to his senses . what nonsense , he thought . no , it ’ s better not to think at all !
0	that ’ s probably the way men being led to their execution slide into thinking about all the things they encounter along their way , flashed through his mind , but it merely flashed , like a bolt of lightning ; he himself extinguished this thought as quickly as possible . now he was getting very close ; here ’ s the house , here ’ s the gate .
0	suddenly a clock struck once from somewhere .
0	could it really be half past seven ?
0	it couldn ’ t be ; the clock must be fast !
0	to his good fortune , once again he managed to get through the gates successfully .
0	moreover , as if on purpose , at that very moment just before him a huge load of hay was entering the gate , completely shielding him while he was walking through the gateway ; just as the cart was passing into the courtyard , he managed to slip in to its right .
0	there , on the other side of the cart , he could hear several voices shouting and arguing . but no one had noticed him , and he didn ’ t happen to run into anyone . many windows looking out onto this huge square courtyard were open at this time , but he didn ’ t raise his head—he didn ’ t have the strength .
0	the staircase leading to the old woman ’ s apartment was close by , just to the right of the gate .
0	he was already on the first step .
0	catching his breath and pressing his hand against his pounding heart , feeling and adjusting the axe again , he began climbing the stairs cautiously and quietly , constantly listening for any sounds .
0	but this time the staircase was completely empty ; all the doors were closed ; he didn ’ t encounter anyone at all .
0	however , on the second floor , the door to one empty apartment stood wide open and painters were working inside it , but they didn ’ t even notice him . he stood there a while , thought a bit , and walked on . of course , it would be better if no one were here at all , but .
0	there are two more floors above them .
0	but here ’ s the fourth floor , here ’ s the door , and here ’ s the apartment directly opposite ; that one ’ s also empty . on the third floor , by all indications , the apartment right under the old woman ’ s was unoccupied as well : the nameplate , nailed to the door , had been removed—they must have moved away !
0	he gasped for breath .
0	for one moment , a thought flashed through his mind : should i leave ?
0	but he didn ’ t heed it and began listening at the door to the old woman ’ s apartment : dead silence .
0	then he listened again for sounds on the staircase , listening attentively , for a long time . then he glanced around for the last time , crept up to the door , straightened his clothes , and adjusted the axe in its loop again .
0	am i much too agitated ?
1	he had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase .
1	his garret was under the roof of a high , five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room .
1	the landlady who provided him with garret , dinners , and attendance , lived on the floor below , and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen , the door of which invariably stood open .
1	and each time he passed , the young man had a sick , frightened feeling , which made him scowl and feel ashamed .
1	he was hopelessly in debt to his landlady , and was afraid of meeting her .
1	this was not because he was cowardly and abject , quite the contrary ; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition , verging on hypochondria .
1	he had become so completely absorbed in himself , and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting , not only his landlady , but anyone at all .
1	he was crushed by poverty , but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him .
1	he had given up attending to matters of practical importance ; he had lost all desire to do so . nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him . but to be stopped on the stairs , to be forced to listen to her trivial , irrelevant gossip , to pestering demands for payment , threats and complaints , and to rack his brains for excuses , to prevaricate , to lie—no , rather than that , he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen .
1	this evening , however , on coming out into the street , he became acutely aware of his fears .
1	i want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles , he thought , with an odd smile .
1	hm ... yes , all is in a man 's hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice , that 's an axiom .
1	it would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of .
1	taking a new step , uttering a new word is what they fear most ... . but i am talking too much .
1	it 's because i chatter that i do nothing .
1	or perhaps it is that i chatter because i do nothing .
1	i 've learned to chatter this last month , lying for days together in my den thinking ... of jack the giant‐killer .
1	why am i going there now ?
1	am i capable of that ?
1	it is not serious at all .
1	it 's simply a fantasy to amuse myself ; a plaything !
1	the heat in the street was terrible : and the airlessness , the bustle and the plaster , scaffolding , bricks , and dust all about him , and that special petersburg stench , so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked painfully upon the young man 's already overwrought nerves . the insufferable stench from the pothouses , which are particularly numerous in that part of the town , and the drunken men whom he met continually , although it was a working day , completed the revolting misery of the picture .
1	an expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man 's refined face .
1	he was , by the way , exceptionally handsome , above the average in height , slim , well‐built , with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair .
1	soon he sank into deep thought , or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind ; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it .
1	from time to time , he would mutter something , from the habit of talking to himself , to which he had just confessed .
1	at these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak ; for two days he had scarcely tasted food .
1	he was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags .
1	in that quarter of the town , however , scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise .
1	owing to the proximity of the hay market , the number of establishments of bad character , the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of petersburg , types so various were to be seen in the streets that no figure , however queer , would have caused surprise . but there was such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man 's heart , that , in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth , he minded his rags least of all in the street . it was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students , whom , indeed , he disliked meeting at any time .
1	and yet when a drunken man who , for some unknown reason , was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse , suddenly shouted at him as he drove past : hey there , german hatter bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat . it was a tall round hat from zimmerman 's , but completely worn out , rusty with age , all torn and bespattered , brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion . not shame , however , but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him .
1	but even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal .
1	i knew it , he muttered in confusion , i thought so !
1	just what i thought !
1	hence the pot‐house !
1	he pounced upon raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month .
1	for beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick , he is swept out with a broom , so as to make it as humiliating as possible ; and quite right , too , forasmuch as in beggary i am ready to be the first to humiliate myself .
1	yet i know too that drunkenness is not a virtue , and that that 's even truer .
1	but allow me ... . he got up , staggered , took up his jug and glass , and sat down beside the young man , facing him a little sideways .
1	honoured sir , a month ago mr. lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating , and my wife is a very different matter from me !
1	no , i have not happened to , answered raskolnikov .
1	what do you mean ?
1	a month ago when mr .
1	excuse me , young man , has it ever happened to you ... hm ... well , to petition hopelessly for a loan ?
1	it seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days .
1	why am i not at my duty , honoured sir , marmeladov went on , addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov , as though it had been he who put that question to him .
1	evidently marmeladov was a familiar figure here , and he had most likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern .
1	this habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards , and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home .
1	the innkeeper came down from the upper room , apparently on purpose to listen to the funny fellow and sat down at a little distance , yawning lazily , but with dignity .
1	well , i 've just come from one and it 's the fifth night i 've slept so ... . he filled his glass , emptied it and paused .
1	and why do n't you work , why are n't you at your duty , if you are in the service ?
1	lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his own hands , and i lay drunk , did n't i suffer ?
1	bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair .
1	they were fat and red , with black nails .
1	his conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest .
1	the boys at the counter fell to sniggering .
1	hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify themselves and even if possible obtain consideration .
1	why am i not at my duty ?
1	does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm i am ?
1	but what do you mean by hopelessly ?
1	hopelessly in the fullest sense , when you know beforehand that you will get nothing by it .
1	you know , for instance , beforehand with positive certainty that this man , this most reputable and exemplary citizen , will on no consideration give you money ; and indeed i ask you why should he ?
1	for he knows of course that i sha n't pay it back .
1	but mr. lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself , and that that 's what is done now in england , where there is political economy . why , i ask you , should he give it to me ?
1	and yet though i know beforehand that he wo n't , i set off to him and ... why do you go ?
1	well , when one has no one , nowhere else one can go !
1	for every man must have somewhere to go .
1	since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere !
1	when my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket , then i had to go ... ( for my daughter has a yellow passport ) , he added in parenthesis , looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man . no matter , sir , no matter !
1	he went on hurriedly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled—no matter , i am not confounded by the wagging of their heads ; for everyone knows everything about it already , and all that is secret is made open . and i accept it all , not with contempt , but with humility .
1	excuse me , young man , can you ... . no , to put it more strongly and more distinctly ; not can you but dare you , looking upon me , assert that i am not a pig ? the young man did not answer a word .
1	well , the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity , after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside .
1	well , so be it , i am a pig , but she is a lady !
1	i have the semblance of a beast , but katerina ivanovna , my spouse , is a person of education and an officer 's daughter .
1	granted , granted , i am a scoundrel , but she is a woman of a noble heart , full of sentiments , refined by education .
1	and yet ... oh , if only she felt for me !
1	honoured sir , honoured sir , you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him !
1	but katerina ivanovna , though she is magnanimous , she is unjust ... . and yet , although i realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for i repeat without being ashamed , she pulls my hair , young man , he declared with redoubled dignity , hearing the sniggering again—but , my god , if she would but once ... . but no , no ! it 's all in vain and it 's no use talking !
1	for more than once , my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but ... such is my fate and i am a beast by nature !
1	marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table .
1	such is my fate !
1	do you know , sir , do you know , i have sold her very stockings for drink ?
1	not her shoes—that would be more or less in the order of things , but her stockings , her stockings i have sold for drink !
1	her mohair shawl i sold for drink , a present to her long ago , her own property , not mine ; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too .
1	we have three little children and katerina ivanovna is at work from morning till night ; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children , for she 's been used to cleanliness from a child . but her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and i feel it !
1	and the more i drink the more i feel it .
1	that 's why i drink too . i try to find sympathy and feeling in drink ... . i drink so that i may suffer twice as much !
1	and as though in despair he laid his head down on the table .
1	young man , he went on , raising his head again , in your face i seem to read some trouble of mind .
1	for in unfolding to you the story of my life , i do not wish to make myself a laughing‐stock before these idle listeners , who indeed know all about it already , but i am looking for a man of feeling and education .
1	know then that my wife was educated in a high‐class school for the daughters of noblemen , and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit .
1	the medal ... well , the medal of course was sold—long ago , hm ... but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady .
1	and although she is most continually on bad terms with the landlady , yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone .
1	i do n't condemn her for it , i do n't blame her , for the one thing left her is recollection of the past , and all the rest is dust and ashes .
1	yes , yes , she is a lady of spirit , proud and determined .
1	she scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat , but wo n't allow herself to be treated with disrespect .
1	that 's why she would not overlook mr. lebeziatnikov 's rudeness to her , and so when he gave her a beating for it , she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows .
1	she was a widow when i married her , with three children , one smaller than the other .
1	she married her first husband , an infantry officer , for love , and ran away with him from her father 's house .
1	she was exceedingly fond of her husband ; but he gave way to cards , got into trouble and with that he died .
1	he used to beat her at the end : and although she paid him back , of which i have authentic documentary evidence , to this day she speaks of him with tears and she throws him up to me ; and i am glad , i am glad that , though only in imagination , she should think of herself as having once been happy ... . and she was left at his death with three children in a wild and remote district where i happened to be at the time ; and she was left in such hopeless poverty that , although i have seen many ups and downs of all sort , i do n't feel equal to describing it even .
1	and she was proud , too , excessively proud ... . and then , honoured sir , and then , i , being at the time a widower , with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife , offered her my hand , for i could not bear the sight of such suffering .
1	you can judge the extremity of her calamities , that she , a woman of education and culture and distinguished family , should have consented to be my wife .
1	weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands , she married me !
1	for she had nowhere to turn !
1	do you understand , sir , do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn ?
1	no , that you do n't understand yet ... . and for a whole year , i performed my duties conscientiously and faithfully , and did not touch this ( he tapped the jug with his finger ) , for i have feelings .
1	but even so , i could not please her ; and then i lost my place too , and that through no fault of mine but through changes in the office ; and then i did touch it ! ...
1	it will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent capital , adorned with innumerable monuments . here i obtained a situation ... . i obtained it and i lost it again .
1	this time it was through my own fault i lost it : for my weakness had come out ... . we have now part of a room at amalia fyodorovna lippevechsel 's ; and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with , i could not say .
1	there are a lot of people living there besides ourselves .
1	dirt and disorder , a perfect bedlam ... hm ... yes ... and meanwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up ; and what my daughter has had to put up with from her step‐mother whilst she was growing up , i wo n't speak of . for , though katerina ivanovna is full of generous feelings , she is a spirited lady , irritable and short—tempered ... . yes .
1	but it 's no use going over that !
1	sonia , as you may well fancy , has had no education . i did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history , but as i was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books , and what books we had ... hm , anyway we have not even those now , so all our instruction came to an end .
1	we stopped at cyrus of persia . since she has attained years of maturity , she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through mr. lebeziatnikov , lewes ' physiology—do you know it ? —and even recounted extracts from it to us : and that 's the whole of her education .
1	and now may i venture to address you , honoured sir , on my own account with a private question . do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work ?
1	not fifteen farthings a day can she earn , if she is respectable and has no special talent and that without putting her work down for an instant ! and what 's more , ivan ivanitch klopstock the civil counsellor—have you heard of him ? —has not to this day paid her for the half‐dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her roughly away , stamping and reviling her , on the pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were put in askew .
1	and there are the little ones hungry ... . and katerina ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands , her cheeks flushed red , as they always are in that disease : 'here you live with us , says she , 'you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help . and much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little ones for three days !
1	i was lying drunk and i heard my sonia speaking ( she is a gentle creature with a soft little voice ... fair hair and such a pale , thin little face ) . she said : 'katerina ivanovna , am i really to do a thing like that ? and darya frantsovna , a woman of evil character and very well known to the police , had two or three times tried to get at her through the landlady .
1	said katerina ivanovna with a jeer , 'you are something mighty precious to be so careful of !
1	but do n't blame her , do n't blame her , honoured sir , do n't blame her ! she was not herself when she spoke , but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry children ; and it was said more to wound her than anything else ... . for that 's katerina ivanovna 's character , and when children cry , even from hunger , she falls to beating them at once .
1	at six o'clock i saw sonia get up , put on her kerchief and her cape , and go out of the room and about nine o'clock she came back . she walked straight up to katerina ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her in silence .
1	she did not utter a word , she did not even look at her , she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl ( we have a shawl , made of drap de dames ) , put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall ; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering ... . and i went on lying there , just as before ... . and then i saw , young man , i saw katerina ivanovna , in the same silence go up to sonia 's little bed ; she was on her knees all the evening kissing sonia 's feet , and would not get up , and then they both fell asleep in each other 's arms ... together , together ... yes ... and i ... lay drunk . marmeladov stopped short , as though his voice had failed him .
1	then he hurriedly filled his glass , drank , and cleared his throat . since then , sir , he went on after a brief pause—since then , owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil‐intentioned persons—in all which darya frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect—since then my daughter sofya semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket , and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us . for our landlady , amalia fyodorovna would not hear of it ( though she had backed up darya frantsovna before ) and mr. lebeziatnikov too ... hm ... . all the trouble between him and katerina ivanovna was on sonia 's account .
1	at first he was for making up to sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity : 'how , said he , 'can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that ?
1	and katerina ivanovna would not let it pass , she stood up for her ... and so that 's how it happened .
1	and sonia comes to us now , mostly after dark ; she comforts katerina ivanovna and gives her all she can ... . she has a room at the kapernaumovs ' the tailors , she lodges with them ; kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too .
1	they all live in one room , but sonia has her own , partitioned off ... . hm ... yes ... very poor people and all with cleft palates ... yes .
1	and his wife , too , has a cleft palate .
1	then i got up in the morning , and put on my rags , lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his excellency ivan afanasyvitch .
1	his excellency ivan afanasyvitch , do you know him ?
1	well , then , it 's a man of god you do n't know .
1	he is wax ... wax before the face of the lord ; even as wax melteth ! ...
1	'marmeladov , once already you have deceived my expectations ... i 'll take you once more on my own responsibility'—that 's what he said , 'remember , he said , 'and now you can go .
1	i kissed the dust at his feet—in thought only , for in reality he would not have allowed me to do it , being a statesman and a man of modern political and enlightened ideas . i returned home , and when i announced that i 'd been taken back into the service and should receive a salary , heavens , what a to‐do there was ! ...
1	at that moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came in from the street , and the sounds of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing the hamlet were heard in the entry .
1	the tavern‐keeper and the boys were busy with the new‐comers . marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story .
1	he appeared by now to be extremely weak , but as he became more and more drunk , he became more and more talkative .
1	the recollection of his recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him , and was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face . that was five weeks ago , sir .
1	yes ... . as soon as katerina ivanovna and sonia heard of it , mercy on us , it was as though i stepped into the kingdom of heaven . it used to be : you can lie like a beast , nothing but abuse .
1	now they were walking on tiptoe , hushing the children . 'semyon zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office , he is resting , shh !
1	they made me coffee before i went to work and boiled cream for me ! they began to get real cream for me , do you hear that ? and how they managed to get together the money for a decent outfit—eleven roubles , fifty copecks , i ca n't guess .
1	boots , cotton shirt‐fronts— most magnificent , a uniform , they got up all in splendid style , for eleven roubles and a half .
1	the first morning i came back from the office i found katerina ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—soup and salt meat with horse radish—which we had never dreamed of till then .
1	she had not any dresses ... none at all , but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit ; and not that she 'd anything to do it with , she smartened herself up with nothing at all , she 'd done her hair nicely , put on a clean collar of some sort , cuffs , and there she was , quite a different person , she was younger and better looking . sonia , my little darling , had only helped with money 'for the time , she said , 'it wo n't do for me to come and see you too often . after dark maybe when no one can see .
1	do you hear , do you hear ?
1	do you hear , do you hear ?
1	'to be sure , says he , 'semyon zaharovitch , remembering your past services , says he , 'and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness , since you promise now and since moreover we 've got on badly without you , ( do you hear , do you hear ; ) 'and so ,
1	do you hear , do you hear ?
1	and all that , let me tell you , she has simply made up for herself , and not simply out of wantonness , for the sake of bragging ; no , she believes it all herself , she amuses herself with her own fancies , upon my word she does !
1	and i do n't blame her for it , no , i do n't blame her ! ... six days ago when i brought her my first earnings in full—twenty‐three roubles forty copecks altogether—she called me her poppet : 'poppet , said she , 'my little poppet . and when we were by ourselves , you understand ?
1	well , she pinched my cheek , 'my little poppet , said she .
1	marmeladov broke off , tried to smile , but suddenly his chin began to twitch .
1	the tavern , the degraded appearance of the man , the five nights in the hay barge , and the pot of spirits , and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered his listener . raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation .
1	honoured sir , honoured sir , cried marmeladov recovering himself—oh , sir , perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you , as it does to others , and perhaps i am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of my home life , but it is not a laughing matter to me .
1	for i can feel it all ... . and the whole of that heavenly day of my life and the whole of that evening i passed in fleeting dreams of how i would arrange it all , and how i would dress all the children , and how i should give her rest , and how i should rescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to the bosom of her family ... .
1	well , then , sir ( marmeladov suddenly gave a sort of start , raised his head and gazed intently at his listener ) well , on the very next day after all those dreams , that is to say , exactly five days ago , in the evening , by a cunning trick , like a thief in the night , i stole from katerina ivanovna the key of her box , took out what was left of my earnings , how much it was i have forgotten , and now look at me , all of you !
1	it 's the fifth day since i left home , and they are looking for me there and it 's the end of my employment , and my uniform is lying in a tavern on the egyptian bridge . i exchanged it for the garments i have on ... and it 's the end of everything !
1	marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist , clenched his teeth , closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table .
1	but a minute later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bravado , he glanced at raskolnikov , laughed and said : this morning i went to see sonia , i went to ask her for a pick‐me‐up ! you do n't say she gave it to you ?
1	cried one of the new‐comers ; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw .
1	this very quart was bought with her money , marmeladov declared , addressing himself exclusively to raskolnikov .
1	thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands , her last , all she had , as i saw ... . she said nothing , she only looked at me without a word ... . not on earth , but up yonder ... they grieve over men , they weep , but they do n't blame them , they do n't blame them !
1	but it hurts more , it hurts more when they do n't blame !
1	and maybe she needs them now , eh ?
1	what do you think , my dear sir ?
1	for now she 's got to keep up her appearance .
1	it costs money , that smartness , that special smartness , you know ?
1	and there 's pomatum , too , you see , she must have things ; petticoats , starched ones , shoes , too , real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle . do you understand , sir , do you understand what all that smartness means ?
1	and here i , her own father , here i took thirty copecks of that money for a drink !
1	come , who will have pity on a man like me , eh ?
1	are you sorry for me , sir , or not ?
1	tell me , sir , are you sorry or not ?
1	he would have filled his glass , but there was no drink left .
1	the pot was empty .
1	why am i to be pitied , you say ?
1	shouts of laughter and even oaths followed .
1	the laughter and the oaths came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged government clerk .
1	marmeladov suddenly declaimed , standing up with his arm outstretched , as though he had been only waiting for that question .
1	there 's nothing to pity me for !
1	i ought to be crucified , crucified on a cross , not pitied !
1	crucify me , oh judge , crucify me but pity me !
1	and then i will go of myself to be crucified , for it 's not merry-making i seek but tears and tribulation ! ...
1	do you suppose , you that sell , that this pint of yours has been sweet to me ?
1	it was tribulation i sought at the bottom of it , tears and tribulation , and have found it , and i have tasted it ; but he will pity us who has had pity on all men , who has understood all men and all things , he is the one , he too is the judge .
1	he will come in that day and he will ask : 'where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross , consumptive step‐mother and for the little children of another ?
1	where is the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard , her earthly father , undismayed by his beastliness ? and he will say , 'come to me !
1	i have already forgiven thee once ... . i have forgiven thee once ... . thy sins which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much ... . and he will forgive my sonia , he will forgive , i know it ... i felt it in my heart when i was with her just now !
1	and he will judge and will forgive all , the good and the evil , the wise and the meek ... . and when he has done with all of them , then he will summon us . 'you too come forth , he will say , 'come forth ye drunkards , come forth , ye weak ones , come forth , ye children of shame !
1	and we shall all come forth , without shame and shall stand before him .
1	and he will say unto us , 'ye are swine , made in the image of the beast and with his mark ; but come ye also !
1	and the wise ones and those of understanding will say , 'oh lord , why dost thou receive these men ?
1	and he will say , 'this is why i receive them , oh ye wise , this is why i receive them , oh ye of understanding , that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this .
1	and he will hold out his hands to us and we shall fall down before him ... and we shall weep ... and we shall understand all things !
1	then we shall understand all ! ...
1	and all will understand , katerina ivanovna even ... she will understand ... . lord , thy kingdom come !
1	and he sank down on the bench exhausted , and helpless , looking at no one , apparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep thought .
1	his words had created a certain impression ; there was a moment of silence ; but soon laughter and oaths were heard again .
1	and so on , and so on .
1	let us go , sir , said marmeladov all at once , raising his head and addressing raskolnikov—come along with me ...
1	kozel 's house , looking into the yard .
1	raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to help him .
1	marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the young man .
1	they had two or three hundred paces to go .
1	the drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and confusion as they drew nearer the house .
1	it 's not katerina ivanovna i am afraid of now , he muttered in agitation—and that she will begin pulling my hair .
1	what does my hair matter !
1	that 's what i say !
1	indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it , that 's not what i am afraid of ... it 's her eyes i am afraid of ... yes , her eyes ... the red on her cheeks , too , frightens me ... and her breathing too ... . have you noticed how people in that disease breathe ... when they are excited ?
1	i am frightened of the children 's crying , too ... . for if sonia has not taken them food ... i do n't know what 's happened !
1	i do n't know ! but blows i am not afraid of ... . know , sir , that such blows are not a pain to me , but even an enjoyment .
1	in fact i ca n't get on without it ... . it 's better so . let her strike me , it relieves her heart ... it 's better so ... there is the house .
1	the house of kozel , the cabinet-maker ... a german , well‐to‐do .
1	they went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey .
1	the staircase got darker and darker as they went up .
1	it was nearly eleven o'clock and although in summer in petersburg there is no real night , yet it was quite dark at the top of the stairs .
1	a grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar . a very poor‐looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle‐end ; the whole of it was visible from the entrance .
1	it was all in disorder , littered up with rags of all sorts , especially children 's garments . across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet . behind it probably was the bed .
1	there was nothing in the room except two chairs and a sofa covered with american leather , full of holes , before which stood an old deal kitchen‐table , unpainted and uncovered .
1	at the edge of the table stood a smoldering tallow‐candle in an iron candlestick .
1	it appeared that the family had a room to themselves , not part of a room , but their room was practically a passage . the door leading to the other rooms , or rather cupboards , into which amalia lippevechsel 's flat was divided stood half open , and there was shouting , uproar and laughter within .
1	people seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there .
1	raskolnikov recognised katerina ivanovna at once .
1	she was a rather tall , slim and graceful woman , terribly emaciated , with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks .
1	she was pacing up and down in her little room , pressing her hands against her chest ; her lips were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps . her eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare . and that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the candle‐end playing upon it made a sickening impression .
1	she seemed to raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for marmeladov ... . she had not heard them and did not notice them coming in . she seemed to be lost in thought , hearing and seeing nothing .
1	the room was close , but she had not opened the window ; a stench rose from the staircase , but the door on to the stairs was not closed . from the inner rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in , she kept coughing , but did not close the door .
1	the youngest child , a girl of six , was asleep , sitting curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa . a boy a year older stood crying and shaking in the corner , probably he had just had a beating .
1	beside him stood a girl of nine years old , tall and thin , wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung over her bare shoulders , long outgrown and barely reaching her knees . her arm , as thin as a stick , was round her brother 's neck .
1	she was trying to comfort him , whispering something to him , and doing all she could to keep him from whimpering again . at the same time her large dark eyes , which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened face , were watching her mother with alarm .
1	marmeladov did not enter the door , but dropped on his knees in the very doorway , pushing raskolnikov in front of him . the woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him , coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he had come for . but evidently she decided that he was going into the next room , as he had to pass through hers to get there .
1	she cried out in a frenzy , he has come back !
1	and where is the money ?
1	what 's in your pocket , show me !
1	where are your clothes ?
1	where is the money !
1	and she fell to searching him . marmeladov submissively and obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search .
1	not a farthing was there .
1	where is the money ?
1	she cried—mercy on us , can he have drunk it all ?
1	there were twelve silver roubles left in the chest !
1	and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room .
1	marmeladov seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees .
1	this does not hurt me , but is a positive con‐so‐la‐tion , ho‐nou‐red sir , he called out , shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead .
1	the child asleep on the floor woke up , and began to cry .
1	the boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror , almost in a fit .
1	the eldest girl was shaking like a leaf .
1	he 's drunk it !
1	he 's drunk it all , the poor woman screamed in despair—and his clothes are gone !
1	and they are hungry , hungry ! —and wringing her hands she pointed to the children .
1	and you , are you not ashamed ? —she pounced all at once upon raskolnikov—from the tavern !
1	have you been drinking with him ?
1	you have been drinking with him , too !
1	the young man was hastening away without uttering a word .
1	coarse laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in at the doorway . further in could be seen figures in dressing gowns flung open , in costumes of unseemly scantiness , some of them with cards in their hands .
1	they were particularly diverted , when marmeladov , dragged about by his hair , shouted that it was a consolation to him .
1	they even began to come into the room ; at last a sinister shrill outcry was heard : this came from amalia lippevechsel herself pushing her way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day .
1	as he went out , raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket , to snatch up the coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to lay them unnoticed on the window . afterwards on the stairs , he changed his mind and would have gone back .
1	but reflecting that it would be impossible to take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it , he dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging . sonia wants pomatum too , he said as he walked along the street , and he laughed malignantly—such smartness costs money ... . hm !
1	and maybe sonia herself will be bankrupt to‐day , for there is always a risk , hunting big game ... digging for gold ... then they would all be without a crust to‐morrow except for my money .
1	what a mine they 've dug there !
1	and they 're making the most of it !
1	they 've wept over it and grown used to it .
1	he sank into thought . and what if i am wrong , he cried suddenly after a moment 's thought .
1	what if man is not really a scoundrel , man in general , i mean , the whole race of mankind—then all the rest is prejudice , simply artificial terrors and there are no barriers and it 's all as it should be .
1	he waked up late next day after a broken sleep .
1	but his sleep had not refreshed him ; he waked up bilious , irritable , ill‐tempered , and looked with hatred at his room .
1	it was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length . it had a poverty‐stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls , and it was so low‐pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling . the furniture was in keeping with the room : there were three old chairs , rather rickety ; a painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books ; the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long untouched .
1	a big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and half the floor space of the room ; it was once covered with chintz , but was now in rags and served raskolnikov as a bed . often he went to sleep on it , as he was , without undressing , without sheets , wrapped in his old student 's overcoat , with his head on one little pillow , under which he heaped up all the linen he had , clean and dirty , by way of a bolster .
1	a little table stood in front of the sofa .
1	it would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder , but to raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable .
1	he had got completely away from everyone , like a tortoise in its shell , and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation .
1	he was in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing .
1	his landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him in meals , and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her , though he went without his dinner .
1	nastasya , the cook and only servant , was rather pleased at the lodger 's mood and had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room , only once a week or so she would stray into his room with a broom .
1	she waked him up that day .
1	get up , why are you asleep ?
1	she called to him .
1	it 's past nine , i have brought you some tea ; will you have a cup ?
1	raskolnikov opened his eyes , started and recognised nastasya .
1	from the landlady , eh ?
1	he asked , slowly and with a sickly face sitting up on the sofa .
1	she set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it .
1	here , nastasya , take it please , he said , fumbling in his pocket ( for he had slept in his clothes ) and taking out a handful of coppers—run and buy me a loaf .
1	and get me a little sausage , the cheapest , at the pork‐butcher 's .
1	the loaf i 'll fetch you this very minute , but would n't you rather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage ?
1	i saved it for you yesterday , but you came in late .
1	it 's fine soup .
1	when the soup had been brought , and he had begun upon it , nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting . she was a country peasant‐woman and a very talkative one .
1	praskovya pavlovna means to complain to the police about you , she said .
1	what does she want ?
1	you do n't pay her money and you wo n't turn out of the room .
1	that 's what she wants , to be sure .
1	the devil , that 's the last straw , he muttered , grinding his teeth , no , that would not suit me ... just now .
1	she is a fool , he added aloud .
1	i 'll go and talk to her to‐day .
1	fool she is and no mistake , just as i am .
1	but why , if you are so clever , do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it ? one time you used to go out , you say , to teach children .
1	what are you doing ?
1	work ... what sort of work ?
1	i am thinking , he answered seriously after a pause .
1	nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter .
1	she was given to laughter and when anything amused her , she laughed inaudibly , quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill .
1	and have you made much money by your thinking ?
1	she managed to articulate at last .
1	one ca n't go out to give lessons without boots .
1	he answered , reluctantly , as though replying to his own thought .
1	and you want to get a fortune all at once ? he looked at her strangely .
1	yes , i want a fortune , he answered firmly , after a brief pause .
1	do n't be in such a hurry , you quite frighten me !
1	shall i get you the loaf or not ?
1	a letter came for you yesterday when you were out .
1	i ca n't say .
1	i gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it .
1	will you pay me back ?
1	then bring it to me , for god 's sake , bring it , cried raskolnikov greatly excited—good god !
1	a minute later the letter was brought him .
1	that was it : from his mother , from the province of r—— .
1	he turned pale when he took it .
1	it was a long while since he had received a letter , but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his heart .
1	nastasya , leave me alone , for goodness ' sake ; here are your three copecks , but for goodness ' sake , make haste and go !
1	the letter was quivering in his hand ; he did not want to open it in her presence ; he wanted to be left alone with this letter .
1	when nastasya had gone out , he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it ; then he gazed intently at the address , the small , sloping handwriting , so dear and familiar , of the mother who had once taught him to read and write .
1	he delayed ; he seemed almost afraid of something .
1	at last he opened it ; it was a thick heavy letter , weighing over two ounces , two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting . my dear rodya , wrote his mother—it 's two months since i last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me awake at night , thinking .
1	but i am sure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence .
1	you know how i love you ; you are all we have to look to , dounia and i , you are our all , our one hope , our one stay .
1	what a grief it was to me when i heard that you had given up the university some months ago , for want of means to keep yourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other work !
1	how could i help you out of my hundred and twenty roubles a year pension ?
1	the fifteen roubles i sent you four months ago i borrowed , as you know , on security of my pension , from vassily ivanovitch vahrushin a merchant of this town .
1	he is a kind‐hearted man and was a friend of your father 's too .
1	but having given him the right to receive the pension , i had to wait till the debt was paid off and that is only just done , so that i 've been unable to send you anything all this time . but now , thank god , i believe i shall be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate ourselves on our good fortune now , of which i hasten to inform you .
1	in the first place , would you have guessed , dear rodya , that your sister has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in the future .
1	thank god , her sufferings are over , but i will tell you everything in order , so that you may know just how everything has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you .
1	when you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that dounia had a great deal to put up with in the svidrigraïlovs ' house , when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it—what could i write in answer to you ? if i had written the whole truth to you , i dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us , even if you had to walk all the way , for i know your character and your feelings , and you would not let your sister be insulted .
1	i was in despair myself , but what could i do ?
1	and , besides , i did not know the whole truth myself then .
1	what made it all so difficult was that dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family , on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month , and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt .
1	this sum ( now i can explain it all to you , my precious rodya ) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles , which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year .
1	we deceived you then , writing that this money came from dounia 's savings , but that was not so , and now i tell you all about it , because , thank god , things have suddenly changed for the better , and that you may know how dounia loves you and what a heart she has .
1	at first indeed mr. svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table ... .
1	but i do n't want to go into all those painful details , so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over .
1	in short , in spite of the kind and generous behaviour of marfa petrovna , mr. svidrigaïlov 's wife , and all the rest of the household , dounia had a very hard time , especially when mr. svidrigaïlov , relapsing into his old regimental habits , was under the influence of bacchus .
1	and how do you think it was all explained later on ?
1	would you believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for dounia from the beginning , but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt .
1	possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes , considering his years and his being the father of a family ; and that made him angry with dounia .
1	and possibly , too , he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others .
1	but at last he lost all control and had the face to make dounia an open and shameful proposal , promising her all sorts of inducements and offering , besides , to throw up everything and take her to another estate of his , or even abroad .
1	you can imagine all she went through !
1	to leave her situation at once was impossible not only on account of the money debt , but also to spare the feelings of marfa petrovna , whose suspicions would have been aroused : and then dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family . and it would have meant a terrible scandal for dounia too ; that would have been inevitable . there were various other reasons owing to which dounia could not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks .
1	you know dounia , of course ; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she has .
1	dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness .
1	she did not even write to me about everything for fear of upsetting me , although we were constantly in communication .
1	it all ended very unexpectedly .
1	marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dounia in the garden , and , putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position , threw the blame upon her , believing her to be the cause of it all .
1	an awful scene took place between them on the spot in the garden ; marfa petrovna went so far as to strike dounia , refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that dounia should be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant 's cart , into which they flung all her things , her linen and her clothes , all pell‐mell , without folding it up and packing it .
1	and a heavy shower of rain came on , too , and dounia , insulted and put to shame , had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen versts into town .
1	only think now what answer could i have sent to the letter i received from you two months ago and what could i have written ?
1	i was in despair ; i dared not write to you the truth because you would have been very unhappy , mortified and indignant , and yet what could you do ?
1	you could only perhaps ruin yourself , and , besides , dounia would not allow it ; and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow , i could not . for a whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal , and it came to such a pass that dounia and i dared not even go to church on account of the contemptuous looks , whispers , and even remarks made aloud about us .
1	all our acquaintances avoided us , nobody even bowed to us in the street , and i learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful way , smearing the gates of our house with pitch , so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave . all this was set going by marfa petrovna who managed to slander dounia and throw dirt at her in every family .
1	she knows everyone in the neighbourhood , and that month she was continually coming into the town , and as she is rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband—which is not at all right—so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the town , but over the whole surrounding district . it made me ill , but dounia bore it better than i did , and if only you could have seen how she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up !
1	she is an angel ! but by god 's mercy , our sufferings were cut short : mr. svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and , probably feeling sorry for dounia , he laid before marfa petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of dounia 's innocence , in the form of a letter dounia had been forced to write and give to him , before marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden . this letter , which remained in mr. svidrigaïlov 's hands after her departure , she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews , for which he was entreating her .
1	in that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to marfa petrovna , reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl , unhappy enough already .
1	indeed , dear rodya , the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that i sobbed when i read it and to this day i can not read it without tears .
1	moreover , the evidence of the servants , too , cleared dounia 's reputation ; they had seen and known a great deal more than mr. svidrigaïlov had himself supposed—as indeed is always the case with servants .
1	marfa petrovna was completely taken aback , and 'again crushed ' as she said herself to us , but she was completely convinced of dounia 's innocence .
1	the very next day , being sunday , she went straight to the cathedral , knelt down and prayed with tears to our lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty .
1	then she came straight from the cathedral to us , told us the whole story , wept bitterly and , fully penitent , she embraced dounia and besought her to forgive her .
1	the same morning without any delay , she went round to all the houses in the town and everywhere , shedding tears , she asserted in the most flattering terms dounia 's innocence and the nobility of her feelings and her behavior .
1	what was more , she showed and read to everyone the letter in dounia 's own handwriting to mr. svidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it—which i must say i think was superfluous .
1	in this way she was busy for several days in driving about the whole town , because some people had taken offence through precedence having been given to others . and therefore they had to take turns , so that in every house she was expected before she arrived , and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would be reading the letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it , even many who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in other people 's .
1	anyway she succeeded in completely re‐establishing dounia 's reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband , as the only person to blame , so that i really began to feel sorry for him ; it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly .
1	dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families , but she refused .
1	all of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which , one may say , our whole fortunes are now transformed . you must know , dear rodya , that dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry him .
1	i hasten to tell you all about the matter , and though it has been arranged without asking your consent , i think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on that account , for you will see that we could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you .
1	and you could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot .
1	this was how it happened .
1	he is already of the rank of a counsellor , pyotr petrovitch luzhin , and is distantly related to marfa petrovna , who has been very active in bringing the match about .
1	it began with his expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance . he was properly received , drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer .
1	he is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get to petersburg , so that every moment is precious to him .
1	at first , of course , we were greatly surprised , as it had all happened so quickly and unexpectedly . we thought and talked it over the whole day .
1	he is a well‐to‐do man , to be depended upon , he has two posts in the government and has already made his fortune . it is true that he is forty‐five years old , but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women , and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man , only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited .
1	and beware , dear rodya , when he comes to petersburg , as he shortly will do , beware of judging him too hastily and severely , as your way is , if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight . i give you this warning , although i feel sure that he will make a favourable impression upon you .
1	moreover , in order to understand any man one must be deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas , which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards .
1	and pyotr petrovitch , judging by many indications , is a thoroughly estimable man .
1	at his first visit , indeed , he told us that he was a practical man , but still he shares , as he expressed it , many of the convictions 'of our most rising generation ' and he is an opponent of all prejudices . he said a good deal more , for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to , but this is scarcely a vice .
1	i , of course , understood very little of it , but dounia explained to me that , though he is not a man of great education , he is clever and seems to be good‐natured .
1	you know your sister 's character , rodya .
1	she is a resolute , sensible , patient and generous girl , but she has a passionate heart , as i know very well . of course , there is no great love either on his side , or on hers , but dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel , and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her happiness his care . of that we have no good reason to doubt , though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste .
1	besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see , to be sure , of himself , that his own happiness will be the more secure , the happier dounia is with him .
1	and as for some defects of character , for some habits and even certain differences of opinion—which indeed are inevitable even in the happiest marriages—dounia has said that , as regards all that , she relies on herself , that there is nothing to be uneasy about , and that she is ready to put up with a great deal , if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one . he struck me , for instance , at first , as rather abrupt , but that may well come from his being an outspoken man , and that is no doubt how it is .
1	for instance , at his second visit , after he had received dounia 's consent , in the course of conversation , he declared that before making dounia 's acquaintance , he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation , without dowry and , above all , one who had experienced poverty , because , as he explained , a man ought not to be indebted to his wife , but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor .
1	i must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely than i have done , for i have forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning . and , besides , it was obviously not said of design , but slipped out in the heat of conversation , so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it over , but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude , and i said so afterwards to dounia .
1	but dounia was vexed , and answered that 'words are not deeds , and that , of course , is perfectly true .
1	dounia did not sleep all night before she made up her mind , and , thinking that i was asleep , she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night ; at last she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me that she had decided .
1	i have mentioned already that pyotr petrovitch is just setting off for petersburg , where he has a great deal of business , and he wants to open a legal bureau . he has been occupied for many years in conducting civil and commercial litigation , and only the other day he won an important case .
1	he has to be in petersburg because he has an important case before the senate .
1	so , rodya dear , he may be of the greatest use to you , in every way indeed , and dounia and i have agreed that from this very day you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that your future is marked out and assured for you .
1	oh , if only this comes to pass !
1	this would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a providential blessing . dounia is dreaming of nothing else .
1	we have even ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to pyotr petrovitch . he was cautious in his answer , and said that , of course , as he could not get on without a secretary , it would be better to be paying a salary to a relation than to a stranger , if only the former were fitted for the duties ( as though there could be doubt of your being fitted ! )
1	but then he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave you time for work at his office .
1	the matter dropped for the time , but dounia is thinking of nothing else now .
1	she has been in a sort of fever for the last few days , and has already made a regular plan for your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in pyotr petrovitch 's business , which might well be , seeing that you are a student of law .
1	i am in complete agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , and think there is every probability of realising them .
1	and in spite of pyotr petrovitch 's evasiveness , very natural at present ( since he does not know you ) , dounia is firmly persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her future husband ; this she is reckoning upon .
1	of course we are careful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to pyotr petrovitch , especially of your becoming his partner . he is a practical man and might take this very coldly , it might all seem to him simply a day-dream .
1	nor has either dounia or i breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his helping us to pay for your university studies ; we have not spoken of it in the first place , because it will come to pass of itself , later on , and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of himself , ( as though he could refuse dounia that ) the more readily since you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office , and receive this assistance not as a charity , but as a salary earned by your own work .
1	dounia wants to arrange it all like this and i quite agree with her .
1	and we have not spoken of our plans for another reason , that is , because i particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when you first meet him . when dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about you , he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close , for oneself , and that he looked forward to forming his own opinion when he makes your acquaintance .
1	do you know , my precious rodya , i think that perhaps for some reasons ( nothing to do with pyotr petrovitch though , simply for my own personal , perhaps old‐womanish , fancies ) i should do better to go on living by myself , apart , than with them , after the wedding . i am convinced that he will be generous and delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter for the future , and if he has said nothing about it hitherto , it is simply because it has been taken for granted ; but i shall refuse .
1	i have noticed more than once in my life that husbands do n't quite get on with their mothers‐in‐law , and i do n't want to be the least bit in anyone 's way , and for my own sake , too , would rather be quite independent , so long as i have a crust of bread of my own , and such children as you and dounia .
1	if possible , i would settle somewhere near you , for the most joyful piece of news , dear rodya , i have kept for the end of my letter : know then , my dear boy , that we may , perhaps , be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years !
1	it is settled for certain that dounia and i are to set off for petersburg , exactly when i do n't know , but very , very soon , possibly in a week .
1	it all depends on pyotr petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in petersburg .
1	to suit his own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible , even before the fast of our lady , if it could be managed , or if that is too soon to be ready , immediately after .
1	oh , with what happiness i shall press you to my heart !
1	dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of seeing you , she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry pyotr petrovitch for that alone .
1	she is an angel !
1	she is not writing anything to you now , and has only told me to write that she has so much , so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now , for a few lines would tell you nothing , and it would only mean upsetting herself ; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses .
1	but although we shall be meeting so soon , perhaps i shall send you as much money as i can in a day or two .
1	now that everyone has heard that dounia is to marry pyotr petrovitch , my credit has suddenly improved and i know that afanasy ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy‐five roubles on the security of my pension , so that perhaps i shall be able to send you twenty‐five or even thirty roubles .
1	i would send you more , but i am uneasy about our travelling expenses ; for though pyotr petrovitch has been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey , that is to say , he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big trunk ( which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his ) , we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in petersburg , where we ca n't be left without a halfpenny , at least for the first few days .
1	but we have calculated it all , dounia and i , to the last penny , and we see that the journey will not cost very much . it is only ninety versts from us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we know , so as to be in readiness ; and from there dounia and i can travel quite comfortably third class .
1	so that i may very likely be able to send to you not twenty‐five , but thirty roubles .
1	but enough ; i have covered two sheets already and there is no space left for more ; our whole history , but so many events have happened !
1	and now , my precious rodya , i embrace you and send you a mother 's blessing till we meet .
1	love dounia your sister , rodya ; love her as she loves you and understand that she loves you beyond everything , more than herself .
1	she is an angel and you , rodya , you are everything to us—our one hope , our one consolation .
1	if only you are happy , we shall be happy . do you still say your prayers , rodya , and believe in the mercy of our creator and our redeemer ?
1	i am afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to‐day ; if it is so , i pray for you .
1	remember , dear boy , how in your childhood , when your father was living , you used to lisp your prayers at my knee , and how happy we all were in those days .
1	good‐bye , till we meet then—i embrace you warmly , warmly , with many kisses .
1	yours till death , almost from the first , while he read the letter , raskolnikov 's face was wet with tears ; but when he finished it , his face was pale and distorted and a bitter , wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips .
1	he laid his head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered , pondered a long time . his heart was beating violently , and his brain was in a turmoil .
1	at last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box .
1	his eyes and his mind craved for space .
1	he took up his hat and went out , this time without dread of meeting anyone ; he had forgotten his dread . he turned in the direction of the vassilyevsky ostrov , walking along vassilyevsky prospect , as though hastening on some business , but he walked , as his habit was , without noticing his way , muttering and even speaking aloud to himself , to the astonishment of the passers‐by .
1	many of them took him to be drunk .
1	ebd e‐booksdirectory.com his mother 's letter had been a torture to him , but as regards the chief fact in it , he had felt not one moment 's hesitation , even whilst he was reading the letter .
1	the essential question was settled , and irrevocably settled , in his mind : never such a marriage while i am alive and mr .
1	the thing is perfectly clear , he muttered to himself , with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his decision .
1	no , mother , no , dounia , you wo n't deceive me !
1	and then they apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without me !
1	they imagine it is arranged now and ca n't be broken off ; but we will see whether it can or not ! a magnificent excuse : 'pyotr petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in post‐haste , almost by express .
1	no , dounia , i see it all and i know what you want to say to me ; and i know too what you were thinking about , when you walked up and down all night , and what your prayers were like before the holy mother of kazan who stands in mother 's bedroom .
1	so it is finally settled ; you have determined to marry a sensible business man , avdotya romanovna , one who has a fortune ( has already made his fortune , that is so much more solid and impressive ) a man who holds two government posts and who shares the ideas of our most rising generation , as mother writes , and who seems to be kind , as dounia herself observes . that seems beats everything !
1	and that very dounia for that very ' seems ' is marrying him !
1	... but i should like to know why mother has written to me about 'our most rising generation ' ? simply as a descriptive touch , or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of mr. luzhin ?
1	oh , the cunning of them ! i should like to know one thing more : how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since ? was it all put into words , or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds , so that there was no need to speak of it aloud , and better not to speak of it .
1	most likely it was partly like that , from mother 's letter it 's evident : he struck her as rude a little , and mother in her simplicity took her observations to dounia .
1	who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it .
1	and now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with mr. luzhin , who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband 's bounty—who propounds it , too , almost at the first interview .
1	'you are our one comfort , you are everything to us .
1	his bitterness grew more and more intense , and if he had happened to meet mr. luzhin at the moment , he might have murdered him .
1	hm ... yes , that 's true , he continued , pursuing the whirling ideas that chased each other in his brain , it is true that 'it needs time and care to get to know a man , but there is no mistake about mr. luzhin .
1	granted that he 'let it slip , though he is a sensible man , ( yet maybe it was not a slip at all , but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible ) but dounia , dounia ?
1	that 's how it always is with these schilleresque noble hearts ; till the last moment every goose is a swan with them , till the last moment , they hope for the best and will see nothing wrong , and although they have an inkling of the other side of the picture , yet they wo n't face the truth till they are forced to ; the very thought of it makes them shiver ; they thrust the truth away with both hands , until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool 's cap on them with his own hands .
1	but his bride and her mother are to drive in a peasant 's cart covered with sacking ( i know , i have been driven in it ) .
1	it is only ninety versts and then they can 'travel very comfortably , third class , for a thousand versts !
1	one must cut one 's coat according to one 's cloth , but what about you , mr. luzhin ?
1	she is your bride ... . and you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey .
1	to be sure it 's a matter of business , a partnership for mutual benefit , with equal shares and expenses ; —food and drink provided , but pay for your tobacco .
1	the luggage will cost less than their fares and very likely go for nothing .
1	how is it that they do n't both see all that , or is it that they do n't want to see ?
1	i should think so !
1	and to think that this is only the first blossoming , and that the real fruits are to come !
1	but what really matters is not the stinginess , is not the meanness , but the tone of the whole thing .
1	for that will be the tone after marriage , it 's a foretaste of it .
1	what does she expect to live upon in petersburg afterwards ?
1	three silver roubles or two 'paper ones ' as she says ... . that old woman ... hm .
1	she has her reasons already for guessing that she could not live with dounia after the marriage , even for the first few months .
1	the good man has no doubt let slip something on that subject also , though mother would deny it : ' i shall refuse , says she .
1	and mother too , why should she be so lavish ? what will she have by the time she gets to petersburg ?
1	she knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs , ruining her old eyes .
1	and all her shawls do n't add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty , i know that .
1	so she is building all her hopes all the time on mr. luzhin 's generosity ; 'he will offer it of himself , he will press it on me .
1	it 's a bitter thing to spend one 's life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles , but i know she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a lett with a german master than degrade her soul , and her moral dignity , by binding herself for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has nothing in common—for her own advantage .
1	i should like to know whether mr. luzhin has any orders of merit ; i bet he has the anna in his buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants .
1	he will be sure to have it for his wedding , too !
1	enough of him , confound him !
1	well , ... mother i do n't wonder at , it 's like her , god bless her , but how could dounia ?
1	i know that very well .
1	you were nearly twenty when i saw you last : i understood you then .
1	mother writes that 'dounia can put up with a great deal .
1	i knew that two years and a half ago , and for the last two and a half years i have been thinking about it , thinking of just that , that 'dounia can put up with a great deal .
1	if she could put up with mr. svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it , she certainly can put up with a great deal .
1	she 'd live on black bread and water , she would not sell her soul , she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort ; she would not barter it for all schleswig‐holstein , much less mr. luzhin 's money .
1	she understands the man , of course , but she will have to live with the man .
1	and if mr. luzhin had been of unalloyed gold , or one huge diamond , she would never have consented to become his legal concubine .
1	no , dounia was not that sort when i knew her and ... she is still the same , of course !
1	and they are pleased , pleased !
1	is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when afanasy ivanovitch 's debt is paid ?
1	why is she consenting then ?
1	what 's the point of it ?
1	what 's the answer ?
1	it 's clear enough : for herself , for her comfort , to save her life she would not sell herself , but for someone else she is doing it !
1	for one she loves , for one she adores , she will sell herself !
1	that 's what it all amounts to ; for her brother , for her mother , she will sell herself !
1	she will sell everything !
1	in such cases , 'we overcome our moral feeling if necessary , freedom , peace , conscience even , all , all are brought into the market .
1	let my life go , if only my dear ones may be happy !
1	more than that , we become casuists , we learn to be jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves , we can persuade ourselves that it is one 's duty for a good object . that 's just like us , it 's as clear as daylight .
1	it 's clear that rodion romanovitch raskolnikov is the central figure in the business , and no one else .
1	oh , yes , she can ensure his happiness , keep him in the university , make him a partner in the office , make his whole future secure ; perhaps he may even be a rich man later on , prosperous , respected , and may even end his life a famous man !
1	it 's all rodya , precious rodya , her first born !
1	for such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter !
1	oh , loving , over‐partial hearts !
1	why , for his sake we would not shrink even from sonia 's fate .
1	sonia , sonia marmeladov , the eternal victim so long as the world lasts .
1	have you taken the measure of your sacrifice , both of you ?
1	can you bear it ?
1	is there sense in it ? and let me tell you , dounia , sonia 's life is no worse than life with mr. luzhin .
1	'there can be no question of love , mother writes .
1	and what if there can be no respect either , if on the contrary there is aversion , contempt , repulsion , what then ?
1	and what if it 's more than you can bear afterwards , if you regret it ?
1	is it any use ?
1	is not that so ? do you understand what that smartness means ? do you understand that the luzhin smartness is just the same thing as sonia 's and may be worse , viler , baser , because in your case , dounia , it 's a bargain for luxuries , after all , but with sonia it 's simply a question of starvation .
1	so you will have to 'keep up your appearance , too .
1	the bitterness , the misery , the curses , the tears hidden from all the world , for you are not a marfa petrovna .
1	and how will your mother feel then ? even now she is uneasy , she is worried , but then , when she sees it all clearly ? yes , indeed , what have you taken me for ?
1	i wo n't have your sacrifice , dounia , i wo n't have it , mother !
1	it shall not be , so long as i am alive , it shall not , it shall not !
1	i wo n't accept it !
1	he suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still .
1	you 'll forbid it ?
1	but what are you going to do to prevent it ?
1	and what right have you ?
1	what can you promise them on your side to give you such a right ?
1	your whole life , your whole future , you will devote to them when you have finished your studies and obtained a post ?
1	yes , we have heard all that before , and that 's all words , but now ?
1	now something must be done , now , do you understand that ?
1	and what are you doing now ?
1	they borrow on their hundred roubles pension . they borrow from the svidrigaïlovs . how are you going to save them from svidrigaïlovs , from afanasy ivanovitch vahrushin , oh , future millionaire zeus who would arrange their lives for them ?
1	in another ten years ? in another ten years , mother will be blind with knitting shawls , maybe with weeping too . she will be worn to a shadow with fasting ; and my sister ?
1	what may happen to her during those ten years ?
1	so he tortured himself , fretting himself with such questions , and finding a kind of enjoyment in it .
1	it was clear that he must not now suffer passively , worrying himself over unsolved questions , but that he must do something , do it at once , and do it quickly .
1	and yet all these questions were not new ones suddenly confronting him , they were old familiar aches . it was long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart . long , long ago his present anguish had its first beginnings ; it had waxed and gathered strength , it had matured and concentrated , until it had taken the form of a fearful , frenzied and fantastic question , which tortured his heart and mind , clamouring insistently for an answer .
1	anyway he must decide on something , or else ...
1	or throw up life altogether !
1	he cried suddenly , in a frenzy—accept one 's lot humbly as it is , once for all and stifle everything in oneself , giving up all claim to activity , life and love !
1	do you understand , sir , do you understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn ?
1	marmeladov 's question came suddenly into his mind , for every man must have somewhere to turn ... . he gave a sudden start ; another thought , that he had had yesterday , slipped back into his mind .
1	but he did not start at the thought recurring to him , for he knew , he had felt beforehand , that it must come back , he was expecting it ; besides it was not only yesterday 's thought .
1	the difference was that a month ago , yesterday even , the thought was a mere dream : but now ... now it appeared not a dream at all , it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape , and he suddenly became aware of this himself ... . he felt a hammering in his head , and there was a darkness before his eyes .
1	he looked round hurriedly , he was searching for something . he wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat ; he was walking along the k—— boulevard .
1	there was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him . he walked towards it as fast he could ; but on the way he met with a little adventure which absorbed all his attention .
1	looking for the seat , he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him , but at first he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his path . it had happened to him many times going home not to notice the road by which he was going , and he was accustomed to walk like that .
1	but there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front of him , that gradually his attention was riveted upon her , at first reluctantly and , as it were , resentfully , and then more and more intently . he felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so strange about the woman . in the first place , she appeared to be a girl quite young , and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with no parasol or gloves , waving her arms about in an absurd way .
1	she had on a dress of some light silky material , but put on strangely awry , not properly hooked up , and torn open at the top of the skirt , close to the waist : a great piece was rent and hanging loose . a little kerchief was flung about her bare throat , but lay slanting on one side . the girl was walking unsteadily , too , stumbling and staggering from side to side .
1	he overtook the girl at the seat , but , on reaching it , she dropped down on it , in the corner ; she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes , apparently in extreme exhaustion .
1	looking at her closely , he saw at once that she was completely drunk .
1	it was a strange and shocking sight .
1	he could hardly believe that he was not mistaken .
1	he saw before him the face of a quite young , fair‐haired girl—sixteen , perhaps not more than fifteen , years old , pretty little face , but flushed and heavy looking and , as it were , swollen . the girl seemed hardly to know what she was doing ; she crossed one leg over the other , lifting it indecorously , and showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street . raskolnikov did not sit down , but he felt unwilling to leave her , and stood facing her in perplexity .
1	this boulevard was never much frequented ; and now , at two o'clock , in the stifling heat , it was quite deserted .
1	and yet on the further side of the boulevard , about fifteen paces away , a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement . he , too , would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object of his own . he , too , had probably seen her in the distance and had followed her , but found raskolnikov in his way .
1	he looked angrily at him , though he tried to escape his notice , and stood impatiently biding his time , till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away .
1	the gentleman was a plump , thickly‐set man , about thirty , fashionably dressed , with a high colour , red lips and moustaches . raskolnikov felt furious ; he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way .
1	he left the girl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman .
1	what do you want here ?
1	he shouted , clenching his fists and laughing , spluttering with rage .
1	what do you mean ?
1	the gentleman asked sternly , scowling in haughty astonishment .
1	get away , that 's what i mean .
1	how dare you , you low fellow !
1	he raised his cane . raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists , without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like himself .
1	but at that instant someone seized him from behind , and a police constable stood between them .
1	that 's enough , gentlemen , no fighting , please , in a public place .
1	what do you want ?
1	he asked raskolnikov sternly , noticing his rags .
1	raskolnikov looked at him intently .
1	he had a straightforward , sensible , soldierly face , with grey moustaches and whiskers .
1	you are just the man i want , raskolnikov cried , catching at his arm .
1	i am a student , raskolnikov ... . you may as well know that too , he added , addressing the gentleman , come along , i have something to show you .
1	and taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat .
1	look here , hopelessly drunk , and she has just come down the boulevard . there is no telling who and what she is , she does not look like a professional .
1	and they 've put her out into the street like that .
1	look at the way her dress is torn , and the way it has been put on : she has been dressed by somebody , she has not dressed herself , and dressed by unpractised hands , by a man 's hands ; that 's evident . and now look there : i do n't know that dandy with whom i was going to fight , i see him for the first time , but he , too , has seen her on the road , just now , drunk , not knowing what she is doing , and now he is very eager to get hold of her , to get her away somewhere while she is in this state ... that 's certain , believe me , i am not wrong .
1	i saw him myself watching her and following her , but i prevented him , and he is just waiting for me to go away .
1	now he has walked away a little , and is standing still , pretending to make a cigarette ... . think how can we keep her out of his hands , and how are we to get her home ?
1	the policeman saw it all in a flash .
1	the stout gentleman was easy to understand , he turned to consider the girl .
1	the policeman bent over to examine her more closely , and his face worked with genuine compassion .
1	ah , what a pity !
1	he said , shaking his head—why , she is quite a child !
1	she has been deceived , you can see that at once .
1	listen , lady , he began addressing her , where do you live ?
1	where do you live ?
1	it 's shameful , missy , it 's a shame !
1	he shook his head again , shocked , sympathetic and indignant . it 's a difficult job , the policeman said to raskolnikov , and as he did so , he looked him up and down in a rapid glance . he , too , must have seemed a strange figure to him : dressed in rags and handing him money !
1	did you meet her far from here ?
1	i tell you she was walking in front of me , staggering , just here , in the boulevard .
1	she only just reached the seat and sank down on it .
1	ah , the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays , god have mercy on us !
1	an innocent creature like that , drunk already !
1	she has been deceived , that 's a sure thing .
1	and as likely as not she belongs to gentlefolk too , poor ones maybe ... . there are many like that nowadays .
1	he bent over her once more .
1	she opened her eyes fully all of a sudden , looked at him intently , as though realising something , got up from the seat and walked away in the direction from which she had come .
1	oh shameful wretches , they wo n't let me alone !
1	at that moment something seemed to sting raskolnikov ; in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him .
1	do n't be anxious , i wo n't let him have her , the policeman said resolutely , and he set off after them .
1	she said , waving her hand again .
1	she walked quickly , though staggering as before .
1	the dandy followed her , but along another avenue , keeping his eye on her .
1	he repeated aloud , sighing .
1	he shouted after the policeman .
1	what is it to do with you ?
1	let him amuse himself .
1	he pointed at the dandy , what is it to do with you ?
1	the policeman was bewildered , and stared at him open‐eyed .
1	ejaculated the policeman , with a gesture of contempt , and he walked after the dandy and the girl , probably taking raskolnikov for a madman or something even worse . he has carried off my twenty copecks , raskolnikov murmured angrily when he was left alone .
1	well , let him take as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end . and why did i want to interfere ? is it for me to help ?
1	have i any right to help ?
1	let them devour each other alive—what is to me ?
1	how did i dare to give him twenty copecks ?
1	in spite of those strange words he felt very wretched .
1	he sat down on the deserted seat .
1	his thoughts strayed aimlessly ... . he found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that moment .
1	he longed to forget himself altogether , to forget everything , and then to wake up and begin life anew ... .
1	he said , looking at the empty corner where she had sat—she will come to herself and weep , and then her mother will find out ... . she will give her a beating , a horrible , shameful beating and then maybe , turn her out of doors ... . and even if she does not , the darya frantsovnas will get wind of it , and the girl will soon be slipping out on the sly here and there .
1	then there will be the hospital directly ( that 's always the luck of those girls with respectable mothers , who go wrong on the sly ) and then ... again the hospital ... drink ... the taverns ... and more hospital , in two or three years—a wreck , and her life over at eighteen or nineteen ... . have not i seen cases like that ? and how have they been brought to it ?
1	why , they 've all come to it like that .
1	that 's as it should be , they tell us .
1	a certain percentage , they tell us , must every year go ... that way ... to the devil , i suppose , so that the rest may remain chaste , and not be interfered with .
1	what splendid words they have ; they are so scientific , so consolatory ... . once you 've said 'percentage ' there 's nothing more to worry about . if we had any other word ... maybe we might feel more uneasy ... .
1	but what does it matter ?
1	but what if dounia were one of the percentage !
1	of another one if not that one ?
1	but where am i going ?
1	he wondered at himself .
1	razumihin was one of his old comrades at the university .
1	it was remarkable that raskolnikov had hardly any friends at the university ; he kept aloof from everyone , went to see no one , and did not welcome anyone who came to see him , and indeed everyone soon gave him up .
1	he took no part in the students ' gatherings , amusements or conversations .
1	he worked with great intensity without sparing himself , and he was respected for this , but no one liked him .
1	he was very poor , and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him , as though he were keeping something to himself .
1	he seemed to some of his comrades to look down upon them all as children , as though he were superior in development , knowledge and convictions , as though their beliefs and interests were beneath him .
1	with razumihin he had got on , or , at least , he was more unreserved and communicative with him .
1	indeed it was impossible to be on any other terms with razumihin .
1	he was an exceptionally good‐humoured and candid youth , good‐natured to the point of simplicity , though both depth and dignity lay concealed under that simplicity .
1	the better of his comrades understood this , and all were fond of him .
1	he was extremely intelligent , though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times .
1	he was of striking appearance—tall , thin , blackhaired and always badly shaved .
1	he was sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength .
1	one night , when out in a festive company , he had with one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back . there was no limit to his drinking powers , but he could abstain from drink altogether ; he sometimes went too far in his pranks ; but he could do without pranks altogether . another thing striking about razumihin , no failure distressed him , and it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him .
1	he could lodge anywhere , and bear the extremes of cold and hunger .
1	he was very poor , and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort or another .
1	he spent one whole winter without lighting his stove , and used to declare that he liked it better , because one slept more soundly in the cold . for the present he , too , had been obliged to give up the university , but it was only for a time , and he was working with all his might to save enough to return to his studies again .
1	raskolnikov had not been to see him for the last four months , and razumihin did not even know his address .
1	about two months before , they had met in the street , but raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that he might not be observed .
1	and though razumihin noticed him , he passed him by , as he did not want to annoy him .
1	ebd e‐booksdirectory.com of course , i 've been meaning lately to go to razumihin 's to ask for work , to ask him to get me lessons or something ... raskolnikov thought , but what help can he be to me now ?
1	suppose he gets me lessons , suppose he shares his last farthing with me , if he has any farthings , so that i could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons ... hm ... well and what then ?
1	that 's not what i want now .
1	what shall i do with the few coppers i earn ?
1	it 's really absurd for me to go to razumihin ... . the question why he was now going to razumihin agitated him even more than he was himself aware ; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action . could i have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by means of razumihin alone ?
1	he asked himself in perplexity .
1	he pondered and rubbed his forehead , and , strange to say , after long musing , suddenly , as if it were spontaneously and by chance , a fantastic thought came into his head .
1	hm ... to razumihin 's , he said all at once , calmly , as though he had reached a final determination . i shall go to razumihin 's of course , but ... not now .
1	i shall go to him ... on the next day after it , when it will be over and everything will begin afresh ... . and suddenly he realised what he was thinking .
1	after it , he shouted , jumping up from the seat , but is it really going to happen ?
1	is it possible it really will happen ? he left the seat , and went off almost at a run ; he meant to turn back , homewards , but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing ; in that hole , in that awful little cupboard of his , all this had for a month past been growing up in him ; and he walked on at random .
1	his nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel shivering ; in spite of the heat he felt cold .
1	with a kind of effort he began almost unconsciously , from some inner craving , to stare at all the objects before him , as though looking for something to distract his attention ; but he did not succeed , and kept dropping every moment into brooding .
1	when with a start he lifted his head again and looked round , he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he was going . in this way he walked right across vassilyevsky ostrov , came out on to the lesser neva , crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands .
1	the greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in and weighed upon him .
1	here there were no taverns , no stifling closeness , no stench .
1	but soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability .
1	sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage , he gazed through the fence , he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies , and children running in the gardens .
1	the flowers especially caught his attention ; he gazed at them longer than at anything .
1	he was met , too , by luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback ; he watched them with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from his sight .
1	once he stood still and counted his money ; he found he had thirty copecks .
1	twenty to the policeman , three to nastasya for the letter , so i must have given forty‐seven or fifty to the marmeladovs yesterday , he thought , reckoning it up for some unknown reason , but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket .
1	he recalled it on passing an eating‐house or tavern , and felt that he was hungry ... . going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some sort . he finished eating it as he walked away .
1	it was a long while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once , though he only drank a wineglassful .
1	his legs felt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him .
1	he turned homewards , but reaching petrovsky ostrov he stopped completely exhausted , turned off the road into the bushes , sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep .
1	in a morbid condition of the brain , dreams often have a singular actuality , vividness , and extraordinary semblance of reality .
1	at times monstrous images are created , but the setting and the whole picture are so truth‐like and filled with details so delicate , so unexpectedly , but so artistically consistent , that the dreamer , were he an artist like pushkin or turgenev even , could never have invented them in the waking state .
1	such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system .
1	raskolnikov had a fearful dream .
1	he dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth . he was a child about seven years old , walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday . it was a grey and heavy day , the country was exactly as he remembered it ; indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in memory .
1	the little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand , not even a willow near it ; only in the far distance , a copse lay , a dark blur on the very edge of the horizon .
1	a few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern , a big tavern , which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion , even of fear , when he walked by it with his father .
1	there was always a crowd there , always shouting , laughter and abuse , hideous hoarse singing and often fighting . drunken and horrible‐looking figures were hanging about the tavern .
1	he used to cling close to his father , trembling all over when he met them . near the tavern the road became a dusty track , the dust of which was always black .
1	it was a winding road , and about a hundred paces further on , it turned to the right to the graveyard .
1	in the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother , when a service was held in memory of his grandmother , who had long been dead , and whom he had never seen .
1	on these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross .
1	he loved that church , the old‐fashioned , unadorned ikons and the old priest with the shaking head .
1	near his grandmother 's grave , which was marked by a stone , was the little grave of his younger brother who had died at six months old . he did not remember him at all , but he had been told about his little brother , and whenever he visited the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow down and kiss the little grave .
1	and now he dreamt that he was walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard ; he was holding his father 's hand and looking with dread at the tavern . a peculiar circumstance attracted his attention : there seemed to be some kind of festivity going on , there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople , peasant women , their husbands , and riff‐raff of all sorts , all singing and all more or less drunk . near the entrance of the tavern stood a cart , but a strange cart .
1	it was one of those big carts usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy goods . he always liked looking at those great cart‐horses , with their long manes , thick legs , and slow even pace , drawing along a perfect mountain with no appearance of effort , as though it were easier going with a load than without it .
1	but now , strange to say , in the shafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast , one of those peasants ' nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load of wood or hay , especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut . and the peasants would beat them so cruelly , sometimes even about the nose and eyes , and he felt so sorry , so sorry for them that he almost cried , and his mother always used to take him away from the window .
1	all of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting , singing and the balalaïka , and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out , wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders .
1	get in , get in ! shouted one of them , a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot . i 'll take you all , get in !
1	but at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the crowd .
1	why , mikolka , are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart ?
1	and this mare is twenty if she is a day , mates ! get in , i 'll take you all , mikolka shouted again , leaping first into the cart , seizing the reins and standing straight up in front . the bay has gone with matvey , he shouted from the cart—and this brute , mates , is just breaking my heart , i feel as if i could kill her .
1	get in , i tell you !
1	i 'll make her gallop !
1	d'you hear , she 'll gallop !
1	and he picked up the whip , preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare .
1	she has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years !
1	do n't you mind her , mates , bring a whip each of you , get ready !
1	they all clambered into mikolka 's cart , laughing and making jokes .
1	six men got in and there was still room for more .
1	they hauled in a fat , rosy‐cheeked woman .
1	she was dressed in red cotton , in a pointed , beaded headdress and thick leather shoes ; she was cracking nuts and laughing .
1	the crowd round them was laughing too and indeed , how could they help laughing ? that wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a gallop ! two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to help mikolka .
1	with the cry of now , the mare tugged with all her might , but far from galloping , could scarcely move forward ; she struggled with her legs , gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which were showered upon her like hail .
1	the laughter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled , but mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare , as though he supposed she really could gallop .
1	let me get in , too , mates , shouted a young man in the crowd whose appetite was aroused .
1	give it to her !
1	father , father , he cried , father , what are they doing ?
1	father , they are beating the poor horse !
1	come along , come along !
1	they are drunken and foolish , they are in fun ; come away , do n't look !
1	and he tried to draw him away , but he tore himself away from his hand , and , beside himself with horror , ran to the horse .
1	she was gasping , standing still , then tugging again and almost falling . beat her to death , cried mikolka , it 's come to that . i 'll do for her !
1	what are you about , are you a christian , you devil ?
1	shouted an old man in the crowd .
1	a wretched nag like that pulling such a cartload , said another . you 'll kill her , shouted the third .
1	get in , more of you !
1	it 's my property , i 'll do what i choose .
1	get in , all of you !
1	i will have her go at a gallop ! ...
1	all at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything : the mare , roused by the shower of blows , began feebly kicking .
1	even the old man could not help smiling .
1	two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her about the ribs .
1	one ran each side .
1	give us a song , mates , shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song , jingling a tambourine and whistling .
1	the woman went on cracking nuts and laughing .
1	... he ran beside the mare , ran in front of her , saw her being whipped across the eyes , right in the eyes !
1	one of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face , he did not feel it . wringing his hands and screaming , he rushed up to the grey‐headed old man with the grey beard , who was shaking his head in disapproval .
1	one woman seized him by the hand and would have taken him away , but he tore himself from her and ran back to the mare .
1	she was almost at the last gasp , but began kicking once more .
1	he threw down the whip , bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long , thick shaft , he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort brandished it over the mare .
1	he 'll crush her , was shouted round him .
1	he 'll kill her !
1	there was a sound of a heavy thud .
1	thrash her , thrash her !
1	why have you stopped ?
1	shouted voices in the crowd .
1	shouted voices in the crowd .
1	why would n't she gallop then ?
1	shouted mikolka , with bloodshot eyes , brandishing the bar in his hands .
1	he stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to beat .
1	but the six whips were attacking her in all directions , and the shaft was raised again and fell upon her a third time , then a fourth , with heavy measured blows . mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow .
1	at that instant his father , who had been running after him , snatched him up and carried him out of the crowd .
1	let us go home , he said to him .
1	why did they ... kill ... the poor horse !
1	he sobbed , but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest .
1	they are drunk ... . they are brutal ... it 's not our business !
1	he put his arms round his father but he felt choked , choked .
1	he tried to draw a breath , to cry out—and woke up .
1	he waked up , gasping for breath , his hair soaked with perspiration , and stood up in terror .
1	thank god , that was only a dream , he said , sitting down under a tree and drawing deep breaths .
1	but what is it ?
1	is it some fever coming on ?
1	such a hideous dream !
1	he felt utterly broken : darkness and confusion were in his soul .
1	he rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands .
1	he cried , can it be , can it be , that i shall really take an axe , that i shall strike her on the head , split her skull open ... that i shall tread in the sticky warm blood , break the lock , steal and tremble ; hide , all spattered in the blood ... with the axe ... . good god , can it be ?
1	he was shaking like a leaf as he said this .
1	but why am i going on like this ?
1	he continued , sitting up again , as it were in profound amazement .
1	yesterday , yesterday , when i went to make that ... experiment , yesterday i realised completely that i could never bear to do it ... . why am i going over it again , then ?
1	i knew that i could never bring myself to it , so what have i been torturing myself for till now ?
1	why am i hesitating ?
1	as i came down the stairs yesterday , i said myself that it was base , loathsome , vile , vile ... the very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror .
1	no , i could n't do it , i could n't do it ! granted , granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning , that all that i have concluded this last month is clear as day , true as arithmetic ... . my god !
1	i could n't do it , i could n't do it ! why , why then am i still ... ?
1	he rose to his feet , looked round in wonder as though surprised at finding himself in this place , and went towards the bridge .
1	he was pale , his eyes glowed , he was exhausted in every limb , but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easily .
1	he felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long been weighing upon him , and all at once there was a sense of relief and peace in his soul .
1	lord , he prayed , show me my path—i renounce that accursed ... dream of mine .
1	crossing the bridge , he gazed quietly and calmly at the neva , at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky .
1	in spite of his weakness he was not conscious of fatigue .
1	it was as though an abscess that had been forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken .
1	he was free from that spell , that sorcery , that obsession !
1	later on , when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during those days , minute by minute , point by point , he was superstitiously impressed by one circumstance , which , though in itself not very exceptional , always seemed to him afterwards the predestined turning-point of his fate .
1	he could never understand and explain to himself why , when he was tired and worn out , when it would have been more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way , he had returned by the hay market where he had no need to go .
1	it was obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way , though not much so .
1	it is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without noticing what streets he passed through .
1	but why , he was always asking himself , why had such an important , such a decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the hay market ( where he had moreover no reason to go ) at the very hour , the very minute of his life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny ? as though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose !
1	it was about nine o'clock when he crossed the hay market .
1	at the tables and the barrows , at the booths and the shops , all the market people were closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their wares and , like their customers , were going home . rag pickers and costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty and stinking courtyards of the hay market .
1	raskolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring alleys , when he wandered aimlessly in the streets . here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention , and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people .
1	at the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out with tapes , thread , cotton handkerchiefs , etc .
1	they , too , had got up to go home , but were lingering in conversation with a friend , who had just come up to them . this friend was lizaveta ivanovna , or , as everyone called her , lizaveta , the younger sister of the old pawnbroker , alyona ivanovna , whom raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his watch and make his experiment ... . he already knew all about lizaveta and she knew him a little too .
1	she was a single woman of about thirty‐five , tall , clumsy , timid , submissive and almost idiotic . she was a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister , who made her work day and night , and even beat her . she was standing with a bundle before the huckster and his wife , listening earnestly and doubtfully .
1	they were talking of something with special warmth .
1	the moment raskolnikov caught sight of her , he was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense astonishment , though there was nothing astonishing about this meeting .
1	you could make up your mind for yourself , lizaveta ivanovna , the huckster was saying aloud .
1	come round to‐morrow about seven .
1	they will be here too .
1	said lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully , as though unable to make up her mind .
1	i look at you , you are like some little babe .
1	and she is not your own sister either‐nothing but a step‐sister and what a hand she keeps over you !
1	but this time do n't say a word to alyona ivanovna , her husband interrupted ; that 's my advice , but come round to us without asking .
1	it will be worth your while . later on your sister herself may have a notion . am i to come ?
1	and we 'll have a cup of tea , added his wife .
1	all right , i 'll come , said lizaveta , still pondering , and she began slowly moving away . raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more .
1	he passed softly , unnoticed , trying not to miss a word .
1	his first amazement was followed by a thrill of horror , like a shiver running down his spine . he had learnt , he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt , that the next day at seven o'clock lizaveta , the old woman 's sister and only companion , would be away from home and that therefore at seven o'clock precisely the old woman would be left alone . he was only a few steps from his lodging .
1	he went in like a man condemned to death .
1	he thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking ; but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought , no will , and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided .
1	certainly , if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity , he could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan than that which had just presented itself .
1	in any case , it would have been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty , with greater exactness and less risk , and without dangerous inquiries and investigations , that next day at a certain time an old woman , on whose life an attempt was contemplated , would be at home and entirely alone .
1	ebd e‐booksdirectory.com later on raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his wife had invited lizaveta .
1	it was a very ordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about it .
1	a family who had come to the town and been reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes , all women 's things .
1	as the things would have fetched little in the market , they were looking for a dealer . this was lizaveta 's business .
1	she undertook such jobs and was frequently employed , as she was very honest and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it .
1	she spoke as a rule little and , as we have said already , she was very submissive and timid . but raskolnikov had become superstitious of late .
1	the traces of superstition remained in him long after , and were almost ineradicable . and in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious , as it were , the presence of some peculiar influences and coincidences .
1	in the previous winter a student he knew called pokorev , who had left for harkov , had chanced in conversation to give him the address of alyona ivanovna , the old pawnbroker , in case he might want to pawn anything . for a long while he did not go to her , for he had lessons and managed to get along somehow . six weeks ago he had remembered the address ; he had two articles that could be pawned : his father 's old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones , a present from his sister at parting .
1	he decided to take the ring . when he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first glance , though he knew nothing special about her . he got two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way home .
1	he asked for tea , sat down and sank into deep thought .
1	a strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg , and very , very much absorbed him . almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student , whom he did not know and had never seen , and with him a young officer .
1	they had played a game of billiards and began drinking tea .
1	all at once he heard the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker alyona ivanovna and give him her address . this of itself seemed strange to raskolnikov ; he had just come from her and here at once he heard her name .
1	of course it was a chance , but he could not shake off a very extraordinary impression , and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him ; the student began telling his friend various details about alyona ivanovna .
1	she is first‐rate , he said .
1	you can always get money from her .
1	she is as rich as a jew , she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble .
1	lots of our fellows have had dealings with her .
1	but she is an awful old harpy ... . and he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was , how if you were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost ; how she gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven percent a month on it and so on .
1	the student chattered on , saying that she had a sister lizaveta , whom the wretched little creature was continually beating , and kept in complete bondage like a small child , though lizaveta was at least six feet high . there 's a phenomenon for you , cried the student and he laughed .
1	they began talking about lizaveta .
1	the student spoke about her with a peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened with great interest and asked him to send lizaveta to do some mending for him .
1	raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about her . lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half‐sister , being the child of a different mother .
1	she was thirty‐five . she worked day and night for her sister , and besides doing the cooking and the washing , she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she earned . she did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind without her sister 's permission .
1	the old woman had already made her will , and lizaveta knew of it , and by this will she would not get a farthing ; nothing but the movables , chairs and so on ; all the money was left to a monastery in the province of n—— , that prayers might be said for her in perpetuity . lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister , unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance , remarkably tall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards . she always wore battered goatskin shoes , and was clean in her person .
1	what the student expressed most surprise and amusement about was the fact that lizaveta was continually with child . but you say she is hideous ? yes , she is so dark‐skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up , but you know she is not at all hideous .
1	she has such a good‐natured face and eyes .
1	and the proof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her .
1	and her smile is really very sweet .
1	how strange it was !
1	no , i 'll tell you what .
1	i could kill that damned old woman and make off with her money , i assure you , without the faintest conscience‐prick , the student added with warmth . the officer laughed again while raskolnikov shuddered .
1	listen , i want to ask you a serious question , the student said hotly .
1	i was joking of course , but look here ; on one side we have a stupid , senseless , worthless , spiteful , ailing , horrid old woman , not simply useless but doing actual mischief , who has not an idea what she is living for herself , and who will die in a day or two in any case . yes , yes , i understand , answered the officer , watching his excited companion attentively . on the other side , fresh young lives thrown away for want of help and by thousands , on every side !
1	a hundred thousand good deeds could be done and helped , on that old woman 's money which will be buried in a monastery !
1	hundreds , thousands perhaps , might be set on the right path ; dozens of families saved from destitution , from ruin , from vice , from the lock hospitals—and all with her money . kill her , take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all . what do you think , would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds ?
1	for one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay .
1	one death , and a hundred lives in exchange—it 's simple arithmetic !
1	besides , what value has the life of that sickly , stupid , ill‐natured old woman in the balance of existence !
1	no more than the life of a louse , of a black‐beetle , less in fact because the old woman is doing harm .
1	she is wearing out the lives of others ; the other day she bit lizaveta 's finger out of spite ; it almost had to be amputated .
1	of course she does not deserve to live , remarked the officer , but there it is , it 's nature .
1	oh , well , brother , but we have to correct and direct nature , and , but for that , we should drown in an ocean of prejudice .
1	but for that , there would never have been a single great man .
1	they talk of duty , conscience—i do n't want to say anything against duty and conscience ; —but the point is , what do we mean by them . stay , i have another question to ask you .
1	no , you stay , i 'll ask you a question .
1	you are talking and speechifying away , but tell me , would you kill the old woman yourself ?
1	it 's nothing to do with me ... . but i think , if you would not do it yourself , there 's no justice about it ... . let us have another game .
1	raskolnikov was violently agitated . of course , it was all ordinary youthful talk and thought , such as he had often heard before in different forms and on different themes .
1	but why had he happened to hear such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain was just conceiving ... the very same ideas ? and why , just at the moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her ?
1	this coincidence always seemed strange to him .
1	this trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on him in his later action ; as though there had really been in it something preordained , some guiding hint ... .
1	on returning from the hay market he flung himself on the sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring .
1	meanwhile it got dark ; he had no candle and , indeed , it did not occur to him to light up .
1	he could never recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time .
1	at last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering , and he realised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa .
1	soon heavy , leaden sleep came over him , as it were crushing him . he slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming . nastasya , coming into his room at ten o'clock the next morning , had difficulty in rousing him .
1	she brought him in tea and bread .
1	the tea was again the second brew and again in her own tea‐pot .
1	and he is always asleep .
1	my goodness , how he sleeps !
1	he got up with an effort .
1	his head ached , he stood up , took a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again .
1	going to sleep again , cried nastasya .
1	are you ill , eh ?
1	he made no reply .
1	afterwards , he said with an effort , closing his eyes again and turning to the wall .
1	nastasya stood over him .
1	perhaps he really is ill , she said , turned and went out .
1	she came in again at two o'clock with soup .
1	he was lying as before .
1	the tea stood untouched .
1	nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully rousing him .
1	she shouted , looking at him with repulsion .
1	he got up , and sat down again , but said nothing and stared at the floor .
1	are you ill or not ?
1	asked nastasya and again received no answer .
1	you 'd better go out and get a breath of air , she said after a pause .
1	will you eat it or not ?
1	afterwards , he said weakly .
1	she remained a little longer , looked at him with compassion and went out .
1	a few minutes afterwards , he raised his eyes and looked for a long while at the tea and the soup .
1	then he took the bread , took up a spoon and began to eat .
1	he ate a little , three or four spoonfuls , without appetite , as it were mechanically .
1	his head ached less .
1	after his meal he stretched himself on the sofa again , but now he could not sleep ; he lay without stirring , with his face in the pillow .
1	he was haunted by day‐dreams and such strange day‐dreams ; in one , that kept recurring , he fancied that he was in africa , in egypt , in some sort of oasis .
1	the caravan was resting , the camels were peacefully lying down ; the palms stood all around in a complete circle ; all the party were at dinner .
1	but he was drinking water from a spring which flowed gurgling close by .
1	and it was so cool , it was wonderful , wonderful , blue , cold water running among the parti‐coloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like gold ... . suddenly he heard a clock strike . he started , roused himself , raised his head , looked out of the window , and seeing how late it was , suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa .
1	he crept on tiptoe to the door , stealthily opened it and began listening on the staircase .
1	his heart beat terribly .
1	but all was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep ... . it seemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had done nothing , had prepared nothing yet ... . and meanwhile perhaps it had struck six .
1	and his drowsiness and stupefaction were followed by an extraordinary , feverish , as it were distracted haste .
1	but the preparations to be made were few .
1	he concentrated all his energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing ; and his heart kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe .
1	first he had to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat—a work of a moment .
1	he rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away under it , a worn out , old unwashed shirt .
1	from its rags he tore a long strip , a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long .
1	he folded this strip in two , took off his wide , strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material ( his only outer garment ) and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside , under the left armhole .
1	his hands shook as he sewed , but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put the coat on again .
1	the needle and thread he had got ready long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper .
1	as for the noose , it was a very ingenious device of his own ; the noose was intended for the axe .
1	it was impossible for him to carry the axe through the street in his hands . and if hidden under his coat he would still have had to support it with his hand , which would have been noticeable .
1	now he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose , and it would hang quietly under his arm on the inside . putting his hand in his coat pocket , he could hold the end of the handle all the way , so that it did not swing ; and as the coat was very full , a regular sack in fact , it could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the hand that was in the pocket .
1	this noose , too , he had designed a fortnight before .
1	when he had finished with this , he thrust his hand into a little opening between his sofa and the floor , fumbled in the left corner and drew out the pledge , which he had got ready long before and hidden there .
1	this pledge was , however , only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thickness of a silver cigarette case . he picked up this piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of a workshop .
1	afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron , which he had also picked up at the same time in the street . putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood , he fastened them very firmly , crossing and re-crossing the thread round them ; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it .
1	this was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time , while she was trying to undo the knot , and so to gain a moment .
1	the iron strip was added to give weight , so that the woman might not guess the first minute that the thing was made of wood .
1	all this had been stored by him beforehand under the sofa .
1	he had only just got the pledge out when he heard someone suddenly about in the yard .
1	it struck six long ago .
1	he rushed to the door , listened , caught up his hat and began to descend his thirteen steps cautiously , noiselessly , like a cat . he had still the most important thing to do—to steal the axe from the kitchen . that the deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago .
1	he had also a pocket pruning‐knife , but he could not rely on the knife and still less on his own strength , and so resolved finally on the axe .
1	we may note in passing , one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by him in the matter ; they had one strange characteristic : the more final they were , the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in his eyes .
1	in spite of all his agonising inward struggle , he never for a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his plans .
1	and , indeed , if it had ever happened that everything to the least point could have been considered and finally settled , and no uncertainty of any kind had remained , he would , it seems , have renounced it all as something absurd , monstrous and impossible . but a whole mass of unsettled points and uncertainties remained . as for getting the axe , that trifling business cost him no anxiety , for nothing could be easier .
1	nastasya was continually out of the house , especially in the evenings ; she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop , and always left the door ajar .
1	it was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her about .
1	and so , when the time came , he would only have to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe , and an hour later ( when everything was over ) go in and put it back again .
1	supposing he returned an hour later to put it back , and nastasya had come back and was on the spot .
1	he would of course have to go by and wait till she went out again .
1	but supposing she were in the meantime to miss the axe , look for it , make an outcry—that would mean suspicion or at least grounds for suspicion .
1	but those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider , and indeed he had no time .
1	he was thinking of the chief point , and put off trifling details , until he could believe in it all .
1	but that seemed utterly unattainable .
1	so it seemed to himself at least .
1	he could not imagine , for instance , that he would sometime leave off thinking , get up and simply go there ... . even his late experiment ( i.e . his visit with the object of a final survey of the place ) was simply an attempt at an experiment , far from being the real thing , as though one should say come , let us go and try it—why dream about it ! —and at once he had broken down and had run away cursing , in a frenzy with himself .
1	meanwhile it would seem , as regards the moral question , that his analysis was complete ; his casuistry had become keen as a razor , and he could not find rational objections in himself . but in the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself , and doggedly , slavishly sought arguments in all directions , fumbling for them , as though someone were forcing and drawing him to it .
1	at first—long before indeed—he had been much occupied with one question ; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily detected , and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces ?
1	he had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions , and in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime , as in the criminal himself . almost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness , at the very instant when prudence and caution are most essential .
1	it was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease , developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the perpetration of the crime , continued with equal violence at the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time after , according to the individual case , and then passed off like any other disease . the question whether the disease gives rise to the crime , or whether the crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the nature of disease , he did not yet feel able to decide .
1	when he reached these conclusions , he decided that in his own case there could not be such a morbid reaction , that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design , for the simple reason that his design was not a crime ... . we will omit all the process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion ; we have run too far ahead already ... . we may add only that the practical , purely material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his mind .
1	one has but to keep all one 's will‐power and reason to deal with them , and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business ... . but this preparation had never been begun . his final decisions were what he came to trust least , and when the hour struck , it all came to pass quite differently , as it were accidentally and unexpectedly .
1	one trifling circumstance upset his calculations , before he had even left the staircase .
1	when he reached the landlady 's kitchen , the door of which was open as usual , he glanced cautiously in to see whether , in nastasya 's absence , the landlady herself was there , or if not , whether the door to her own room was closed , so that she might not peep out when he went in for the axe .
1	but what was his amazement when he suddenly saw that nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen , but was occupied there , taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line .
1	seeing him , she left off hanging the clothes , turned to him and stared at him all the time he was passing .
1	he turned away his eyes , and walked past as though he noticed nothing .
1	but it was the end of everything ; he had not the axe !
1	what made me think , he reflected , as he went under the gateway , what made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment !
1	why , why , why did i assume this so certainly ?
1	he was crushed and even humiliated .
1	he stood hesitating in the gateway . to go into the street , to go a walk for appearance ' sake was revolting ; to go back to his room , even more revolting .
1	and what a chance i have lost for ever !
1	he muttered , standing aimlessly in the gateway , just opposite the porter 's little dark room , which was also open .
1	from the porter 's room , two paces away from him , something shining under the bench to the right caught his eye ... . he looked about him—nobody .
1	he approached the room on tiptoe , went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called the porter .
1	yes , not at home !
1	somewhere near though , in the yard , for the door is wide open .
1	he dashed to the axe ( it was an axe ) and pulled it out from under the bench , where it lay between two chunks of wood ; at once , before going out , he made it fast in the noose , he thrust both hands into his pockets and went out of the room ; no one had noticed him !
1	when reason fails , the devil helps !
1	this chance raised his spirits extraordinarily .
1	he walked along quietly and sedately , without hurry , to avoid awakening suspicion .
1	he scarcely looked at the passers‐by , tried to escape looking at their faces at all , and to be as little noticeable as possible .
1	suddenly he thought of his hat .
1	i had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead !
1	a curse rose from the bottom of his soul .
1	glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop , he saw by a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven .
1	he had to make haste and at the same time to go someway round , so as to approach the house from the other side ... . when he had happened to imagine all this beforehand , he had sometimes thought that he would be very much afraid .
1	but he was not very much afraid now , was not afraid at all , indeed .
1	his mind was even occupied by irrelevant matters , but by nothing for long .
1	as he passed the yusupov garden , he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great fountains , and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares .
1	by degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer garden were extended to the field of mars , and perhaps joined to the garden of the mihailovsky palace , it would be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town .
1	then he was interested by the question why in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity , but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains ; where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness .
1	then his own walks through the hay market came back to his mind , and for a moment he waked up to reality . he thought , better think of nothing at all !
1	so probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way , flashed through his mind , but simply flashed , like lightning ; he made haste to dismiss this thought ... . and by now he was near ; here was the house , here was the gate .
1	suddenly a clock somewhere struck once .
1	can it be half‐past seven ?
1	impossible , it must be fast !
1	luckily for him , everything went well again at the gates .
1	at that very moment , as though expressly for his benefit , a huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate , completely screening him as he passed under the gateway , and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the yard , before he had slipped in a flash to the right .
1	on the other side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling ; but no one noticed him and no one met him . many windows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were open at that moment , but he did not raise his head—he had not the strength to .
1	the staircase leading to the old woman 's room was close by , just on the right of the gateway .
1	he was already on the stairs ... .
1	drawing a breath , pressing his hand against his throbbing heart , and once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight , he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs , listening every minute .
1	but the stairs , too , were quite deserted ; all the doors were shut ; he met no one .
1	one flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were at work in it , but they did not glance at him . he stood still , thought a minute and went on . of course it would be better if they had not been here , but .
1	it 's two storeys above them .
1	and there was the fourth storey , here was the door , here was the flat opposite , the empty one . the flat underneath the old woman 's was apparently empty also ; the visiting card nailed on the door had been torn off— they had gone away ! ...
1	he was out of breath .
1	for one instant the thought floated through his mind shall i go back ?
1	but he made no answer and began listening at the old woman 's door , a dead silence .
1	then he listened again on the staircase , listened long and intently ... then looked about him for the last time , pulled himself together , drew himself up , and once more tried the axe in the noose . am i very pale ?
1	am i not evidently agitated ?
