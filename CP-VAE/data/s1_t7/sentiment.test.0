he had successfully managed to avoid meeting his landlady on the staircase .
his small room , more like a closet than an apartment , was tucked under the roof of a tall five-story building .
the landlady of the apartment , who rented him this room and provided both dinner and a servant , lived below in a separate apartment on the same staircase ; every time he left to go out , he had to pass the landlady ’ s kitchen door , which was almost always left open onto the landing .
every time the young man passed , he felt a painful and fearful sensation , one that he was ashamed of and that made him wince .
he was deeply in debt to the landlady and was afraid to face her .
it wasn ’ t that he was so fearful and cowed ; in fact , it was just the opposite ; but for some time he had been in an irritable and anxious state , similar to hypochondria .
he had become so absorbed in himself and so isolated from others that he was afraid of meeting anyone , not only his landlady .
he was crushed by poverty , but even his constrained circumstances had ceased to burden him of late .
he was not actually afraid of his landlady , no matter what she intended to do to him . but to stop on the staircase , put up with all sorts of nonsense about ordinary rubbish that didn ’ t concern him at all , her constant pestering about payment , her threats and complaints , and , in the face of it all , to have to dodge her , make excuses , tell lies—no thank you ; it was better to slip past somehow , like a cat on a staircase , and steal away unnoticed .
however , this time the fear of meeting his creditor surprised even him as he made his way out to the street .
what sort of feat am i about to attempt , yet at the same time i ’ m afraid of such nonsense !
everything lies in a man ’ s hands , and still he lets it slip by , solely out of cowardice . that ’ s an axiom .
it would be interesting to know what people fear the most .
most of all they fear taking a new step , uttering a new word of their own .
but i ’ m babbling too much .
it ’ s because i ’ m not doing anything that i ’ m babbling .
and it ’ s in the last month i ’ ve learned to prattle , lying for days and nights in my corner , thinking about .
well , why am i going out now ?
can i really be capable of doing that ?
no , it ’ s not serious at all .
so , i ’ m amusing myself for the sake of fantasy : games !
yes , that ’ s it , games ! it was stiflingly hot outside ; moreover , the stuffiness , the crush of people , lime plaster everywhere , scaffolding , bricks , dust , and that particular summer stench , so familiar to every petersburg resident lacking the means to rent a summer dacha—all this suddenly and offensively struck the young man ’ s already distraught nerves . the unbearable stench of cheap taverns , which were particularly numerous in this part of the city , and the drunkards encountered constantly , despite its being a weekday , completed the repulsive and grim scene .
for a moment , a feeling of the deepest loathing flashed across the young man ’ s delicate features .
incidentally , he was remarkably handsome , with splendid dark eyes and dark brown hair ; he was taller than average , slender , and well built .
but soon he seemed to slip into profound pensiveness , even , it would be more accurate to say , into a state of oblivion . he walked along not noticing his surroundings , not even wanting to take notice of them .
from time to time he merely muttered something to himself , from his penchant for monologues , which he immediately acknowledged to himself .
at that moment he himself was aware that at times his thoughts were confused and that he was feeling very weak : it was the second day he ’ d eaten hardly anything at all .
he was so poorly dressed that someone else , even someone used to seeing such , would be ashamed to appear on the street during the day wearing such ragged clothes .
however , the district was one where it was difficult to shock anyone with one ’ s apparel .
the proximity of the haymarket , the abundance of certain establishments , and , primarily , the population of tradesmen and craftsmen , all crowded into these streets and lanes of central petersburg , sometimes filled the general panorama with such subjects that it would be strange to be surprised at all on meeting another such figure . but so much malicious contempt had already accumulated in the young man ’ s soul that , in spite of all his own sometimes very immature squeamishness , when he was out on the street he was not in the least embarrassed by his tattered clothes . it was another matter altogether when he met some of his acquaintances or former comrades , whom , in general , he didn ’ t much like seeing .
however , when one drunkard , who for some unknown reason was being transported somewhere along the street in an enormous cart harnessed to a huge dray horse , suddenly shouted to him , in passing , hey , you , you german hatmaker ! and roared as loud as he could , pointing his finger at him—the young man suddenly stopped and violently grabbed his own hat . it was a tall , round top hat bought at zimmerman ’ s shop , but already worn out , and now of a completely faded reddish-brown color , with many holes and stains , lacking a brim , and leaning to one side at a most unattractive angle .
however , it was not shame that seized him but a completely different feeling , more resembling fear .
he muttered in confusion .
that ’ s exactly what i thought !
details , details are the main thing !
at the time he himself still didn ’ t believe in his dreams and was merely irritating himself with their repugnant , though seductive audacity .
now , however , a month later , he ’ d begun to regard them in a different light , and in spite of all his mocking monologues about his own powerlessness and indecisiveness , he ’ d grown accustomed , even against his will , to considering this repulsive dream something of a feat , although he still didn ’ t believe in it himself .
if i ’ m so afraid now , what would happen if i somehow managed to commit the actual deed ?
it must have been that the young man glanced at her with some special sort of look , because her former distrust suddenly flashed in her eyes again .
i was here about a month ago , the young man hastened to mumble with a slight bow , recalling that he should be more courteous .
but there was nothing special in there .
what do you want ?
the month ended two days ago .
the young man took it and was so angry that he was just about to leave ; but then he reconsidered , remembering that he had nowhere else to go , and that he ’ d come for a different reason .
and there ’ s one key that ’ s bigger than all the others , three times bigger , with a notched tip ; it ’ s not for the dresser , of course .
he looked at the old woman and was in no rush to leave , just as if he wanted to say or do something else , but it seemed as if he himself didn ’ t know precisely what .
the feeling of infinite revulsion that had begun to oppress and torment his heart as he ’ d been coming to see the old woman had now reached such proportions and was so palpable that he didn ’ t know where to hide from his anguish .
in spite of this contemptuous disdain , he seemed cheerful already , as if suddenly liberated from some terrible burden , and he cast his eyes amicably over those present .
there sat : one fellow who looked like a tradesman , drunk , but not too , nursing his beer ; his large , fat pal , wearing a short jacket , sporting a gray beard , very intoxicated , dozing on the bench ; from time to time this fellow would suddenly , as if half asleep , start snapping his fingers , fling his arms out wide , and jerk the top half of his body around without getting up from the bench , meanwhile warbling some nonsense as he tried to recall a few lines , something like :
he was so exhausted from his whole month of concentrated melancholy and gloomy agitation that he felt like taking a breath in another world , wherever it was , and in spite of the filth of his surroundings , he now remained in the tavern with pleasure .
even though you don ’ t appear to be a person of consequence , my experience tells me that you ’ re an educated man and not accustomed to drink .
dear sir , a month ago a certain mr. lebezyatnikov gave my wife a beating ; but my wife is not like me !
and it was true that here and there some small strands of hay were sticking to his clothes and even to his hair .
his hands were especially grimy , greasy , and reddish , and his fingernails were black .
his conversation seemed to arouse general , though listless attention .
the boys behind the counter started giggling .
in some drunkards this habit becomes a necessity , primarily among those who receive harsh treatment at home and who are ordered about .
why don ’ t i serve , my dear sir ?
don ’ t you think my heart aches over the fact that i grovel to no avail ?
but what do you mean without hope ?
i mean completely hopelessly , knowing in advance that nothing will come of it .
for example , you know beforehand , absolutely , that this most well-intentioned and most useful citizen won ’ t give you money under any circumstances because why , i ask , why should he ?
after all , he knows i won ’ t pay it back .
but mr. lebezyatnikov , who ’ s a follower of the latest ideas , was explaining to me just the other day that in our era compassion has even been prohibited by science and that this is already being done in england , where they ’ ve developed political economy . why then , i ask , should he give me anything ?
yet , knowing beforehand that he won ’ t , you still set off on your way and . why do you set off ?
what if there ’ s no one else to see , nowhere else to go ?
everyone has to have somewhere to go .
because there comes a time when it ’ s absolutely essential to go somewhere .
when my only daughter went out for the first time with a streetwalker ’ s yellow ticket , † then i went out , too . ( my daughter makes her living by streetwalking , sir . ) , he added in parentheses , regarding the young man with some anxiety .
he hastened to declare immediately , even with apparent calm , when the two lads standing at the bar chuckled and the tavern keeper smiled . i don ’ t take offense at their heads nodding , because everyone knows everything already ; nothing ’ s secret , that shall not be made manifest ; i regard all this not with contempt , but with humility .
‡ allow me , young man , can you . but no , it should be explained more powerfully and imaginatively : looking at me at this very moment , it ’ s not a matter of can you , rather it ’ s dare you state positively that i am not a swine ?
well , sir , the speaker continued steadfastly , even with a reinforced sense of self-respect , having paused to let another outburst of laughter in the room die down .
well , sir , i may be a swine , but she is a lady !
i am made in the image of a beast , but my wife , katerina ivanovna , is an educated person , born the daughter of a field officer .
i may be a scoundrel , but she ’ s been raised with a noble heart and brought up with magnanimous feelings .
oh , if only she pitied me !
my dear , dear sir , every man needs to have at least one place where he ’ s pitied !
and while katerina ivanovna is a generous woman , she ’ s unjust . while i myself understand that when she pulls tufts of my hair , she ’ s doing so from a feeling of pity in her heart ( for , i repeat without embarrassment , she does pull tufts of my hair , young man ) , he confirmed in a dignified tone after hearing laughter once again , but , my god , what if even once she .
for more than once have i got what i wanted , more than once have i been pitied , but . but such is my nature , i ’ m a born beast ! that ’ s for sure !
marmeladov resolutely banged his fist on the table .
such is my nature !
do you know , sir , do you know , that i even pawned her stockings ?
not her shoes , sir , since that would have resembled the normal course of events , but her stockings , i pawned her stockings , sir !
i also hocked her mohair shawl , a gift , an earlier one , her own , not from me . we live in a chilly corner , and this past winter she caught a cold and began coughing , even spitting up blood .
we have three small children , and katerina ivanovna works from morning to night , scrubbing and washing and bathing the children , since she ’ s used to cleanliness from early childhood , but she has a weak chest and is predisposed to consumption—that i feel . how can i not feel it ?
and the more i drink , the more i feel it .
that ’ s why i drink , because i ’ m seeking compassion and feeling in this drinking . it ’ s not joy i seek , only sorrow . i drink because i genuinely want to suffer !
and then , as if in despair , he rested his head on the table .
young man , he continued , raising his head again , i can read some sorrow in your face .
i saw it when you entered , and that ’ s why i turned to you right away . in telling you the story of my life , i don ’ t wish to parade my disgrace before these idlers here , who know it all already ; i ’ m seeking a sensitive , educated man .
do you know that my wife was educated in a provincial school for children of the nobility , and at the award ceremony she was chosen to perform the shawl dance§ in the presence of the governor and other distinguished guests , for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit ?
well , we sold that medal . a long time ago . the certificate ’ s still in her trunk , and she recently showed it to our landlady .
even though she has endless quarrels with the landlady , she wanted to show off to someone and tell her about those happy days in the past .
i don ’ t condemn her , i don ’ t , because these things are preserved in her memory , and all the rest has turned to dust !
yes , yes ; she ’ s a hot-tempered woman , proud and obstinate .
she washes the floor herself and has only black bread to eat , but she won ’ t tolerate any disrespect .
that ’ s why she wouldn ’ t tolerate mr. lebezyatnikov ’ s rudeness , and when he gave her a beating , she took to her bed more as a result of her feeling than from the actual blows .
she was already a widow when i married her , with three children , each smaller than the other .
her first husband was a cavalry officer , and she married him for love and ran away from her parents ’ house with him .
she loved her husband dearly , but he took to gambling , ended up in court , and soon died .
he ’ d begun beating her toward the end ; although she didn ’ t let him get away with it , about which i have detailed documentary evidence ; she weeps to this day when she remembers him and reproaches me . i ’ m glad , very glad that even in her imagination she can see herself as being happy for a while . after his death she was left with three young children in a distant and dreadful provincial town , where i was also staying at the time ; she was living in such hopeless poverty—even though i ’ ve had many different experiences , i can ’ t even begin to describe her situation .
her family refused to help her . besides , she was proud , extremely proud . and then , my dear sir , then , being a widower myself , and having a fourteen-year-old daughter , i proposed to her because i couldn ’ t bear to see such suffering .
you can judge for yourself the degree of her misfortune , that she , an educated and well-brought-up woman from an eminent family , agreed to marry the likes of me !
weeping and wailing , wringing her hands , she did !
because she had nowhere else to go .
do you understand , do you really understand , dear sir , what it means when a person has nowhere else to go ?
you don ’ t understand it yet . for one whole year i fulfilled my obligation devotedly and devoutly and never touched the bottle—he pointed to the bottle—because i do have feelings .
but even then i couldn ’ t please her , even with that ; it was afterward , when i lost my job , which wasn ’ t my fault , but it happened because of changes in the department that i turned to drink !
it ’ s already been about half a year , after our wanderings and numerous misfortunes , since we finally turned up in this splendid capital with all of its many monuments . and i found a job here . i found one and then i lost it .
this time it was my own fault , because i had reached the end of my rope . now we live in a little corner , at our landlady ’ s , amaliya fedorovna lippevekhsel , but i don ’ t know how we manage to live and pay her .
many others live there besides us .
it ’ s sodom , sir , of the most hideous kind . meanwhile my daughter from my first marriage has grown up ; i won ’ t describe what she had to suffer while growing up , my daughter , from her stepmother . because although katerina ivanovna is filled with kindly feelings , she ’ s a hot-tempered and irritable lady , and she can snap .
there ’ s no reason to recall it !
as you can well imagine , sonya received no education . about four years ago , i tried to read some geography and world history with her ; but since i myself was weak in those areas and we had no suitable textbooks , and the books we did have . well , we don ’ t even have those books now , all our reading ended then and there .
we stopped at the persian king cyrus the great.¶ then , once she was older , she read some books of romantic content as well as several others , given to her by mr. lebezyatnikov . one was lewes ’ s physiology. # do you happen to know it , sir ? she read it with great interest and even read some passages aloud to us : and that was her entire education .
now i ’ m turning to you , my dear sir , on my own behalf , with a confidential question of my own : in your opinion , can a poor but honest girl earn a living by honest work ?
she can ’ t earn even fifteen kopecks a day , sir , if she ’ s honest , since she possesses no special skills , and that ’ s even if she works all the time ! besides , the state councillor ivan ivanovich klopshtok—have you ever heard of him ? not only hasn ’ t he paid her yet for the half dozen fine cotton shirts she made him , but he even drove her out with insults , stamping his feet and calling her names , claiming that the collars were the wrong size and had been sewn in crooked .
and then katerina ivanovna , wringing her hands , paces the room , her face flushed with the red blotches that always accompany that illness : you live here with us , she says , like a sponger ; you eat and drink and enjoy the warmth , but what ’ s there to eat and drink when these little ones haven ’ t seen a crust of bread for three days ? i was lying there at the time . why not say it ?
i was a little drunk , sir , and i heard my sonya ( she ’ s very meek and has such a soft voice . she ’ s fair-haired and her face is always so pale and thin ) , say : oh , katerina ivanovna , must i really go out and do that ? meanwhile , darya frantsevna , a malevolent woman well known to the police , had reported her to the landlady several times .
replied katerina ivanovna , with a mocking laugh , what are you saving yourself for ?
but don ’ t blame her , don ’ t , dear sir , don ’ t blame her ! she wasn ’ t in her right mind when she said it ; she was agitated , sick , and the children were crying because they hadn ’ t eaten , and she said it more as an insult than as what she really meant . because katerina ivanovna is the sort of person who , as soon as the children begin crying , even when they ’ re hungry , begins to beat them right away .
and then i saw how sonechka , around six o ’ clock , got up , put on a kerchief , her hooded cloak , and left the apartment ; she came back at nine . she walked in and went straight up to katerina ivanovna and silently put thirty silver rubles down on the table in front of her .
she didn ’ t utter one word as she did , didn ’ t even look at her , but merely picked up our large green shawl ( we have one that we use ) , covered her head and face completely , and lay down on the bed , facing the wall , but her whole body and her little shoulders were trembling . meanwhile , sir , i lay there , in the same condition as before . and then i saw , young man , i saw how katerina ivanovna , also without saying a word , went up to sonechka ’ s bed and knelt there all evening , kissing her feet ; she was unable to stand , and then , embracing , they both fell asleep together .
then he suddenly filled his glass , drank it down quickly , and grunted . since then , sir , he continued after a brief pause , since then , as a result of one unfortunate incident and the fact that some ill-intentioned people informed the authorities , which darya frantsevna had encouraged because she felt as if she hadn ’ t been treated with appropriate respect , since then my daughter , sofiya semyonovna , was compelled to obtain the yellow card of a prostitute , and as a result has no longer been able to reside with us . it was the landlady , amaliya fedorovna , who wouldn ’ t allow it ( darya frantsevna had previously encouraged her in this ) , as well as mr. lebezyatnikov .
at first he himself tried to have his way with her , and then he suddenly became very touchy : how can i , such a cultured person , he says , continue to live in the same apartment with a person like her ?
katerina ivanovna wouldn ’ t tolerate it and got involved .
and now sonechka stops by mostly after dark , comforts katerina ivanovna , and leaves whatever money she can .
she lives in the apartment of the tailor kapernaumov , renting a room from them ; he ’ s lame and afflicted with a speech defect and his entire large family has the same defect .
his wife has it , too .
one morning i ’ d just woken up , sir , put on my ragged clothes , raised my hands to heaven , and set off to see his excellency , ivan afanasevich .
do you happen to know his excellency , ivan afanasevich ?
then you don ’ t know such a virtuous man !
wax before the face of the lord ; he melts like wax !
well , marmeladov , he says , you ’ ve disappointed my expectations once before . i ’ ll take you on again as my own responsibility , that ’ s what he said . remember this , he said , and now go away !
i kissed the dust at his feet , mentally , because he wouldn ’ t have allowed it , being a person of such high rank and modern ideas about public service ; i returned home , and when i announced that i ’ d been reinstated in my job and would be receiving a salary , lord , what a commotion it caused !
marmeladov paused again , overcome with strong emotion . just then a whole group of men entered from outside , already quite drunk , with the sound of a rented accordion and the soft , cracked voice of a seven-year-old child singing the little farm .
the tavern keeper and the waiters attended to the new arrivals . marmeladov , who didn ’ t pay any attention to these people , continued his story .
he already seemed very weak , but the more intoxicated he grew , the more talkative he became .
his recollections of his recent successes at work seemed to invigorate him , and some were even reflected in his face by a sort of radiance . this took place , good sir , about five weeks ago .
they ’ d both just found out , katerina ivanovna and sonechka , good lord , and it was as if i ’ d been admitted to the heavenly kingdom . it used to be that i ’ d lie around like a beast , and receive only abuse !
but that day : they walked around on tiptoe and kept the children quiet : semyon zakharych is tired from his work ; he ’ s resting : shh !
they ’ d serve me coffee before i went off to work , and they ’ d even heat up some cream ! they began to buy real cream , do you hear ? i have no idea how they scraped the money together to provide me with a decent uniform , eleven rubles and fifty kopecks .
boots , the finest calico shirtfronts , and a uniform : they threw it all together splendidly for eleven and a half rubles .
the first day , i arrived home from work in the morning and saw that katerina ivanovna had prepared two courses , soup and salted beef with horseradish , something we ’ d never even dreamt of before .
that is , none at all , sir , and now she looked as if she were going out visiting ; she was all dressed up ; it wasn ’ t as if she had anything to use , she did it all from nothing ; her hair was done up , she had a clean white collar and sleeve covers ; she looked like a completely different person , much younger and prettier . sonechka , my little sweetheart , had merely provided the money , while for the time being , she said , she thought it wouldn ’ t be proper for her to visit us too often , except after dark , so no one would see her .
you hear , do you hear ?
you hear , do you hear ?
of course , he says to him , i remember your service , semyon zakharych , and although you displayed a fondness for that trivial frailty , now , since you ’ ve made a promise , and besides , without you things had started to go badly .
( you hear , do you hear ? )
i hope , he says , now on your word of honor , —that is , all of it , i tell you , she made up the whole story , not as a result of thoughtlessness , sir , but so she could boast a bit !
when , six days later , i brought my first wages home—twenty-three rubles and forty kopecks—when i brought it all home , she called me a sweetie : you ’ re such a sweetie , she said ! we were all alone , sir , do you understand ? well , it ’ s not for my looks , and besides , what sort of husband am i ?
no , she pinched my cheek : you ’ re such a sweetie !
marmeladov paused , was about to smile , but suddenly his chin began to quiver , though he restrained himself .
this tavern , his debauched appearance , his five nights on a hay barge , his bottle , and , at the same time , this painful love for his wife and family disconcerted his listener . raskolnikov attended intensely , but with painful emotion .
marmeladov exclaimed after recovering . oh , sir , you may find all this amusing , as do the others , since i ’ m only upsetting you with the foolishness of all these petty details of my domestic life , but i don ’ t find it amusing in the least !
that ’ s because i can feel it all . i spent the rest of that entire heavenly day of my life and all that evening in fleeting dreams : that is , how i ’ d arrange everything , outfit the children , provide peace of mind to my wife , and return my only begotten daughter to the bosom of the family from her disgrace . and more , much more .
well , sir , my good sir—marmeladov suddenly seemed to shudder , raise his head , and stare at his listener—well , sir , the next day , after all these daydreams , that is , exactly five days ago , toward evening , by clever stealth , like a thief in the night , i stole the key from katerina ivanovna ’ s box , took out what was left of the money i ’ d brought home , i don ’ t recall how much it was , and now , look at me , all of you !
i ’ ve been away from home five days ; they ’ re looking for me , it ’ s the end of my job , and my uniform is left in some tavern near the egyptian bridge ; i traded it for these clothes . and it ’ s the end of everything !
marmeladov struck his fist on his forehead , clenched his teeth , closed his eyes , and placed his elbow firmly on the table .
but in a moment his face suddenly changed ; he glanced at raskolnikov with some sort of assumed cunning and feigned insolence , started laughing , and said : i visited sonya today . i went to ask her for some money to buy a drink so i could get rid of my hangover !
someone who ’ d just come in cried , then burst out laughing .
this bottle was bought with her money , sir , marmeladov uttered , addressing raskolnikov exclusively .
she gave me thirty kopecks , with her own hands , her last coins , all there was , i could see for myself . she didn ’ t say a word , merely looked at me in silence . that doesn ’ t happen here on earth , but up there .
they grieve over people , they weep , but they do not reproach them , they don ’ t !
but she needs them herself now , doesn ’ t she ?
what do you think , my dear sir ?
now she has to keep herself clean .
this extra cleanliness costs money , do you understand ?
well , she also has to buy makeup , doesn ’ t she ? starched petticoats , the kind of stylish shoes that display her little feet when she has to step over a puddle . do you understand , do you , sir , what this cleanliness means ?
well , sir , i , her own father , took those thirty kopecks to ease my hangover ! and i ’ m drinking , sir !
well , who would feel sorry for the likes of me ?
do you feel sorry for me now , sir , or not ?
tell me , sir , do you feel sorry or not ?
he wanted to refill his glass , but there was nothing left .
the bottle was empty .
why should anyone feel sorry for you ?
there was a burst of laughter and even some cursing .
the listeners laughed and cursed , and even those who weren ’ t listening joined in , simply looking at the sorry sight of the former civil servant . why feel sorry for me ?
marmeladov cried suddenly , standing up , his arm outstretched , now genuinely inspired , as if he ’ d been waiting for those words .
no , there ’ s no reason to feel sorry for me !
i should be crucified , nailed to a cross , not pitied .
but crucify me , oh judge , crucify me , and after having crucified me , then feel sorry for me !
i myself will come and ask to be crucified , for it ’ s not joy i seek , but sorrow and tears !
do you think , oh , shopkeeper , that your bottle has afforded me any pleasure ?
sorrow , sorrow is what i sought in its depths , sorrow and tears , and i found them and tasted of them ; but he who has pitied all men and who has understood everyone and everything , he will take pity on us ; he and no one else ; he is the judge .
he will come on that day and he will ask : where is thy daughter who sacrificed herself for her wicked and consumptive stepmother and for a stranger ’ s little children ?
where is thy daughter who pitied her earthly father , a useless drunkard , and who was not dismayed by his beastliness ? and he will say : come forth !
thy many sins are now also forgiven , for thou hast loved much . and he will forgive my sonya , he will ; i know that he will forgive her . just a little while ago when i was with her , i felt this in my heart !
and he will judge and forgive everyone , both the good and the evil , the wise men and the humble . and when he has finished with everyone , then he will summon us , too : come forth , he will say , even ye ! come forth , ye drunkards , come forth , ye weaklings , come forth , ye shameless ones !
and we will all come forth , without shame , and we will stand before him .
ye are made in the image of the beast and ye bear his mark ; but ye also shall come forth !
and the wise men and the learned men will exclaim , lord !
wherefore do you receive these people ? and he will say , i receive them , oh , ye wise men , i receive them , oh , ye learned men , because not one of them hath ever considered himself worthy .
and he will stretch forth his arms to us , and we will kiss his hands . and we will weep . and we will understand all things !
then will we understand all things !
and everyone will understand . she , too , will understand . oh , lord , thy kingdom come !
deep in thought , he sank down on the bench , weak and exhausted , looking at no one , oblivious of his surroundings .
his words made quite an impression ; silence reigned for a moment , but soon the previous laughter and curses resumed .
and so on and so forth .
let ’ s go , sir , marmeladov said suddenly , raising his head and turning to raskolnikov .
to kozel ’ s house , in the courtyard .
raskolnikov had been wanting to leave for some time ; he himself had even thought about helping the other man get home .
marme­ladov ’ s legs were much weaker than his words , and he leaned heavily on the young man .
they had only about two or three hundred paces to walk .
the closer they got to his house , the more and more the drunken man was overcome by embarrassment and fear .
i ’ m not afraid of katerina ivanovna now , he muttered in agitation . it ’ s not that she ’ ll begin tearing out my hair .
what do i care about my hair ?
that ’ s what i say !
i ’ m also afraid of the red blotches on her cheeks .
i ’ m also afraid of the children ’ s crying .
i just don ’ t ! but i ’ m not afraid of a beating . you should know , sir , not only are such beatings not painful , i even enjoy them .
for i myself couldn ’ t do without them . it ’ s better that way . let her beat me ; it relieves her soul .
he ’ s a locksmith , a german , he ’ s rich .
they entered from the courtyard and went up to the fourth floor .
the farther they climbed , the darker the stairs became .
it was almost eleven o ’ clock , and even though at that time of year there ’ s no real night in petersburg , it was very dark at the top of the stairs .
the small sooty door at the end of the stairway , at the very top , was open . a candle stub lit the poorest of rooms , only ten paces long ; it was entirely visible from the hallway .
everything was thrown about and in disarray , especially the children ’ s clothing . a bedsheet with holes in it had been hung across the back corner . behind it , most likely , stood a bed .
there were only two chairs in the room itself and a very tattered oilcloth sofa , in front of which stood an old kitchen table made of pine , unpainted and uncovered .
at the edge of the table was a partially burned tallow candle stub in an iron candlestick .
it turned out that marmeladov lived in a separate room , not in that corner ; his room was one through which people had to pass . the door to the farthest rooms or cells , into which amaliya lippevekhsel ’ s apartment had been divided , stood slightly ajar . there was a great deal of noise and shouting .
it seemed that people were playing cards and having tea .
raskolnikov recognized katerina ivanovna immediately .
she was a terribly emaciated woman , thin , rather tall and elegant , with lovely dark brown hair still , and real red blotches on her cheeks .
she paced back and forth in her little room , arms folded across her chest , lips parched , gasping unevenly for breath . her eyes were shining as if she had a fever , but her glance was sharp and steady , and her consumptive and agitated face made a morbid impression in the last light of the flickering candle end quivering on her face .
she seemed to raskolnikov to be about thirty years old and was certainly no match for marmeladov . she didn ’ t hear and didn ’ t see the men entering ; she seemed to be in some sort of stupor in which she neither saw nor heard anything .
it was stuffy in the room , but she hadn ’ t opened the window ; there was a stench emanating from the staircase , but the door stood open ; waves of tobacco smoke wafted in from the inner rooms through the open door ; she was coughing but hadn ’ t closed the door .
the youngest girl , around six years old , was asleep on the floor , sitting up somehow , hunched over , her head resting on the sofa . the little boy , a year older than her , was trembling in the corner and crying . he ’ d probably just been beaten .
the eldest daughter , around nine years old , was as tall and slim as a matchstick , wearing only a wretched , very tattered blouse , and draped over her bare shoulders a decrepit cotton shawl that had probably been made for her about two years ago , because now it didn ’ t even reach her knees ; she stood in the corner next to her younger brother , embracing his neck with one long arm , desiccated as a matchstick .
she seemed to be comforting him , whispering something to him , doing all she could so he wouldn ’ t start whimpering again , while at the same time she followed her mother with her very , very large dark eyes , which seemed even larger on her emaciated and frightened little face .
the woman , noticing a stranger , paused distractedly in front of him ; having returned to her senses momentarily , she seemed to be wondering why he ’ d come in . but most likely she imagined that he was heading into the other rooms , since theirs served as the passageway . realizing this and not paying any more attention , she went to the hall door to close it ; then , catching sight of her husband kneeling on the threshold , she suddenly screamed .
she cried in a rage .
where ’ s the money ?
what ’ s left in your pocket ?
where are your clothes ?
where ’ s the money ?
marmeladov obediently and calmly raised both his arms to the sides to make it easier to search his pockets .
there wasn ’ t a kopeck left .
where ’ s the money ?
oh , lord , did he really spend it all on drink ?
there were twelve silver rubles left in the box !
suddenly , in a rage , she grabbed hold of his hair and dragged him into the room .
marmeladov himself made it easier for her , crawling on his knees meekly behind her .
even this gives me enjoyment ! even this isn ’ t painful , but en-joy-ab-le , my dear-est kind sir , he cried , being shaken by his hair and even bumping his forehead once on the floor .
the child who was asleep on the floor woke up and began crying .
the little boy in the corner couldn ’ t restrain himself , began shaking , burst into tears , and , in a terrible fright , almost a fit , rushed to his sister .
the older girl , half awake , trembled like a leaf .
all of it , he drank it all up !
the poor woman shouted in despair . and those aren ’ t his clothes !
they ’ re hungry , hungry ! ( wringing her hands , she pointed to the children . )
and you , aren ’ t you ashamed ?
were you drinking with him ?
were you drinking with him , too ?
the young man hastened to leave without saying a word .
besides , the interior door swung open , and several curious onlookers peeked in . impudent people in skullcaps were stretching their heads forward , laughing and smoking cigarettes or pipes . there were people wearing bathrobes , some left completely unfastened , or wearing almost indecent summer clothes ; others held cards in their hands .
they laughed especially heartily when marmeladov , being dragged by his hair , cried that he found it enjoyable .
they even began coming into the room ; at last one could hear a sinister screech : it was amaliya lippevekhsel forcing her way through to impose a sort of order and to frighten the poor woman for the hundredth time with her insulting command to vacate the apartment by the following day .
as he left , raskolnikov managed to shove his hand into his pocket , grab the change left from the ruble he ’ d cashed at the tavern , and place it on the windowsill unobserved . then , once on the staircase , he reconsidered and wanted to return . what a foolish thing i just did , he thought .
they have sonya , and i need the money myself . but after some thought , he realized that it was already impossible to take it back and he wouldn ’ t do it , anyway ; he gave up and returned to his own apartment . sonya also has to buy makeup , he went on , grinning sarcastically as he walked along the street .
but maybe sonechka won ’ t make any money today , because there ’ s always risk involved , hunting for valuable game , prospecting for gold .
what a gold mine they ’ ve discovered !
and they mine it !
and they ’ ve gotten used to it .
man ’ s a scoundrel : he can get used to anything ! but what if i ’ m wrong ? he suddenly cried inadvertently .
what if man ’ s really not a scoundrel , in general—that is , the whole human race ; that would mean that all the rest is prejudice , merely imagined fears , and there are no boundaries , and that ’ s how it should be !
it was already late in the day when he awoke after a disturbed sleep , but the sleep hadn ’ t fortified him .
he woke up feeling aggravated , irritable , and spiteful and looked around his small space with contempt .
it was a tiny closet of a room , some six paces long , and it had the most pitiful appearance , with dusty yellowish wallpaper peeling away in many places . the ceiling was so low that even a slightly tall man would find it unnerving , and it always seemed to him that at any moment he might bump his head against it . the furniture suited the room : there were three old chairs , not in good condition , and a painted table in the corner holding a few books and notebooks .
finally , a large , ungainly sofa took up almost the entire wall and about half the width of the whole room ; at one time it had been covered in chintz , but now it was in tatters and served as raskolnikov ’ s bed . he often slept on it just as he was , without undressing , without a sheet , covering himself with his old shabby student ’ s overcoat , with one small pillow at the head of the bed , under which he would place all the linen he owned , both clean and dirty , so that his head was raised a bit .
a small table stood in front of the sofa .
it was hard to sink lower or become more slovenly , but raskolnikov found this aspect even pleasant in his current frame of mind .
he had definitely withdrawn from everyone , like a turtle into its shell , and even the face of the servant , who was obliged to wait on him and who would sometimes enter his room , aroused his bile and occasioned tremors .
that sometimes happens with those monomaniacs who are too focused on something .
the landlady had stopped providing him with food about two weeks ago , and up to the present he hadn ’ t taken it upon himself to have it out with her , even though he went without his dinner .
the cook nastasya , the landlady ’ s only servant , welcomed the lodger ’ s mood and had completely stopped sweeping and straightening his room , except that about once a week she would sometimes take a broom to it , as if by accident .
it was she who had just awakened him .
why are you sleeping ?
she yelled at him .
it ’ s past nine o ’ clock . i brought you some tea . do you want it ?
the lodger opened his eyes , shuddered , and recognized nastasya .
is that tea from the landlady or what ?
he asked , slowly and painfully raising himself up a bit on the sofa .
she placed her own cracked teapot in front of him , with its diluted tea and two yellow lumps of sugar .
here , nastasya , take this , please , he said , fumbling in his pocket ( he ’ d been sleeping in his clothes ) , and he pulled out a handful of copper coins .
and get me a little sausage from the sausage maker , the cheapest sort .
i ’ ll bring you a roll in a moment , but wouldn ’ t you like some cabbage soup instead of sausage ?
i saved you some , but you came home late .
it ’ s good cabbage soup .
when she ’ d brought in the soup and he ’ d set about eating it , nastasya sat down on the sofa next to him and started chatting . she was a peasant woman and very talkative .
praskovya pavlovna wants to complain to the police about you , she said .
what does she want ?
you don ’ t pay her any money and you won ’ t vacate the room .
it ’ s clear what she wants .
oh , hell , that ’ s all i needed , he muttered , grinding his teeth . no , that ’ s not . a good thing right now .
she ’ s a fool , he said aloud .
i ’ ll go see her today . i ’ ll talk to her .
she may be a fool , just like i am , but what about you ?
are you clever , lying here like a sack , with nothing to show for it ? before , you said , you used to teach children ; why don ’ t you do anything now ? raskolnikov said reluctantly and harshly .
what do you do ?
what kind of work ?
i think , he replied seriously after a little pause .
nastasya simply collapsed in laughter .
she was easily amused , and when she found something funny , she laughed inaudibly , her whole body rocking and shaking until she felt sick .
have you thought up a lot of money ?
she was finally able to utter .
without boots , you can ’ t go teach .
he continued reluctantly , as if replying to his own thoughts .
you want all your capital at once ? he regarded her with a strange look .
yes , all my capital , he replied firmly , after a slight pause .
well , better to go slowly , or you ’ ll scare me ; i ’ m already very frightened .
should i get you a roll , or not ?
a letter came for you yesterday while you were out .
i don ’ t know from whom .
i paid the mailman three kopecks .
will you pay me back ?
bring it to me , for heaven ’ s sake , bring it ! raskolnikov cried in great excitement .
a minute later , the letter appeared .
just as he thought : it was from his mother , in ryazan province .
he even turned pale as he took it .
he hadn ’ t received any letters in some time ; but now something else suddenly took hold of his heart .
nastasya , go away , for heaven ’ s sake ; here ’ s your three kopecks , only go away right now , for heaven ’ s sake !
the letter trembled in his hands : he didn ’ t want to open it in her presence : he wanted to be alone with the letter .
after nastasya left , he quickly raised the letter to his lips and kissed it ; then for a long time he gazed at the handwriting of the address , at his mother ’ s familiar , beloved , tiny slanted writing , she who ’ d once taught him how to read and write .
he took his time ; he even seemed afraid of something .
he finally opened it : the letter was long , thick , and weighed almost a full ounce ; two large pieces of writing paper were covered with tiny script . my dear rodya , his mother wrote . it ’ s been more than two months since i ’ ve written you a letter , as a result of which i ’ ve suffered , at times even lost sleep , wondering about you .
but most likely you won ’ t blame me for my unintended silence .
you know how i love you ; you ’ re all we have , dunya and i , you mean everything to us , all our hope , all our aspiration .
i was so upset when i learned that you ’ d left the university several months ago because you were unable to support yourself , and that your lessons and other sources had ended !
how could i help you with my pension of only one hundred and twenty rubles a year ?
as you well know , i ’ d borrowed those fifteen rubles i sent you four months ago from our local merchant afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , on the promise of my pension .
he ’ s a good man and was your father ’ s acquaintance .
but in giving him the right to receive my pension for me , i was obliged to wait until i repaid my debt , and that ’ s only just happened , so all this time i haven ’ t been able to send you anything . but now , thank god , it seems i can send you some more ; in general , we can even boast of good fortune now about which i hasten to inform you .
in the first place , could you guess , dear rodya , that your dear sister has been living with me for the last month and a half , and we ’ ll no longer be separated in the future .
praise the lord , her torments have ended , but i ’ ll tell you everything in order , so you ’ ll know what ’ s happened and what we ’ ve been keeping from you up to now .
when you wrote to me about two months ago that you ’ d heard from someone or other that dunya had to endure much rudeness in mr. svidrigaylov ’ s house and you asked me for a more detailed explanation—what could i write to you at that time ? if i ’ d told you the whole truth , you ’ d probably have dropped everything and rushed to see us , even come on foot , because i know your character and your feelings , and you wouldn ’ t have allowed your sister to be insulted .
i myself was in despair , but what could i do ?
even i didn ’ t know the whole truth then .
the main difficulty was that dunya , who ’ d entered their household last year as a governess , had received an advance of one hundred rubles , on the condition that a certain amount would be deducted from her salary each month ; therefore , she couldn ’ t leave her position until she ’ d repaid her debt .
this amount ( i can now explain it all to you , precious rodya ) she ’ d accepted mostly so she could send you sixty rubles , which you needed then and which you received from us last year .
at the time we deceived you , writing that it had come from dunya ’ s savings , but that wasn ’ t so . now i ’ m telling you the whole truth because everything ’ s suddenly changed , by the will of god , for the better , and so you ’ ll know how much dunya loves you and what a precious heart she has .
as a matter of fact , right from the start mr. svidrigaylov treated her very rudely and made various impolite remarks and insults to her at the table .
but i don ’ t want to dwell on these agonizing difficulties and upset you for no reason , since all of that ’ s stopped .
in brief , in spite of the kind and generous treatment by marfa petrovna , mr. svidrigaylov ’ s wife , and all the servants , dunechka had a very difficult time , especially when mr. svidrigaylov , following old regimental custom , was under the influence of bacchus .
but what happened afterward ?
just imagine that this madman had conceived a passion for dunya sometime earlier , but had been concealing it under the guise of rudeness and contempt for her .
perhaps he himself was ashamed and horrified to see that he himself , at his age and as the father of a family , harbored such frivolous hopes ; therefore , he inadvertently took his anger out on dunya .
perhaps by his rude treatment and mockery he wanted to hide the whole truth from other people .
but , in the end , he couldn ’ t restrain himself and dared make an open and vile proposition to dunya , promising her various rewards ; moreover , he said he would forsake everything and go to another village with her or , perhaps , even abroad .
you can imagine her suffering !
it was impossible for her to leave her position at that time , not only because of her financial obligation , but because she wanted to spare marfa petrovna , who might suddenly conceive a hatred for her , and consequently arouse discord in the household . it would create a huge scandal for dunechka ; she ’ d never be able to escape it . there were many other reasons why dunya couldn ’ t consider removing herself from this horrible house earlier than six weeks .
of course , you know dunya , you know how clever she is and what a strong character she has .
she can tolerate many things and find so much generosity within herself even in the most extreme circumstances , so as not to lose her strength .
she didn ’ t even write to me about all this so as not to upset me , though we often exchanged news .
the finale was unexpected .
marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dunechka in the garden . misinterpreting the whole affair , she blamed dunya for everything , thinking that she was the cause of it all .
it occasioned a terrible scene right there in the garden : marfa petrovna even struck her , and didn ’ t want to listen to reason . she shouted for a whole hour and finally ordered that dunya be sent back to me in town on a simple peasant ’ s cart , onto which they tossed all her things , linens , dresses , in any which way , untied and unpacked .
then it began to pour down rain ; dunya , insulted and disgraced , had to make the trip , all eleven miles , with a peasant in an open cart .
now just imagine , how and what could i write in reply to your letter that i ’ d received two months ago ?
i myself was in despair . i dared not tell you the truth because you ’ d be so unhappy , bitter , and angry . and what could you do ?
you might have gotten yourself into trouble ; besides , dunya wouldn ’ t allow it . i couldn ’ t just fill my letter with nonsense about this and that , when i felt such sorrow in my soul . rumors about this episode circulated through the whole town for an entire month , and it reached the point where dunya and i couldn ’ t even go to church because of all the contemptuous looks and whispers .
all of our acquaintances shunned us , and everyone stopped greeting us . i learned for certain that some merchants ’ shop assistants and some office clerks wanted to insult us in the worst possible way by tarring the gates of our house so that the landlord would demand that we vacate our apartment . the cause of all this was marfa petrovna , who ’ d managed to denounce and slander dunya in every household .
she was acquainted with everyone in town , and during that month she visited town continually . she ’ s somewhat talkative and loves to go on about family matters , especially complaining about her husband to each and every person , which is not a good thing ; so she spread the whole story in a very short time , not only in town , but throughout the district . i fell ill , but dunya was stronger than i was ; if you ’ d only seen how she endured it all and how she consoled and reassured me !
but , by god ’ s grace , our torments ended . mr. svidrigaylov thought better of it , repented , probably taking pity on dunya , and presented to marfa petrovna clear and complete evidence of dunya ’ s innocence , namely this : a letter that dunya had felt compelled to write and convey to him , even before marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden , one that remained in his possession after dunya ’ s departure . the note asked him to cease these personal declarations and secret meetings that he ’ d insisted on .
in this letter she reproached him in the most impassioned way and with total indignation for his dishonorable treatment of marfa petrovna . she reminded him that he was a father and the head of a household , and , finally , she said how vile it was for him to torment and distress a young woman who was already in distress and defenseless .
in a word , dear rodya , this letter was so nobly and poignantly written that i sobbed while reading it and to this day can ’ t do so without shedding tears .
contributing to dunya ’ s exoneration came the testimony of those servants who saw and knew much more than mr. svidrigaylov supposed , as always happens .
marfa petrovna was completely astounded and once again crushed , as she herself acknowledged ; on the other hand , she was fully convinced of dunechka ’ s innocence .
the very next day , sunday , heading directly to church , she tearfully implored our lady to give her the strength to bear this new ordeal and carry out her duty .
then , right after church , without making any stops , she came to us and told us everything . she wept bitterly and , with full repentance , embraced dunya and begged her forgiveness .
that same morning , without tarrying , she set off right from our house to all the households in town , and in each one , shedding tears , she restored dunya ’ s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and behavior in the most flattering terms .
she showed everyone dunechka ’ s handwritten letter to mr. svidrigaylov , read it aloud , and even allowed people to make copies of it ( which , it seems to me , was going too far ) .
in this way it took her several days to visit everyone in town , so that some people felt offended that she was partial to others . lines were formed since she was expected in advance at every household and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would read the letter there . at each reading , people would line up who ’ d already heard the letter read several times in their own homes and in those of their other acquaintances .
in my opinion , much of this , very much , was unnecessary ; but such was marfa petrovna ’ s character . at least she fully restored dunechka ’ s honor . all the vileness of this affair left an indelible disgrace on her husband as the main culprit , so that i even began to feel sorry for him .
soon dunya was invited to give lessons in several households , but she refused .
all of this served principally to further the unexpected circumstance by which , one can say , our entire fate is now being altered . you should know , dear rodya , that a suitor has proposed to dunya and she ’ s already given her consent , which i ’ m writing to inform you about immediately .
even though this matter was conducted without your advice , you probably won ’ t bear any grudge either against me or your sister , since you yourself will see , from the facts , that it was impossible to delay or wait for your answer to arrive .
besides , you yourself couldn ’ t have judged it accurately without being here .
this is how it happened .
he ’ s already a court councillor , this petr petrovich luzhin , a distant relative of marfa petrovna ’ s , who herself helped a great deal in this affair .
it all began with his expressing a desire through her that he wished to make our acquaintance ; he was received properly , had some coffee , and the next day sent a letter in which he very politely stated his proposal and asked for a swift and definitive answer .
he ’ s a practical , busy man , just about to leave for petersburg , so he values every minute .
of course , at first we were very surprised , since all this took place so swiftly and unexpectedly . all that day we pondered and considered it together .
he ’ s a reliable , well-to-do person , works in two places , and has already amassed some capital . it ’ s true that he ’ s forty-five , but he has a rather pleasant appearance and can still be attractive to women ; he ’ s also an extremely solid and decent man , only a little gloomy and a bit arrogant . but perhaps it only seems that way , at first glance .
i advise you , dear rodya , when you meet him in petersburg , which will happen quite soon , not to judge him too quickly and heatedly , as you sometimes do , if at first glance you think something about him is not quite right . i say this just in case , although i ’ m sure that he ’ ll make a pleasant impression on you .
besides , in order to determine what sort of person he is , one must deal with him gradually and carefully , so as not to fall into error or prejudice , which is difficult to correct or smooth over afterward .
and petr petrovich , at least from many indications , is an extremely respectable man .
on his first visit , he stated that he was a positive person ; he shares to a large extent , as he himself explained it , the convictions of our younger generation , and he is an enemy of all prejudices . he said a great many other things because he seems a bit vain and very much likes to be listened to , but that ’ s almost not a fault .
of course , i understood very little , but dunya explained to me that although he is not a well-educated man , he is clever and , it seems , kind .
you know your sister ’ s character , rodya .
she ’ s a strong young woman , sensible , patient , and generous , although she has an impassioned heart , as i ’ ve come to know well . of course , there ’ s no particular love involved , either on her side or on his , but dunya , in addition to being a clever young woman , is also a lofty creature—an angel . she ’ ll consider it her duty to make her husband happy , and he , in turn , will concern himself with his wife ’ s happiness , which , for the time being , we have no major reason to doubt , even though , i must admit , this whole affair was concluded rather quickly .
besides , he ’ s a very prudent man and of course will realize that his own conjugal happiness will be more assured the happier dunechka is with him .
as for the fact that there are some irregularities in his character , some old habits , even some disagreement in their views ( which can ’ t be avoided even in the happiest of marriages ) , on that count dunechka told me that she ’ s relying on herself and there ’ s no reason to be concerned , that she can tolerate a great deal on the condition that their future relations will be fair and honest . for example , he seemed a bit harsh to me at first ; but that could be precisely because he ’ s such a straightforward man , and it ’ s absolutely so .
for example , during his second visit , after he ’ d already received her consent , he expressed in our conversation that previously , even before he knew dunya , he ’ d intended to marry an honest young woman , but one without a dowry , and certainly one who ’ d already experienced poverty ; because , as he explained , a husband should in no way be obligated to his wife , and that it ’ s much better if the wife considers her husband to be her benefactor .
i ’ ll add that he expressed himself a little more gently and affectionately than i described , but i ’ ve forgotten his exact words , and recall only the idea ; besides , he said it without any premeditation . obviously it just slipped out in the heat of conversation , so that afterward he even tried to correct himself and soften it . but it still seemed somewhat harsh to me , and i conveyed this to dunya later .
but she replied , even somewhat annoyed , that words are not the same as deeds , and of course that ’ s fair .
before deciding , dunechka didn ’ t sleep the whole night ; supposing that i was already asleep , she got out of bed and spent the whole night pacing back and forth in the room . finally she knelt down and prayed fervently in front of the icon for a long time ; in the morning , she announced to me that she ’ d made a decision .
i ’ ve already mentioned that petr petrovich is now heading to petersburg . he has important business there , since he wants to open a public lawyer ’ s office in the capital . he ’ s been engaged for a while in various legal actions and lawsuits , and a few days ago he won an important case .
he has to go to petersburg because he has an important matter pending in the senate .
thus , dear rodya , he might prove extremely useful for you in all sorts of ways ; dunya and i have already supposed that you , even from this day forward , might definitely launch your future career and consider your fate now clearly determined .
oh , if only this were to come to pass !
it would be such a benefit that one would have to regard it as nothing other than a gift to us directly from the almighty .
we even dared mention a few words on this account to petr petrovich . he expressed himself cautiously and said that of course , since he wouldn ’ t be able to get along without a secretary , naturally it would be better to pay a salary to a relative , rather than to a stranger , if that person turns out to be competent to carry out his duties ( as if you could turn out to be incompetent ! ) .
then he expressed his doubt that your studies at the university would allow you time to work in his office .
the matter was left there for the moment , but now dunya can think about nothing but this .
for the last few days , she ’ s simply been in a sort of excited state and has devised an entire scheme about how you could become petr petrovich ’ s comrade and even his partner in his legal affairs , all the more so since you yourself are studying law .
i ’ m in complete agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , seeing their complete likelihood .
in spite of petr petrovich ’ s present , extremely understandable evasiveness ( because he doesn ’ t know you yet ) , dunya ’ s quite sure that she ’ ll manage it all by means of her good influence over her future husband , and she ’ s convinced of that .
of course , we were careful not to let anything slip out about these future dreams of ours , especially about your becoming his partner . he ’ s a pragmatic person and might take it very coolly , since all this might seem to him to be only dreams .
similarly , neither dunya nor i have said a word to him about our strong hope that he would help us support you financially while you ’ re at the university . we didn ’ t talk about it , first because it might happen later of its own accord ; probably , he himself , without unnecessary words , will propose it ( as if he could refuse this to dunya ) , all the more so since you yourself might become his right-hand man in the office and then you would receive this assistance not in the form of charity , but as earned income .
that ’ s what dunya wants to arrange and i agree with her completely .
the second reason we didn ’ t say anything was because i particularly wanted to put you on an equal footing with him at our impending meeting with him . when dunya told him about you with such enthusiasm , he replied that one must first take a close look at anyone to form a judgment about him , and that he would reserve for himself the right to form his own opinion of you until he made your acquaintance .
you know , my precious rodya , it seems to me , for several reasons ( however , by no means related to petr petrovich , but just so , for some of my very own , personal , perhaps even old-womanish whims ) —it seems to me that perhaps i ’ d be better off if , after their wedding , i were to live on my own , as i do now , and not with them . i ’ m absolutely sure that he ’ d be so generous and considerate as to invite me and propose that i not be separated from my daughter . if he hasn ’ t said so up to now , naturally it ’ s because that ’ s what he intends even without words ; but i ’ ll refuse .
i ’ ve noticed more than once in life that husbands are not very fond of their mothers-in-law ; not only do i not want to be the slightest burden to anyone , but i myself want to be completely free , while i still have my own crust of bread to eat and children such as you and dunechka .
if possible , i ’ ll settle somewhere near both of you , because , rodya , i saved the most pleasant news for the end of my letter : you should know , my dear , that very soon we may all be together again and the three of us will embrace after our separation of almost three years !
it ’ s definitely been decided that dunya and i will leave for petersburg , i don ’ t know exactly when , but , in any case , very , very soon , perhaps even in a week .
everything depends on the instructions of petr petrovich , who will let us know as soon as he gets his bearings in petersburg .
for several reasons he wants to hasten the marriage ceremony and even , if possible , hold the wedding before the next church fast , and if that doesn ’ t work , then as soon as possible after the fast of the assumption .
oh , i ’ ll take you to my heart with such happiness !
dunya ’ s excited and elated at the prospect of seeing you , and once she said , as a joke , that she ’ d marry petr petrovich for that reason alone .
she ’ s an angel !
she has nothing to add for you now , but she told me to write only that she has so many things to talk over with you , so very many things , that she won ’ t even pick up a pen now because she couldn ’ t convey it all in just a few lines , and she ’ d only upset herself ; she told me to send you her warmest embrace and countless kisses .
but , in spite of the fact that we may very soon be meeting in person , i ’ ll still be sending you some money in a few days , as much as i can .
now that everyone has learned that she ’ ll be marrying petr petrovich , my credit has suddenly improved , and i know for sure that afanasy ivanovich will trust me , on account of my pension , even up to seventy-five rubles , so i may be able to send you twenty-five or thirty rubles .
i ’ d send you more , but i ’ m concerned about our expenses for the trip . although petr petrovich was kind enough to take upon himself a portion of the cost of our journey to the capital , namely , he offered to convey at his expense our baggage and a large trunk ( somehow through his acquaintances there ) , we still have to consider our arrival in petersburg , where we can ’ t show up without a kopeck , if only for the first few days .
meanwhile , dunechka and i have calculated everything precisely , and it turns out that the trip will cost us very little . we ’ re only sixty miles from the railroad station , so just in case , we ’ ve made an agreement with a peasant driver here whom we know . and after that , dunechka and i will happily travel in a third-class railway car .
thus , i may manage to send you not twenty-five rubles , but more likely thirty .
enough : i ’ ve completely filled two entire sheets , and there ’ s no space left ; it ’ s our whole story : so many events have accumulated !
and now , my precious rodya , i embrace you until our upcoming meeting and i give you my maternal blessing .
love dunya , your sister , rodya ; love her as she loves you , and know that she loves you without limit , more than she loves herself .
she ’ s an angel ; and you , rodya , you mean everything to us , all our hope , all our aspiration .
are you still saying your prayers to god , rodya , as you did before , and do you still believe in the goodness of our creator and savior ?
i ’ m afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the latest fashionable disbelief . if that ’ s so , then i pray for you .
remember , my dear , how in your childhood , when your father was still alive , you mumbled your prayers on my lap and how happy we all were then !
good-bye , or , rather , till we meet !
yours till the grave , almost all the while raskolnikov was reading , from the very beginning of the letter , his face was bathed in tears . however , after he ’ d finished , his face was pale , distorted by a spasm , and a painful , angry , spiteful smile curled on his lips .
he lay his head down on his meager , worn-out pillow , and he thought ; he thought for a long time . his heart was pounding , and his thoughts were violently agitated .
at last he felt stifled and cramped in that little yellow room of his , which resembled a cupboard or a trunk .
his gaze and his thoughts demanded space .
he grabbed his hat and left , this time no longer afraid of meeting anyone on the staircase ; he ’ d forgotten all about that . he took a route across voznesensky prospect toward vasilievsky island , as if hastening there on business , but , as was his custom , he walked without noticing the street , whispering and even talking aloud to himself , which fact greatly astonished the passersby .
many people thought he was drunk .
his mother ’ s letter tormented him . but as far as the basic , most important point was concerned , he had no doubts even for one moment , even while he was reading the letter .
the very heart of the matter was resolved in his mind , resolved once and for all : this marriage will never take place as long as i live , and to hell with mr. luzhin !
because this matter is obvious , he muttered to himself , smirking and maliciously celebrating in advance the triumph of his decision .
no , mama , no dunya , you can ’ t deceive me !
and what makes it even worse , they apologize for not asking my advice and for deciding the matter without me !
they think it ’ s impossible to break it off now ; we ’ ll see if it ’ s possible or not ! what a splendid excuse : petr petrovich , they say , is such a businesslike man that he can ’ t possibly get married in any other way than in a hurry , almost en route on a train .
no , dunya , i can see everything , and i know what those many things are that you want to talk over with me ; i also know what you worried about all night , pacing the room , and what you prayed about before the icon of our lady of kazan , the one that mama has in her bedroom .
so , in other words , it ’ s been decided once and for all : you ’ re pleased , avdotya romanovna , to marry that practical , rational man who ’ s amassed his capital ( who ’ s already amassed his capital ; that ’ s more impressive , more imposing ) , who ’ s working in two places , who shares the convictions of our younger generation ( as mama writes ) , and who seems to be a kind man , as dunya herself says . that word seems is the most splendid of all !
and this same dunechka is planning to marry that seems !
however , i ’ m curious : why did mama write to me about our younger generation ’ ? simply to characterize that man or with some future goal in mind : to persuade me to look kindly on mr. luzhin ?
i ’ m curious to resolve one more aspect : to what extent were they both open with each other that day and night , and then during the following days ? were all the words spoken honestly between them , or did they both understand that each of them felt the same thing in her heart and mind , and there was no reason to utter it aloud or to talk about it .
most likely , that ’ s part of what happened ; it ’ s clear from the letter : he seemed a bit harsh , and naïve mama let her views slip out to dunya , while she , of course , got angry and replied somewhat annoyed .
who wouldn ’ t be enraged when the matter ’ s so clear even without such naïve questions , when it ’ s all been decided , and there ’ s nothing more to say ?
then she writes to me , love dunya , rodya ; she loves you more than she loves herself ’ ; isn ’ t that a feeling of remorse secretly tormenting her for having agreed to sacrifice her daughter for her son ?
you ’ re our hope , you ’ re our everything !
spite was seething in him more and more intensely , and if he ’ d encountered mr. luzhin at that very moment , he might just have killed him !
hmm , it ’ s true , he continued , pursuing the vortex of thoughts spinning in his head .
it ’ s true that one must deal with him gradually and carefully to determine what sort of person he is , but mr. luzhin ’ s character is obvious .
the main thing is he ’ s a businesslike man ’ and seems to be kind ’ : what a joke that he took the conveyance of their baggage upon himself and that he ’ s shipping a large trunk at his own expense !
meanwhile , both of them , his fiancée and her mother , hire a peasant and will ride in his cart , covered with bast matting !
it ’ s only sixty miles and then we ’ ll happily travel in a third-class railway car ’ another six hundred miles .
that ’ s sensible : you must cut your coat to fit your cloth ; and you , mr. luzhin , what about it ?
how could you not know that her mother ’ s borrowing money in advance against her pension to cover the cost of their journey ?
of course , here you have a common commercial transaction , an undertaking for mutual profit with equal shares ; in other words , he ’ s splitting their expenses in half ; bread and salt in common , but bring your own tobacco , as the proverb says .
but here that efficient man has hoodwinked them a bit : the baggage costs less than their passage and might even go for free .
why don ’ t they both see it , or do they take no notice of it on purpose ?
but they ’ re content , content !
just think , these are the flowers : the real fruit lies ahead !
it ’ s not his stinginess or miserliness that ’ s important here , but the tone of it all .
it ’ ll become the tone of their future marriage , it ’ s a prophecy .
what ’ ll she have left after she arrives in petersburg ?
three silver rubles or two little paper bills , as that .
why , she ’ s already managed to guess for whatever reasons that it ’ ll be impossible for her and dunya to live together after the marriage , even at first .
that nice man , most likely , somehow let it slip , he gave himself away , even though mama brushes it off completely , i , she says , i ’ ll refuse .
well then , what will she rely upon : on her hundred and twenty ruble pension , after she deducts the money she owes afanasy ivanovich ?
she ’ ll knit little winter scarves or sew little sleeve covers , and ruin her aging eyes .
but those little scarves will add only twenty rubles a year to her hundred and twenty , that much i know .
that means they ’ ll still have to rely on mr. luzhin ’ s noble generosity : he himself , she says , he ’ ll propose it , he ’ ll entreat me .
it ’ s always the same with these schilleresque beautiful souls : ‡ up to the last moment they dress a person in peacock feathers , until the last moment they hope for the good , not the bad ; and although they have a feeling about the other side of the coin , they won ’ t utter a single word about it to themselves for any reason .
i ’ m curious as to whether mr. luzhin has received any official decorations ; i ’ ll bet he has the order of saint anna§ and that he wears it at dinners with contractors and merchants .
he might even put it on for his wedding .
but to hell with him !
well , never mind mama , she can think what she wants—that ’ s who she is ; but what about dunya ?
dear dunechka , i know you so well !
you were almost twenty the last time we saw each other : i understood your character already .
mama writes that you can tolerate many things .
i knew that two and a half years ago and have been thinking about it since then , precisely about this , that dunya can tolerate many things .
if she can bear mr. svidrigaylov and all the aftermath , that means she really has a high tolerance .
now she imagines , together with mama , that she can even tolerate mr. luzhin , expounding his theory regarding the advantage of wives rescued from poverty and husbands who do them such a great honor and make it clear at their very first meeting .
it must have been clear to her what sort of person he was and with whom she ’ d have to live .
she would eat only black bread and drink only water rather than sell her soul or give up her moral freedom in exchange for comfort ; she wouldn ’ t trade it for all of schleswig-holstein , ¶ let alone for mr. luzhin .
no , that wasn ’ t the dunya i knew , and .
that ’ s for sure !
it ’ s hard to spend your whole life as a governess earning only two hundred rubles and traipsing around the provinces ; but still i know my sister would sooner go work with negroes on a plantation or with latvian peasants for a baltic german # than defile her spirit and her moral feelings by a relationship with a man she doesn ’ t respect and with whom she has nothing in common—forever , merely for personal gain !
why is she agreeing now ?
what ’ s the point ?
what ’ s the answer ?
it ’ s clear : she wouldn ’ t sell herself on her own , for her own comfort , even to save herself from death , but she would sell herself for someone else !
she ’ d sell herself for a dear , beloved person !
that ’ s the crux of the matter : she ’ s selling herself for her brother and for her mother !
she ’ ll sell everything !
oh , with such an opportunity we ’ ll suppress moral feeling ; we ’ ll bring our freedom , serenity , even our conscience , everything , everything to the flea market .
as long as our beloved creatures are happy .
moreover , we ’ ll devise our own casuistry , we ’ ll learn from the jesuits , and perhaps we ’ ll reassure ourselves for a while , persuade ourselves that it ’ s necessary , really necessary for a good cause . that ’ s just how we are and it ’ s clear as day .
it ’ s clear there ’ s no one else involved except rodion romanovich raskolnikov , standing front and center .
yes , indeed , we can arrange for his happiness , support him at the university , make him a partner in the law office , guarantee his entire future ; perhaps afterward he ’ ll become wealthy , honored , and respected , maybe end up famous .
why here ’ s her rodya , her precious rodya , her firstborn !
how could she not sacrifice a daughter for such a firstborn son ?
oh , loving , unjust hearts !
perhaps we wouldn ’ t even reject sonechka ’ s fate !
sonechka , sonechka marmeladova , eternal sonechka , as long as the world lasts !
the sacrifice , have you both measured the enormous sacrifice ?
are you strong enough ?
do you realize , dunya , that sonechka ’ s fate is no worse than yours would be with mr. luzhin ?
there ’ s no particular love involved , mama writes .
but what if there ’ s disgust , contempt , loathing—then what ?
then it turns out , once more , of course , that you have to keep yourself clean .
isn ’ t that right ?
do you understand , do you really understand what that cleanliness entails ? do you understand that luzhin ’ s idea of cleanliness is just the same as sonechka ’ s , perhaps even worse , nastier , filthier , because you , dunechka , can count on a life of luxury , whereas with sonya , it ’ s simply a matter of life and death !
well , and if you ’ re not up to it , will you repent ?
so much sorrow , grief , curses , and tears hidden from everyone , so much , because you ’ re no marfa petrovna , are you ?
why , even now she ’ s distraught , she ’ s suffering ; but what about then , when she sees everything as it really is ? what did you really think of me ?
i don ’ t want your sacrifice , dunya ; i don ’ t want it , mama !
it won ’ t take place as long as i live , it won ’ t , it won ’ t !
i won ’ t accept it !
he suddenly came to his senses and stopped .
it won ’ t take place ?
what ’ ll you do so that it won ’ t ?
what right do you have ?
what can you promise them in return to have such a right ?
to devote your whole destiny to them , your future , when you complete your course of studies and attain a position ?
we ’ ve heard all that before , and it ’ s just an attempt to frighten us , but now ?
you have to do something right now , do you understand ?
what are you doing in the meantime ?
they get their money as credit against that hundred-ruble pension or as an advance from the svidrigaylovs ! how will you protect them from those svidrigaylovs or from afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , you future millionaire , you , you zeus , disposing of their fates ?
but in ten years , mother will have managed to go blind from knitting scarves and perhaps from shedding tears ; she ’ ll waste away from fasting ; and my sister ?
well , just think what can happen to her in ten years or during that time ?
that ’ s how raskolnikov tortured and teased himself with these questions , even deriving some enjoyment from it .
besides , all these questions weren ’ t new or unexpected , but old ones , painful , and persistent .
all this current anguish had taken root in him ages ago ; it had grown , accumulated , and of late matured and intensified , having assumed the form of a terrible , wild , fantastic question that tormented his heart and mind , irresistibly demanding a solution . now the letter from his mother had suddenly struck him like a thunderbolt . clearly it was unnecessary to be dejected now or to suffer passively , merely considering these questions insoluble ; instead , it was absolutely necessary to do something right now , as soon as possible .
no matter what , he had to decide to do something , or else .
or renounce life altogether !
submit to fate as it is , once and for all , and stifle everything in me , rejecting any right to act , live , or love !
do you understand , do you really understand , dear sir , what it means when a person has nowhere else to go ?
all of a sudden he recalled marmeladov ’ s question from the day before . because everyone has to have somewhere to go . he suddenly shuddered : one thought , also from the day before , flashed through his mind again .
but he hadn ’ t shuddered because of that thought . he ’ d known , he ’ d had a premonition , that it would flash through his mind and he ’ d already been expecting it ; and this thought was not from the day before at all .
but the difference was that a month ago , even as recently as yesterday , it had been only a daydream , but now . now it suddenly appeared not as a daydream , but in some new , awe-inspiring , completely unfamiliar form , and all of a sudden he himself became aware of it . his head throbbed , and things grew dark before his eyes .
he glanced around hurriedly ; he was looking for something . he wanted to sit down and was searching for a bench . just then he was making his way along konnogvardeisky boulevard .
a bench was visible in the distance , about a hundred paces ahead . he walked as quickly as he could , but along the way he had a little adventure that attracted all his attention for a few minutes .
looking for a bench , he noticed just in front of himself , some twenty paces ahead , a woman walking along the street . at first , he paid her no attention , just as he hadn ’ t focused on other things appearing before him up to now . many times it had happened that he was walking home and didn ’ t recall the route he ’ d taken ; he ’ d grown used to that .
but there was something strange about this woman that caught his eye from the first glance , so that gradually his attention began to be focused on her—reluctantly at first , as if with annoyance , but then it grew stronger and stronger . suddenly he wanted to understand precisely what was so strange about her . first of all , she must have been a very young woman ; she was walking along bareheaded in the heat , without parasol or gloves , waving her arms in a ludicrous manner .
she was wearing a silk dress made of some light fabric ( some kind of cloth ) , but in a very odd way , scarcely fastened , and torn at the waist in the back , a large piece of material detached and hanging loose ; a little scarf had been tossed over her bare neck , but it protruded crookedly to one side . to top it all off , the young woman was walking unsteadily , stumbling , even swaying from side to side .
he caught up with the young woman at the bench , but , upon reaching it , she collapsed into one corner , threw her head against the back of the bench , and closed her eyes , obviously from extreme exhaustion .
examining her closely , he guessed at once that she was completely drunk .
it was a strange and absurd sight to behold .
he even wondered whether he might be mistaken .
before him was an extremely young face , about sixteen , perhaps even only fifteen—a little face , under fair hair , pretty , but quite flushed and seemingly swollen . the young woman seemed to understand very little ; she had crossed one leg over the other and was displaying more of it than was proper , and , by all indications , she had very little awareness that she was outside on the street . raskolnikov didn ’ t sit down and didn ’ t want to walk away ; he stood in front of her in a quandary .
this boulevard was always deserted , and now , after one o ’ clock and in such heat , there was almost no one there at all .
however , just to one side , about fifteen paces away , at the edge of the street , stood a gentleman , who , by all appearances , also very much wanted to approach the young woman for some purpose . he , too , had probably seen her from a distance and was trying to catch up with her , but raskolnikov had hindered him .
the gentleman cast angry glances at him , trying , however , not to make them too obvious , waiting his turn impatiently until the annoying vagabond left .
the matter was clear . this gentleman was about thirty , stout , plump , hale and hearty , with pink lips , a little mustache , and very foppishly dressed . raskolnikov got very angry ; he suddenly wanted to insult this fat dandy .
for a moment , he left the young woman and approached the gentleman .
what do you want here ?
he cried , clenching his fists and laughing , his lips foaming with rage .
what ’ s the meaning of this ?
the gentleman asked sternly , frowning in haughty astonishment .
clear off , that ’ s what !
how dare you , you scum !
raskolnikov threw himself at the man with his fists , without even considering that the plump gentleman could easily get the better of two men his size .
but just at that moment someone grabbed him forcefully from behind : a policeman now stood between them .
enough , gentlemen , we ’ ll have no fighting in public places , if you please .
what do you want ?
he asked raskolnikov sternly , noticing his tattered clothes .
raskolnikov looked at him attentively .
he had a manly soldier ’ s face , with a gray mustache , sideburns , and an intelligent expression .
you ’ re exactly what i want , he cried , grabbing him by the arm .
i ’ m a former student , raskolnikov . you should know that , too , he said , turning to the gentleman . please come along with me ; i ’ ll show you something .
after taking the policeman by the arm , he pulled him over to the bench .
here , look , she ’ s completely drunk and was just walking along the boulevard ; heaven knows who she is or where she ’ s from , but she doesn ’ t look like that ’ s her profession .
then they turned her loose onto the street .
look , her dress is torn ; you can see how it was put on : someone else dressed her , she didn ’ t do it herself , and it was by someone ’ s clumsy hands , men ’ s hands . and now look over here at this dandy , with whom i was just about to fight ; i ’ m not acquainted with him ; this is the first time i ’ ve seen him . he , too , must have noticed along his way that she was drunk and unaware of where she was and now he very much wants to go up and grab her—since she ’ s in such a state—and take her off somewhere .
i myself saw him observing and following her , but i interfered , and now he ’ s waiting until i leave .
he ’ s just withdrawn a little , as if to roll a cigarette . how can we get her away from him ? how can we get her home ?
the policeman understood everything in an instant and thought about it .
the fat gentleman ’ s intention , of course , was easily explicable , but there was the girl .
the officer bent over to get a closer look at her , his features reflecting genuine compassion .
ah , what a shame !
he said , shaking his head . she ’ s still just a child .
they tricked her , that ’ s for sure .
listen here , miss , he said to her .
where might you live ?
ah , dear me , this is bad !
he said , shaking his head again , feeling embarrassed , compassionate , and indignant . he said , turning to raskolnikov , right there and then looking him over rapidly from head to toe . raskolnikov must have appeared a bit strange to the policeman : he was in tatters , yet was giving away his own money !
did you come upon them far from here ?
i tell you , she was walking ahead of me , swaying , right here along the boulevard .
when she reached this bench , she collapsed .
ah , what shameful things occur nowadays in this world , oh lord !
such a simple girl , and drunk already !
she ’ s been tricked , that ’ s for sure .
there are many young women just like her nowadays . she looks delicate , too , as if she might be a lady .
he bent over her once more .
perhaps he had daughters of his own like her—as if she might be a lady and looks delicate , well mannered and already imitating all the latest fashions .
what a scoundrel , and he won ’ t go away !
the man heard him and was about to get angry again , but reconsidered and limited himself merely to a contemptuous glance .
we may be able to get her away from him , sir , replied the police officer thoughtfully .
he said , leaning over her .
she walked quickly , swaying violently as she had before .
the dandy followed her , but along the opposite side of the boulevard , and didn ’ t take his eyes off her .
he repeated aloud with a sigh .
he yelled after the mustachioed policeman .
what ’ s it to you ?
let him amuse himself .
( he pointed at the dandy . ) what ’ s it matter to you ?
the policeman didn ’ t understand and stared at him wide-eyed .
raskolnikov burst into laughter . said the officer , waving his arm , and followed the dandy and the girl , probably thinking that raskolnikov was insane or something far worse . he ’ s made off with my twenty kopecks , raskolnikov muttered spitefully when left alone .
well , let him get some money from that fellow , too , and then he ’ ll let the girl go off with him , and that ’ ll be the end of it . why am i getting involved here , trying to help ?
what right do i have to help ?
let them devour each other alive—what ’ s it to me ?
how did i dare part with those twenty kopecks ?
in spite of these strange words , he felt very wretched .
he sat down on the deserted bench .
his thoughts were scattered . in general , it was hard for him at that moment to think about anything at all .
he wanted to sink into forgetfulness , to forget everything , then wake up and start all over again .
she ’ ll come to her senses , weep for a while , and then her mother will find out . at first she ’ ll beat her , then whip her , severely and shamefully , and then , perhaps , drive her away . and if she doesn ’ t drive her away , darya frantsevna will get wind of it , and then my little girl will start scurrying from place to place .
then right to the hospital : that ’ s always how it is with those girls who live with their virtuous mothers and who fool around on the sly ; well , and then to the hospital again . back to the hospital . in two or three years—she ’ ll be a cripple , and all in all she ’ ll get to live only to eighteen or nineteen .
how have they all turned out ?
that ’ s the way it has to be , they say .
a certain percentage , they say , has to go away every year . probably to the devil , so as to invigorate the rest and not interfere with them .
they really have such fine words : they ’ re so comforting and erudite . once stated , a percentage , there ’ s nothing more to worry about . if it had been some other word , well then .
it might be more troubling .
what if dunechka somehow winds up in that percentage ?
if not that one , then a different one ?
where am i going ?
he wondered to himself .
razumikhin was one of his former comrades at the university .
it was remarkable that raskolnikov , who ’ d been at the university , had hardly any comrades , avoided everyone , visited no one , and received them only unwillingly . soon everyone turned away from him .
somehow he took no part whatsoever in general gatherings , conversations , amusements , anything .
he studied diligently , unsparingly , and for that they respected him , but no one liked him .
he was very poor and somehow arrogantly proud and uncommunicative ; it was as if he were concealing something inside .
to some of his comrades it seemed that he regarded them , everyone , from on high , as children , as if he ’ d surpassed them in his development , knowledge , and convictions , and regarded their convictions and interests as beneath him .
for some reason , he ’ d become friends with razumikhin—that is , not exactly friends , but he was more sociable with him , more honest .
but it was impossible to be in any other relationship with razumikhin .
he was an unusually cheerful and sociable fellow , good-natured to the point of innocence . nevertheless , beneath this innocence were concealed both depth and dignity .
his best friends realized this , and everyone liked him .
he was very clever , although sometimes really naïve .
his appearance was expressive—tall , thin , always badly shaven , and he had black hair .
sometimes he got into brawls , and he was reputed to be a very strong man .
one night , in a group , he floored all six and a half feet of an officer of the law with one blow . he could drink without limit , but could also abstain totally ; at times he could be unacceptably mischievous , but he could also refrain from mischief completely . razumikhin was also remarkable in that no failures ever troubled him and no adverse circumstances could ever seem to weigh him down .
he could be lodged even on a rooftop and endure intolerable hunger and extraordinary cold .
he was very poor and he alone supported himself completely , earning money by some sort of work .
one year he didn ’ t heat his room all winter and maintained that it was even more pleasant because a person can sleep better in the cold . at the present time , he had also been forced to leave the university , but not for long ; with all his might he was hastening to improve his circumstances so that he could continue his studies .
raskolnikov hadn ’ t been to see him for the last four months or so , and razumikhin didn ’ t even know where his friend ’ s apartment was .
once somehow , about two months ago , they were about to meet on the street , but raskolnikov turned away and even crossed over to the other side of the street so he wouldn ’ t be noticed .
but razumikhin , even though he did notice him , passed him by , not wishing to disturb his friend .
as a matter of fact , for some time i ’ ve been wanting to ask razumikhin for work , to arrange some lessons or something else for me .
suppose he does arrange some lessons , suppose he even shares his last kopecks with me , if he has any to share , so that i could even buy some boots , have my clothes mended , and offer some lessons .
well , and then what ?
what can i do with a few five-kopeck pieces ?
the question of why he ’ d just set out for razumikhin ’ s agitated him more than he himself even realized ; he searched anxiously for some sinister meaning for himself in this seemingly most ordinary action . so , did i really want to resolve this whole matter with razumikhin alone and find a way out through him ?
he asked himself in astonishment .
he reflected , rubbed his forehead , and then , strange to say , after considerable thought , a very curious idea somehow unexpectedly , suddenly , almost of its own accord , entered his head .
to razumikhin , he uttered suddenly with total composure , as if a definitive solution was contained within this idea , i ’ ll go to razumikhin , of course i will . but—but not now .
on another day , i ’ ll go after that , when that ’ s already been done and everything will begin anew . all of a sudden , he came to his senses .
after that , he cried , jumping up from the bench . will that actually happen ?
will that really and truly occur ? he abandoned the bench and set off walking , almost running ; he wanted to turn back , head home , but suddenly felt terribly repulsed by the idea of going home : it was there , in his corner , in that awful cupboard of a room , that that had been ripening for more than a month ; he set off wherever his legs would carry him .
his nervous trembling had become somewhat feverish ; he even started shivering ; he felt a chill , in spite of the great heat .
he began , with a kind of effort , almost unconsciously , according to some inner necessity , to examine all the things he was encountering , as if urgently seeking diversion , but he didn ’ t succeed very well and continually lapsed into thought .
when , shuddering , he once again lifted his head and glanced around , he immediately forgot what he ’ d been thinking about and even where he ’ d been going . in that way , he walked all across vasilievsky island and came out to the little neva , crossed a bridge , and turned toward the islands .
at first his tired eyes , accustomed to the dust of the city , the lime plaster , and the huge , crowded , oppressive buildings , took pleasure in the verdure and freshness .
there was no stuffiness , no stench , no taverns .
but soon these new , pleasant sensations also became painful and annoying .
at times he stopped in front of some dacha adorned with greenery , looked through the fence , and in the distance , on the balconies and terraces , glimpsed fashionably dressed women and children running around in the garden .
the flowers interested him particularly ; he looked at them longest of all .
he also encountered luxurious carriages and men and women on horseback ; he followed them attentively with his eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from sight .
once he stopped and counted his money : it turned out that he had about thirty kopecks .
i gave twenty to the policeman and three to nastasya for the letter—so yesterday i must have given the marmeladovs forty-seven or fifty kopecks , he thought , calculating for some reason , but soon even forgot why he ’ d taken the money out of his pocket .
he remembered why as he was passing an establishment , something like an eating house , and felt that he wanted to have a bite to eat . upon entering the building , he downed a shot of vodka and ate a little pie with some sort of filling .
he finished it along the way . he hadn ’ t had any vodka for a long time and it had an immediate effect , although he had only one shot .
his legs suddenly grew heavy , and he began to feel a strong urge to sleep .
he started for home ; but when he reached petrovsky island , he paused in complete exhaustion , turned off the road , walked over to some bushes , dropped down on the grass , and immediately fell sound asleep .
in a morbid condition , our dreams are often distinguished by their extraordinary clarity , intensity , and a heightened resemblance to reality .
sometimes an outrageous scene takes shape , yet its setting and its entire course of development are so plausible and possess such subtle , unexpected details artistically corresponding to the total picture , that the dreamer couldn ’ t possibly conceive of them while awake , even if he were an artist like pushkin or turgenev .
such dreams , morbid dreams , are always remembered long afterward and produce a powerful impression on a person ’ s distraught and already overwrought organism .
raskolnikov had a terrible dream .
he dreamt of his childhood , while they were still living in their little town . he was a boy of about seven and was walking along with his father outside town late one holiday afternoon . it was a gray day ; the weather was stifling , and the place looked exactly as he remembered it : when compared , it was much more obscure even in his memory than it now appeared in his dream .
he could see the town very clearly , as if he held it in the palm of his hand ; there were no trees nearby ; somewhere very far away , on the edge of the horizon , was a small , dark thicket .
a tavern stood a few paces beyond the last garden of the town ; it was a large building and always made a very unpleasant impression on him ; it even frightened him whenever he happened to walk past it with his father .
there was always such a large crowd of people in front of it , shouting , laughing , cursing , howling in such dreadful , hoarse voices , and often brawling ; people with such drunken and dreadful mugs were always lingering outside .
whenever he encountered them , he always pressed up against his father and trembled . the country road that ran past the tavern was always so dusty and black .
it was a winding road ; after about three hundred paces it curved to the right , toward the cemetery .
a stone church with a green cupola stood in the middle of this cemetery ; he used to go there once or twice a year with his father and mother when a requiem was being sung for his grandmother who ’ d died a long time ago and whom he ’ d never known .
they always brought along a special dish on a white plate under a napkin ; it was made of sweetened rice with raisins arranged on top in the shape of a cross .
he loved this church and its ancient icons , most of which were lacking frames , and the old priest , with his quivering head .
next to his grandmother ’ s grave , marked by a stone , was the small grave of his younger brother , who ’ d died at the age of six months , and whom he also hadn ’ t known and couldn ’ t remember ; but he ’ d been told that he ’ d had a younger brother , and every time he visited the cemetery , he crossed himself devoutly and respectfully over the grave , bowing and kissing it .
and this is what he dreamt : he ’ s walking along the road with his father toward the cemetery and going past the tavern ; he ’ s holding his father ’ s hand and glancing over at it fearfully . this time something in particular draws his attention : it seems to be some special occasion with a motley crowd of townsfolk , peasant women and their husbands , and all sorts of riffraff . they ’ re all drunk and singing songs ; next to the tavern porch stands a strange kind of cart .
it ’ s one of those large ones to which they harness big draft horses to pull wares and barrels of wine . he ’ s always liked looking at these enormous horses , with their long manes , their heavy legs clomping along calmly at a steady pace , pulling mountainous loads , never straining , as if it were even easier for them to pull a load than an empty cart .
but now , strange as it seems , a peasant ’ s small , scrawny , light brown nag is harnessed to such a large cart , one of those horses—he ’ s seen it often—that sometimes strain to pull some huge load of firewood or hay , especially if the cart has gotten stuck in the mud or a rut . the peasants always whip the horse so terribly , so very painfully , sometimes even across its muzzle and eyes , and he would always feel so sorry , so very sorry to witness it that he would feel like crying , and his mother would always lead him away from the window .
now things are getting extremely boisterous : some very large and extremely drunken peasants in red and blue shirts , their heavy coats slung over their shoulders , come out of the tavern shouting , singing , and playing balalaikas .
git in , everyone git in ! shouts one peasant , a young lad with a thick neck and a fleshy face , red as a beet , i ’ ll take ya all .
but there is a burst of laughter and shouting :
hey , mikolka , you must be outta yer head to hitch that ol ’ mare to yer cart !
git in , i ’ ll take ya all ! mikolka shouts again , jumping in first , taking hold of the reins , and standing up straight in the front of the cart . matvei went off with the bay , he cries from the cart , and as for this ol ’ mare here , lads , she ’ s only breakin ’ my heart : i don ’ t give a damn if it kills ’ er ; she ain ’ t worth her salt .
git in , i tell ya !
i ’ ll make ’ er gallop !
she ’ ll gallop , all right !
and he takes the whip in his hand , getting ready to thrash the horse with delight .
i bet she ain ’ t galloped in ten years .
don ’ t pity ’ er , lads ; everyone , bring yer whips , git ready !
they all clamber into mikolka ’ s cart with guffaws and wisecracks .
there are six lads and room for more .
they take along a peasant woman , fat and ruddy .
she ’ s wearing red calico , a headdress trimmed with beads , and fur slippers ; she ’ s cracking nuts and cackling .
the crowd ’ s also laughing ; as a matter of fact , how could one keep from laughing at the idea of a broken-down old mare about to gallop , trying to pull such a heavy load ! two lads in the cart grab their whips to help mikolka .
the mare strains with all her might , but not only can ’ t she gallop , she can barely take a step forward ; she merely scrapes her hooves , grunts , and cowers from the blows of the three whips raining down on her like hail .
laughter redoubles in the cart and among the crowd , but mikolka grows angry and in his rage strikes the little mare with more blows , as if he really thinks she ’ ll be able to gallop .
take me along , too , lads ! shouts someone from the crowd who ’ s gotten a taste of the fun .
she ’ ll take everyone .
papa , what are they doing ?
papa , they ’ re beating the poor horse !
let ’ s go , let ’ s go !
they ’ re drunk , misbehaving , those fools : let ’ s go .
he tries to lead his son away , but the boy breaks from his father ’ s arms ; beside himself , he runs toward the horse .
gasping for breath , she stops , and then tries to pull again , about to drop . beat ’ er to death ! that ’ s what it ’ s come to .
aren ’ t you a christian , you devil ?
shouts one old man from the crowd .
just imagine , asking an ol ’ horse like that to pull such a heavy load , adds another .
you ’ ll do ’ er in !
she ’ s mine ! † i can do what i want with ’ er !
git in , all of ya !
i ’ m gon na make ’ er gallop !
suddenly a roar of laughter rings forth and drowns out everything : the little mare couldn ’ t bear the hail of blows and had begun kicking feebly .
even the old man can ’ t resist , and he starts laughing .
two lads from the crowd grab whips and run up to the little horse to start beating her flanks .
one stands on each side .
let ’ s have a song , lads ! someone cries from the cart , and everyone joins in . a riotous song bursts forth , tambourines jingle , and whistles sound in the chorus .
the peasant woman ’ s still cracking nuts and laughing .
the boy runs along the horse ’ s side , rushes ahead , and sees how they ’ re beating her across the eyes , right across her eyes !
one of the men holding a whip lashes the boy across the face ; he doesn ’ t feel it ; he ’ s wringing his hands , shouting , and then hurls himself at the gray-haired old man with the gray beard , the one who ’ d been shaking his head before and condemning it all .
one peasant woman takes him by the hand and tries to lead him away ; but he breaks free from her and runs up to the horse again .
the mare ’ s almost at her last gasp but begins kicking again .
he throws his whip away , bends down , and pulls a long , thick wooden shaft from the bottom of his cart ; he grabs hold of one end with both hands and raises it ominously above the mare .
he ’ ll crush ’ er !
he ’ ll kill ’ er !
there is the sound of a heavy thud .
thrash ’ er , go on !
why ’ d ya stop ?
cry several in the crowd .
shout several voices in the crowd .
still , she didn ’ t gallop !
yells mikolka , the crowbar still in his hands , his eyes bloodshot .
he stands there as if feeling sorry that there ’ s nothing more to strike .
with a shout he pushes his way through the crowd and runs to the mare , embraces her bloody , lifeless muzzle , and kisses her , kisses her eyes , her lips . then he suddenly springs up and in a rage hurls himself at mikolka to pummel him with his little fists .
at that moment his father , who ’ d been chasing him , finally grabs hold of him and leads him away from the crowd .
let ’ s go home !
the poor little horse ?
he sobs , but his breath falters , and his words emerge as screams from his constricted chest .
they ’ re drunk , acting up ; it ’ s none of our business .
the boy puts his arms around him , but his chest feels tight .
he wants to catch his breath , cries out , and wakes up .
raskolnikov awoke in a sweat , his hair drenched from perspiration ; he was panting and raised himself up on his elbows in horror .
he said , sitting up under the tree and taking in a deep breath .
but what ’ s this all about ?
is it a fever beginning ?
such a hideous dream !
he felt as if his whole body had endured a beating ; his soul seemed confused and wretched .
he sat up and rested his elbows on his knees , supporting his head with both hands .
will i really do it , will i really take an axe , hit her over the head with it , crush her skull ? i ’ ll slip in the warm , sticky blood , break the lock , steal , and tremble ; then i ’ ll hide , all covered in blood . oh , lord , will i really do it ?
as he said this , he trembled like a leaf .
but what am i thinking ?
he continued , exclaiming again as if in deep amazement .
i knew that i wouldn ’ t endure it , so why am i still tormenting myself ? why just yesterday , yesterday , when i went to conduct that .
test , even then i understood perfectly well that i wouldn ’ t endure it .
why am i still in doubt ?
only yesterday , going down the stairs , i realized how mean , vile , base , how base it all is . when i lay awake i felt nauseous and horrified by the idea alone .
no , i can ’ t go through it , i can ’ t ! even if there ’ s no doubt whatsoever in all my calculations , even if everything i ’ ve decided this past month is clear as day , as correct as arithmetic . i still can ’ t do it !
i can ’ t endure it , i can ’ t ! why , why have i been tormenting myself ?
he stood up , looked around in astonishment , as if wondering why he had come here , and set off for tuchkov bridge .
he was pale , his eyes burning , all his limbs exhausted , but he suddenly seemed able to breathe more easily .
he felt that he had gotten rid of a terrible burden , one that had been oppressing him for so long a time , and his soul suddenly seemed light and peaceful .
show me the way , and i will renounce this cursed .
crossing the bridge , he calmly and peacefully looked at the neva , at the bright setting of the burning red sun .
in spite of his weakness , he didn ’ t even feel the least tiredness .
it was as if an abscess on his heart that had been coming to a head all month had suddenly burst .
now he was free from all those evil charms , sorcery , witchcraft , and delusions .
afterward , when he recalled this moment and everything that happened to him during these days , minute by minute , point by point , piece by piece , one circumstance always struck him as a superstitious occurrence , even though in essence it wasn ’ t all that unusual , but later it constantly seemed to be a kind of premonition of his fate .
namely : he could never understand or explain to himself why , so tired and worn out , when it would have been most advantageous for him to go home by the shortest , most direct route , instead he headed home across haymarket square , which was completely unnecessary .
the detour was not long , but obvious and totally unneeded .
of course he had returned home dozens of times without recalling the route he took .
but why , he always asked himself , why did such an important , such a decisive meeting and , at the same time , such an extremely accidental meeting on the haymarket ( where he had no reason at all to be ) , why did it take place then , at that hour , at that moment of his life , precisely when he was in that mood , precisely in those circumstances , when only it , that meeting , could have had the most crucial , most decisive impact on his entire fate ? it was as if it had been waiting to ambush him !
it was almost nine o ’ clock when he passed through the haymarket .
all the merchants at their tables , stands , shops , and stalls were locking up their establishments , removing and packing up their wares , and dispersing to their homes , just as their customers were . around the eating houses on the filthy , stinking lower floors of the buildings on haymarket square , and especially in the taverns , were gathered all sorts of craftsmen and ragpickers .
raskolnikov loved these places primarily , just as he did all the nearest lanes , when he would walk the streets aimlessly . here his tattered clothes attracted no unwarranted attention and he could make his way in any apparel without creating a scandal .
at konnyi lane , on the corner , stood a tradesman and his wife , a peasant woman , at two tables with wares they were selling : threads , braids , calico head scarves , and so on .
they were also packing to go home , but lingered as they chatted with a passing acquaintance . this acquaintance was lizaveta ivanovna , or simply lizaveta , as everyone called her , the younger sister of that very same old woman , alyona ivanovna , the widow of a collegiate registrar and moneylender , where raskolnikov had been the day before when he had gone to pawn his watch and conduct his test .
she was a tall , awkward , timid , humble unmarried woman , almost feebleminded , thirty-five years old , living as a complete slave in her sister ’ s house , working for her day and night , trembling in her presence , even enduring beatings from her . she was standing deep in thought with a bundle in front of the tradesman and the peasant woman , listening to them attentively .
they were explaining something to her with particular passion .
when raskolnikov suddenly caught sight of her , some sort of strange feeling , similar to deepest astonishment , seized him , even though there was nothing astonishing about the meeting .
you really should decide on your own , lizaveta ivanovna , the tradesman was saying loudly .
come back tomorrow , around seven o ’ clock .
they ’ ll be here , too .
lizaveta replied slowly and pensively , as if unable to make up her mind .
i look at you and see that you ’ re just like a little child .
she ’ s not even your real sister , but your half sister , and she ’ s got you under her thumb .
this time don ’ t say anything to alyona ivanovna , her husband interrupted her . that ’ s my advice . come see us without asking her .
then your sister will figure it out , too . seven o ’ clock tomorrow ; they ’ ll be here , too , and you ’ ll decide on your own .
we ’ ll put up the samovar , the wife added .
all right , i ’ ll come , said lizaveta ivanovna , still pondering , and slowly started on her way . raskolnikov passed by just then and didn ’ t overhear any more .
he walked by quietly , unnoticed , trying not to miss a single word .
he had found out , he had suddenly , abruptly , and completely unexpectedly found out that tomorrow , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , lizaveta , the old woman ’ s sister and the only person who lived with her , would be away from home , and , as a result , the old woman , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , would be at home alone . there were only a few paces left to his apartment .
he entered like a person condemned to death .
he wasn ’ t thinking about anything , nor could he even think ; he suddenly felt with his entire being that he no longer possessed any freedom of thought or willpower , and that everything had been decided once and for all .
of course , even if he ’ d had to wait years for a convenient opportunity , even then , having a plan , it would most likely have been impossible to reckon on a more apparent step toward fulfilling his plan than that which had suddenly been presented now .
in any case , it would be difficult to discover the day before and for certain , with greater precision and the least amount of risk , without any dangerous inquiries or investigations , that tomorrow , at such and such a time , such and such an old woman , on whose life an attempt would be made , would be at home alone , absolutely alone .
afterward raskolnikov happened to learn somehow precisely why the tradesman and his wife had invited lizaveta to visit .
the matter was most ordinary and didn ’ t involve anything unusual at all .
an impoverished family that had recently arrived was selling some items , dresses and so on , all women ’ s goods .
since it was unprofitable to sell them at the market , they were looking for a trader , and lizaveta engaged in that kind of commerce .
she took a commission , went about on business , and had a large clientele because she was so honest and always set the best price : whatever price she stated , she stuck to it .
in general she said very little and , as already indicated , she was very humble and timid . but lately raskolnikov had become superstitious .
he retained traces of it for a long time afterward , almost indelibly . and in this entire affair he was always inclined subsequently to see some strangeness , as it were , some mystery , as though particular influences or coincidences were in evidence .
last winter , pokorev , a student he knew , had been about to leave for kharkov and mentioned , in passing , the address of an old woman , alyona ivanovna , in case he needed to pawn something . he didn ’ t look her up for a long time because he was giving lessons and managing somehow . about a month and a half ago , he remembered her address ; he had two items suitable for pawning : his father ’ s old silver watch and a small gold ring with three little red stones , given to him by his sister as a gift , a keepsake , at their parting .
he decided to take the ring ; after locating the old woman , right from the first glance , without knowing anything in particular about her , he conceived an insurmountable loathing for her ; he received two small notes from her and on his way home dropped by a shabby little tavern .
he ordered tea , sat down , and lapsed into deep thought .
a strange idea had emerged in his head , like a baby chick pecking its way out of its egg , and it interested him greatly . at another table close to his sat a young officer and a student with whom he was not acquainted and whom he was unable to recall later .
they had been playing billiards and were now drinking tea .
all of a sudden he heard the student say something to the officer about the moneylender , alyona ivanovna , the widow of the collegiate registrar , and he mentioned her address to him . that alone seemed somehow strange to raskolnikov : he ’ d just come from there , and here they were talking about her .
of course it was a coincidence , but he couldn ’ t shake off the extremely extraordinary impression , and now it seemed that someone was trying to nudge him in that direction : the student suddenly began telling his comrade various details about this alyona ivanovna .
she ’ s well known , he said .
you can always get some money from her .
she as rich as a yid , can lend you five thousand just like that , but she doesn ’ t balk at taking a pledge worth a single ruble , either .
many of our students have been to see her .
but she ’ s an awful bitch . he started describing how nasty she was , how willful , and said that if you were even one day late in redeeming your pledge , the item would be gone . she gives you four times less than the pledge is worth , he said , deducts five or even seven percent interest a month , so on and so forth .
the student got carried away blabbing and , in addition , said that the old woman has a sister , lizaveta , whom she beats constantly and keeps totally enslaved , like a little child , even though she herself is small and vile , while lizaveta ’ s at least six feet tall .
they began talking about lizaveta .
the student did so with some particular enjoyment and kept laughing , while the officer listened with great interest and asked the student to send this lizaveta around to him to mend some linen .
raskolnikov didn ’ t utter a word during this conversation , yet he learned everything all at once : lizaveta was the old woman ’ s younger half sister ( they had different mothers ) and was already thirty-five years old .
she worked for her sister day and night and served at home in place of a cook and a laundress ; she also sewed to order , washed other people ’ s floors , and turned all the money over to her sister . she dared not accept any orders or work without the older woman ’ s permission .
the old woman had already drawn up her will , which lizaveta herself knew , as well as the fact that she wouldn ’ t receive even half a kopeck , except for personal property , chairs , and so forth . all the money was to be left to a monastery in the novgorod province , for the eternal remembrance of her soul . lizaveta was a woman of the lower middle class , not like her sister , who had married an official ; she was terribly unattractive , extremely tall , with long , large , apparently turned-out feet , always wore worn-out goatskin shoes , and kept herself neat and clean .
the main thing , however , that astonished and amused the student was that lizaveta was continually pregnant . but didn ’ t you say she ’ s a freak ? yes , so dark-skinned , as if she ’ s a disguised soldier , but you know , she ’ s not really a freak .
she has such a kind face and eyes .
the proof is that many men find her attractive . she ’ s quiet , gentle , meek , and agreeable , agreeable to everything .
she even has a very nice smile .
because of her strangeness .
no , but here ’ s what i can tell you .
i could kill and rob that cursed old woman , and can assure you , feel no pangs of conscience , the student added passionately . the officer burst out laughing once again , but raskolnikov shuddered .
allow me to pose a serious question to you , the student said , growing excited .
i was joking just now , of course , but look : on the one hand , here ’ s a stupid , mindless , worthless , spiteful , sick old hag , needed by no one—on the contrary , causing harm to everyone ; she herself doesn ’ t know what she ’ s living for , and she ’ ll die of her own accord tomorrow . well , i do , replied the officer , staring attentively at his impassioned comrade . on the other hand , there are young , fresh forces , going to waste for lack of support , by the thousands , all over the place .
a hundred , even a thousand good deeds and undertakings could be planned and performed with the old woman ’ s money that ’ s being left in her will to a monastery !
hundreds , maybe thousands of beings could be set on the right path ; dozens of families could be rescued from poverty , kept from dissolution , from ruin , debauchery , and venereal hospitals—all this with her wealth . murder her and take her money and then use it to dedicate yourself to the service of all humanity and to the common good : what do you think , wouldn ’ t thousands of good deeds make up for one little , tiny crime ?
thousands of lives saved from wrack and ruin—for one life ?
one death and a hundred lives in exchange—it ’ s a matter of arithmetic !
what ’ s the life of that consumptive , stupid , spiteful old woman worth on the common scale ?
no more than that of a louse , a cockroach—not even that much , because the old woman ’ s harmful .
she consumes other people ’ s lives : just the other day she bit lizaveta ’ s finger out of spite ; they almost had to amputate !
of course she doesn ’ t deserve to live , observed the officer , but that ’ s nature .
hey , friend , nature can be rectified and directed ; without that , one would drown in prejudices .
without that , there wouldn ’ t be even one great man .
they say , duty , conscience . i don ’ t want to speak against duty and conscience—but how are we to understand them ? wait , i ’ ll pose one more question to you .
no , you wait ; i ’ ll pose a question to you .
now you ’ re ranting and raving , but tell me this : would you yourself kill the old woman or not ?
this has nothing to do with me . in my opinion , if you won ’ t dare to do it yourself , it ’ s not a matter of justice !
of course , all this was the most ordinary , most common run of ideas and conversation of young people , the sort he had heard many times before in other forms and with other themes .
but why precisely now did he happen to overhear just such a conversation and such ideas when in his own mind . exactly the same ideas had recently arisen ? and why precisely at this moment , just as he was carrying the germ of this idea away from the old woman ’ s apartment , had he just happened upon this conversation about her ?
this coincidence always seemed strange to him .
this insignificant conversation in the tavern had an extraordinary impact on him during the further development of this affair : it was as if it really was a premonition , a sign .
after returning from the haymarket , he threw himself down on his sofa and sat there motionless for a whole hour .
meanwhile , it grew dark ; he didn ’ t have any candles , and it never even occurred to him to light one .
he couldn ’ t recall a thing : was he really thinking about anything at that time ?
finally he felt the return of his recent fever and chills , and surmised with pleasure that he could also lie down on the sofa .
soon a heavy , leaden sleep settled upon him , as if oppressing him . he slept for an unusually long time and had no dreams . nastasya , who came in at ten o ’ clock the next morning , roused him with difficulty .
she brought him some tea and bread .
the tea was weak once again and supplied in her own teapot .
look at him , he ’ s asleep !
he ’ s constantly sleeping !
he raised himself up with effort .
his head ached ; he tried to stand up , turned around in his little room , and fell back down on the sofa .
going back to sleep !
are you ill , or what ?
he made no reply .
later , he said with effort , closing his eyes once more and turning toward the wall .
nastasya stood over him for a while .
maybe he really is ill , she said , turned away , and left .
she came in again at two o ’ clock with some soup .
he was lying there just as before .
the tea was untouched .
nastasya was offended and began shaking him angrily .
she cried , regarding him with disgust .
he raised himself and sat up , but said nothing to her and looked at the floor .
are you sick or what ?
nastasya asked and once again received no reply .
at least you ought to go outside , she said after a brief pause , and get some fresh air .
are you going to eat something ?
later , he said weakly .
she stood there a little while longer , regarded him with compassion , and left the room .
a few minutes later , he raised his head and stared at the tea and soup for a long time .
then he picked up the bread , picked up a spoon , and started to eat .
he ate a little , without much appetite , three or four spoonfuls , as if automatically .
his head ached less .
after this , he stretched out again on the sofa , but couldn ’ t fall asleep ; he lay there without moving , facedown , buried in his pillow .
he kept having daydreams , and they were very strange , indeed : most often he imagined that he was somewhere in africa , in egypt , on some sort of oasis .
a caravan was taking a rest ; camels were lying down peacefully ; all around , palm trees grew in a complete circle ; everyone was having dinner .
he kept drinking water , right from the stream that was there beside him , flowing and murmuring .
it was cool there and the water was so marvelously blue and cold , running over multicolored stones and over such pure , golden , glistening sand . suddenly he heard a clock clearly chiming . he shuddered , came to , raised his head , looked out the window , guessed the time , and jumped up , having come to his senses completely , as if someone had torn him away from the sofa .
he approached the door on tiptoe , opened it very quietly , and listened for any noise on the staircase below .
his heart was pounding dreadfully .
but all was quiet on the staircase , as if everyone was asleep . it seemed reckless and bizarre that he could have been sleeping in such oblivion since yesterday , and that he hadn ’ t yet done anything , made any preparations . meanwhile , perhaps the clock was chiming six o ’ clock .
an unusual , feverish , bewildering burst of activity suddenly overtook him , replacing his sleep and stupor .
however , there wasn ’ t much preparation to be done .
he made every effort to remember everything and forget nothing ; his heart was still pounding , thumping so hard that it became hard for him to breathe .
first , he had to make a loop and sew it into his coat—that would take only a minute or so .
he groped under his pillow and found among the linen stuffed there an old , ragged , unwashed shirt .
he tore off a strip from its tatters , about two inches wide and about fourteen inches long .
he folded the strip in two , took off his loose , sturdy summer coat made out of a thick cotton material ( it was his only outside coat ) , and began sewing both ends of the strip together under the left sleeve .
his hands shook as he sewed , but he overcame that , so that nothing would be visible from the outside when he put his coat on again .
he had long ago prepared a needle and thread , and they had lain wrapped in paper in the little table .
as for the loop , that was his own very clever idea : it was designed to hold the axe .
after all , he couldn ’ t walk along the street carrying an axe in his hands . and if he were to hide it under his coat , he ’ d still have to hold it with his hand , but that would be noticeable .
now , with a loop , he merely had to insert the head of the axe and it could hang there comfortably , inside under his armpit , for the whole way there . if he put his hand into his side pocket , he could grasp the handle to make sure it didn ’ t swing ; and since the coat was very loose , a genuine sack , the fact that he was keeping hold of it with the hand in his pocket wouldn ’ t be noticed from outside .
he had conceived of this loop two weeks ago .
after finishing his sewing , he thrust his fingers into a small opening between his turkish sofa and the floor , groped around inside the left corner , and pulled out the pledge he ’ d prepared long ago and hidden there .
this pledge , however , wasn ’ t really a pledge at all , but simply a smoothly fashioned wooden block , no larger than a silver cigarette case in size and thickness . he ’ d come upon this block by chance on one of his walks , in a certain courtyard where a workshop was located in one wing of the building .
then he ’ d added a smooth thin metal strip to the block , most likely broken off from something , which he ’ d also found on the street at the same time . after putting the two pieces together , the metal smaller than the wooden one , he ’ d tied them together with string , fastened tightly crosswise ; then he ’ d wrapped them neatly and smartly in clean white paper and tied them with a thin ribbon , also crosswise , and made the knot so that it would be difficult to untie .
this was done in order to divert the old woman ’ s attention for a while , since she would begin to struggle with the knot and thus he could seize the moment .
the iron plate had been added to give the pledge weight , so that at first the old woman wouldn ’ t guess that the object was made of wood .
all of this had been kept hidden under the sofa in his room until the right moment .
suddenly , just as he ’ d picked up the pledge , he heard a voice coming from somewhere in the courtyard below shouting :
it ’ s way past six !
he rushed to the door , listened cautiously , grabbed his hat , and started down the thirteen steps , carefully , inaudibly , like a cat . the most important matter lay ahead—stealing an axe from the kitchen . he had long ago decided that he had to use an axe to do the deed .
he also had a folding garden knife , but he couldn ’ t rely on a knife or , particularly , on his own strength ; therefore , he had settled definitively on an axe .
let us note , by the way , one peculiarity regarding all his definitive decisions already reached in this affair . they shared one strange trait : the more definitive they were , the more outrageous , the more absurd they immediately became in his own eyes .
in spite of all his tormenting inner conflict , he never , even for one moment , could believe in the feasibility of his plans during all this time .
and even if it sometimes happened that everything was understood and definitively resolved and that no further doubts remained—in that case , it seems , he would have renounced all of it as an absurdity , a monstrosity , and an impossibility . an enormous number of unresolved points and doubts still remained . as for where he could acquire an axe , that detail didn ’ t faze him in the least , since there was nothing easier .
especially in the evenings , nastasya was frequently away from the house : either she ran off to the neighbors or to a shop , and the door was always left wide open .
the landlady quarreled with her only about this oversight .
and so , when the time came , all one had to do was enter the kitchen on the sly and grab the axe , then later , an hour later ( when everything was finished ) , go in and put it back .
but doubts still remained : let ’ s suppose he returned an hour later to put it back , but nastasya was also there .
of course , he ’ d have to pass by and wait until she left again .
what if during that time the axe was needed , she began looking for it , and started yelling—that would arouse suspicion or , at least , grounds for suspicion .
but all of these were just trifles he hadn ’ t even begun to worry about , and there was no time to do so .
he thought about the main point and put off the details until such time as he himself would be sure of everything .
but that seemed decidedly unrealizable .
at least , that was how he saw it .
he couldn ’ t , for example , imagine that at some time he would stop thinking , get up , and—simply go there . even his recent test ( that is , his visit with the intention of definitively scoping out the place ) had been no more than an attempt at a test , far from the real thing , merely : let me go , he says , and attempt it ; why just dream about it ? and right away he couldn ’ t stand it , spat in disgust , and ran away , furious with himself .
meanwhile , it would seem , he had already completed his entire analysis , in the sense of resolving the question morally : his casuistry had been sharpened like a razor , and he himself could no longer find any conscious objections . in the last instance , he simply no longer trusted himself and stubbornly , slavishly , looked for objections everywhere , gropingly , as if someone were forcing him to do it and dragging him there .
from the beginning—or , rather , for a long time before—he ’ d been preoccupied by one question : why are almost all crimes so conspicuous , so easily discovered , and the traces of almost all criminals revealed so obviously ?
little by little he arrived at diverse and curious conclusions ; in his opinion , the main reason was contained not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime , but in the criminal himself : the criminal himself , almost every one of them , at the very moment of the crime , is subject to some failure of willpower and reason , which are replaced , instead , by phenomenal childish thoughtlessness , precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed .
according to his conviction , it turned out that this eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness , develop gradually , and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime ; they continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for some time afterward , depending on the individual ; then they pass away , as does any illness . the question remains : does the illness give birth to the crime itself , or is the crime , somehow by its own nature , always accompanied by something like an illness ? he still felt it was beyond his power to resolve this question .
after arriving at these conclusions , he decided that in his own case , in this affair , there could be no such morbid reversals , that he would retain his reason and his willpower , essentially , all during the implementation of his plan , for the sole reason that what he had planned—was not really a crime . we will omit the long process by which he arrived at this last conclusion ; even without that , we have raced too far ahead . we will merely add that in general the factual , purely material difficulties of this affair played a very secondary role in his mind .
one must simply exercise one ’ s willpower and all one ’ s reason over these difficulties , and they will all be overcome in their time , when one becomes familiar with all the details of this affair in all of its precision . but the affair hadn ’ t begun . he continued to believe least of all in his final decisions , and when the time came , everything turned out differently , somehow unintentionally , almost unexpectedly .
one extremely insignificant circumstance landed him in an impasse , even before he went down the stairs .
having reached the landlady ’ s kitchen , its door wide open as usual , he carefully peeked in to have a look around beforehand : by any chance was the landlady herself in there during nastasya ’ s absence , and if not , was the door to her room firmly closed so that she couldn ’ t look out when he entered to take the axe ?
imagine his astonishment when he suddenly saw that not only was nastasya home this time , and in the kitchen , but that she was busy working : she was taking the laundry out of a basket and pinning it up to dry !
seeing him , she stopped hanging the linens , turned to him , and regarded him all the while he was passing .
he looked away and walked by , as if not noticing anything .
but that spelled the end of the whole affair : he had no axe !
what on earth gave me the idea , he wondered as he approached the entranceway , what gave me the idea that she wouldn ’ t be home precisely at this moment ?
why , why , why did i decide this with such certainty ?
he was crushed , even somehow humiliated .
he paused in the entryway to reflect . to set off along the street , just so , as if to take a stroll , just for appearance ’ s sake , was repulsive ; to go back home was even more repulsive .
what an opportunity has been lost forever !
he muttered , standing aimlessly in the entrance , directly opposite the door to the caretaker ’ s small dark lodgings , also left open .
from the caretaker ’ s room , only two paces away , under a bench on the right , something gleamed before his eyes . he looked around cautiously—no one was there .
he approached the lodge on tiptoes , went down two steps , and in a low voice called the caretaker .
just as i thought , he ’ s not home !
he must be close by , however , in the courtyard , because the door ’ s wide open .
he rushed at the axe ( it was an axe ) and pulled it out from under the bench , where it had been lying between two logs ; right there , before he left , he secured the axe in the loop , thrust both hands into his pockets , and left the lodge ; no one noticed him !
if not by reason , then with the devil ’ s help , he thought , chuckling strangely .
this chance occurrence bolstered him enormously .
he walked along the street quietly and steadily , without hurrying , so as not to arouse any suspicions .
he didn ’ t look at any passersby , even trying not to glance into their faces at all , and to be as unnoticeable as possible .
then he suddenly remembered his hat !
i even had some money a few days ago and could have bought myself a cap !
a curse burst forth from his soul .
glancing by chance with one eye into a shop , he noticed that there , on the wall clock , it was already ten minutes past seven .
he needed to hurry and , at the same time , to make a detour : he wanted to approach the building in a roundabout way , from the other side . previously , when he had imagined all this , he ’ d sometimes thought he ’ d feel very afraid .
but now he didn ’ t feel very afraid ; in fact , he didn ’ t even feel afraid in the least .
he was even preoccupied at the time by some extraneous thoughts , but not for very long .
passing the yusupov garden , he was about to consider the idea of placing tall fountains there , thinking how well they would refresh the air in all the squares .
little by little he came to the conviction that if the summer garden could be extended to include the entire field of mars and even connect it with the gardens at the mikhailovsky palace , that it would be a splendid and most useful thing for the city .
then suddenly something caught his interest : why exactly was it that in all large cities people were somehow inclined to live and settle , not out of necessity alone , precisely in those parts of town where there were no gardens , no fountains , and where filth and stench prevailed , as well as all sorts of vileness .
then he recalled his own strolls through the haymarket , and a moment later he came back to his senses . what nonsense , he thought . no , it ’ s better not to think at all !
that ’ s probably the way men being led to their execution slide into thinking about all the things they encounter along their way , flashed through his mind , but it merely flashed , like a bolt of lightning ; he himself extinguished this thought as quickly as possible . now he was getting very close ; here ’ s the house , here ’ s the gate .
suddenly a clock struck once from somewhere .
could it really be half past seven ?
it couldn ’ t be ; the clock must be fast !
to his good fortune , once again he managed to get through the gates successfully .
moreover , as if on purpose , at that very moment just before him a huge load of hay was entering the gate , completely shielding him while he was walking through the gateway ; just as the cart was passing into the courtyard , he managed to slip in to its right .
there , on the other side of the cart , he could hear several voices shouting and arguing . but no one had noticed him , and he didn ’ t happen to run into anyone . many windows looking out onto this huge square courtyard were open at this time , but he didn ’ t raise his head—he didn ’ t have the strength .
the staircase leading to the old woman ’ s apartment was close by , just to the right of the gate .
he was already on the first step .
catching his breath and pressing his hand against his pounding heart , feeling and adjusting the axe again , he began climbing the stairs cautiously and quietly , constantly listening for any sounds .
but this time the staircase was completely empty ; all the doors were closed ; he didn ’ t encounter anyone at all .
however , on the second floor , the door to one empty apartment stood wide open and painters were working inside it , but they didn ’ t even notice him . he stood there a while , thought a bit , and walked on . of course , it would be better if no one were here at all , but .
there are two more floors above them .
but here ’ s the fourth floor , here ’ s the door , and here ’ s the apartment directly opposite ; that one ’ s also empty . on the third floor , by all indications , the apartment right under the old woman ’ s was unoccupied as well : the nameplate , nailed to the door , had been removed—they must have moved away !
he gasped for breath .
for one moment , a thought flashed through his mind : should i leave ?
but he didn ’ t heed it and began listening at the door to the old woman ’ s apartment : dead silence .
then he listened again for sounds on the staircase , listening attentively , for a long time . then he glanced around for the last time , crept up to the door , straightened his clothes , and adjusted the axe in its loop again .
am i much too agitated ?
