but macaulay himself , kukshina started to say
copyright by the hudson review
i ’ m not shouting ; i ’ m speaking very calmly ; it ’ s you who is shouting ; i ’ m a student , and i won ’ t allow you to shout at me
bazarov said , interrupting him
i ’ ve come from katerina ivanovna ; she had no one else to send
like the individualist sexual rebels of early nineteenth-century europe , many women nihilists avoided organized movements , whether feminist or radical
oh , how low i ’ ve fallen !
is he resorting to his previous practice , or what ?
still , he felt timid through and through ; instead of using all the apologies and greetings he would prepared in advance , he mumbled some nonsense to the effect that evdoksiya , that is , kukshina , had sent him to inquire about anna sergeevna 's health and that arkady nikolaevich had always sung the highest praises of at this point he hesitated and became so confused he sat on his hat
had he been more perspicacious , he would have seen that there was no question of a sentimental mood ; rather , something completely opposite was in play
here we are at home , said nikolai petrovich , removing his cap and shaking his head
what a splendid horse i have for you !
but here ’ s the fourth floor , here ’ s the door , and here ’ s the apartment directly opposite ; that one ’ s also empty
and he that was dead came forth— ’
that lesson was useful to me ; i hope that it will be useful to you as well
you are in a melancholy mood today , evgeny
look : he ’ s jumped up and is bowing
water cascaded onto the ground not in drops , but in entire streams
above bazarov stands that fear , that love , those tears he inspires
madam , madam , calm yourself , began the civil servant
though they thirsted after learning , nihilist women often preferred to seek it abroad than to join the slow struggle for higher education in russia itself
let ’ s have a song , lads !
i heard everything , how he tormented you
and he tumbled down the stairs
the possible association between turgenev 's creation of bazarov , his project for primary education and the arevolutionary ' planning of ogaryov makes it likely that the claim in the letter to sluchevsky that if bazarov 'is called a nihilist , then one ought to read : revolutionary ' , is not accidental , nor simply an instance of turgenev pandering to youth
do you know , sir , do you know , that i even pawned her stockings ?
he saw everything , no doubt
but what does this letter mean now ?
seven o ’ clock tomorrow ; they ’ ll be here , too , and you ’ ll decide on your own
he wondered to himself
in my opinion , it is just the opposite
these are special cases , i agree with you ; the example i presented is really a special case , sir !
sonya accepted it , blushed , jumped up , muttered something , and hastily began to take her leave
he was a lieutenant , the police superintendent ’ s assistant , and had a reddish mustache protruding horizontally in both directions and extremely fine facial features , expressing nothing whatsoever , however , except a certain insolence
there , on the corner , stood a large crowd of people , all peasants
‡ aleksandr radishchev ( – ) was a leading liberal writer who opposed serfdom and the russian judicial system
just think about the predicament we ’ re in now !
one fellow was thrown out of a pastry shop a few days ago
i asked whether you believe that ghosts exist
she worked for her sister day and night and served at home in place of a cook and a laundress ; she also sewed to order , washed other people ’ s floors , and turned all the money over to her sister
petr petrovich took out his watch and looked at it
hey , damn it , you devil !
better , evgeny , better ; but who knows , it 's all in god 's hands , while doing your duty
but why are they such fools ?
besides , you ’ re the brother of a person who ’ s interested me a great deal ; lastly , at the time i heard a considerable amount about you from that person , from which i concluded that you have great influence on her
i am here , bazarov 's voice rang out from arkady 's room
by the way , i just remembered
i do not even know what your quarrels were about , but i saw how you twisted him around your little finger
they grieve over people , they weep , but they do not reproach them , they don ’ t !
why are you laughing again ?
but why precisely now did he happen to overhear just such a conversation and such ideas when in his own mind
a law , a law , let 's make a law ,
it really is possible
you reject everything , or , to put it more precisely , you destroy everything but one must also build
sonya had been waiting for him all day in horrible agitation
bazarov observed , moving away from the window
it ’ s very , very original , but
my acquaintance tolstyakov , whenever he enters some public place where others are standing around wearing their hats and caps , feels compelled to doff his hat
the princess appeared looking very sleepy , which lent her wrinkled , old face an even more spiteful expression
i ’ m lying and i ’ m not worthy of you
nikolai petrovich took a step back and flung his arms open wide
for a moment there was no reply , but it was clear that several people were standing behind the door and seemed to be pushing someone
so elegant and so stupid !
and he came in and went right to the cabinet where i keep my pipes
may you live a long , long time ; you ’ ll be needed by others
your father certainly has good taste
besides , i am sure you could not have made a bad choice ; if you have invited her to live here with you under one roof , she must deserve it
in doing so , he may have spoiled the portrait for some readers ; he most certainly appears to have violated the novel 's internal chronology ; but , chiefly , he underlined that the idealism of his own generation of westernists involved an ultimate commitment to revolutionary change and that to deny the revolutionary ideal was a betrayal
they ’ re on your hands , you know
mostly they were street urchins , boys and girls
but he himself has admitted that he lied at first ?
but while i remained on guard below , he got dressed and slipped out
she suddenly wailed in a harrowing cry , overflowing with tears , protect these orphans !
after finishing his sewing , he thrust his fingers into a small opening between his turkish sofa and the floor , groped around inside the left corner , and pulled out the pledge he ’ d prepared long ago and hidden there
you ’ ve gotten me drunk even without drinking
they indulgently regard even the excessive use of such substances , although they acknowledge that such excesses are harmful to the health
what do you think ?
only on his deathbed does bazarov concede having been psychologically and morally misguided ; his rigid subscription to his ideas and his fixation on their future realization have deprived him of the satisfactions he might have found in the present
his face was distorted by a smile
he ’ s come to , echoed the stranger
just as i thought !
just look at your hand !
but she needs them herself now , doesn ’ t she ?
why was he trying to divert razumikhin ’ s eyes to mikolka ?
you should have seen his lancets , said bazarov and left the room
no , so help me god , i ’ m not !
do you like him , dunya ?
i hope you are not just coming from the governor 's ?
while i think : here i lie under a haystack the tiny space i occupy is so small compared to the rest of space , where i am not and where things have nothing to do with me ; and the amount of time in which i get to live my life is so insignificant compared to eternity , where i have never been and wo not ever be yet in this atom , this mathematical point blood circulates , a brain functions and desires something as well
to m e saltykov
the social-political interpretation of fathers and sons has been widespread
it was him , him !
he gathered everything up in his hands and stood in the middle of the room
do you love your sister sonya ?
the tradesman must be hiding in some corner
in the end odintsova remarries , but she does so without abandoning her icy composure
and i felt such a hatred for your every last muzhik
not in the least , replied arkady
the candle stub had long since burned down in the twisted candleholder , dimly illuminating in this impoverished room the murderer and the prostitute , strangely united for the reading of the eternal book
it 's hard to say
bazarov shook his head
if they ask , perhaps i ’ ll even tell them , he thought as he approached the police station
then i found out , sonya , that if i waited for everyone to become smart , it would take much too long
the nigilistka 's rejection of all this fit in with her desire to be functional and useful , and with her repugnance for the day-to-day existence of the superfluous woman
the lender is free to sell your property and to pursue all legal steps against you
i ’ m saying this so you know
asked avdotya romanovna , growing frightened
what i did hear was really rather strange
and besides , your sister can ’ t stand me
she repeated , withdrawing slightly from him
and in ottsy i deti the portraits of the kirsanovs , their babies , their joyous participation in the natural cycle , all lead us to infer that all is right with the world
my wife and i—we both respect literature , and my wife is passionate about it !
my twenty-five years ' service of the muses ended in the gradual disenchantment of the reading public and i do not foresee any reason why it should reverse its view
sainthood and revolutionary dedication first emerged as prominent ideals in turgenev 's work with this novel
he was very clever , although sometimes really naïve
everywhere and in everything i go to the limit
on the contrary , there won ’ t be any horns in a common-law marriage !
svidrigaylov said with a smile , standing and picking up his hat
truly great individuals , it seems to me , must experience great sorrow in this world , he added , suddenly becoming contemplative , and no longer in a conversational mode
i don ’ t need your sentence reduction at all !
alarm , cries of fear , moans
sonya sat down , looked around—at lebezyatnikov , at the money lying on the table , at petr petrovich again , and then didn ’ t take her eyes off him , as if her gaze were riveted to him
katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears ; she also prayed , at times adjusting the child ’ s small shirt , and managing to cover the little girl ’ s bare shoulders with a scarf that she took from the wardrobe without having to get up from her knees or interrupt her prayers
he has spoken of moldering or decaying , but now he writes of the place where i shall rest
who approaches everything from a critical point of view , observed arkady
now that arbor 's done well , he added , because it 's all acacia and lilac—they are good boys and do not need much care
although cultural anthropologists might not agree , the concept of ethnicity need not be confined to national , regional , or linguistic groups but ought to be applied to any category of human beings that constitutes a more or less clearly defined cultural community visibly distinguishable from the surrounding society
so you ’ re here only counting on engaging in debauchery ?
why are you saying this ?
you call a friendly conversation 'prattle ' ?
she even has a very nice smile
you ’ ve distorted my idea !
a woman ’ s voice asked in alarm
you think we ’ ll become closer ?
the rain had stopped , but the wind was still blowing
in many instances he was even too indulgent of her character , all seven years
in the society of his day , as turgenev fills it in with a few quick strokes , bazarov is as superfluous as rudin
they accepted my offer with enthusiasm and considered it an honor ; since then we ’ ve been acquainted
why not mention it ?
you must respond and acknowledge your obligation , while the fact that you happened to be in love and all those tragic particulars , all that is none of our business
you know , living in the country with marfa petrovna , i was tormented to death by memories of all these mysterious nooks and crannies where one can find so many things
therefore it was essential to him that you be here !
it was impossible to make out any other words ; the footsteps died away and everything became quiet
yes , sir , we had a case that was almost the same in our legal practice , sir , a psychological case , a morbid one , sir , porfiry rattled on , speaking very quickly
he cried , banging his fist on the table again
where , if i may ask ?
what methods do i need now ?
what an insensitive , spiteful egoist !
cried dunya , jumping up from her seat
in a review of my monograph on turgenev 's ottsy i deti , edward j brown remarked rather cryptically that on the pages of his greatest novel turgenev had
both imagination and vision carry us beyond the permitted ; odintseva 's thoughts are a hidden defiance of the decorous house in which she lives , an erotic transgression she has no will to sustain
you see , lately , since you fell ill , i ’ ve frequently had the occasion to talk about you a great deal
it ’ s all because i ’ m very ill , he decided gloomily once and for all
she had a reputation as a frivolous coquette and devoted herself eagerly to all sorts of pleasures , dancing until she collapsed , laughing and joking with young people whom she received before dinner in a dimly lit drawing room ; but at night she wept and prayed , finding no solace anywhere , often pacing her room until early morning , wringing her hands in anguish or sitting , cold and pale , over her psalter
her plump arms were instantly entwined around his neck , her head pressed to his chest , and there was complete silence
he approached the door on tiptoe , opened it very quietly , and listened for any noise on the staircase below
at first anna sergeevna was afraid that the sight of their happiness might be too difficult for her to bear ; but it turned out to be the complete opposite : it not only failed to oppress her , but even interested her , mellowed her at long last
on their return they usually got into an argument ; arkady was usually demolished , even though he spoke far more than his comrade
i say this for the benefit of those readers who attribute great significance to refined manners , who look with aversion on bazarov , as on a man who is mal élevé and mauvais ton
where can one discern the impulse which makes his greatest work acquire a degree of transcendence beyond impartiality , conscientious objectivity and the rigorous topicality which is inseparable from realism ?
let ’ s have a talk ; it ’ s a pity that i have so many affairs to attend to , other people ’ s and my own
this special form of address had an impact on bazarov he turned his head a little ; obviously trying to free himself from the burden of oppressive oblivion , he uttered , what is it , father ?
arkady 's voice was shaky at first : he perceived himself as magnanimous , but at the same time realized he was delivering something of a lecture to his father
cried the other caretaker , an enormous peasant dressed in a heavy tunic and carrying keys on his belt
and perhaps even forgives
surely you wouldn ’ t dare to decide that ?
you should know that he has friends
he cried with such bitter irritation , with such a despairing look , that razumikhin gave up
turgenev 's first two women are depicted only posthumously : they were beloved by the two kirsanov brothers , nikolai and pavel
just in case , he thought again and rang the old woman ’ s bell
they ’ re very nice people , and the children often come to see me
i will tell him the history of your illness since sidor sidorych has gone [ that was the name of the local doctor ] , and we will have a short consultation
the more harmless sources of pleasure there are , the easier it is to live in the world , and the whole task of our generation is precisely to decrease the sum of suffering and increase the strength and amount of pleasure
there they are , they ’ re bringing them ; the older one caught them
it ’ s written in legalese , and it can ’ t be written in any other way ; it came out more crudely than he might have wanted
raskolnikov thrust his summons at the head clerk
we know that dostoevsky admired fathers and sons , at least that he wrote to turgenev about it in terms of appreciation which turgenev said made me throw up my hands in amazement—and pleasure
what do you mean , sir ?
of course , you ’ re right that none of it ’ s new and it all resembles everything we ’ ve read and heard a thousand times before
one could say yes , he did , almost for certain
these days it ’ s hard to tell who ’ s gentry and who ’ s not
it ’ s a terribly filthy place : dirt , stench , full of suspicious types
someone shouted at him when he came out to the canal
all she needs is a train out behind her and a crown on top of her head
yes , yes , i know you , bazarov , she repeated
do you think i ’ ll give my dunya away to a man such as you ?
my father 's pure gold
victor , open the bottle ; that 's in your line of work
really , you look much better
nihilism is supposed to relieve all our ills , and you , you are our saviors and heroes
coughs choked her , but her threat seemed to work
how will you protect them from those svidrigaylovs or from afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , you future millionaire , you , you zeus , disposing of their fates ?
he finished it along the way
you think he ’ s clever ?
perhaps he had hastened to reach that conclusion , but he didn ’ t think about that
at the basis of the main character , bazarov , there lay the figure of a young provincial doctor that had struck me
have you come to see us ?
of course , i blamed it all on my fate , pretended to hunger and thirst for light , and finally set in motion the greatest and most certain means of conquering a woman ’ s heart , a means that never deceives anyone and that acts decisively on every woman , without exception
yes , yes , yes i have been asking myself where i would heard the name bazarov before
raskolnikov felt and realized at that moment , once and for all , that sonya was with him now and forever ; she would go with him to the ends of the earth , wherever fate might send him
cinq sous , cinq sous ,
why isn ’ t this the place ?
turgenev—after pushkin—is almost the sole genius of measure and , therefore , a genius of culture
and when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth
no , i haven ’ t , replied raskolnikov
but how will you live ?
a remarkable play of tones characterize these passages
it wasn ’ t like that then , he thought
please don ’ t trouble yourself !
he was fine just a little while ago
what was it , for example , that led them astray from the very start ?
everything about her was still green and fresh : her voice , the light down on her face , her pink hands with white circles on her palms , and mikhail mikhailovich speransky ( - ) , a leading statesman and liberal reformer under alexander i he was the son of a village priest and one of the first to rise to a position of great power from such humble origins
the pestilence grew and advanced further and further
but never , never did these people consider themselves so intelligent and so infallible about the truth as when they were infected
he ’ s a civil servant , a retired titular counselor , marmeladov !
that she had every confidence in me and so on
the walls looked as if they had been roughly assembled from boards and were covered with worn-out wallpaper , so dusty and torn that although one could still guess its color ( yellow ) , it was no longer possible to make out the pattern
the gentleman asked sternly , frowning in haughty astonishment
i love nikolai petrovich with all my heart
you could make anything you like of her ; while the other one 's an old warhorse
how disgustingly i fawned and flattered that despicable ilya petrovich !
however , that lasted for only a moment
realism as a method of the artistic depiction of reality in the history of russian nineteenth-century literature not only develops but stratifies
well , should i come in or go away ?
if someone didn ’ t know about it beforehand—he wouldn ’ t notice a thing
but am i really so removed from everyone ?
a little more , and he might have given himself away completely , in actual fact
of course , you are joking
cried a witness ’ s voice from the crowd
should we take him to the police station ?
have you been to the police station ?
concerning the actual conditions of our duel , since there wo not be any seconds—
i ’ ll have zosimov spend the night at the landlady ’ s , so he ’ ll be right here if needed
if only he ’ s at home , he added
he even spoke a few words of decent french with a foreigner who was waiting there
without even stopping to consider what all this might mean , in a burst of nonsensical joy , he ran out onto the steps a footman in livery opened the carriage door ; a lady wearing a black veil and black mantilla was emerging
i wanted to tell you , find out your opinion , and ask for your hand , because i am not a wealthy man and feel i am ready to make any sacrifice you are not answering ?
how can you even ask about that ?
he is willing to receive extreme unction , though at the sight of the priest in his robes , of the smoking censer and the candles before the icon something like a shudder of horror passed for a moment over the death-stricken face
but this kind creature does not reject me , he thought , and his heart once again experienced the sweetness of magnanimous emotion
raskolnikov sat down ; his trembling was ending , and his entire body felt hot
they are completely convinced that all an author does is to convey his ideas ; they do not wish to believe that to reproduce the truth , the reality of life accurately and powerfully , is the literary man 's highest joy , even if that truth does not correspond to his own sympathies
there is , she says , a mother , a very reasonable lady , this mama
i have no memory , none at all , or i ’ d remember !
how could he have left all those things in that hole under the wallpaper ?
how can i afford to bury him ?
thought—whatever it may be , it is thinking nevertheless and not the digestive process
for that matter it 's easy to alleviate the situation if , while maintaining all his contempt for sitnikov , he at some time mentions to arkady that one must preserve the sitnikovs on the basis of the rules promulgated by prince vorontsov , who replied to complaints about the abominations of a certain police inspector , i know that he is a scoundrel but he has one important merit—he is genuinely devoted to me
he finds one and says it , 'crisis , and now he feels relieved
i was merely curious
she would come back , sit down again , pick up her fan , and would not even be breathing more rapidly ; meanwhile arkady would resume his chatter , suffused with happiness by being so near her , talking to her , looking into her eyes , at her beautiful forehead , at her pleasant , imposing , intelligent face
he thought about the main point and put off the details until such time as he himself would be sure of everything
i ’ m in a hurry and have to leave
you , sister , seem to have been offended by the fact that out of the whole letter i ventured such a frivolous remark , and you think that i mention such trivialities intentionally to make difficulties for you because i ’ m annoyed
why does he die ?
it won ’ t take place ?
my impressions at that time though of various sorts were all similarly oppressive
odintseva , as we later discover , will not frequent her garden portico after seeing a grass snake there ( viii , [ p ] ) ; it is in this portico that arkady proposes to katya
at the end of the novel , when the most important surviving characters are gathered together for one last time , katya is in complete control
the novel has neither plot nor denouement , nor a particularly well-considered structure ; it has types and characters , it has episodes and scenes , and bazarov 's teacher is chernyshevsky or dobrolyubov , and the circle is that of the journal the contemporary
she sighed very deeply and died
in general she said very little and , as already indicated , she was very humble and timid
perhaps ; you know best
my sister received an education by chance and is condemned to seek positions as a governess
he ’ d probably just been beaten
in the country , fifteen days pass imperceptibly ; bazarov talks with anna sergeyevna a lot , argues with her , expresses himself fully , and finally begins to feel for her a kind of malicious , tormenting passion
how can we get her home ?
his speech is distinguished by its simplicity , appropriateness , mockery , and completely russian cast
i ’ m curious as to whether mr luzhin has received any official decorations ; i ’ ll bet he has the order of saint anna§ and that he wears it at dinners with contractors and merchants
all the merchants at their tables , stands , shops , and stalls were locking up their establishments , removing and packing up their wares , and dispersing to their homes , just as their customers were
my reason must not have deserted me entirely ; i must still have my ability to reason and my memory , if i remembered and figured that out myself !
you continue to jest , pavel petrovich said , getting up from his chair
well , sir , my good sir—marmeladov suddenly seemed to shudder , raise his head , and stare at his listener—well , sir , the next day , after all these daydreams , that is , exactly five days ago , toward evening , by clever stealth , like a thief in the night , i stole the key from katerina ivanovna ’ s box , took out what was left of the money i ’ d brought home , i don ’ t recall how much it was , and now , look at me , all of you !
to tell you all this , i would have said , if i did not believe a useless lie was stupid
she ’ s an absolutely , utterly unexpected character !
of course , they chased her away ; but she herself says she abused him and threw something at him
odintsova repeated , lowering her voice
he was still a student then
why did you run away ?
praising turgenev for his absolute sanity and the deepest sensibility , for an unerring instinct for the significant , for the essential in the life of men and women , joseph conrad nonetheless wrote to edward garnett that with the year the age of turgenev had come to an end , too
maybe he ’ s not home , said a male voice
a peasant runs away , or a modern sectarian—a lackey of someone else ’ s ideas—because if you just show him the end of your finger , like gogol ’ s midshipman dyrka , ¶ he ’ ll believe in anything you like for the rest of his life
you ’ re insane , really , insane !
once again the rubbish , the same eggshells on the spiral staircase ; once more the apartment doors left wide open , the same kitchens from which smoke and stench emanated
in a word , i ’ m marrying petr petrovich , dunechka continued , because i ’ m choosing the lesser of two evils
dmitry prokofich came to see me just yesterday—i agree , i agree , i have a nasty , caustic character , but the conclusions he drew from it !
as one of kropotkin 's acquaintances observed , they would not stand up when a woman entered the room , but they would often travel halfway across the city to help a girl in her studies
at best , the author was drawn as a
and i found a job here
oh , that ’ s not it , not it , sonya exclaimed in anguish
it is also extremely likely that katerina ivanovna wanted , precisely in this case , precisely at this moment in time , when it seemed as if she ’ d been abandoned by everyone in the whole world , to show all these worthless and nasty lodgers that she not only knew how to live and how to entertain guests , but had been brought up not for such a fate in life but in the noble , one could even say , aristocratic home of a colonel , and that she had never been raised to sweep the floor or to wash the children ’ s rags at night
why are they tormenting me ?
she was already a widow when i married her , with three children , each smaller than the other
bazarov put his hand on his forehead
as for the last point , however , marfa petrovna was fairly calm all along ; she was a clever woman and , therefore , couldn ’ t regard me in any other way than as a depraved and dissolute man , incapable of genuine love
the fact that you ’ re daring , arrogant , serious and
is this really , really all true ?
this timofeich , an experienced and clever old man with faded yellow hair , a weather-beaten reddish face , and tiny teardrops in his squinting eyes , had appeared before bazarov unexpectedly , wearing his shortish coat of thick blue-gray cloth , tied with a leather belt , and tarred boots
i have not lacked confidence in a single one of my things as strongly as in that very one
doctors are mercenary , you know
now you really have to be prim and proper , so that everyone will see that you ’ re respectable children
everything was just as it had been before : chairs , mirror , yellow sofa , and framed pictures
i can only take off my hat and bow low as in the gypsy song
it ’ s better not to sleep at all , he decided
and he ’ ll keep on , keep circling around me , constantly narrowing the radius of his circle—and then—plop !
so you have noticed my reserve how else did you put it my reticence ?
razumikhin had been sitting there in his dressing gown , which was worn to tatters , with slippers on his bare feet ; he was disheveled , unshaven , and unwashed
now , since we ’ ve begun talking openly ( and it ’ s excellent that we ’ ve begun
he is least of all interested in other characters , but the others are all the more interested in him
of course , mama , avdotya romanovna remarked earnestly
it was as if i myself was completely dumbfounded then
but as far as the basic , most important point was concerned , he had no doubts even for one moment , even while he was reading the letter
what ’ s all this about ?
she had come with a commission , one that , apparently , she liked very much
the two problems of youth and anger , or maturity and acceptance , come to a head in bazarov 's involvement with odintsov , the central episode in the novel , which also serves as a kind of structural dividing line between the political ( or social ) and the psychological
never did they consider their pronouncements , their scientific conclusions , their moral convictions and beliefs so infallible
by the way , for two days i was telling her at length about the prussian house of lords ( because , what else is there to talk about with her ?
and where , i say , did you get those earrings ?
in order to say i dissect frogs , or i make soap [ as in ustryalov 's parody of fathers and sons ] , certain generalizations , albeit negative ones , are necessary —to wit , to elevate disbelief in any other knowledge than particular knowledge into a principle
all this current anguish had taken root in him ages ago ; it had grown , accumulated , and of late matured and intensified , having assumed the form of a terrible , wild , fantastic question that tormented his heart and mind , irresistibly demanding a solution
i see ; but you must admit , you too possess a bit of that vanity we were just talking about
allow me to ask you to explain yourself immediately and inform me as to why you ’ ve bestowed the honor of a visit on me
it ’ s strange that you ’ re late even for your father ’ s funeral
what does it say there : so the right hand , isn ’ t it , doesn ’ t know
odintsova turned to bazarov
were you drinking with him , too ?
and bring me the newspapers , older ones , for the last five days , and i ’ ll give you some money for a drink
it all depends on you , on you , on you alone , he began with flashing eyes , almost in a whisper , losing the thread , even failing to utter some words because of his excitement
he seemed to be in a stupor
where are your clothes ?
he wanted to run away as quickly as possible
it ’ s for you , for you , sofiya semyonovna , and please , without further conversation , because i have no time for it
now , what do you suppose they made of all that ?
if she went out , it must be to see a particular lady on account of her orphans
turgenev has a propensity for idealism , but , nevertheless , not one of the idealists in his novel can be compared to bazarov either in strength of mind or in strength of character
yes , insane , i lost my head , i went crazy , completely
for me the strangest thing of all is that the number of crimes among the upper class is also increasing , in parallel , so to speak
he himself had no particular interest in all these teachings , ideas , and systems ( which andrey semyonych threw at him )
confront such terrible danger for a reward of one hundred rubles !
you insist that it was at your instigation !
why should i stay ?
a curse burst forth from his soul
after that he met no one , not a single soul , on his way up to his room ; the landlady ’ s door was closed and locked
i have even invented a new resin
let ’ s go , decided raskolnikov
( wringing her hands , she pointed to the children )
turgenev does not glorify the russian people or its past
the second she calls monumental time ; it is linked to eternity , all-encompassing and infinite , like imaginary space
there 's a peasant here suffering from icterus
they were there painting ; by any chance did you see them ?
how is it that i didn ’ t know that ?
yet they all pay a high price for their allegiance to their private cause
they dared think that you were mad
he placed the axe on the floor next to the dead woman and immediately reached into her pocket , trying not to get covered with her spurting blood—into that same right pocket from which she ’ d taken her keys the last time
at least , he touched the ground with one finger of his right hand
is it about twenty-five versts to your estate ?
once , about three years ago , he happened to spend a night at an inn in a remote district town
katerina ivanovna took lidochka , lifted the little boy from his chair , and , moving to the corner of the room near the stove , went down on her knees and placed the children on their knees in front of her
avdotya romanovna stared intently at her brother and kept waiting
are you that disenchanted ?
open up , you thinker , you , wake up !
ah , it ’ s a pity there ’ s so little time , because you ’ re such an interesting subject !
here you are , sir , if you ’ d care to see : mr writer , that is , a student , that is , a former student , doesn ’ t pay his debt
never mind , do not be alarmed sit down do not come near me : my illness is contagious
no , i have to cast that aside , he thought , coming back to his senses
at the end of the novel fenechka is the woman who is most radically altered
said her mother , looking timidly into her daughter ’ s eyes to read her thoughts , already feeling somewhat consoled that dunya was defending rodya and , therefore , must have forgiven him
suddenly she rested her right hand on the railing , lifted her right leg and thrust it over , then her left leg , and threw herself into the canal
when nikolai first meets her ( to remove a cinder from her eye ) , she has a tender , timid face ; her hair is soft ; her lips innocent and slightly parted ; her teeth , moist and pearly white
so you be the judge : it ’ s all the same to me now ; consequently , i ’ m doing this solely for you
besides , what right did he have to judge petr petrovich so quickly and rashly ?
and this infection 's already spread quite far
well , if you like , i ’ ll tell you how a woman tried to save ’ me , to use your language
fix it ; i ’ ll wait
tomorrow morning it ’ ll all be
come to see me and i ’ ll put it on you ; we ’ ll pray and go together
such a beginning did not bode well for a good ending
it would ’ ve been important for us to know if someone had seen them that same evening before eight o ’ clock , in that apartment , and it just occurred to me that you might be able to tell us
katerina ivanovna received it and bowed to him politely , even ceremoniously
obviously he was uncle ’ s pupil
look at how your hand is trembling !
the older couple believe that the younger pair treat each other as brother and sister
but there was no reason to be so underhanded about it
tell me , i ’ m convinced that you regard me with suspicion because i ’ ve been so tactful with you and up to now haven ’ t pestered you with any questions
the place is right ; if they come and ask you , tell them that i up and left for—oh , america
later on , things reach the stage that he is himself carried away for a moment and kisses fenichka , and pavel petrovich challenges him to a duel
† references to napoleon ’ s significant military victories and audacious crossing of mont blanc
how true , oh lord !
for god 's sake , said vasily ivanovich , let me do that myself
his introduction of motifs associated with a literary type serves his central problematic : the relationship of men and women to their own passional nature
i recently wrote you , but after your letter which i received yesterday i consider it necessary to write a couple of words in reply
for example , i ’ m obliged to arrest one person sooner , but someone else has a different character , sir ; so why shouldn ’ t i let him gallivant around town , sir , ha-ha !
and she was not the only one—all the others were also smiling and seemed to be asking forgiveness ; everyone was feeling a little awkward , a little melancholy , and , in reality , very happy
is there such an article ?
he was simply out of date
i was simply trying to educate her , completely innocently , trying to incite her to protest
but instead , bazarov talked about medicine , homeopathy , and botany
sonya stood there , deathly pale , regarding luzhin , unable to utter any reply
just like sitnikov , she was always anxious
he will be remembered for his enigmatic personality ,
what did i say ?
once upon a time
some flies , disturbed from their sleep , clustered around the untouched portion of veal still sitting on the table
it has been , razumikhin replied , frowning , and added , as if reluctantly , kokh recognized the item and positively identified the person who ’ d pawned it , and he verified that the item was really his
voyage , i ’ d like to carry out all the necessary preliminary arrangements
in fact , i even took a liking to her
her nose was a little broad , like almost all russian noses , and her complexion was not entirely clear ; nevertheless , arkady was sure he would never met such a lovely woman
what more do i want ?
it ’ s the very same vakhrushin , sir , afanasy ivanovich , according to your mother ’ s request , who once sent you some money in a similar manner ; he didn ’ t refuse to do it again this time , sir , and several days ago semyon semyonovich was informed that he should transfer thirty-five rubles to you , in anticipation of better times , sir
and there ’ s one more daughter
i have the honor to inform you that because of some sudden delays , i was unable to meet you on the platform , so i sent a very efficient fellow in my place
allow me , ladies and gentlemen , allow me ; don ’ t crowd me
raskolnikov walked across the square
dunechka asked anxiously , exchanging glances with her mother
‡ the man is a scoundrel !
and i ’ m drinking , sir !
et voilà comme on écrit l'histoire !
you ’ re not telling the truth !
believe me , i have borne and am able to bear the harshest truth from my friends
i left my uncle in charge
i see , she said , he has time for his own girl
nikolai petrovich was born in the south of russia , just like his older brother , pavel , about whom more later , and was brought up at home until the age of fourteen , surrounded by underpaid tutors , free-and-easy but obsequious adjutants , and other regimental and staff people
raskolnikov spoke loudly and pointed directly at him
that 's an important question as well
wouldn ’ t it be possible to see someone else ?
wasn ’ t he perhaps making a mistake ?
why , she ’ d even give you money , you fool !
i want to go see him right now and find out what he means by that
well , marmeladov , he says , you ’ ve disappointed my expectations once before
god knows what sort of ideas and plans you have in mind or what sort of thoughts you ’ re conceiving ; is it for me to pester you and ask what you ’ re thinking about ?
i assume you do not require any further explanation ?
if i ’ d seen through him before , i never would have been tempted
however , there ’ s no difficulty now
thank you , arkasha , nikolai petrovich began in a hollow voice , his fingers once again running over his brow and forehead
we ’ d drink it with pleasure
he was one of a countless and diverse legion of vulgar people , feeble retards , and uneducated morons who instantly and without fail latch onto the most fashionable current idea in order to vulgarize it and immediately caricature the cause they themselves sometimes serve in a most sincere manner
it was a one-hundred-ruble banknote , folded in eighths
a strange lethargy could be detected in all his movements ; even his step , usually forceful and decisively bold , was different
amaliya ivanovna rushed around the room , screaming , moaning , brawling , and flinging everything she could lay her hands on onto the floor
where will we put him , that 's the question ?
git in , everyone git in !
i know this for certain , even from the facts , sir
katerina ivanovna regarded him with a grim but stern look ; tears flowed from her eyes
without fail they ’ d have discovered him there if kokh hadn ’ t been such a fool and gone to fetch the caretaker
long since the issues that he fought out have ceased to be of any actual interest
thrash ’ er , go on !
oh , my dear , i just don ’ t know what to talk about , pulkheriya aleksandrovna burst out
obviously they had not been expected
i ’ m not such a boor as you think
his cynicism has two aspects , an internal and an external one , a cynicism of thought and feeling and a cynicism of manner and expression
bazarov school had happened upon turgenev 's theme , then , of course , the picture would have been drawn otherwise and the colors would have been applied differently
perching on the sofa at his son 's feet , he hoped to have a nice chat with him , but bazarov sent him away at once , saying that he wanted to sleep ; but he did not fall asleep until morning
sorrow , sorrow is what i sought in its depths , sorrow and tears , and i found them and tasted of them ; but he who has pitied all men and who has understood everyone and everything , he will take pity on us ; he and no one else ; he is the judge
and only then did he completely understand the meaning these poor little orphan children had for her , and the pitiful half-mad katerina ivanovna , with her consumption and her banging her head against the wall
what book did he give you ?
my son , my dear , kind son !
to nihilism , incidentally , russia owes the well-known and remarkable fact that in our culturally deprived country , women began , earlier than in most civilized states , their surge toward higher education and equal rights —a fact which already [ as of ] has had enormous significance and which in the future will obviously play a great role in the fate of our country and even perhaps throughout the civilized world
well , if you like , we can hire a cab !
the point is that this idea
raskolnikov asked with obvious agitation
but enough about me—and it is time to stop these sporadic reminiscences which , i fear , will hardly satisfy readers
peter returned to the carriage and handed him his matchbox and a fat , black cigar , which arkady lit immediately , spreading such a strong and acrid smell of cheap tobacco around himself that nikolai petrovich , who would never been a smoker , turned away , though unobtrusively so as not to offend his son
as for your being a great sinner , that ’ s true , he added almost enthusiastically
she ’ s sitting there with her mouth open wide , just look : she ’ s like an owl , a genuine screech owl in her cap with new ribbons , ha-ha-ha !
svidrigaylov was observing and scrutinizing him in silence , which also struck raskolnikov at once ; it seemed as if he wanted to get up and slip out of the tavern surreptitiously so that no one would notice him
the room in which they found themselves looked more like a study than a drawing room
the one rambles idealistic poetry , the other grumbles his faith in the dissection of frogs ; the one is all too obviously weak , the other seems spectacularly strong
raskolnikov walked along next to him
why do you think that ?
true , i consider that you ’ ve been sent to us by providence , and so i was convinced that you already knew everything about it
it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
the radical critic pisarev came to turgenev 's aid
yes , you did the sensible thing
he felt , at least , that if not now , he would be capable of doing it later
all dressed in white
for a little while all right
to hell with all that !
what are you waiting for ?
do not worry , i have not given anyone the evil eye
peter , he called , extending his arm , are those our peasants over there ?
i don ’ t recall his exact words , but the idea was that he ’ d become wealthy for free , as quickly as possible , without having to work for it !
he extended both his hands to me , yet didn ’ t give me even one ; he withdrew his hand in time , flashed through his mind suspiciously
razumikhin turned as pale as a corpse
nikolai the miracle worker ; a tiny porcelain egg on a red ribbon fastened to the saint 's gold halo hung over his chest ; there were jars of last year 's preserves on the windowsills , carefully arranged , glistening bright green ; on their paper lids fenechka had written in large letters : guzbery
bazarov 's transgression of culture and his painful death echo ovid 's rendering of the story of actaeon , a hero whose transformation images destruction rather than reward
everyone ’ s pestering me on all sides , saying , it ’ s a crime , a crime !
yes , yes , that would be better , much better , she responded with feeling
i will introduce you to her
for which you received the st vladimir cross ?
i began with the thesis that fathers and sons is a novel with two entwined themes :
what what was that ?
i am wondering where you acquired those powers of observation you genuinely possess
but they don ’ t stutter
he was now almost running around the room , moving his stout little legs faster and faster , looking down at the floor , his right hand thrust behind his back , his left constantly waving about , executing various gestures , each time astonishingly ill-suited to his words
nikolai petrovich tried to establish monetary fines for any damages , but the matter usually ended when the horses were returned to their owners after a day or two of grazing on the master 's land
the russian peasant 's just like the mysterious stranger that mrs radcliffe used to go on about at such length
are you always home alone ?
it seems that way , at least
i don ’ t even have any matches
there ’ s only one thing that matters , only one : to be able to dare !
the whole interest , the whole meaning of the novel is contained in the death of bazarov
it ’ s just that as soon as i saw you , the drink went to my head
it is the cognitive revolution that took place between a time when nature was felt to reflect man , and a later time in which man was conceived as little more than a reflection of nature that makes the local relationship of turgenev and secenov of particular interest
enough of that , evgeny
no , he says , i didn ’ t
it was a balance involving ' the body and pressure of time and that rapidly changing physiognomy of russians of the cultured stratum ' , which he described as being preeminently the object of his observation as a novelist ; it was therefore arealistic ' in its devotion to the realities of russian life and topical in its concern with chronicling the history of the russian intelligentsia
do you know what i remembered , brother ?
i can ’ t believe it !
lying on the 'earth , looking up at the 'heavens ' you know , there 's special significance in that
i just don ’ t know how she can ask like that !
yes , indeed , avdotya romanovna !
and so on and so forth
i told you once for all that you not dare say to me amal lyudvigovna ; i ’ m amal-ivan !
of course , he had quickly managed to discern in andrey semyonych an extremely vulgar and simpleminded man
she surpassed the ludicrous in her attitudes and behavior
crossing the bridge , he calmly and peacefully looked at the neva , at the bright setting of the burning red sun
i don ’ t believe it !
they should be more careful with him today
you yourself can see that it ’ s not right !
katerina ivanovna wants me to implore you to attend the funeral tomorrow morning
however , lebezyatnikov , in spite of the fact that he was a nice man , had also begun to have some difficulty tolerating his fellow lodger and former mentor petr petrovich
bazarov said with particular emphasis
you should have seen how he abused me today !
why did she take him away ?
yes , of course , evgeny ; there 's an excellent room in the wing next to me : he will be fine there
and this dream of so many years had almost been realized : he was impressed by avdotya romanovna ’ s beauty and education ; her helpless position excited him in the extreme
i do not see any obstacles i am happy for katya and for arkady nikolaich
just imagine , he said , turning to raskolnikov , that ’ s the way it was last evening
that will suffice for me
his gaze and his thoughts demanded space
it was so stuffy that it was even unbearable to sit there ; everything was so saturated by the smell of alcohol that it seemed a person could become drunk in about five minutes just inhaling the air
each one would depend on all the others for the rest of their lives !
well , what ’ s the matter ?
anna sergeevna took hold of katya 's chin and raised her face
no , it ’ s better to do it without thinking , and get it off my back !
in translating the laws of science into ideological practice , scientism gives up the extrahistorical claim to truth attaching to mathematical signs
the type of bazarov seemed to him practically an apotheosis of the contemporary ,
look at my watch ; but i ’ ll tell you about it because it ’ s an interesting little matter , my marriage , that is , in its own way
he was crossing the street and a carriage ran him over ; don ’ t be upset ; he ’ ll come to
well , they pressured him and pressured him , squeezed him and squeezed him , and he finally confessed
she ’ s an orphan ; god has sent you !
i could never trust his character , not even when he was only fifteen years old
never mind , let them eat
is this still my dream or not ?
it was burning with fever
it was like a hideous joke , an absurdity !
he told her that amaliya ivanovna was driving them out of the apartment and that katerina ivanovna was rushing off to look for justice
i nearly put off speaking about it until another time , but really , you ’ re capable of frustrating a dead man
she did not play cards and kept laughing frequently , in marked contrast to her pale and worried look
that was a thunderbolt , sir !
soon everyone turned away from him
i said anna sergeevna odintsova 's here and has brought a gentleman with her , a doctor
so , he will be living in a fine white hut while i am pushing up burdock ; well , then what ?
she troubles me ; you ’ ll see , you will
she stood there and turned around in front of me
uttered pavel petrovich ; his face took on such a detached , remote expression , as if he would entirely withdrawn to some cloudy height
take , for example , that theme of the doorbells once again : i , that is , the examining magistrate , wholeheartedly revealed that precious detail to you , that fact
that appears to be something felt by all readers—and one might add that , like the heroes of dostoevsky , bazarov does not so much proclaim his views—he speaks of them unwillingly and rarely—as incarnate them
i swear to you , he continued to whisper , already on the stairs , just a little while ago he came close to beating us up , the doctor and me !
he ’ s such a
no , wouldn ’ t it be better to try svidrigaylov : to find out what that was all about ?
he whispered gloomily a plump , blue-gray dove flew down onto the road and went off to drink from a puddle near the well
i said it about you not because of your dishonor and your sin , but because of your great suffering
how could he possibly care about a promissory note at this time , or about some overdue payment ?
you are , aren ’ t you ?
he turned around ; lebezyatnikov came running toward him
turgenev decided to choose as a representative of the bazarov type an uncouth man ; of course as he delineated his hero , he did not conceal or try to gloss over his awkwardness
he decided to keep silent and wait : what would happen next ?
send someone to fetch odintsova , anna sergeevna ; she 's a landowner who lives nearby do you know her ?
have you seen them recently ?
now it ’ s almost clear to me how you regard crime , but
he sometimes thought : svidrigaylov was constantly skulking around him and was doing so now ; svidrigaylov knew his secret ; he had harbored designs against dunya
maybe we should put on our frockcoats ?
it tasted not quite like copper , not quite like resin ; the flies were also a bother
what ’ s the life of that consumptive , stupid , spiteful old woman worth on the common scale ?
a strange thought occurred to him suddenly : perhaps it would really be better in prison
well , i can almost see it somewhere in a garden—a garden , isn ’ t that what you told zametov , and then repeated to me a second time ?
the schiller in you is always getting confused
should i get rid of the axe ?
why am i going now , when i myself know that all of it will be just as it is in the books , and not any different ?
in one town , we learn that a former student has robbed the mail along the main road
but our carriage only seats two , and i do not know how your friend will
the cleanliness of his room and freshness of the bed linen made a pleasant impression on him
a moment later he rang it again , louder
fenechka 's eye got better soon , but the impression she would made on nikolai petrovich did not fade quickly
he remained there for rather a long time ; when he came back to breakfast , nikolai petrovich inquired solicitously after his health because his face looked so dark
not only is turgenev not a novelist , he is more precisely not a russian novelist
now all that ’ s over and done with and we can say that we ’ re all happy again
what do i care ?
my whole life , or anything
i can hear her sighing through the wall , but when i go out to see her—i have nothing to say to her
i was a little drunk , sir , and i heard my sonya ( she ’ s very meek and has such a soft voice
but that ’ s all nonsense , too !
i was so furious that the next day i went to the address bureau to give it a try , and what do you know , they located you in two minutes
the description of bazarov 's death is one of the best passages in turgenev 's novel ; indeed , i doubt whether anything more remarkable can be found in the whole body of his work
you ’ re lying , i won ’ t let you catch me !
she directed the conversation to music , but when she learned that bazarov did not acknowledge art , she quietly returned to the subject of botany , although arkady was just about to launch into a disquisition on the significance of folk melodies
odintsova gives her sister and brother-in-law a handsome present , and even bazarov— now dead—has earlier recommended that arkady follow the example of the jackdaw , which is , as natural history instructs , a most respectable family bird ( [ ] )
yesterday he so insistently demanded that petr petrovich be refused , and now we ’ re told that rodya can ’ t be received !
stop it , sonya , stop it !
deliberately setting aside the consolations of religious faiths , his was a realistic view of life which attempted from first to last to peer beyond the veil , or to cross the threshold separating reality from eternity
the poetic sensibility at work in turgenev 's tales of destructive passion evokes ennui in the modern reader
that ’ s the main thing , remembered afterward , and there ’ s your evidence
was that all right ?
he had gone to her first , to sonya , with his confession ; in her he ’ d sought another person , when he ’ d needed to find one ; she would follow after him wherever fate sent him
but it ’ s particularly true for women
for destitution you ’ re not even driven away with a stick—you ’ re swept out of human company with a broom so that it will be even more humiliating ; and that ’ s fair , for in my destitution i ’ m the first one prepared to humiliate myself
she very much wanted to remember him , to honor him , his memory
what do you mean , you don ’ t need the sentence reduction , how can that be ?
at the time he himself still didn ’ t believe in his dreams and was merely irritating himself with their repugnant , though seductive audacity
now things are getting extremely boisterous : some very large and extremely drunken peasants in red and blue shirts , their heavy coats slung over their shoulders , come out of the tavern shouting , singing , and playing balalaikas
his turning away from his former passion finds affectionate but mocking reflection in rudin and dvorianskoe gnezdo and becomes the subject of bitter denunciation in gamlet shchi-grovskogo uezda
pavel petrovich exclaimed impatiently
well , therefore you could ’ ve challenged men to a duel
where were you all last night ?
bazarov does not like to argue or , in general , to express his opinions and only pavel petrovich is sometimes able to draw him into a significant discussion
secondly : my conscience is completely clear ; i have no ulterior motives in making this offer
and it seems that as recently as yesterday , you supposed he loved katya like a brother
it does not matter , he muttered
i ’ m gon na make ’ er gallop !
that is the point of view from which the action and events of the novel may best be evaluated
so what , if they deserve to be despised ?
fathers and children : turgenev and the liberal predicament
katerina sergeevna , he began , his voice trembling , his hands clasped tightly together
and it ’ s impossible to drag a man off with what they have
) ; he thought , by this time she 's forgotten entirely about my existence , and in his soul he felt a sense of exquisite humility
in comedy , the villains , the blockers , are laughed off the stage , while in tragedy the people who do not belong come to a more frightful end
why did you try to hang yourself ?
bazarov leaned out of his carriage , while arkady poked his head around his comrade 's back and saw on the little porch of the manor house a tall , gaunt man with disheveled hair and a thin aquiline nose , dressed in an old , unfastened military jacket
he provides in answer an effective presentation of life which fixes and crystallizes youthful rebellion , a program which substitutes for love between the generations a whole other world of affections and loyalties among peers
in the rear blind wall of this portico or gallery , there were six niches for statues , which odintsov had planned to order from abroad
what if there ’ s no one else to see , nowhere else to go ?
arkady nodded his head , as if he himself were not shy
it ’ s what ’ s called bonne guerre , † and the most permissible deceit !
he thought to himself
razumikhin roared and suddenly threw himself at zosimov , grabbing him by the throat
he listens to me , his eyes wide open , and suddenly grows pale as a ghost
that ’ s why sofiya semyonovna ’ s been summoned to appear today at the hotel where the aristocratic lady is staying temporarily , having just arrived in town from her dacha
he ’ s been vegetating his whole life as a district postmaster
his words made quite an impression ; silence reigned for a moment , but soon the previous laughter and curses resumed
he had already heard something about it yesterday ; he even recalled that he had been invited ; but as a result of his own affairs , he let everything else slip from his attention
but , of course , it ’ s now that you won ’ t come
bazarov reverses in his biography the direction taken by the movement from romanticism to naturalism : he is a naturalist who metamorphoses into a romantic poet
perhaps we wouldn ’ t even reject sonechka ’ s fate !
no , if i ’ d handed them some fifteen hundred rubles for a dowry and for gifts , nice little boxes , toilet cases , jewelry , fabrics , and all sorts of trifles from knop ’ s and the english shop , then everything would have turned out better and
i don ’ t believe in a future life , said raskolnikov
and to base it all on that ?
an ecstatic smile parted his broad lips and remained fixed there
at last everything quieted down all at once , as if cut off ; the men departed
well , sonya , where ’ ve you been ?
six months ; he will be seven soon , on the eleventh
now the letter from his mother had suddenly struck him like a thunderbolt
with faint , weak steps , trembling knees , and a terrible chill , raskolnikov turned back and climbed the stairs to his little room
she reached the third floor , turned down the long hallway , and rang the bell at number : on the door , written in chalk , were the words kapernaumov
one thing is certain : it was a derivative of the masculine word and followed it into the language of popular usage
in silence , only occasionally exchanging small talk , our friends arrived at fedot 's
he said , shaking his head
she ’ s now a widow , a consumptive , and a pitiful woman with three young orphans , hungry
so that 's what you think !
of course , he was not that horrible if he held out for seven years
i get six rubles for sixteen pages , which means about fifteen rubles for the whole thing , and i got six rubles in advance
i was fed up with all of them yesterday , raskolnikov replied , turning suddenly to porfiry with an arrogantly challenging smile
but turgenev did not bring bazarov out of his gloomy mood
he was apparently steady and serene
i wo not undertake a refutation ; perhaps the lady even told the truth
he ’ s a very nice young man
raskolnikov didn ’ t utter a word during this conversation , yet he learned everything all at once : lizaveta was the old woman ’ s younger half sister ( they had different mothers ) and was already thirty-five years old
raskolnikov turned around quickly and sat down on the chair next to the table
of course , he has his own aims , and most likely they ’ re bad ones
we ’ ll see , we ’ ll see , he repeated to himself
i ’ m not even referring to the means
perhaps even later today
that ’ s the explanation of her way out !
having once imagined this hospitality , she had come to believe in it as a sacred thing
still i ’ ll know that you love me , and for me even that ’ s enough
with a nod of his head , he indicated his outstretched , enfeebled body
sofiya semyonovna , raskolnikov corrected him
it suits you , if you only knew : a romeo who ’ s six feet tall !
how can this be ?
what about your head ?
pelouse et frémy , notions générales bazarov replied
she was acquainted with everyone in town , and during that month she visited town continually
or something of that sort—as is always done in similar cases by relatives or even by strangers , but in general by people wishing to assist
you just mentioned zametov
but , juxtaposed to such pitiful and insignificant fathers as the kirsanovs , the stern bazarov captivated turgenev and , instead of spanking the son , he flogged the fathers
rumors about this episode circulated through the whole town for an entire month , and it reached the point where dunya and i couldn ’ t even go to church because of all the contemptuous looks and whispers
tales were circulating about him
a restless and vacant expression appeared on the small , though pleasant features of his pampered face ; his little eyes , looking as if they would been squeezed into his face , stared intently and uneasily , and he laughed nervously , in an abrupt , wooden manner
do they know i went back to the apartment ?
he couldn ’ t , for example , imagine that at some time he would stop thinking , get up , and—simply go there
farewell , madame , bazarov said , as if guessing her thought , and headed back to the house
will you fulfill everything ?
however , he guessed right away that this wasn ’ t the only thing that was upsetting him ; there was something demanding immediate resolution , but he was unable to figure out what it was or to put it into words
that is , it seems to be the case
dunya went up to her mother and kissed her
first we must bring this creature back to his senses
with my constitution , i even fear that i might suffer a stroke
stackenschneider recalls that the term nigilistka was held in high regard among women of the sixties , while kiseinaya devushka was a pejorative term ( dnevnik , )
not the arrears , my friend !
there ’ s a certain circumstance
from time to time , with a sheepish and vague look , he glanced at the speaker but , obviously , didn ’ t have any idea what he was talking about , and it was doubtful that he even heard him
and the stricter the master , the better for the peasant
we can only be sure that after the publication of fathers and children , the image of the female nihilist ( turgenev did not use the word ) was firmly fixed in the public eye
even before this , she seemed , in spite of all her excellent qualities , to have a somewhat ecstatic and romantic cast to her views
the doctor complied so as not to irritate him and left
and avdotya romanovna ’ s not too tired , either ?
i will feel fine tomorrow
he came running in ecstasy
raskolnikov turned around quickly and stared directly at razumikhin
photographs of russian life and russian life in the interior
he cast a challenging and desperate glance at the caretaker , who silently handed him a gray piece of paper folded in two , sealed with bottle wax
the wallpaper here was still the same
i ’ m afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the latest fashionable disbelief
well , sir , let ’ s get down to business !
well , what of it ?
we ’ re furriers , tradesmen , and work at home
prokofich , in his own way , was just as much of an aristocrat as pavel petrovich
achilles said with a shudder , his pupils growing wider and wider
women regarded him as a charming melancholic , but he did not keep company with ladies
here ’ s how i would have changed the counterfeit banknotes : i ’ d have counted the first thousand very carefully , four times over , examining each note , and then moved on to the next thousand ; i ’ d have begun counting that one , reached the middle of the pile , and then pulled out some fifty-ruble note , held it up to the light , turned it over , and held that side up to the light , too—checking to see if it was counterfeit
raskolnikov stood there for the whole service
well , yes , of course , it 's all in the nature of things , vasily ivanych said , but we would better go inside
i ’ m not afraid of katerina ivanovna now , he muttered in agitation
he was russia in a large measure , henry james wrote in partial portraits ( )
polechka was wearing her usual dress
that peasant woman with a child is begging for alms ; it ’ s curious that she considers me more fortunate than she is
when bazarov , writhing in delirium , cries out , take ten from eight , what 's left over ?
why does he feel so grateful to me ?
other figures will gain , too , i think
now i believe it even less !
most frequently he does not even feel the need to express himself ; he thinks to himself and , from time to time , lets drop a cursory remark , which is usually seized upon with respectful eagerness by his proselytes and pupils like arkady
she hasn ’ t left this room ; as soon as she returned , you scoundrel , she sat down right next to rodion romanovich !
just at that moment , several people appeared in the doorway together with lebezyatnikov , among whom were the two recently arrived ladies
used to sing that song when he was courting me
on the other hand , pavel petrovich came to despise bazarov with all the strength he could muster : he considered him arrogant , impudent , a cynic , and a plebian ; he suspected that bazarov did not respect him , that he might even despise him—pavel kirsanov !
it ’ s simply work , a noble , useful activity to society , one worth as much as any other , and is a much higher activity , for example , than that of some raphael or pushkin , because it ’ s more useful ! ¶
i hope your journey was agreeable ?
i want to find out and will be able to learn , for certain , whether he ’ s a brother to me or not
there is , i believe , a fairly general consensus among those who have studied turgenev that he was a writer who took a remarkably objective , fair-minded view of the political scene while always seeking to hold the middle ground
taking arms against idealism and destroying its castles in the air , he himself , at times , becomes an idealist , that is , he begins to prescribe to man how he should enjoy himself and how he should regulate his own sensations
he then saw how her lower lip trembled in indignation in response to her brother ’ s bold and ungratefully cruel commands—and he could not resist
he lay there for a long time
he acts thus through calculation : he pays the price of a minor unpleasantness in order to secure greater comfort in the future or deliverance from a greater unpleasantness
well , it ’ s tempting , isn ’ t it ?
fenechka raised her eyes to look at bazarov , eyes that seemed even darker from the whitish reflection on the upper part of her face
he entered like a person condemned to death
bazarov would ask , interrupting him
pavel petrovich paced slowly back and forth in the dining room ( he never ate supper ) and occasionally sipped a goblet filled with red wine and even less frequently uttered some remark , or rather exclamation , such as ah !
you seem not to be yourself
young folks do not much like that , he explained to her
porfiry petrovich asked , glancing at razumikhin
( well , do you recall the public reading of pushkin ’ s egyptian nights ? ‡ those dark eyes ?
he ’ s here on business , he ’ s a lawyer , and even his conversation is so
odintseva 's psychic and sensual retreats will be governed by this allegiance to an order both psychological and social
the former preserve the world and increase its population ; the latter move the world forward and lead it to its goal
the older generation does not understand bazarov and for that very reason fears him : arkady 's father , a soft slothful landowner , is acute enough , however , to remark that bazarov is different : he has fewer traces of the slaveowner
the confession didn ’ t last very long
i am here with a small carnage , but there 's a troika of horses for your coach as well , said nikolai petrovich with some concern , while arkady had a drink of water from an iron dipper brought by the woman in charge of the carriage inn , and bazarov lit his pipe and walked over to the driver , who was unharnessing the horses
throwing over her head the same lightweight green shawl the late marmeladov had mentioned in his account , katerina ivanovna squeezed through the disorderly drunken crowd of lodgers , who were still pushing into the room
he stepped on the box and then picked them up !
one morning she declared openly that according to her calculations , rodya should be coming back soon ; that she recalled how , at their parting , he himself had reminded her that she should expect him in nine months
to m n katkov
i dared not tell you the truth because you ’ d be so unhappy , bitter , and angry
yes , sir , curtains ; nikolai petrovich was kind enough to give them to me ; they have been here for some time
it was lying there , beside the pillow ; raskolnikov saw it
rodya ’ s been ill for the last five days and was delirious for three of them
but that ’ s because he hasn ’ t dared to use them
dobrolyubov ) , but apart from that one could not conceive of a better reincarnation of bazarov than mayakovsky
russia 's true conservator , pushkin 's legatee who first revealed to europe that russia is also europe
but soon he felt very cold standing above the water ; he turned and set off on bolshoi prospect
he drew near , but even then did not raise his eyes and said in a hollow voice , i must apologize , anna sergeevna
her husband is said to be one of russia 's future statesmen , a lawyer who is clever , willful , kind , and cold as ice
these zones are formed from the fragments of character speech [ polurec ] , from various forms for hidden transmission of someone else 's word , from scattered words and sayings belonging to someone else 's speech , from those invasions into authorial speech of others ' expressive indicators ( ellipsis , questions , exclamations )
raskolnikov said with a particular look , and then smiled , nodded his head , and went down the stairs
this solace not only sheds light on the novel 's closing scene but also states its second , inextricably related theme : love and continuity between generations
how have they all turned out ?
they say , i ’ ll carry one small brick for universal happiness and as a result i ’ ll feel my heart at peace
they both remained silent , and that silence lasted for a peculiarly long time , about ten minutes
she asked , turning to bazarov
thus , rodya , all your clothes have been renewed , because , in my opinion , your overcoat is not only still serviceable , but even has a kind of elegance about it : that ’ s what happens when you order your clothes from charmeur ’ s tailor shop !
it also disturbed him what razumikhin had just said about porfiry
but not to try on the shoes
asked the perplexed razumikhin , shaking his head
i shouldn ’ t have said that to her !
considering that avdotya romanovna , in essence , was impoverished ( ah , excuse me , i didn ’ t want to
not only to sonya , but next you ’ ll go to dunya !
this is my friend razumikhin , a good fellow
one might similarly apply to turgenev 's novel isaiah berlin 's gloss on strakhov 's words about turgenev 's poetic and truthful genius
the dome of the cathedral , the outline of which could not appear more conspicuously from any other point of view than this spot on the bridge , some twenty paces from the chapel , was gleaming ; through the clear air one could discern every last detail of its decoration
he hastened to say when they opened the door
herzen was crying off from revolution because he rejected western civilization
waste , futility , and anguish are overwhelming , but then comes a dramatic reversal , and the novel ends with a declaration of hope :
can you be serious , rodya ?
but without turning around , vasily ivanovich merely gestured in despair and left the room
the role of aunt , guardian , mother , whatever you want to call it
congratulate me , bazarov cried suddenly , today , june twenty-second , is my guardian angel 's day
you ’ re capricious and spoiled , and you can ’ t deny yourself anything—i call that filth , because it leads directly to filth
sonya started to say , without so much as looking at razumikhin , and , as a result , became even more embarrassed
where has she gone ?
he does and he ’ s also lame
in a larger sense , the argument between the ordinary or prosaic and the extraordinary or dramatic pervades this book
there is the sound of a heavy thud
that ’ s all ; it seemed to me that this is what i had to do and what i had to start with
do you know that my wife was educated in a provincial school for children of the nobility , and at the award ceremony she was chosen to perform the shawl dance§ in the presence of the governor and other distinguished guests , for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit ?
what am i saying ?
when he decides to leave—abruptly and even cruelly after a visit home of only three days—part of his motivation is , in fact , love for his parents :
i ’ m really losing my mind !
i am in my right mind , sir , and you
well , the hell with all of you !
why did i reveal it to her ?
that 's all bazarov almost uttered his favorite word romanticism , but restrained himself and said , nonsense
in a word , i conclude that everyone , not only the great people , but even those who stand out just slightly from the everyday rut , that is , those who are even marginally capable of uttering some new word , must , by their nature , necessarily be criminals—more or less , it goes without saying
at first , he paid her no attention , just as he hadn ’ t focused on other things appearing before him up to now
he came to see the apartment , said the elder workman , drawing near
bazarov is exceedingly full of self-esteem , but this self-esteem is unnoticeable as a direct consequence of his vastness
they ’ re really the ones i ought to be wearing now
even though i know that you ’ re a man
it was because of my new clothes that i decided to fool you all
do you remember what i wanted to tell you yesterday ?
he went to the stove , opened it , and began searching in the cinders : pieces of the trouser fringes and fragments of his torn pockets were lying inside , just as they had been when he ’ d thrown them in there : this meant that no one had looked inside !
cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna , interrupting him
sonya followed katerina ivanovna closely , weeping and constantly imploring her to return home
do you still have the same steward ?
but to hell with all of them !
i couldn ’ t work up the courage to do it
hands at your sides , quickly , quickly , glissez-glissez , pas de basque ! ‡‡ stamp your feet
he was holding his cap , preparing to leave
don ’ t come to see me
and once even replaced it with father , pronounced , it 's true , between his teeth ; with excessive carelessness he poured much more wine into his glass than he really wanted and then drank it all
the high official repeats in annoyance
they have to be washed together
the sacrifice , have you both measured the enormous sacrifice ?
if you were now to reveal all your secrets to me , i might not even listen ; i might just spit and walk away
the first abuses the main character , the other two enthusiastically praise everything
i do not quite understand what you mean , replied arkady
to i p borisov
here ’ s the point : perhaps i ’ m very guilty before you ; i feel this to be the case , sir
he didn ’ t understand that such a premonition could be a prediction of a future crisis in his life , of his future resurrection , of a future view of life itself
anna sergeevna asked , among other things , what he would been doing at the kirsanovs
nothing liberates man as much as learning , and nowhere is freedom as necessary as in art , in poetry : not for nothing are the arts called liberal ,
it wasn ’ t that money , calm down !
saying good-bye to bazarov , odintsova stretched out her hand and said , we will see each other again , wo not we ?
finally the plan included even sonya , who would accompany katerina ivanovna to t—— and there would assist her in everything
he stood up , wanting to return home , but the emotions stirring in his heart could not be calmed ; he began pacing slowly around the garden , first gazing sadly at the ground under his feet , then raising his eyes to the sky , where swarms of stars were already twinkling
vasily ivanovich led him into the study
because you can ’ t remain like this—that ’ s why !
yet very rarely has their style been regarded as anything but exemplary
he pricked up his ears
well , then here ’ s a little example for the future—that is , don ’ t think i ’ d dare to instruct you : why , just look at those articles on crime you publish !
he wanted to finish everything before sunset
raskolnikov shuddered , but porfiry seemed not to notice him , all the while concerned only about razumikhin ’ s cigarette
as a pure empiricist , he enjoys the pleasant sensation and gradually becomes so accustomed to it , that when the time comes to tear himself away , it is difficult and painful for him to do so
the only difference is that i don ’ t insist in any way that extraordinary people absolutely must and are always obligated to commit all sorts of outrages , as you say
' i have conceived a loathing for this peasant , bazarov says , ' i have to work the skin off my hands for him , and he wo not so much as thank me for it ; anyway , what do i need his thanks for ?
he had been spurting these empty , meaningless phrases without stop , suddenly dropping in some enigmatic words , then wandering off into nonsense again
she as rich as a yid , can lend you five thousand just like that , but she doesn ’ t balk at taking a pledge worth a single ruble , either

now splashes of rain flew in the window from the trees and bushes ; it was dark as a cellar , so that one could barely make out objects as vague dark spots
they did not know , and the author knows even less
are not you enjoying yourself here ?
we summoned chebarov , shoved ten rubles in his mouth , got the note back , and now i have the honor of presenting it to you—they ’ ll take your word for it now—here , take it ; i ’ ve even torn it a bit like it ’ s supposed to be
she didn ’ t hear and didn ’ t see the men entering ; she seemed to be in some sort of stupor in which she neither saw nor heard anything
was that why you frightened me , just to lead me to this ?
has it ever occurred to you that the sistine madonna has a fantastic face , the face of a sad holy fool ?
why did he come ?
i ’ d acquired new clothes before that
well , yes and the cigar does not taste very good
meanwhile raskolnikov persuaded someone to fetch a doctor
don ’ t tell me they should release your painter ?
do you also want to torment me to death ?
my head started spinning a little
but no friendship can survive such confrontations for very long
and he will stretch forth his arms to us , and we will kiss his hands
there have been many attempts to define russian nihilism , but i think nikolai strakhov came close to the truth when he said that nihilism itself hardly exists , although there is no denying the fact that nihilists do
how can he do it without a signature ?
take me , he says , to such and such a police station ; i ’ ll admit to everything
but healthy people can experience something similar , remarked dunechka , regarding zosimov uneasily
as you wish , but there ’ s something about you : precisely now—that is , not at this very minute , but now in general
he was at home in his little room ; at that moment he was busy writing ; he unlocked the door himself
as if in the theater
but he understood her , too
you , i trust , do not need logic to put a piece of bread in your mouth when you are hungry
no , dunya , i can see everything , and i know what those many things are that you want to talk over with me ; i also know what you worried about all night , pacing the room , and what you prayed about before the icon of our lady of kazan , the one that mama has in her bedroom
this certificate of merit , obviously , was now supposed to bear witness to katerina ivanovna ’ s right to establish a school ; but the main thing was , it was kept in reserve with the goal of finally putting those two overdressed tail draggers in their place , in case they came to the funeral feast , and to demonstrate clearly to them that katerina ivanovna was descended from a noble , one could even say aristocratic , household and was a colonel ’ s daughter , and that she was much better than certain adventure seekers who had become so very common as of late
i was conscious , conscious !
but the struggle was too uneven ; amaliya ivanovna pushed her away like a feather
i warn you that dunechka ’ s already decided the entire matter from the outset , but i , i still don ’ t know what to do , and
he rushed toward her
she was extremely agitated and tried to lift herself up
what if he still did now ?
and what does bazarov do amidst these three personalities ?
how could you not know that her mother ’ s borrowing money in advance against her pension to cover the cost of their journey ?
turgenev 's background in german idealist philosophy , especially hegelianism , is quite well documented and requires only the briefest summary
my mother , my sister , how i loved them !
he felt that he had gotten rid of a terrible burden , one that had been oppressing him for so long a time , and his soul suddenly seemed light and peaceful
why do you set off ?
to get to the police station , he had to go straight and then turn left at the second street : it was just a few steps away
one was holding a lit lantern , with which , by leaning over , he was casting light on something lying on the pavement near the carriage wheels
at that very moment , he was summoned to see porfiry petrovich
he grew angry that my mother and my sister , in spite of his slander , didn ’ t want to quarrel with me ; word for word , he began to utter unforgivably impudent things to them
he recommends stoff and kraft precisely as a popular book , that is , an empty one ; the duel with pavel petrovich is introduced precisely as graphic proof of the emptiness of elegantly noble knighthood , presented almost in an exaggeratedly comic way
raskolnikov thought for a minute
even the inevitable exclamations and sighs , interrogations and astonishment , suddenly were all unusually moderate and restrained ; on the other hand , the most enthusiastic gratitude was expressed and even accompanied with tears by the fiancée ’ s most sensible mother
well , remarked bazarov , those are fair conditions
you were a cardsharp ?
now i ’ ll wear lizaveta ’ s cross , and this one is for you
and if only fate had sent him remorse—burning remorse , crushing the heart , banishing sleep , to escape from which men dream of the noose or the maelstrom !
raskolnikov hadn ’ t managed to discern that at first
by this summons , raskolnikov managed to explain
after all , could there have been other ones , sir ?
'turgenev ' , he said to the novelist 's friend annenkov , 'should be ashamed of lowering the flag before a radical , or saluting him as an honourable soldier
nikolai petrovich jumped up and fixed his gaze on the road
preaching is an illness , a hunger , a desire ; a healthy person can not be a prophet or even a preacher
this is how i ’ d have behaved , began raskolnikov , once again suddenly drawing his face close to zametov ’ s , staring intently at him again , and whispering once more , so that this time zametov even shuddered
that ’ s so , isn ’ t it ?
she was killed with an axe
you knew my character ; you wanted to drive me into a fury and then suddenly startle me with priests and deputies
yea , lord : i believe that thou art the christ , the son of god , which should come into the world
we will see each other again soon , father , really
don ’ t mention that ; it hasn ’ t happened in petersburg ; the devil take it !
both had stated their positions earlier in different ways , but the direct confrontation between them in had all the features of a quarrel
but the point is that this is not just his personal ideal , but the ideal that was cherished by the young generation before turgenev 's bazarov and after him and which was embodied , not only by various characters in stories and novels , but also by real people who endeavored to base their actions and words on bazarovism
there was a burst of laughter and even some cursing
he managed to force him to take the glass of water in his hand
but the thirst for activity has reached the final , extreme point in him
she wanted to ask if at least his landlady was home , but she didn ’ t say anything
only the heart is necessary , the ability to sacrifice one 's egoism—one can not even speak of a calling here ( not to mention mr v d s decoration )
from the lack of restraint in their mode of address , bazarov observed to arkady ,
he didn ’ t meet any passersby or cabs along the prospect
no one will accuse you of having the intention or of complicity , especially since it was you who discovered the banknote by turning her pockets inside out , which means you had no idea of it beforehand
it was apparent that she was deeply moved , that she very much wanted to express something , to say something , to defend katerina
she could concede a great deal , agree to many things , even those that contradicted her convictions , but there was always a limit to her honesty , her rules , and her deepest convictions that no circumstances would ever force her to cross
all this isn ’ t the point
but what am i thinking ?
of course , he was late for the funeral , but he would get there in time for the wake , and there , right now , he would see sonya
jesus saith unto her , i am the resurrection and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live
but he scraped up some dirt and pressed it around the bottom of the block with his foot
he killed to rob them , and he did so ; he took the money and several items
you know , avdotya romanovna , you ’ re terribly like your brother in all sorts of ways !
however , it ’ s horrid to have to explain all this
the process of these thoughts remains in the shadows ; i doubt whether turgenev was in a position to render the description of this process : in order to portray it , he would have had to live through it in his own head , he would have had to himself become bazarov , but we can be sure that this did not happen to turgenev , because anyone who had even once , even for a few minutes , looked at things through bazarov 's eyes would have remained a nihilist for the rest of his life
i want to work , so please do not disturb me
he picked up his candle in annoyance to go out and find that ragged fellow , no matter what , and get out of there as soon as possible
and how did he throw it ?
meanwhile , at the time he ’ d proposed to dunya , he ’ d been completely convinced of the absurdity of all the rumors , which had been publicly refuted by marfa petrovna herself and long since discarded by the entire town , which had vindicated dunya
the officer asked with a laugh
he started up the stairs on this hunch
or or i dare not go on
the exchanges between him and pyotr stepanovich about the forthcoming revolution are a delight : pyotr stepanovich picked up his hat and rose to his feet
were you out of your mind when you signed it ?
for a minute or so he stared at her expressive and sickly little face ; then he kissed the portrait and handed it to dunya
why not say it ?
katerina ivanovna began laughing hysterically
as if i have made extensive preparations !
he , too , repeated bazarov with a humble bow
the noise coming from behind the door suddenly increased , and the door opened slightly
svidrigaylov stared into raskolnikov ’ s eyes and all of a sudden , after a short pause , lowered his voice and asked :
bazarov , in this passage , sees himself amidst red dogs : but in a position radically different from his earlier stature as hunter ( okhotnik )
suddenly he removed his arm , turned away , walked rapidly to the window , and stood in front of it
well , and then what ?
he took items worth ten or twenty rubles , stuffed them into his pocket , searched around in the old woman ’ s trunk , among her clothes—but later , in her dresser , in a box in the top drawer , they find fifteen hundred rubles in cash , plus some notes !
that is to say , they ought to be reduced to a state of exhaustion by the constant repetition of one and the same words ) ; and yet , to tell the truth , he does not give complete satisfaction either to the refined gentry , who talk with chic or with melancholy of the emancipation ( pronouncing it as though it were french ) , nor to the uncultivated gentry , who unceremoniously curse tha ' amuncipation
that 's all i care about
it was polyenka ; she was running after him and calling to him , wait !
has he had anything to eat ?
'that 's not our business first one must clear the ground
but how to end it ?
you see what i am doing : it turns out there 's empty space in my suitcase and i am stuffing hay into it
the fact that i came ?
the outlook of the woman-as-nihilist has been differentiated here from that of the woman-as-radical whom we shall encounter in the following chapter
it was not at all clear how that certificate of merit had suddenly turned up in her hands , the one that the late marmeladov had mentioned to raskolnikov , explaining to him in the tavern that katerina ivanovna , his wife , had done the shawl dance in the presence of the governor and other distinguished people at the institute graduation ball
although , this isn ’ t the way it ’ s done
i bet you will !
it would be another matter if there were witnesses here ; but we ’ re all alone , whispering to each other
at first bazarov stirred in his bed , then replied , my boy , i can see you are still a fool
you know , i won ’ t go see porfiry ; i ’ m fed up with him
and what am i to believe in ?
last year , there was one moment when
- ; martin malia , alexander herzen and the birth of russian socialism , j-j
i ’ m even glad other people are here
you have not forgotten your german ?
all because of me !
the head clerk , however , interested him greatly : he tried to guess something about him from his face , to penetrate to his core
i was not playing , arkady began and then fell silent
i let the chance slip by !
if they ’ d had that brainless idea , they ’ d have tried with all their might to conceal it and hide their cards so they could catch you afterward
marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dunechka in the garden
but it was clever of me to bring up the idea of the apartment : it ’ ll be useful later on !
they consider him a suspect in the murder !
i won ’ t go simply on principle , so as not to participate in this vile superstition , that ’ s what !
once for some reason they lingered quite a while ; nikolai petrovich went out to meet them in the garden and , upon approaching the arbor , suddenly overheard the rapid footsteps and voices of the two young men
true life is not lived where great external changes take
it would not be a bad idea to have something to eat , observed bazarov , stretching himself and sinking down on the sofa
but the lesson , the lesson you gave him today at the crystal palace ’ was beyond perfection !
and the consultation began
the point was that he ’ d also found out that among the invited guests would be raskolnikov
bazarov 's role as unmasker is here jovial , masculine , insinuating—but it is a frivolous rehearsal of more serious destruction
some demanded payment of their accounts or an increase ; others left , even after receiving their wages in advance ; horses fell ill ; harnesses were worn out in no time at all ; tasks were performed carelessly ; the threshing machine ordered from moscow turned out to be useless because of its enormous weight ; another machine was ruined the very first time it was used ; half the cattle shed burned down
and yet what richness of simple human feeling !
i read his journal article about people to whom everything is permitted
bazarov scents an enemy , and takes deliberate pleasure in describing himself and his allies as 'nihilists ' , by which he means no more than that he , copyright ® isaiah berlin , first published by oxford university press
my children have remained with their aunt ; they ’ re well off , and they don ’ t need me at all
he suddenly cried inadvertently
there must be more to it
to hell with it !
odintsova summoned an elderly aunt to live with them and reconciled herself to a wasted life
if he weren ’ t still lying there in a real fever , then perhaps it was precisely because this constant inner anxiety was keeping him on his feet for the time being and aware , at least artificially
it ’ s all so stupid , even loathsome to a person who has nothing to do with it !
i swore that i wouldn ’ t argue !
you seem to be trying to infuriate me on purpose , so that i ’ ll leave you alone
all these rumors reached her , but perhaps an unwanted pregnancy
what a splendid man !
bazarov left and arkady was overcome by a joyous feeling
if he hasn ’ t said so up to now , naturally it ’ s because that ’ s what he intends even without words ; but i ’ ll refuse
the sound of horses ' hooves rang out along the road a peasant appeared from behind some trees
this unfortunate lizaveta was so simple , so helpless , and so terrified once and for all , that she didn ’ t even raise her arms to protect her face , although that would have been the most necessary and natural gesture at that moment , because the axe was raised right above her face
and , as luck would have it , the peasants they passed were all in tatters and riding pathetic nags ; the roadside willows stood , bark torn and branches broken , like beggars in rags ; emaciated , shaggy cows , mere bags of bones , gnawed greedily on the grass growing along ditches
but true patriotism has nothing in common with this arrogant , conceited aloofness which leads only to self-deception , ignorance and irremediable errors
have you by any chance read livingstone ’ s journal ? †
and what will become of them ?
of course , that ’ s how it must be

we could even sing marlborough s ’ en va-t-en guerre , # since it ’ s a genuine children ’ s song and is sung in all aristocratic homes when they ’ re putting the children to sleep :
'these two representatives of two utterly opposed schools of thought were manifestly in accord on one point , morally linked for an instant by a common sorrow , by a very sincere and poignant grief at finally parting with a compatriot whom both alike could admire and esteem
this was organized with the civil servant ’ s efforts ; even the policeman helped carry katerina ivanovna
bazarov is the rare example of a turgenev character who lacks not only a pre-history , but to whom the writer never applies introspection ( ie , an authorial explanation and testing of his subjective world ) at those points where bazarov 's position—his past and future—is in question ( yet such introspection is applied to his experience of love !
it was his first endeavor , i tell you , his first
the doctor ’ s more useful , much more
bazarov did not get up at all that day and spent the whole night in a heavy , semiconscious torpor
not in the least !
you say he 's not indifferent to me , and it 's always seemed to me that he liked me
in our territory , began porfiry , extending both hands to him
after this first meeting with odintsov , bazarov endeavors to speak of her in his former jocular tone , but the very cynicism of his expressions belies an involuntary , repressed respect
it ’ s obvious , ob-vi-ous that something ’ s not right here , cried the young man , and he set off down the stairs at a run

raskolnikov continued examining him in silence
she was sitting on a bench , wearing a white kerchief on her head as usual ; next to her lay a large heap of red and white roses still wet from the dew
what symptoms of infection , evgeny ?
well , handsome or not , observed vasily ivanovich , still a man , as they say , ommfay
for people without exceedingly vivid imaginations , these wistful upward looks do not make the tea any tastier
it is not creation
here ’ s what you consider most important : is the man spending the money or not ?
he will continue to ask the question until he dies , and his preoccupation , usually just below the surface though sometimes bursting forth in bitter outrage , will be expressed in the imagery of disease or death , which first enters his consciousness and conversation in the moment we have witnessed : a splendid body !
she , with the help of some money left to her by svidrigaylov , had long ago planned and been preparing herself to follow the band of convicts in which he would also be sent into exile
as he left , raskolnikov managed to shove his hand into his pocket , grab the change left from the ruble he ’ d cashed at the tavern , and place it on the windowsill unobserved
an almost cheerful katerina ivanovna whispered to raskolnikov again
the last twenty-five pages are of an incomparable elevation and intensity , worthy of tolstoy and dostoevsky , and in some respects , particularly in their blend of tragic power and a mute underlying sweetness , superior to them
when zosimov , having pointed to him , had said , there ’ s raskolnikov , he ’ d suddenly and quickly raised himself , as if jumping up , and sat on the edge of his bed ; in an almost challenging voice , but also faltering and faint , he said :
well , sir , i ’ m at your service
to vasilievsky island , i ’ m going to razumikhin , that ’ s where , right now
mikolka stands on one side and begins to strike her back for no reason
and , without extending his hand , he left him
if you ’ d seen it , you might have given away the money , too
then i had dinner and went to see porfiry
it ’ s when it has no way of getting out and it ’ s trying to clog your liver ; you begin seeing things
just so , i have to , he replied vaguely , as if hesitating in what he really wanted to say
nikodim fomich was talking heatedly to ilya petrovich , and some of their words reached his ears :
he was a close friend of turgenev 's [ editor ]
now she was no longer hiding ; both her eyes were open wide : they enveloped him with a fiery and shameless look , they beckoned him , laughing
even if mr luzhin were made of the purest gold or solid diamond , even then she wouldn ’ t agree to become mr luzhin ’ s legal concubine !
i know this , ma ’ am
your career is a scholarly one , and you won ’ t be dislodged by failures !
but when he reached konnogvardeisky boulevard , where two days ago he had encountered that young woman , his laughter suddenly vanished
sonechka was embarrassed , and bowed somewhat hastily and fearfully , even with some painful sensation reflected in her face , as if she found avdotya romanovna ’ s politeness and thoughtfulness burdensome and distressing
give me that bundle , nastenka
forgive me that i began speaking of it ; i think about it all the time , and i can ’ t sleep at night
zametov remarked , then paused , as if suddenly struck by a thought that passed through his mind like a bolt of lightning
you ’ re a reasonable man
did you really doubt that ?
he and they regarded each other with distrust and hostility
mitrei hadn ’ t seen him since and was finishin ’ up the work alone
i have received a pleasant letter from maykov and will answer him
after seeing , began the tradesman , that the caretakers wouldn ’ t listen to me and go to the police , because , they said , it was already too late , and perhaps he ’ d get angry that they hadn ’ t come right away , i felt irritated and couldn ’ t sleep , and i started to make inquiries
someone behind her spat out
for the last hour and a half they had vied with each other in interrogating nastasya , who was still standing before them and had already managed to tell them all there was to know
after returning from the haymarket , he threw himself down on his sofa and sat there motionless for a whole hour
oh , evgeny , do not say things like that !
suddenly , far off , about two hundred steps away , at the end of the street , in the thickening darkness , he made out a crowd , voices , shouting
if the earrings , which turned up in nikolai ’ s hands on that very day and at that time , really constitute the most important factual evidence against him—though perfectly explicable according to his own testimony , consequently , still disputable evidence—then one must consider the exculpatory evidence , all the more so since there are irresistible facts
twenty years bazarov 's idols too will be replaced
the thought alone offends them ; they brush away the truth until the person they ’ ve so embellished rubs their noses in it with his own hands
however , he sometimes asked permission to be present at bazarov 's experiments , and once even brought his sweet-smelling face , washed with the finest of soaps , close to the microscope to see how transparent infusoria swallow green specks of dust and carefully chew them using some very efficient little devices in their throat
she cried , throwing up her hands
one extremely insignificant circumstance landed him in an impasse , even before he went down the stairs
take an axe to ’ er , that ’ s what !
another bird flown the coop ’ !
evgeny , you will take my study , of course
i shall endeavor to organize this material and , if i succeed , i shall explain why our old people will not come to terms with us , why they shake their heads and , depending on the individual and the mood , are angry , bewildered , or quietly melancholy on account of our deeds and ideas
she read his article over and over , even read it aloud sometimes , practically slept with it ; still , she hardly inquired as to where exactly rodya was now , in spite of the fact they were obviously avoiding that subject with her—that fact alone should have aroused her suspicions
nothing could correspond so well as this to the simplicity and straight forwardness of the view bazarov professes
and , setting aside all vanity , it also seems to me that they are farther from the truth than we are ; but at the same time , i feel they have something we lack , some advantage over us youth ?
she thought , lying in her magnificent bed on lace cushions under a light silk coverlet anna sergeevna had inherited from her father a share of his penchant for luxury
in addition , raskolnikov ’ s long-standing hypochondria was precisely affirmed by many witnesses , including dr zosimov , his former university colleagues , his landlady , and her servant
you must stay a while : it really is not too bad here
i bet you suppose that i ’ m now trying to worm myself into your good graces !
open that window it 's stuffy in here
there is no occupation , no love—consequently , there is no pleasure either
even when you were living at home ?
finding in turgenev merely beauty , it is inevitable that mirsky concludes by saying , we do not seek wisdom [ in turgenev ]
but from what i know now , i clearly see that i can ’ t understand a thing ; please , don ’ t think i came to interrogate you
how should i know if they ’ re broke or not ?
she ’ s an absolutely extraordinary character , absolutely !
what scientific means in his value system can be gathered from its opposite , the set of conventions and beliefs bazarov castigates as romantic : romantic means puskin , it means literature , it means metaphors
but i have not been here for some time
he listened in inexpressible agitation as this man , who had seen right through him , disavowed his own words
why , there 's someone over there
he even chuckled to himself , as another distressing idea suddenly rushed into his head
evdoksiya rolled a cigarette with her tobacco-stained fingers , licked the edge of it with her tongue , sucked on it , and then lit it
why do you like apples ? —also by virtue of our sensations
has this house been here long ?
turgenev , in other words , is the literary equivalent of the proverbial dumb blonde
judging from that remark , one can really suppose that you were counting on our helplessness , dunya observed irritably
i ’ ve already mentioned that petr petrovich is now heading to petersburg
well , you should know that i feel no love for her now , none at all ; i even think it strange that i experienced something before
how could we have done without that ?
this was relief from another , more somber and gloomy feeling , one he himself was unable to define in all its force
what kind of music do you prefer ?
and roared as loud as he could , pointing his finger at him—the young man suddenly stopped and violently grabbed his own hat
and three days later , as the friends are driving to odintsova 's estate : 'congratulate me , bazarov suddenly exclaimed , 'today is june nd , my guardian angel 's day
forty years later , in his famous 'poem in prose ' entitled porog ( on the threshold ) , which for prince peter kropotkin was an expression of tur-genev 's 'admiration of those women who gave their lives for the revolutionary movement ' , he celebrated the self-sacrifice of the russian girl who stands on the threshold of a life devoted to revolutionary endeavour , faces the consequences and yet decides to cross the threshold :
und zis nein respectable guest , herr kapitän , makes ze big shkandal !
that ’ s not exactly what i was talking about , petr petrovich , dunya interrupted with some impatience
ah , hello , old man , cried bazarov
to p v annenkov
but he wasn ’ t destined to reach the islands , either : something else occurred
in some drunkards this habit becomes a necessity , primarily among those who receive harsh treatment at home and who are ordered about
someone else in his place , for example , would have been a constant drag on his parents
did i want to abuse bazarov or to extol him ?
katerina ivanovna went to the window , leaned her head against the frame , and cried desperately :
well , if it ’ s siberia—he ’ ll go and i suppose that you ’ ll follow him
of course , they ’ ll be talking about family matters
oh , you stupid girl !
in the ranks of bazarov 's admirers there will undoubtedly be those who will be enraptured by his coarse manners , the vestiges of student life , who will imitate these manners , which are , in any case , a shortcoming and not a virtue , who will perhaps even exaggerate his harshness , gracelessness , and abruptness
raskolnikov asked clumsily , trying hard to look him in the eye ; but he was unable to endure it and suddenly added , i asked only because there were probably many people who ’ d pawned things
he stood on the stairs for some time and watched grimly as his friend walked off quickly in the direction of his street
there ’ s no hurry , there ’ s plenty of time , sir , and all this is mere nonsense , sir !
she cried suddenly , her eyes flashing
he couldn ’ t recall a thing : was he really thinking about anything at that time ?
they were both still wearing their costumes : he in his turban and she in her nightcap with the ostrich feather
his heart was pounding , and his thoughts were violently agitated
i don ’ t understand you very well
he slammed the top of the case shut and stood up from the floor
an awakened fly suddenly bumped into the windowpane and began buzzing plaintively
she says that it would be better , that is , not exactly better , but for some reason it would be absolutely necessary that rodya also deliberately come today at eight o ’ clock and that they meet without fail
do you know what zosimov whispered to me just now as we were leaving ?
what do you mean , 'why ' ?
then they turned her loose onto the street
—which are not science at all , but journalism , materialist propaganda
what does she want ?
pulkheriya aleksandrovna suddenly let drop
bazarov is not only an empiricist , he is also an uncouth rowdy in the ranks of youth likes to express itself in various extravagant conceits and to strike the imagination with infinitely large images
pavel petrovich twitched his mustache
he was tormented by something else , much more important , extraordinary—about himself and no one else , but something different , something major
but it was impossible to be in any other relationship with razumikhin
i ’ ll take you there , it ’ s true , and i ’ ll show you my fiancée , but not now ; you ’ ll have to leave soon
it says something for the vitality of his creation that the debate did not die even in the following century , neither before nor after the russian revolution
what was the cause of it , for god 's sake ?
this is what one critic writes , reviewing the latest translation that appeared in riga ( [ ? ]
it would have been better if you ’ d come tomorrow !
and just where have you been spending your time ?
will we find him at home ?
but what do you think , is she , in fact— oh ho ho !
the contemporary will probably treat me with contempt because of bazarov and will not believe that during the whole time i was writing i was involuntarily attracted to him
we ’ re friends now ; we see each other almost every day
at least she fully restored dunechka ’ s honor
do i love her ?
or what about one for the road ? —and , after consuming one for the road , he did not spare the horses
yellowish , dirty , worn wallpaper was blackened in all the corners ; it must have been damp and smoky during the winter
his mother ’ s face glowed with ecstasy and happiness at the sight of this definitive , nonverbal reconciliation between brother and sister
perhaps you ’ ll hear my name sometime
did you go out yesterday ?
the sickly romanticism and sentimentality are gone
he might not even have foreseen the obstacles he ’ d encounter !
she was very devout and emotional , believing in all sorts of omens , fortune-telling , charms , and dreams ; she believed in holy fools , house spirits , forest spirits , unlucky meetings , the evil eye , folk remedies , maundy salt , and the imminent end of the world ; she believed that if on easter sunday the candles did not go out during the midnight service , there would be a good buckwheat harvest , and if a person looked at a mushroom , it would not grow any bigger ; she believed the devil liked to be near water , and that every jew carried a bloodstain on his chest ; she was afraid of mice , snakes , frogs , sparrows , leeches , thunder , cold water , drafts of air , horses , goats , redheaded people , and black cats ; she regarded crickets and dogs as unclean animals ; she did not eat veal , pigeon , crayfish , cheese , asparagus , artichokes , rabbit , or watermelon because a cut watermelon reminded her of the head of john the baptist ; and she could not mention oysters without shuddering
st petersburg is situated along the shores of the neva bay of the gulf of finland and on islands in the river delta
but i didn ’ t want to give them to her
you sent for them !
† russians often sweeten their tea by placing a lump of sugar between their teeth and drinking tea through it
so my brother just dropped in on you ?
after our conversation i reread pisarev 's article on bazarov , which i had completely forgotten , and i am very glad of it ; that is , not that i had forgotten it , but that i reread it
both fathers and sons believe in great deeds , they merely disagree about what deeds are great
it was still light , but evening was already setting in
ah , what shameful things occur nowadays in this world , oh lord !
well , let ’ s get down to business !
you were able to do it
petr petrovich asked , turning to zosimov
that dog 's in here again , the old woman muttered in reply
good lord , what is it ?
your prayer , perhaps , will be heard
katerina ivanovna rushed to lebezyatnikov
we thought you ’ d definitely come
he paused on each landing and looked around with curiosity
he did , no doubt , adopt a different tone in writing to different correspondents
he was an unusually cheerful and sociable fellow , good-natured to the point of innocence
he will be delighted , of course !
we ’ re heading for nevsky prospect
bazarov 's brief meeting with the radicals is a fine bit of horseplay , their emptyheaded chatter being matched only by his declaration , as preposterous as it is pathetic : i do not adopt anyone 's ideas ; i have my own
the peasant tugged at the reins
sofiya semyonovna was trying their mourning clothes on them
we must live while we are alive , eat dry bread if there is no roast beef , know many women if it is not possible to love a woman , and , in general , we must not dream about orange trees and palms , when under foot are snowdrifts and the cold tundra
katya gave arkady a bright and serious look and , after a long pause for thought , with scarcely a smile , said , yes
by the way , do you like schiller ?
he cried , clenching his fists and laughing , his lips foaming with rage
evgeny vasilich , why are you
but just you try to deal with passions , sir , passions , because even an examining magistrate is a human being , sir
who , who on earth would ever think of searching under that stone ?
it seems that he wants to take some sort of exam , but only to talk and brag about it here , that ’ s all there was to it
nature 's not a temple , but a workshop where man 's the laborer
we knew them , sir , and i begin worryin ’ about them earrin ’ s because we knew that the dead woman lent money for pledges
bazarov came in to see him around eight o'clock the next morning
what must we do ?
it ’ s better that way
i had been abroad before and had always found it sickening
said his mother , overjoyed
anna sergeevna did not want to get in the young couple 's way , and it was only out of a sense of propriety that she did not leave them alone for too long
no , i will stick around for a while yet
be careful , remarked anna sergeevna , porfiry platonych and i will beat you
if this whole affair was carried out consciously , and not in some foolish manner , if i really had a definite and definitive goal , then how is it that up to this point i didn ’ t even peek into the purse and don ’ t know how much i ’ ve taken ?
let me alone , i ’ ll do it myself , raskolnikov said ; he took the pen and signed the book
well , what do you think , is she— ooh là là , or not ?
she also had the habit of not listening to what other people said
i maintain a negative attitude , he says , by virtue of my sensations ; i like to deny—my brain 's made on that plan , and that 's all !
of course you do
here—it was either her road or his
but , after a very short spell of such marital bliss , marya suddenly died
arkady felt sad at having to part from her : he had so enjoyed spending nearly an hour with her !
soon dunya was invited to give lessons in several households , but she refused
git in , i ’ ll take ya all !
well then , am i being open with you or not ?
people are obsessed with debauchery
i didn ’ t exchange a word with zametov
the door to the larger room could be locked ; svidrigaylov felt at home in this little room and may have spent entire days in it
at sonya ’ s entrance razumikhin , who was seated on one of raskolnikov ’ s three chairs , at once stood up next to the door to let her pass
but now i have come to know him better and am convinced he 's clever the main thing is , he 's young , so young not like you and me , evgeny vasilich
it ’ s astonishing that he ’ s come to , the doctor whispered softly to raskolnikov
she erupted in a spell of coughing
but dunya and her husband could derive little joy from this news , especially at the beginning
are you acquainted with her ?
there was no doubt that she was dead
the country road that ran past the tavern was always so dusty and black
for the moment , that ’ s quite unnecessary
but i am surprised that up to now you have not found what you are looking for
but he didn ’ t heed it and began listening at the door to the old woman ’ s apartment : dead silence
he won ’ t understand anything , not one thing !
he had a rather soft heart , but his speech was self-assured , and at times even extremely arrogant—which , when compared to his slight figure , almost always appeared comical
nothing at present , most esteemed sir , replied bazarov
you know something , katerina sergeevna ?
but now , am i happy now ?
isn ’ t it terrible that you live in this filth that you despise and , at the same time , you yourself know ( all you have to do is open your eyes ) that you ’ re not helping anyone and not saving anyone from anything !
[ the contemporary was a leading periodical , in which the ideas repeated by bazarov appeared—
if i leave a particular gentleman all alone : if i don ’ t arrest him and don ’ t disturb him , but if he knows at every hour and every minute , or at least if he suspects , that i know everything , all there is to know , and that i ’ m following him day and night , watching him constantly , and if he feels the weight of my conscious suspicion and fear , well then , he ’ s absolutely certain to lose his head
nothing much : tea , vodka , and herring
is he a writer , then ?
two or three customers were drinking tea , and in one distant room a group of four was sitting , sipping champagne
also in the prison were some exiled poles , political prisoners
he sat down at the green card table , an expression of moderate satisfaction on his face , and ended up winning two rubles fifty copecks in paper money from bazarov : in arina vlasevna 's house there was no notion whatever of reckoning in silver
replied dunya , affectionately and awkwardly turning to him
meanwhile , he ’ d very much like and is hoping to arrange a meeting with you , dunya , and he ’ s asked me to serve as an intermediary
she was an extremely quarrelsome and disorderly german woman
pavel petrovich shuddered slightly and grabbed his thigh
let me have something to drink
you will agree , pavel petrovich , our duel is so unusual as to be ridiculous ?
both kotlyarevsky ( kanun , ) and koni ( peterburg , ) date the appearance of the new women in public at the beginning of the 's
besides , you and i are antiquated people
for some time they measured each other with their glances
his flabby , wrinkled face indicated that he was over fifty ; his small , swollen eyes looked grim , stern , and discontented
you are a good fellow , but , all the same , you are nothing but a soft , beautifully bred , liberal boy
i am saying plainly that you and i behaved very foolishly
vasily ivanovich said , raising his hand in military salute to the greasy skullcap covering his head
katerina ivanovna nodded at the landlady
passing the yusupov garden , he was about to consider the idea of placing tall fountains there , thinking how well they would refresh the air in all the squares
pavel petrovich took his walking stick
mama , he said firmly and insistently , this is sofiya semyonovna marmeladova , the daughter of that unfortunate mr marmeladov who was run over by horses yesterday before my very eyes and about whom i told you already
but this heteroglossia , as we have said , is also diffused throughout the authorial speech that surrounds the characters , creating highly particularized character zones [ zony geroev ]
the road to the right led into town , and from there toward home ; the road to the left led to odintsova 's
another terrible minute passed
but this question is not obsessive ; rather it provides a transition to the one consideration which can make the question of when
she kept losing blood but was beginning to regain consciousness
let them devour each other alive—what ’ s it to me ?
the young man was very pleased when he didn ’ t encounter any of them and managed to slip unnoticed right through the gates and directly onto the staircase
why didn ’ t you ask ?
your papa was a state councillor and almost became a governor ; there was only one step left , so everyone came to him and said , we already think of you , ivan mikhailych , as our governor
dunya raised the revolver and , looking deathly pale , her lower lip blanched and trembling , regarded him with her large black eyes flashing like fire ; she was determined , measuring the distance between them , and awaiting the first move on his part
do you know what ?
even now i am not too sure i am expressing myself clearly
the most fully portrayed female character in the novel and the one most responsible for bazarov 's downfall from his ideological heights into the abyss of romanticism , anna odintsova , seems to be the odd one out with respect to kristeva 's scheme of temporality
stay here , petr petrovich , said dunya
i have to go
vasily ivanovich expressed his regret that no one had thought of seeking medical assistance sooner and declared that there was no hope of saving him
his shirtfront protruded from under his heavy cotton vest , all wrinkled , soiled , and stained
¶¶ you have the most beautiful eyes , / girl , what more do you want ?
razumikhin thought for a moment and ran to catch up with him
there have been many economic changes , zosimov observed
we kept urging her to calm down all the way to your doorstep
is he always so irritable ?
he raised his head
into a bank office with counterfeit notes , where they know all the tricks of the trade—no , i ’ d get frazzled
it was apparent that he had the friendliest intentions
i know all this now
we coldly and soberly regard all that surrounds us ; let us regard ourselves just as coldly and soberly ; all around us is nonsense and backwardness , but , god knows , we are far from perfect
i hope you will not doubt that every word in it , every letter , is true
today your father said he 's received an invitation from your illustrious relative
are you clever , lying here like a sack , with nothing to show for it ?
) —she spoke suddenly , then stopped and shook back her hair
why do you think so , why ?
because as far as i can tell , you have a cold , serene manner ; one must have passion to argue
because it takes place shortly after pavel petrovich has survived the duel with bazarov
the narrator feels the same way
please don ’ t create a disturbance
it seems that zosimov was afraid of something exactly like this
if we understand turgenev 's novel that way , then , perhaps the moral we are seeking will also be disclosed to us more clearly
that ’ s why i ’ m especially grateful to you , rodion romanych , that you didn ’ t disdain my hospitality , even in such circumstances , she added almost aloud
you remember her , laviza ivanovna ?
raskolnikov awoke in a sweat , his hair drenched from perspiration ; he was panting and raised himself up on his elbows in horror
it had been established by sonya , who faithfully wrote letters each month to petersburg , addressed to razumikhin , and she faithfully received a reply back from petersburg each month
in particular he emphasized the fathers ' activity in publishing , at home and abroad , and their salutary effect on social development in russia
polya , lyonya , kolya , come here
was it you i didn ’ t recognize when i was delirious ?
† porokh = gunpowder , hence the lieutenant ’ s nickname
ah , arkadi , do me a favor , let 's have a fight , a real fight , till we are laid out in our coffins , till we destroy each other
but no one had noticed him , and he didn ’ t happen to run into anyone
can i really , really
there may be something to it
well then , are you afraid of the bourgeois shame ?
well then , when you were composing your little article—could it possibly be the case , heh-heh , that you might also have considered yourself , even the tiniest bit , to be an extraordinary ’ man uttering some new word , in the sense that you ’ re using it
marmeladov was in his last agony
however , you know my opinions in general ; i don ’ t blame anyone definitively
at some points in his description of fenichka , arkady , and katya , he seems not only to admire those values but even to be jealous of them
well , didn ’ t i say that there was a common bond between us , eh ?
two kinds of love are debated in fathers and sons
sonya rushed to the door in a fright
raskolnikov didn ’ t learn about his mother ’ s death for a long time , although a correspondence with petersburg was instituted at the very beginning of his exile in siberia
then i acted stupidly again
after finding out everything yesterday , i went today
he says to the boy
from their simple hearts there seem to be torn infinitely sad hymns , some sort of limitlessly deep and tender outcries that irresistibly touch the soul
that awaits us there is covered in mist
or else , i also began to think
everything ’ s been said and forgiven
i was counting on your character at the time , rodion romanych , on your character most of all , sir !
is it you saying this , pavel ?
think and analyze superstitions and authorities are shattered and their world view becomes completely devoid of various illusory notions
he asked , as if annoyed
i don ’ t need any
we saw , they said , that the apartment was open , and that someone must have been working there , but in passing we didn ’ t pay any attention and don ’ t recall precisely whether there were workers inside at the time
well , only because avdotya romanovna herself , voluntarily , was the one to choose him
of course , even if he ’ d had to wait years for a convenient opportunity , even then , having a plan , it would most likely have been impossible to reckon on a more apparent step toward fulfilling his plan than that which had suddenly been presented now
a healthy person , naturally , has no need to see them because he ’ s primarily a being of this earth ; therefore , he must live only his earthly life , for fullness ’ sake and for orderliness
( raskolnikov had made no such remark )
but more than anything else on earth , he loved and treasured his own money , earned by his hard work and other means : it made him the equal of everything above him
true , all this is obscure ; the testimony came from another german lady , an inveterate liar whose word had no credibility ; finally , in the end , no formal charge was brought , thanks to marfa petrovna ’ s efforts and money ; it was all limited to rumors
he was absolutely convinced that at that time he had been wrong about many things , for example , the time and sequence of several events
raskolnikov ’ s motionless and serious face was transformed in one moment , and he suddenly burst into the same nervous laughter as before , as if he were absolutely unable to restrain himself
raskolnikov got very angry ; he suddenly wanted to insult this fat dandy
if you ’ d conceived of another theory , you might even have done something a hundred million times worse !
i should think not !
i ’ ve been watching you : what a busybody you are , remarked zosimov
right here on my finger
said it in an impartial way
in a few moments of condescension or irritation or even unkindness by the sons , in nikolai kirsanov 's hour of melancholy in the garden , in the disappointment of bazarov 's parents that his visit is so short
some burden seemed to have been lifted at once from his heart ; perhaps it wasn ’ t merely the fear of death ; it ’ s doubtful he felt it at that moment
you won ’ t admit it even if you really believe that miracles occur
how outrageous it is !
he listened intently , gloomily , and broodingly , leaning forward at the entrance , glancing curiously from the sidewalk into the room
with his grand manner of offering his cheek to be kissed , his fussy concern for his manuscript amerci ' and his self-proclaimed loyalty to everything german , karmazinov emerged as an attitudinizing , self-important littérateur who set great store by his reputation as the confidant of youth
porfiry also wants to make your acquaintance
no , there wasn ’ t
how , for example , your failure yesterday upsets you , exclaimed the tenderhearted andrey semyonych , once again feeling more strongly disposed to petr petrovich
in the final analysis turgenev could neither condemn nor yet wholly redeem bazarov without falsifying or diminishing the portrait
the iron plate had been added to give the pledge weight , so that at first the old woman wouldn ’ t guess that the object was made of wood
observing her , he noticed how pensive and distracted she was
he shook his boot off his foot
i ’ m very tired : it would be good to lie down or sit down somewhere soon !
do you have any cigarettes ?
then in your opinion there 's no difference between a stupid person and a clever one , between a good person and a bad one ?
it was impossible to find even one speck of dust in the whole place
service in approaching the nihilists and so forth
yes , sir , very good , sir
he becomes angry and sour because of his failure , it annoys him to think that happiness beckoned to him but then passed on and it annoys him to feel that this event has made an impression on him
no , you can tell them to take the samovar away , nikolai petrovich replied and stood up to meet her
the road to town does not pass anywhere near here
well , perhaps i am
the bright yellow wooden houses with their closed shutters looked glum and dirty
marfa petrovna made the arrangement a week before she died , and it was in my presence
a moment later , lebezyatnikov appeared on the threshold ; he didn ’ t enter the room , but paused , also with some particular curiosity , almost in astonishment ; he listened , though for a long time seemed not to understand anything
cried pavel petrovich ; he was positively unable to restrain himself any longer
it may be a good thing that he considers me almost insane , thought raskolnikov
well , any money for shoes or anything else , she ’ s purchased jamaican rum and even , it seems , madeira , and—and—and coffee
but here someone at the other end of the table suddenly started chuckling
but what ’ s it to you ?
i would rather go to my friend porokh : i ’ ll really surprise him , produce quite the effect on him
i beg you to think about what you ’ re saying , katerina ivanovna began haughtily ( she always employed a haughty tone of voice when she spoke with the landlady , so that she would remember her place , and even now she could not deny herself that pleasure )
# good-bye , my pleasure ( french )
and how could he decline it ?
and why did you try to deceive the caretakers and urge them to go to the police lieutenant ?
listen , razumikhin , raskolnikov began softly , apparently in complete calm
he went up to dunya and quietly put his arm around her waist
well , at least on that score you ’ ve somewhat reassured me
her sister , right after tea , had summoned her to the study and , after some preliminary compliments , which always frightened katya a bit , advised her to be more careful in her behavior with arkady and particularly to avoid private conversations with him , which had apparently been noticed by auntie and others in the household
he merely looked around with his mouth open wide , which aroused general merriment
buntuiushchee serdtse ne skrylos v mogile , tsvety , rastushchie na nei , bezmiatezhno gliadiat na nas svoimi nevinnymi glazami : ne ob odnom vechnom spokoistvii govoriat nam oni ,  torn velikom spokoistvii 'ravnodushnoi ' prirody ; oni govoriat takzhe 
these people are perhaps right in their destruction , but in their naive self-adoration or in their adoration of the type which they consider that represents , lies their limitation and one-sidedness
if she didn ’ t leave the room , the money must still be on her !
she silently raised her eyes and looked at him
he was just on his way home , probably drunk
the reasons that have prompted us
i ’ ll take the money and go away ; i ’ ll rent another apartment , and they ’ ll never find me !
but i never express my feelings in his presence because he does not like it
fathers and sons created in bazarov not only a general iconic image of the nihilist that immediately passed into use , he created as well an image of the extrascientific implications of physiology
almost an hour later , steps were heard in the corridor and there was another knock at the door
and , the day after tomorrow he 's giving a grand ball
shouldn ’ t i wait a little longer
you won ’ t find all that in my article ; it ’ s only hinted at there , raskolnikov said
+ reprinted by permission from the hudson review viii , no
about herself , sonya informed them that she had even been able to make several acquaintances and patrons in town ; that she ’ d found work as a seamstress , and since there were hardly any dressmakers in town , she had become essential in many houses ; but she didn ’ t mention that through her raskolnikov also received a certain amount of patronage from the authorities , that his workload was lightened , and so forth
where are my clothes ?
in the first place , it contradicts everything
he walked around the room , then all of a sudden approached her , hurriedly said ,
at last , he gestured contemptuously , entered the building , but stopped in the middle of the stairs
no , even better , i confess
common people get drunk , educated young people having nothing to do but burn with unrealizable dreams and fantasies and deform themselves with theories ; yids have flocked here from somewhere , they hoard all the money , while all the rest lead debauched lives
then he glanced around for the last time , crept up to the door , straightened his clothes , and adjusted the axe in its loop again
neuzheli liubov ' , sviataia , predannaia liubov , ne vsesil'na
you will find it warm here , eh ?
do you wish to interrogate me officially , with all the formalities ?
consider the case of terebeva ( who ’ s in the commune now ) ; she was criticized when she left her family and
she was almost entreating svidrigaylov ; she had forgotten all her fear
why don ’ t they moan ?
it suddenly became clear as day : how could it be that up to now not one person had dared or dares , while bypassing all this absurdity , simply to seize it by the tail and heave it to the devil ?
he had more important things on his mind
he should be pleased to see you , but you ’ re tormenting yourself , she added , her eyes flashing
i ’ ve already spent it all on drink , sir !
nevertheless , he still highly valued his resolve to elevate dunya to his own level and considered it a valiant feat
and i have bowed down
and now it 's back to my dogs once more
then , without even finishing , she threw herself at the public ; if she noticed someone who was decently dressed , she stopped to look and immediately began explaining to him , in her words , that this is what children from a respectable , one might even say aristocratic , home were reduced to
i have nothing to light my pipe
no , you won ’ t run away , rodion romanych
looking at zametov , he suddenly seemed to recall everything and pulled himself together
i do not think so
even the crying children quieted down
don ’ t pity ’ er , lads ; everyone , bring yer whips , git ready !
'there , i thought , 'at long last i have found a man !
she ’ s not even your real sister , but your half sister , and she ’ s got you under her thumb
don ’ t you feel sorry for her ?
he cried , as sonya had before
there ’ s no need , said raskolnikov , pushing the pen away
he took off his cap , put it on the table , and stood still for about ten minutes
you imagine you are progressive , but you are only fit to sit in some kalmuck 's cart !
but the meal passed rather smoothly
chekhov , recalled russian theater director nemirovich-danchenko in his memoirs , cried out almost in despair that russia must pay for its past , that colossal
not to rob or murder , don ’ t be alarmed , not for that
he had been wandering along the embankment of the yekaterinsky canal for about half an hour , perhaps even longer ; several times he looked at the staircases leading down to the water
the matter was clear
perhaps if herzen had been able to read kristeva 's essay on women 's time , he might have interpreted this passage somewhat differently
you should know that !
vasily ivanovich left arkady and returned to his study
i myself will come and ask to be crucified , for it ’ s not joy i seek , but sorrow and tears !
but , staring fixedly at his face , she suddenly blanched
katerina ivanovna shouted at him irritably
i can swear to that
he was a man already past fifty , of average height and solid build , with graying hair and a large bald spot , a yellow , even greenish face swollen by constant drunkenness , puffy eyelids under which shone , like little slits , tiny but animated small reddish eyes
there ’ s no need for that , sir
she went back home and took ill ; now she ’ s in a fever
ah , there ’ s my coat—they overlooked it !
no , rodion romanych , that dream is gone !
you thanked me and even shed some tears ( i ’ m relating everything as it happened in order , first , to remind you and , second , to show you that not the smallest detail has been erased from my memory )
for some reason he felt like chatting with everyone
i bow my head , since there is nothing to be done about it , but i want to say a few words in my defense , though i know how unseemly and pointless it is
according to his calculations , it seemed , they should have seized upon him at once
but with that superiority he has over those around him and as a result of their all feeling his strength , these characters themselves seek closer relations with him and involve him in a drama he did not at all want and did not even anticipate
i didn ’ t kill to acquire the means and power to become a benefactor of humanity
is this all possible ?
i don ’ t want raskolnikov talking about it there
no , i ’ m a student , the young man replied , in part surprised by the man ’ s particularly ornate speech , and by the fact that he ’ d been addressed so directly , so point-blank
but i ’ m not afraid of a beating
get up , get up !
and i would ’ ve thought
but the affair hadn ’ t begun
but think what you will ; now , for my part , i wish to make amends for that first impression and to prove that i ’ m a man with a heart and a conscience
so , i gave her my address ?
i ’ ll support you ; just scribble raskolnikov ’ for him ; take the pen , because , my friend , money ’ s now sweeter than syrup
cried katerina ivanovna ( in spite of the clear evidence ) ; she shook sonya in her arms like a child , kissing her repeatedly , catching hold of her hands and kissing them , too , almost devouring them
he knocked on the door ; his mother opened it
i must think about something else
divides her , so far as thought and feeling are concerned , from the husband with whom she used to fancy herself entirely in accord
you just astonished me , rodion romanych , though i knew before that it would be the case
just don ’ t talk to me as you did yesterday !
so , in your opinion , i seem strange ?
but then—that is , in the beginning of an acquaintance—as you yourself know , you ’ re always more superficial and foolish , you make mistakes and see what ’ s not there
yes , sir , i do wish , sir , and i will tell you definitively , sir , he continued , gently , amicably , taking raskolnikov by the arm , just above his elbow
you didn ’ t load it properly
he shouted to her from across the room
and there ’ s some beer left , half a bottle , and it ’ s cold
excuse me for bothering you with such nonsense , he continued , a bit disconcerted
raskolnikov paused , trying to remember
why , oh , why didn ’ t i know you before ?
how did he seem to you ?
the inn ( ) , at first glance a simple anecdote , is a philosophical novella centering on russian man and history , a work ( like on the eve or a king lear of the steppes ) that reveals turgenev 's affinity with the tragic outlook of the greeks
nikolai petrovich has become an arbitrator and works at it with all his might ; he 's constantly traveling throughout the district ; he delivers long speeches ( being of the opinion that peasants must be made to understand , that is , ie , after the emancipation of the serfs , which occurred in february
is it really the end ?
arkady was very surprised , even saddened ; but he did not think it necessary to say that ; he merely asked whether his uncle 's wound was serious or not
the debate is not over yet
finally , his appearance with a confession , at the very moment when the affair was becoming extraordinarily tangled as a result of the false testimony of the dejected fanatic ( nikolai ) and , besides that , when there were no clear clues pointing to the real criminal , or even any suspicions ( porfiry petrovich kept his word completely ) , all of this definitely facilitated the mitigation of the defendant ’ s fate
that type is drawn so delicately by you that its future judges will hardly be able to understand it completely
dunya dreams only about this
i do not reject them , he said
what does that mean ?
but his reply seemed credible ; the old woman took the pledge
i like watches like this , said dunya
( sonya was about to make some movement and began blushing )
no one said anything much about fenechka , who would just turned seventeen , and she was rarely seen : she lived quietly , modestly , and only on sundays turgenev 's text lists different ages for fenechka
you kept jumping up for no reason at all
i ’ ve already done just that , if you want to know
it was almost eleven o ’ clock , and even though at that time of year there ’ s no real night in petersburg , it was very dark at the top of the stairs
do you need him ?
in prison , in his surroundings , there was a great deal that he didn ’ t see , of course , and that he didn ’ t want to see
she cast her sickly but intense and penetrating glance at poor , trembling sonya , who was wiping the perspiration from her forehead with her scarf ; at last she asked to be raised up
the butler rendered polite assistance , but arkady would gladly have hit him or else burst into tears
besides , i ’ m a very candid man , sir
it ’ s strange , however : why do i hardly think about her , as if i hadn ’ t killed her ?
when he finally drew his last breath and the sound of universal lamentation filled the house , vasily ivanovich was overcome with sudden frenzy
her feelings , her sufferings , at least
then he crouched all the way down to the floor and glanced up at her face ; he took one look and froze in horror : the old woman was sitting there , laughing—she was overcome with quiet , inaudible laughter , trying with all her might to make sure he didn ’ t hear her
they were both silent
the other lady , very plump , had a dark red complexion with spots ; a distinguished woman , very elegantly attired , with a brooch the size of a saucer on her bosom , she stood off to one side , waiting
it ’ s simply feverish weakness , momentary delirium , he decided and he tore out the whole lining of his left trouser pocket
she asked , staring at raskolnikov once again , weighing the pledge in her hand
this dialectical frame makes possible the inclusion of an entire range of temporal visions within it—and just such a range appears , even as that range too is segmented and confined
roared razumikhin , but raskolnikov made no reply
he ’ s behaving like a scoundrel ; here , sir , just have a look at him : he ’ s a most attractive sight !
a half hour ago , we ’ d never seen each other , we considered ourselves enemies , with some unfinished business between us ; we left that matter behind , and now look at how far we ’ ve come !
a large crowd had gathered , and some policemen were standing in front of them
one night pavel petrovich endured a rather severe attack
it ’ s not possible , not possible !
he paused for a moment
a beautiful borzoi with a blue collar came running into the drawing room , paws tapping the floor , followed by a girl about eighteen , with black hair and dark skin , a roundish , but pleasant face , and small dark eyes
while valuing and , so to speak , adoring you , it ’ s possible that , at the same time , i may very much dislike a member of your family
but he didn ’ t know that my mother had come !
i hear the sound of people moving around
razumikhin also rose from his place
they take along a peasant woman , fat and ruddy
this common tendency to extrapolate bazarov 's story , it seems to me , points to a certain contradiction between the novelty of bazarov 's emptiness ( ie , his openness , his capacity , like the heroes of the late dostoevsky , to change sharply and abruptly ) on the one hand , and that characteristic framework in which it is confined
just wait a little
just wait and i ’ ll deceive you , too—ha , ha , ha !
get out , you scoundrel !
why can ’ t it happen ?
§ a dance associated with upper-class young ladies , especially those educated in socially desirable finishing schools
bazarov followed her quickly , without raising his eyes , merely catching the whispering and rustling sounds of her silk dress as it glided ahead of him
that 's how trained dogs dance on their hind legs
it ’ s gogol , the writer , who ’ s said to possess that trait to the highest degree , isn ’ t it ?
oh , arkady nikolaich , my friend !
continued petr petrovich , expanding on this conversation as if he had some purpose
he asked , turning to pavel petrovich , or shall i add a few more ?
but other people , before whom i all too deeply feel my insignificance , might utter the great words perissent nos noms , pourvu que la chose publique soit sauvée !
for some reason they wanted to have an autopsy performed , and i had not done one in a long time
the doctor had not expected that , was embarrassed and asked , wouldid your master hiccup before he died ?
i also used to order some books by mail
raskolnikov felt that some great weight had fallen upon him and was oppressing him
this is probably a conscious attempt to rival the well-known passage in virgil 's first eclogue and tennyson 's imitation of it :
if i have no value , then who needs my devotion ?
his nervous trembling had become somewhat feverish ; he even started shivering ; he felt a chill , in spite of the great heat
be quiet , sonya , be quiet !
simply to characterize that man or with some future goal in mind : to persuade me to look kindly on mr luzhin ?
let anyone you like search her !
well , enough , enough , arisha !
just see how frigid she 's made herself !
zeitung , thursday , june , supplement , page ) : the unprejudiced reader will be completely puzzled how the radical russian younger generation could become so frenzied about a representative of its convictions and strivings as turgenev depicted bazarov that it subjected turgenev to formal disgrace and covered him with abuse
i have to do something
they stop at crossroads and in front of shops
then he expressed his doubt that your studies at the university would allow you time to work in his office
then martha , as soon as she heard that jesus was coming , went and met him : but mary sat still in the house
she was always shy and suffered conversations and explanations with difficulty ; she was about forty , quite plump , with black brows and dark eyes ; she was kind as a result of her stoutness and slowness ; and she was even very pretty
for now you need only air , air , air !
he sweetened her up , muttered nastasya , with a cunning smile
no , to refrain would also be unnatural
how else can they tell you ’ re from a respectable family , you ’ re well-brought-up children , and not at all like all those organ grinders ; we ’ re not presenting some punch and judy show on the streets ; we ’ ll sing a few respectable romances
to show his zeal , when he would catch sight of nikolai petrovich from a distance , he would throw a stick at a passing piglet or threaten a half-naked urchin , but for the most part he just slept
svidrigaylov paid for the spoon , stood up , and left the garden
there 's no arrogance in you , no malice ; there 's only youthful audacity and youthful fervor ; that 's not commensurate to our task
in the terms i have been using , allen 's realists explore and endorse the prosaic view of life
so that ’ s what you ’ re driving at !
vodovozova ( na zare zhizni , d ed
he picked her up , carried her into his room , sat her on the bed , and began to undress her
that ’ s what you say , it seems , if i ’ m not mistaken ?
where is thy daughter who pitied her earthly father , a useless drunkard , and who was not dismayed by his beastliness ?
it is not the concrete incident in which his life is endangered which obsesses the death-haunted man ; it is the subliminal question , when and where , which accompanies him whether wandering noisy streets or lounging beneath a haystack
¶ cyrus was a persian ruler in the sixth century bce
alas , he didn ’ t really know how to express himself properly in russian ( not knowing , however , any other language ) , so now he was suddenly utterly exhausted , as if he had even wasted away following his lawyerly feat
odintsova stretched out both her arms , while bazarov pressed his forehead against the window
that was what woke him now as well
all of a sudden , an unexpected extraneous thought almost made him laugh :
we have become tired of the phrases of the hegelians , our heads have begun to spin from soaring around in the clouds , and many of us , having sobered up and come down to earth , have gone to the other extreme and while banishing dreaminess have started to persecute simple feelings and even purely physical sensations , like the enjoyment of music
but now i ’ m getting angry , and that just might be a fact !
and you , vasily ivanovich , are you sniveling , too ?
it was the landlady , amaliya fedorovna , who wouldn ’ t allow it ( darya frantsevna had previously encouraged her in this ) , as well as mr lebezyatnikov
why 's katya playing so late ?
that should have been done sooner ; now , as a matter of fact , even the caustic 's of no use
why , just today , for example , as we were going past our bailiff philip 's cottage—the one that 's so fine and white—
and just as he wondered about this , somewhere nearby , the soft sound of a wall clock , seeming to rush ahead , struck the hour of three
was it fate or some instinct that was bringing them together ?
perhaps , but he has a very kind heart
how come he hadn ’ t known that right away ?
how does it go ?
give them to me as a present , sonya , she says , please
the policeman told him that the unfortunate man had been caught in the wheel and dragged along the road for some thirty paces
he was very poor and somehow arrogantly proud and uncommunicative ; it was as if he were concealing something inside
at least , you are a god ; am not i a dolt then ?
an inveterate romantic may still be without egotism among us , but is this possible for the latest negator ?
at a merely anecdotal level , nothing could be simpler than to define relations between secenov and turgenev : each respected the other ; both at one time or another belonged to the circle around the journal so-vremennik ; both spent great stretches of time in germany and france absorbing the very latest ideas across a broad spectrum of interests , and both shared an almost british liberalism that made their politics appear slightly unreal or wildly eccentric to their more millenarian fellow slavs
i ’ m sure that no one would give even a baked onion for me , even if you threw in all my entrails , and that ’ s only if you were included in the bargain , too !
is that all you have to base your case on ?
dushkin continues : i know this here peasant mikolai dementev from his childhood ; he ’ s from our district and province , zaraysk , and i ’ m from ryazan
that ’ s the crux of the matter : she ’ s selling herself for her brother and for her mother !
to p v annenkov
they came upon little streams with cleared banks , tiny ponds with fragile dams , little villages with low peasant huts under dark roofs often missing half their thatch , small crooked threshing barns with walls of woven brushwood and gaping doorways beside abandoned threshing floors , and churches , some made of brick with the plaster falling off , others of wood with slanted crosses and overgrown cemeteries
no , that would be too clever !
left alone , sonya immediately began tormenting herself with fear at the thought that perhaps he really would commit suicide
blood , so much blood !
asked pulkheriya aleksandrovna , even more worried than before by his sudden , new , businesslike tone
and do not you tell me these fruits are insignificant : the worst dauber , un barbouilleur , a ballroom pianist who gets five copecks to play for an entire evening , all of them are more useful than you because they are representatives of civilization , not some primitive mongol force !
that is , what did you say about me ?
svidrigaylov was already sitting in the carriage
katerina ivanovna liked them very much ; she put one on and looked at herself in the mirror
what do i care about my hair ?
one ruffian was cursing another , and a very drunken fellow was sprawled out in the street
secondly , that the novel is preeminently the literary genre whose constitutive feature is an artistically organized diversity of social speech types , particularly fathers and sons in which the major thematic and structural emphasis is on the ideology of scientism as it is expressed in the speech practice of the nihilists
that 's family feeling showing itself , bazarov said serenely
excuse her , sir , said sonya , and she got up to leave once again
he dies stoically , wondering whether his country had any real need of him and men like him ; and his death is bitterly lamented by his old , humble , loving parents
petr petrovich said to himself , grinding his teeth ; and yet at the same time a desperate hope occurred to him once again : has this all really fallen through and is it over and done with once and for all ?
once again it was unbearably hot outside : if only there ’ d been a drop or two of rain these last few days
well then , so what if you have to join a different category of men ?
bazarov can not be both things at the same time , yet the author 's in-decisiveness sways the reader 's thought too from one pole to the other
an aimless and idle anxiety in the present , and endless sacrifice in the future , by means of which he would obtain nothing—that was what the world held in store for him
he bent over her once more
sonechka , sonechka marmeladova , eternal sonechka , as long as the world lasts !
pulkheriya aleksandrovna asked in embarrassment
i ’ ll explain that to you later ; but now , my dear fellow , i declare
it seems to be really happening
another half hour passed
i ’ ll let in some fresh air
that ’ s true , muttered zosimov
he muttered through his teeth
he argues with bazarov much more energetically than does his brother , and yet nikolai petrovich suffers much more from his merciless repudiations
svidrigaylov set down the candle , sat on the bed , and fell into thought
well , to hell with it , you hear
farther on , in the depths of the courtyard , the corner of a low , sooty stone shed peered out from behind the fence , evidently part of a workshop
here the whole question is : am i a monster or a victim myself ?
how do i know what ?
death itself is the answer to the great riddle
what ’ s to explain : it ’ s perfectly clear !
i will tell you one thing , i drew all those characters as i would draw mushrooms , leaves , and trees
yesterday your son , he said , turning to pulkheriya aleksandrovna , in the presence of mr rassudkin ( or
katerina ivanovna has taken the place of your mother , hasn ’ t she ?
i could kill and rob that cursed old woman , and can assure you , feel no pangs of conscience , the student added passionately
why does all this not arm the reader against bazarov ?
right ; and why should not i express my thought ?
how was i to blame for that ?
i think , he replied seriously after a little pause
i didn ’ t take it !
the swallows were flying very high ; the wind had died down completely ; some tardy bees were lazily and sleepily buzzing amidst the lilac blossoms ; a swarm of midges hung over a single outstretched branch
no , i thought , morgenfrüh ! † what does mikolka have to do with this ?
the little boy , a year older than her , was trembling in the corner and crying
what do you want ?
i ’ ve come for your crosses , sonya
i ’ ve known this for a long time , rodya
it seemed to me , as a result of all i ’ ve heard about you , that you , on your part , would be very pleased if this marriage could be broken off without harming her interests
here are my two rooms
in the ranks of bazarov 's enemies there will undoubtedly be those who will pay particular attention to these ugly features of his personality and will use them to reproach the general type
upon his arrival in petersburg he had stayed with him not merely for reasons of tightfisted economy , although that was really the main reason , but also for another reason
she came back—it seems she was driven away from somewhere , and perhaps she was even beaten
two peasants wearing caps stood in front of the first hut and traded insults
you know how i love you ; you ’ re all we have , dunya and i , you mean everything to us , all our hope , all our aspiration
the landlady had stopped providing him with food about two weeks ago , and up to the present he hadn ’ t taken it upon himself to have it out with her , even though he went without his dinner
a famous russian icon depicting the virgin and kept in the kazan cathedral in petersburg
the paper actually dropped from raskolnikov ’ s hands , and he looked intensely at the elegant lady , who was being rebuked so unceremoniously
i walked and walked , asked and asked !
it ’ s locked with a key
porfiry won ’ t reveal what he ’ s thinking , but he ’ s questioning those people who pawned items
good-bye , he said after a brief pause
this reading of the book can best be elucidated by beginning at its conclusion , at the almost unbearable closing picture of bazarov 's aged parents kneeling and weeping at his grave
it ’ s a bit delicate but important : if , that is , in any case ( but one that i don ’ t think will happen and consider you completely incapable of ) , if by any chance—well , just in case—the idea occurs to you during these forty or fifty hours to conclude this affair in some other way , in some sort of fantastic manner—to raise your hand against yourself ( an absurd supposition , forgive me for saying ) , then leave a short but detailed note
if i would continued in the civil service , engaged in such drudgery , why i would be an adjutant-general by now
he whispered , barely drawing a breath
that may be , but you are still wrong
and talk to him ?
marry whomever you like !
turgenev knew this and despaired of both , though he hoped the two might be reconciled
arkady immediately fell silent and katya grew pale
here ’ s an example : an old woman was murdered in our neighborhood
every man must fend for himself , and the one who deceives himself the best winds up the happiest of all
you wo not , for instance , fight , and yet you think yourselves terrific
i ’ m happy even now
do not compare me to my sister , please , katya interrupted him hurriedly
she walked quickly , swaying violently as she had before
therefore i put something of that romanticism in bazarov too , but only pisarev noticed it
my grandfather ploughed the earth , bazarov replied with arrogant pride
raskolnikov burst into laughter
then , still in chapter , bazarov articulates the first unequivocal statement of his intimation : every man hangs on a thread ; the abyss can open up beneath him at any moment
and then when i heard about those doorbells , i froze completely and even felt a shudder
he rushed toward the light to examine his sock and the fringe : there are some spots , but they ’ re not too conspicuous ; everything ’ s so dirty , worn out , and faded
this buffoonery prompted andrei gieroglifov , a member of pisarev 's circle , to face the issue squarely in an essay bearing the title love and nihilism , written just as cher-nyshevsky was completing his novel , and drawn largely from schopenhauer 's metaphysics of love
true to her name , odintsova is also temporally isolated from all the other characters
svidrigaylov sat down at the table and asked sonya to take a seat next to him
the words flowed out of him with ecstatic feeling
everythin ’ , my young friend , absolutely everythin ’ , the older man affirmed instructively
he filled three goblets and a little wineglass , toasted the health of their inestimable visitors , immediately downed his glass military style , and forced arina vlasevna to drink hers to the very last drop
in a word , though there might be some hope , it ’ s extremely slight , because in this case there ’ s no right to assistance , even maybe the opposite
good lord , it ’ s so dark !
he had been to the former location once briefly , but a long time ago
she is absolutely devoted to her husband , and both loves and fears her son bazarov
good lord , what a scream !
let the following example serve to guide you
he ’ s now involved with
once , walking somewhere outside the city , he even imagined that svidrigaylov was waiting for him there and that they had made an appointment to meet
i won ’ t come to ask your forgiveness , i ’ ll simply tell you
what i said about luzhin and about god was for myself
raskolnikov took a swallow from the glass and put a small piece of bread into his mouth
he suddenly fell silent and headed for the door
but mostly young people : there are few old men , even fewer old women , there are more children than old men , but still not very many ( italics added )
that evening anna sergeevna was sitting in her room with bazarov , while arkady was pacing the hall listening to katya 's playing
both stand outside the manor-house that is russia , peering in through a window ; rudin makes speeches and bazarov would like to throw stones perhaps erring conveys the spirit rather than the letter of the word better than sinning does
once more she made no reply
he could hear her unlocking the dresser
besides that , he informed me unequivocally that a week before her death , marfa petrovna , in her will , arranged to leave you , dunya , the sum of three thousand rubles , and that you ’ ll be able to receive that money very soon
ah , let ’ s sing cinq sous ’ in french ! ¶ i taught it to you , i did
i expected things to take a completely different direction
but i must behave more calmly ; lately i ’ ve become too full of bile
even if us can be construed as the modern reader , lowe does not indicate that his views of turgenev differ from those held by us
please let ’ s hear how he proves it !
furthermore , i added that he , petr petrovich luzhin , with all his merits , wasn ’ t worth sofiya semyonovna ’ s little finger , about whom he ’ d expressed himself so offensively
we even find it a burden to be men—men with our own real flesh and blood ; we are ashamed of it , we consider it a disgrace and strive to be some sort of imaginary men-in-general
i ’ ll be your slave
he constructed the house and outbuildings , laid out a garden , and dug a pond and two wells ; but the young trees had not taken , too little water collected in the pond , and that in the wells had a brackish taste
bazarov headed to his room , while odintsova shook arkady 's hand absentmindedly and also walked right past him
it ’ s clear , now it ’ s all clear
she still felt awkward with bazarov , even though she would told him , and she herself believed , that everything had been forgotten
he was still very young , dressed like a common worker , of medium height , gaunt , hair cropped around his head , and with fine , seemingly dry facial features
well then , you missed !
the red blotches on her cheeks were growing brighter and brighter , and her chest was heaving more and more
one she calls cyclical time ; it involves repetition , gestation , and the eternal recurrence of biological rhythms conforming to nature
it was as if now , intentionally , he had forgotten
would i do that ?
but these organisms were creatures endowed with intelligence and will
oh , what an unbearable child he is
pavel petrovich tapped his nails on the table
gasping for breath , she stops , and then tries to pull again , about to drop
asked sonya with some surprise
this guess , even as early as yesterday , during his severe anxieties and despair , had begun to strengthen in him
raskolnikov proceeded directly to the house on the canal where sonya lived
if not— be silent , things are bad enough without you
he had completely stopped handling his own everyday affairs and didn ’ t wish to deal with them
as he had been approaching bakaleev ’ s house a while ago , he ’ d suddenly imagined that some item , some small chain , cuff link , or even the paper in which the items were wrapped , with the old woman ’ s marks on it , might somehow have slid down and gotten lost in a little crack , and then might suddenly emerge before him as unexpected and incontrovertible evidence
effective people are nowhere to be seen
is it even worth talking with you ?
turgenev describes her as a genuine noblewoman of the old school , ie , old muscovy , who has somehow lived on into another age
well , weren ’ t you insane at his apartment ?
he had been following her from the moment she had emerged from the gate
at the time we deceived you , writing that it had come from dunya ’ s savings , but that wasn ’ t so
the subtlest critic of turgenev 's position in this debate , elizabeth cheresh allen , takes as her starting point the difference between turgenev and other novelists , such as eliot , trollope , and tolstoy , with whom he is often grouped
he was about to protest but remained contemptuously silent
you wanted to see me ?
andrey semyonych shuddered like a warhorse who ’ d heard the sound of the trumpet
so , even if you sacrifice your brother , you won ’ t be able to prove a thing ; force is very hard to prove , avdotya romanovna
let ’ s go right now
§ the streets on vasilievsky island are numbered and referred to as lines
she would start to say , and before he would even time to turn around , she was already fingering the laces of her handbag and would mutter : never mind , it 's nothing , i was only then she would go off to find vasily ivanovich and , resting her cheek on her hand , would say to him , my dear , how can i find out what enyusha would like for dinner today , cabbage soup or borsch ?
he said to arkady , after climbing into the cart ; pointing to a pair of jackdaws sitting side by side on the stable roof , he added , there you are !
petr petrovich , who that morning had for some reason exchanged several five percent government bonds , was sitting at a table counting packets of banknotes and bonds
about a month and a half ago , he remembered her address ; he had two items suitable for pawning : his father ’ s old silver watch and a small gold ring with three little red stones , given to him by his sister as a gift , a keepsake , at their parting
you are more fortunate than i
that i was looking for , that i was searching
if anything happens , just let me know
don ’ t bring children in here !
yes , katya repeated , and this time he understood her
forgive me , it seemed you did from your question
there are so many memories behind me : life in petersburg , wealth , then poverty , my father 's death , marriage , then a trip abroad , just as it should be many memories , but nothing to remember , while ahead of me—a long , long path , but no goal i really do not want to go on
now she was a modestly , even poorly dressed young woman , very young indeed , almost like a girl , with modest , proper manners , and an innocent but seemingly frightened face
even after that lesson , even during his second visit to the kirsanovs , he is carried away with fenichka and is forced to fight a duel with pavel petrovich
is mr kirsanov leaving us , then ?
she also understood that perhaps it was no longer possible to get away from him now
sat down on the sofa again
what do you want , sir ?
he was annoyed with himself that he ’ d dropped into the tavern
well , we don ’ t even have those books now , all our reading ended then and there
in our province , about sixty miles from here
i know what she said to you , so there ’ s no need to retell it
once again he was momentarily overcome by a strong feeling of joy , such as he ’ d experienced before in the police station
he did , but that ’ s not the point , not at all
of course , it occurred close by
look here , my dear friend
returning to his bedroom , he found his wife in bed and began praying in a whisper so as not to wake her
i warned you , my dear guest , vasily ivanych began , we live here , so to speak , in a bivouac
i have a receipt to that effect in my wallet
perhaps i ’ ll even come tomorrow
but she ’ s not too clever either , is she ?
after all , he 's no longer a young boy : it 's time to toss that rubbish aside
she said a minute later , raising her tearstained little face and wiping her tears with her hands
he added irritably , annoyed at his own involuntary passion
there was indeed in his bearing something to suggest a solid civil servant
you understand who i ’ m talking about : about her , her !
besides , while still in moscow i imagined that i was coming here to seek avdotya romanovna ’ s hand and become mr luzhin ’ s rival
so what ’ s better for him now , the doctor or you ?
it even struck him as almost amusing , while at the same time he felt somewhat heartsick
do not you know in our language , when we say 'not quite right , ' that means 'quite all right ?
he even felt very tormented on her behalf , which upset dunya
the idea is simple , but unfortunately , too long in the coming , hidden by a penchant for enthusiasm and fantasy ; it seems that a little cleverness is necessary to surmise that
i ’ m curious as to whether in the next fifteen or twenty years my soul will be resigned , whether i ’ ll whimper reverently before people , calling myself a criminal with every word i utter
and is nature nonsense ?
too bad about the forest , said arkady and began looking around
intelligentsia , a term , apparently of russian invention , that designates intellectuals of all persuasions dedicated in one form or another to the improvement of life in russia , and so carries far greater ethical implications than the mere word
however one chooses to label the dialectical thought at the heart of turgenev 's novel—hegelian , schellingian , or simply palka  dvukh kontsakh , turgenev 's dialectical intentions show themselves in the work 's very title , which links the generations even as it seems to set them apart
i really did wish to have a discussion with you and your much-esteemed mother , even about some very important matters
his face expressed sincere compassion
she didn ’ t agree with me , just as you don ’ t , and i ’ m glad that she ’ s no longer with us
they are not groundless , and i accept— without false humility—part of the reproaches made to me
and what sort of thoughts had he sometimes harbored ?
she embraced him firmly
what sort of permission do i need ?
nonetheless the whole man , not fragmentary traits , appears at that step of his development , as generally happens in development
at least you have enormous material for being one
raskolnikov had a terrible dream
at the very last farewell , he smiled strangely at the passionate assurances of his sister and razumikhin about their happy future when he would be released from prison , and he predicted that his mother ’ s illness would soon end in calamity
i lay there drunk , sir
as long as our beloved creatures are happy
that is , you mean to say , if i have understood you correctly , no matter what your theoretical view of dueling , in practice you would not allow yourself to be insulted without demanding satisfaction
well , and finally , if you won ’ t agree to drop in on me , then i ’ ll refuse to provide any explanations and will leave immediately
of course , she could tolerate everything with patience and almost without complaint—even this
when it becomes necessary i will have the time and strength to do what i must
well , to hell with it !
et toc , et toc , et tin-tin-tin !
but if svidrigaylov still hadn ’ t been there , would he or would he not go to see porfiry ?
why me in particular ?
as you wish , replied bazarov
it is less the portrait of an individual man than it is the icon of an era , one of those rare instances that let us actually see the otherwise invisible historical forces shaping whole eras
you gave us all your money yesterday !
on the contrary , i am ready to submit , but inequality is difficult to accept
a life for a life
sonya picked up her shawl and put it over her head
i do not quite understand you , arkady said
our nikolai petrovich fell into a reverie
the tenderhearted and sensible mother of arkady ivanovich ’ s fiancée pushed her husband ’ s wheelchair out to him , and , as was her custom , immediately began with some remote questions
i don ’ t know if he ’ s rich now , or how much precisely marfa petrovna left him ; i ’ ll find that out in a very short time ; but , of course , here in petersburg , even having any financial resources at hand , he ’ ll resume his former course of action
truth doesn ’ t vanish , but life can be beaten to a pulp ; there have been examples
vakhrushin , raskolnikov said pensively
the political details of the debate between the men of the forties and the men of the sixties , i suggested , were only the temporal , particular setting for turgenev 's eternal and universal theme
it was on the eve of my departure to come here
what a strange fellow you are !
in our calendar , and the october revolution is annually commemorated in the soviet union on november
analyzed bv dobrolyubov in a long article entitled the kingdom of darkness ( ) [ editor ]
i told you they were telling tall tales !
but this is all so vulgar
you ’ re a good man , i know that , he added with a smile , looking him right in the eye
though he could not sympathize with the aims of the revolutionaries , he could sympathize with them as people
that is the iu
for my part , i am very glad you are studying the natural sciences
she yelled at him
we will omit the long process by which he arrived at this last conclusion ; even without that , we have raced too far ahead
screams mikolka , and swings the shaft with all his might
what he 's saying , of course , is that physiological mechanisms are true , but they may become layered over with false metaphors , especially the kind to which lovers are notoriously drawn
waiting until the end of the quadrille , sitnikov led arkady to odintsova
rodion romanovich has two paths open to him : either a bullet in his brain or siberia
he was very suspicious of svidrigaylov
a second assertion expands on the subject :
of all the pejoratives bazarov uses , none in his eyes is more damning than
if porfiry really had anything positive , then of course it was in connection with the man from yesterday
because in this instance , as i saw it that was precisely how life turned out and above all i wanted to be honest and truthful
nikolai petrovich ordered several bottles of porter , which had just been delivered from moscow , and drank so much his cheeks turned red as raspberries and kept emitting not quite a childish , not quite a nervous laugh
the critic strakhov in his review spoke of him as a character conceived on a heroic scale
one more word , sir , rodion romanovich , about all this ; it ’ s as god wills it , nevertheless , according to our procedure , there are still some things i want to ask you about , sir
dunya cried in despair
here he is , dmitry prokofich razumikhin , she added , introducing him to luzhin
nature 's not a temple , but a workshop , and man 's the workman in it
she had lowered her revolver and , completely stunned , looked at him ; he could have grabbed her twice over—she wouldn ’ t have raised her arms in her defense if he hadn ’ t reminded her himself
what shall we sing ?
a faint breeze , rustling in the leaves of the ash , moved pale gold spots of light slowly back and forth across the dark path and fifi 's yellow back ; arkady and katya were enveloped in deep shade ; only occasionally did a bright streak gleam in her hair
he stood on the threshold like someone rooted to the ground
† a reference to the judicial reforms of
now go to bed , right now , immediately !
will i be better if i acknowledge then , crushed by suffering and idiocy , in old-age impotence after twenty years of exile , what i acknowledge now , and why should i continue to live ?
i suppose it 's time our travelers were nestled in the arms of morpheus , observed vasily ivanovich
but , after having reached the first line , § raskolnikov suddenly turned around , climbed the stairs back up to razumikhin ’ s , and , placing both the german pages and the three rubles down on the table , left again , without saying a word
how is he finding them ?
however , i ’ m not going there now to redeem those items , he said with some haste and special concern for his belongings
never forsake my poor brother nikolai !
besides , you can read pelouse et frémy , notions générales de chimie ; it 's a good book and very clearly written
she stood up and headed for the door
this capacity consciously to behave stupidly is an enviable virtue of strong and intelligent people
i do not beat her for no reason
he thought inadvertently as he climbed up to the fourth floor
lizaveta , the trader , or don ’ t you know ?
he paused on the threshold
why is this so ?
i ’ ve inquired about you many times
that is , i ’ m dead drunk , but that ’ s not the point
but there was no hope ; no doubt remained whatsoever ; it was all true !
he turned away and sat down on the couch
everyone was talking , shouting , and exclaiming ; the coachman seemed confused and kept repeating , from time to time :
this is pavel petrovieh ( : [ p ] )
marmeladov fell silent , as if his voice had broken off
the door opened , and in walked razumikhin
to deny completely arbitrarily one or another natural and real human need is to break with pure empiricism
raskolnikov hurried back to his apartment
indeed , the prospect of an affair with
besides , in order to determine what sort of person he is , one must deal with him gradually and carefully , so as not to fall into error or prejudice , which is difficult to correct or smooth over afterward
nature 's nonsense too in the sense you understand it
what if the cases floated instead of sank ?
merely to bury them and then acquire new responsibilities—a wife and children , and then leave them also without a kopeck or a crust of bread ?
the hell with them ; later we can beat them up , but for now , we ’ ll just laugh !
they won ’ t understand a thing , not a thing , sonya , and they ’ re not worthy of understanding
odintsova turned to arkady
exclamations flew from all sides
in this essay of herzen undertook to show other forms of civic action than those the nihilists proclaimed
having married a wealthy man who left her his estate and fortune upon his demise , anna sergeevna is wholly dedicated to the preservation of the status quo
it seems that i am more naïve than you assume
a gloomy , intense energy is manifested in the younger generation 's unfriendly attitude toward its mentors
this may be the last time i speak with you
have you seen luzhin ?
order yourself some tea at least
does bazarov present a subject for imitation according to you ?
but do you know , avdotya romanovna , that i could even lodge a complaint , ma ’ am
in spite of his weakness , he didn ’ t even feel the least tiredness
well , it ’ s not for my looks , and besides , what sort of husband am i ?
true , they depended on you before , and your late father would ask you for money so he could drink to cure his hangover
put in a third
in reply to the question of what had caused him to offer a confession , he answered frankly that it was his heartfelt repentance
that ’ s exactly what he was counting on , the fact that i wouldn ’ t have had time to think , that i ’ d hasten to reply more plausibly , and would forget that the workmen couldn ’ t have been there two days before
profound task to fulfill , turgenev is only the singer of our cultured stratum , and
because he ’ s so irascible
drink champagne with kukshina ?
what exactly did he say ?
tolstoy 's artistic genius was acknowledged early by writers and critics
once again they stood facing each other for a minute
but that ’ s not true at all
it seems to be a very simple and clear thing , and yet that 's just what one has to explain in our day , as if it were something completely new and yet it would seem , it is completely simple and clear , so simple and clear that the most organic view that emerges immediately from it is nothing other than a simple , untheoretical view of life and its manifestations or expression in science , art , and the history of nations
it ’ s not that she ’ ll begin tearing out my hair
there ’ s drawin ’ s , i mean
he cried to himself
nastasya brought him something to eat ; he ate and drank with a hearty appetite , almost greedily
the tide of public opinion , still so vague with us , turned but a shadow was cast on my name
pavel petrovich smiled and , placing his hand on his brother 's shoulder , made him sit down again
hundreds , maybe thousands of beings could be set on the right path ; dozens of families could be rescued from poverty , kept from dissolution , from ruin , debauchery , and venereal hospitals—all this with her wealth

they were also packing to go home , but lingered as they chatted with a passing acquaintance
don ’ t be angry , rodion romanovich , but for some reason you yourself seem terribly strange to me
who knows , perhaps it ’ s not any better , but even worse
have you just come from the baths ?
yet these new men , herzen added in a later essay , are so dogmatic , doctrinaire , jargon-ridden , as to exhibit the least attractive aspect of the russian character , the policeman's—the martinet's—side of it , the brutal bureaucratic jackboot ; they want to break the yoke of the old despotism , but only in order to replace it with one of their own
listen , razumikhin , began raskolnikov
polechka knelt at her mother ’ s feet and kissed them , sobbing
never , never have i been stronger and more convinced than i am now !
that may be the case : i ’ m babbling because i ’ m not doing anything
since my arrival , i have felt really rotten , as if i would been reading gogol 's letter to the wife of the governor of kaluga
i ’ m a poor , sick student , disheartened—he actually used the word disheartened—by poverty
it ’ s a vile and ridiculous suspicion
calm down , mama , replied dunya , taking off her hat and cloak
as he made his way through the office , raskolnikov noticed that many people were staring at him intently
lebezyatnikov retorted , his temper flaring up
then you must reject everything ?
two lads from the crowd grab whips and run up to the little horse to start beating her flanks
but these people managed to carry out those steps , and therefore they were right ; but i wasn ’ t able to , and therefore i didn ’ t have the right to allow myself to take that step
aristocratism , liberalism , progress , principles , bazarov was saying meanwhile ,
that aspen over there , bazarov began , reminds me of my childhood
there was some sort—do not laugh—
but as you see , i haven ’ t left the matter unattended ; i have risen up and will tell you why : solely , madam , solely because of your blackest ingratitude !
i merely asked you
and if he started to gain the upper hand , he asked , would you stand up for me ?
better to coquette with science than with a dandy
you ’ re really sick , you know that ?
well , what are you afraid of , you little fool !
this isn ’ t why he doesn ’ t run away from me : it ’ s that he has nowhere to run ; he won ’ t run away psychologically , ha-ha !
leontiev in in one of his most revealing statements about his own artistic method
sit down , my dear ; i see that you must be tired
and then about mr razumikhin , that is , whether it was his own idea to come here yesterday to speak on your behalf or was it at your instigation ?
bazarov is more than an outsider to turgenev , but to pisarev he is more than a brother ; for heuristic purposes , of course , we should choose the viewpoint which regards bazarov as its desideratum
that ’ s the detective speaking !
lizaveta , the market woman , had sold me some collars and cuffs cheaply , very nice ones , new , with a pattern
are you some sort of prophet ?
arkady will be here , bazarov remarked
allow me to pass , ladies and gentlemen !
her face was pockmarked ; she was about thirty years old , covered with bruises , and had a swollen upper lip
he has important business there , since he wants to open a public lawyer ’ s office in the capital
a few moments later , the door opened a tiny crack : the inhabitant peered out at the caller with visible distrust , and all that could be seen in the darkness were her flashing beady eyes
in baden once again he somehow became as close to her as before ; it seemed she would never loved him so passionately but a month later it was all over : the flame had flared up for the last time and gone out forever
allow me to inquire
you always say that i ’ m a fool ; well , friend , i swear there are bigger fools than me !
the smolny costume is described and pictured in stefanie dogorouky [ dologorukayaj , la russie avant la débâcle ( paris , ) -
but no ; ennui overcomes you
i also had the opportunity to learn in detail about the scene in the police office , also by chance , sir , not merely in passing but from a particular , reliable source , who , without knowing why himself , grasped the scene surprisingly well
repeated lebezyatnikov , turning to each and every person present
there happened to be a young girl in our house , parasha , dark-eyed parasha , who ’ d just been brought in from another village ; she was a serf girl i ’ d never set eyes on before—very pretty but unbelievably stupid : she burst into tears , raised a loud howl , and created a scandal
you can imagine what occurred there
vassily ivanovich knows as a doctor how great the danger is , but he can not bring himself to look it in the face and tries to deceive himself
twenty rubles , i think—and if this can serve as assistance , then
well , what of it ?
it was the same in the furniture shop , where they didn ’ t want to refund even one ruble of his deposit for the furniture he had purchased , but which had still not been delivered to the apartment
they were just returning home from the governor 's , when suddenly a rather short man jumped from a passing carriage ; wearing a slavophile jacket , shouting , evgeny vasilich !
i shall enter the battle against evil only when i feel myself to be strong
he opened his eyes and , still not recognizing or understanding where he was , began scrutinizing raskolnikov , who was standing over him
before you were sitting on that chair as you ’ ve never sat before , somehow on the edge of it , shuddering from a spasm
well then , arkady , nikolai petrovich began again , turning to his son , shall we have the horses harnessed at once , or do you want to rest a little ?
he , too , of course , had scrutinized the sick man when he ’ d fainted , but he ’ d walked away as soon as raskolnikov had come to
arkady picked up the latest issue of a journal and began reading aloud
i saved you some , but you came home late
he 's become good friends with katya
the silence continued for a minute
i ’ ll get used to it
we tried to determine what sort of fringes you wanted
they came to terms because of me !
we see bazarov only in the last weeks of his life , and this is crucial in light of walter benjamin 's comment on the assertion that a man who dies at is at every moment of his life a man who dies at
formal admission into the ranks of womanizing céladons and then returned to his own room
praise the lord , her torments have ended , but i ’ ll tell you everything in order , so you ’ ll know what ’ s happened and what we ’ ve been keeping from you up to now
porfiry petrovich , apparently , was flustered
by way of example one might analyze the remarkably subtle structure of the third chapter of fathers and sons , underscoring the nuanced modulation of feeling and perspective , the art of implication , and the way that these recall ( for us , today ) chekhov , particularly in his plays
asked the frightened pulkheriya aleksandrovna
in his opening chapter
he had agreed to leave the party immediately and have a look at raskolnikov , but had come to see the women unwillingly and with great uncertainty , failing to trust the drunken razumikhin
when bazarov lauds hatred , how strange !
ba/arov 's mother beatifically adores him , while his father does not merely defer to his son 's views , he suppresses some of his own deepest feelings
to america , and the hell with them !
he felt like mocking himself spitefully
nikolai petrovich asked at last
he soon caught up with him , and for some time walked along behind him ; at last he came even with him and glanced into his face from alongside
to that ideal of civilization turgenev remained true all his life
the cleverer a person is , the less he suspects that he ’ ll be tricked by something so simple
i agree with evgeny , he replied
asked raskolnikov , glancing at him inquisitively
there ’ s some outburst for you ; he ’ s beating his drum !
give him something more substantial to read
i am very glad to hear you say that
he wrote that in the summer of wouldespicable generals praised me , the constantly quoted both for and against the conception of bazarov as a prototype of bolshevik activists
many of our realists are up in arms against turgenev because he does not sympathize with bazarov
long since the issues that he fought out have ceased to be of any actual interest
the image of a student who has solidly passed an examination is much more accurate than your image of the triumphant man , and let me tell you that your comparing yourself to a pigmy is worthless
dunechka shuddered , quickly cocked the revolver , and raised it once again
he fell to thinking deeply about how it might transpire that at last he ’ d humble himself before them all without any argument , humble himself by conviction !
we ’ ve already turned the corner , interrupted dunya
luzhin paused and waited with an offended and challenging look
in a commune , her role will change its present meaning ; that which is foolish here will become clever there ; that which is unnatural here , under present circumstances , will become completely natural there
if you like , all this , i said , could be explained in an entirely different way , and it even winds up being more natural
you don ’ t pay her any money and you won ’ t vacate the room
why did i undertake this mean , vile , base act ?
arkady remembered egorovna , sighed , and wished her eternal peace he did not pray for himself
in a word , through it all he could even provoke a rift between my family and me , and , of course , he hoped once more to restore himself to their good favor
why ’ s the caretaker here ?
we just got here ourselves
she asked , growing heated and upset
they didn ’ t know whom to condemn and whom to acquit
but in giving him the right to receive my pension for me , i was obliged to wait until i repaid my debt , and that ’ s only just happened , so all this time i haven ’ t been able to send you anything
what do you want ?
youngish , that is , recently turned forty , but already aspiring to an important government position and sporting stars on both sides of his chest
what do you think ?
leave me alone , all of you , leave me alone !
shouted dozens of voices ; people came running , and both embankments were covered with spectators
take a good look
and did you notice , rodion romanovich , once and for all , that all these petersburg foreigners—that is , mainly the germans—who come to us from somewhere or other are all stupider than we are ?
a russian translation appeared in
she was singing a romance in a coarse , rough , but rather strong , pleasant voice , in expectation of receiving a two-kopeck piece from the shopkeeper
finally , there is linear time ; time as project , teleology , departure , progression , and arrival ; time as history
katya and arkady could not see them , but heard their every word , the rustle of her dress , their breathing
he cried more threateningly
i don ’ t understand what promissory note you ’ re talking about !
'anonymous russia ' , as he called them in virgin soil
both of them , svidrigaylov and achilles , stood looking at each other in silence for some time
and so , despite your euphemisms , you do not like fathers and sons
he writes from afar
well , even for just a while
i really did know beforehand !
and therefore why not be a vulgarian for a while , when it ’ s so appropriate to appear as such in our climate and
i don ’ t want them to be lost , especially the watch
i wish you good thoughts and auspicious undertakings !
fenechka demonstrated with her own hands how , in her opinion , bazarov twisted pavel petrovich around his little finger
well , listen to my report , he began
wasn ’ t he the servant who came , after his death , to fill your pipe
he searched for her with a sad , timid look in his eyes ; she turned back to him and stood at his head
it may have been there since the house was built and will be there just as long
true , it was still lying on the sofa under his blanket , but it was so worn and dirty that of course zametov couldn ’ t have noticed anything in particular about it
he says , 'they are prepared to rob themselves in order to drink themselves blind at the inn
but at the same time , a gentleman in a civil servant ’ s uniform and an overcoat , a respectable man of about fifty with a medal around his neck ( this was especially pleasant for katerina ivanovna and had an effect on the policeman ) , drew near and silently presented katerina ivanovna with a green three-ruble note
however , i see that it ’ s a delicate matter and i ’ m an ass ; forgive me
how did it happen that she risked taking such a beauty into her house as a governess ?
go at once , this very minute , and stand at the crossroads , bow down , and begin by kissing the ground that you ’ ve fouled ; then bow down to the entire world , all four sides , and say aloud to everyone : i killed !
how do you know ?
you probably think , like everyone else , that i was too strict with him , she continued , turning to raskolnikov
oh , the vile scoundrels
triumph during their lifetime ?
again , it ’ s expressed in legalese , that is , with too obvious a display of its own aim and with extremely naïve speed
i ’ m feeling somewhat weak , dunya ; i ’ m very tired ; but now at least i ’ d like to regain control of myself
but as he uttered his last exclamation , he unexpectedly met dunya ’ s glance ; there was so much , so very much suffering in her eyes that he instinctively came to his senses
it 's awful , just awful
he decided to stop at a single step in his hero 's development
he must be large and heavy , thought raskolnikov , squeezing the axe in his hand
the question remains : does the illness give birth to the crime itself , or is the crime , somehow by its own nature , always accompanied by something like an illness ?
at that moment , a ray of sunlight lit up his left boot : on his sock , which stuck out , there seemed to be more spots
well , perhaps that ’ s just what i ’ m trying to do , hee-hee-hee !
that means you believe only in science
a little while ago , justifying my own love for avdotya romanovna , i said that i myself was a victim
he looked exactly the same as he had yesterday : the same figure , dressed the same way , but a major change had taken place in his face and in his glance : he now looked somehow saddened ; standing there for a little while , he sighed deeply
she was very plain
it was not all that long ago he would engaged in such dreaming while waiting for his son at the carriage inn ; but since then such a change had occurred , and their relations , which had at that time been so unclear , had now become quite well-defined how well-defined they were !
tears stood in their eyes
even if there ’ s no doubt whatsoever in all my calculations , even if everything i ’ ve decided this past month is clear as day , as correct as arithmetic
there can be no doubt that turgenev 's experience of revolution as a momentary event in history—providential , perhaps , accidental , ironical or fateful , he was himself unsure which— matched and possibly reinforced his sense that life 's ultimate joy was to be experienced in the momentary ecstasy of first love
the old woman hadn ’ t locked it after him , perhaps out of caution
on a leather-covered sofa a lady was half-reclining ; she was still young , had fair hair , a bit disheveled , and was wearing a silk dress , not altogether tidy , with large bracelets on her short arms , a lace kerchief on her head
but how did i kill ?
no , that wasn ’ t the dunya i knew , and
not that this narrator is incapable of appreciating prosaic values , too
contemplating that divide , steno thinks : before me i see a threshold—
he tried to run away !
it ’ s what ’ s called la nature et la vérité ! ‡ ha , ha !
he took the money for me
just write what i told you
but he was resurrected , and he knew it ; he felt it completely with the entirety of his renewed being , and she—well , she lived only in his life !
the old woman was no more than a mistake ; she wasn ’ t the point !
in he brought his son to the university ; he spent three winters there with him in petersburg , going almost nowhere and trying to make the acquaintance of arkady 's young companions
that does not prevent me from being a liberal
well , did you see that ?
when you do , the tip of your nose wiggles very sweetly
well , and for a young man with such self-esteem , this was humiliating , especially in our day
on the other hand , once he settled in the country , he never left it again , even during the three winters nikolai petrovich spent with his son in petersburg
you think i am infallible that is , i have organized my life in such a way ?
a fly passed by , and it saw !
instead of the dialectic , life itself had arrived , and in his consciousness something altogether different had to be worked out
in the depths of his soul , pavel petrovich is just as much of a skeptic and empiricist as bazarov himself ; in practical life he always acted and acts as he sees fit , but in the realm of thought he is not able to admit this to himself and thus he adheres in words to doctrines which his actions continually contradict
so help me god , the game isn ’ t worth the candle , and i wasn ’ t intending to talk to you about anything very special
the fez and the carelessly knotted cravat carried a suggestion of the more free life in the country but the stiff collar of his shirt—not white , it is true , but striped as is correct for morning wear—stood up as inexorably as ever against his well-shaven chin
i will pour it myself , nikolai replied hurriedly
up to this point i have not been afraid
he ’ d begun beating her toward the end ; although she didn ’ t let him get away with it , about which i have detailed documentary evidence ; she weeps to this day when she remembers him and reproaches me
what are you saying ?
a garbling of razumikhin ’ s surname resulting from the confusion of rassudok ( reason , intellect ) and razum ( reason , mind )
everyone 's face looks stupid when they are asleep
is there really no hope ?
she waited for ten minutes , and we stood over her in silence
moreover , they are likely to be impostors , as frye calls them , people who lack self-knowledge
no , it ’ s as if it happened in another world
we want to organize our commune in a special way , but only on a broader foundation than previously
i want to live myself , or else it ’ s better not to live at all
does that make you angry , perhaps ?
we ’ ll save him , we ’ ll rescue him
they were alone ; no one saw them
strength , he said , what strength i still possess , yet i have to die !
when evgeny vasilevich first told me that one need not acknowledge any authorities , i felt such delight it was as if i suddenly saw the light !
he simply lost his nerve
he was about to set off in the opposite direction , not understanding why he had turned onto obukhovsky prospect , when all of a sudden , in one of the farthest open windows of the tavern , he saw svidrigaylov sitting there by the window at a tea table , a pipe in his mouth
he rushed to the corner , thrust his hand in , began pulling things out and loading them into his pockets
raskolnikov regarded him gloomily
as a matter of fact , i probably said that more for my own zeal , as raskolnikov had guessed
neither over himself , nor outside himself , nor within himself does he recognize a moderator ahead—no exalted goal ; in his mind—no high design , and yet he has such great capacities
there are such remarks as bazarov drew himself up haughtily
and if the author 's relation to that figure is of even vaguer character , if the author does not know himself whether he loves the created character or not ( as happened to me in regard to bazarov , since that involuntary attraction
you don ’ t need any money ?
the silence persisted , painful and awkward
wait till you ’ re called !
amaliya ivanovna wouldn ’ t accept this and declared at once that her vater from berlin vas a very , very important mann and valked mit ze hends in ze pockets and always said , poof !
everyone crowded toward petr petrovich
various attempts have been made to render compatible the two opposing views regarding turgenev 's intentions in the novel
you still have another percussion cap
perhaps you ’ ve been drinking ?
the author says practically nothing about his hero 's development , how such a character could have been formed
i see that to some people i can really seem to be a romantic figure
pushkin was never a soldier
i bet you haven ’ t even thought of that
from odintseva 's own illicit imagination , via a reference to this woman 's beautiful body , the narrator has come to a vision of her bathing
it ’ s because he ’ s going to jerusalem , lads ; he ’ s saying good-bye to his children and his motherland ; he ’ s bowing down to the whole world , kissing the capital city of st petersburg and the ground it stands on , added a tradesman who was also a little drunk
in my opinion , if you won ’ t dare to do it yourself , it ’ s not a matter of justice !
and that it was a strange thing , of course , to look for equality in a fight
raskolnikov regarded everything with a strange sensation of indifference and unconcern
surely it ’ s not forever
she ’ s a most charming creature !
what are you thinking about ?
i do not know ; but send someone to fetch her
he waited , tiptoed out , and ran downstairs
i manage my own estate , and , just imagine , have a steward named erofey—he 's a wonderful character , just like cooper 's pathfinder : there 's something so spontaneous about him !
even this gives me enjoyment !
with pleasure , replied bazarov
well , i wo not give up so easily , his brother muttered
it seems as if you ’ re burying me or saying farewell forever , he said in a somewhat strange manner
i ’ m afraid and scared ?
i know his theory
why are you getting restless ?
good lord , what a question !
there was a minute of gloomy silence
turgenev thus makes his own contributions to what mario praz discusses as the tradition of la belle dame sans merci ; see the romantic agony ( oxford , ) , pp
well , rodya , sit up
no , it wasn ’ t merely springtime delirium , dunechka said with animation
listen , katerina sergeevna : that 's really an insult
turgenev did not find one essential indictment against this type , and thus his voice , the voice of a man who finds himself in a camp which is inconsistent with his age and his views of life , has an especially important and decisive meaning
i didn ’ t like arguing and didn ’ t lose my temper—another bad sign !
i do not believe all those rumors heard in town ; but i do like to think , as our educated governor says , that they are well-founded
but a boat was unnecessary : a policeman ran down the steps to the edge of the canal , threw off his overcoat and boots , and plunged into the water
it ’ s clearly tempting and one doesn ’ t have to think !
the thief has been unmasked , and i intend to prosecute , sirs
i ’ m ashamed even to mention it
that ’ s precisely what he ’ s missing !
there was vodka , rum , and lisbon wine , all of very poor quality , but all in sufficient quantity
that means god spared us the trouble : last week he was constantly asking me to introduce him to you , porfiry , but i see that you ’ ve already sniffed each other out without me
her glance , fixed on his face , expressed horror and inconsolable sadness
it may well be the case that lionel trilling , the meaning of a literary idea , in his the liberal imagination : essays on literature and society ( new york , ) , pp
i ’ ve insisted several times that this question can be explained to novices only at the very end , when a person ’ s already committed to the system , when he ’ s educated and politically progressive
they sat there for two hours whispering all the time : now , katerina says , since semyon zakharych is back at work and receiving a salary , and he ’ s even been to see his excellency ; his excellency came out himself , told everyone else to wait , while he took semyon zakharych by the arm and escorted him into his office
that it might have been an apparition
how would they have parted today if the unexpected disaster with nikolai hadn ’ t occurred ?
boiled rice with raisins and honey , traditionally eaten at a funeral repast
excuse me , i can ’ t remember your surname , he said , bowing politely to razumikhin ) , insulted me by distorting an idea that i conveyed to you in a private conversation , over coffee , namely , that marriage to a poor young woman , one who had already experienced hardship in life , in my opinion , was more advantageous for conjugal relations than marriage to someone who ’ s known prosperity , since it ’ s more propitious for moral development
perhaps i would ’ ve been glad to die ?
perhaps katerina ivanovna considered herself obligated to her deceased husband to honor his memory as befitting , so that all the lodgers , including amaliya ivanovna , in particular , would know that not only was he no worse than they , but perhaps , even much better , and that not one of them had the right to look down his nose at him
there for the moment are some of the impressions i have gathered on the wing
has the world turned upside down , or what ?
he can hardly stand , while you think
after doing so , he pulled out the axe , wiped off the iron blade , and for a long time , almost three minutes , scrubbed the wooden handle where it was covered in blood , even using soap to wash it away
this ending too has failed to satisfy many critics , even one so perceptive as prince mirsky , who complains that there is something arbitrary in bazarov 's death
it ’ s all because this wretched kolya ’ s so stupid , he ’ s such a bother !
but imagine her surprise when pavel petrovich , pavel petrovich himself , brought her hand toward his lips and leaned over , without kissing it , merely emitting convulsive sighs from time to time
my head ’ s spinning even more
there is , she says , an invalid father , a retired civil servant , who sits in a wheelchair and hasn ’ t been able to move his legs for three years
a man who , perhaps , has feelings and sympathies , who may know a thing or two , but who ’ s lived his life
he immediately wrote a note to my mother and informed her that i ’ d given the money not to katerina ivanovna , but to sofiya semyonovna ; in addition , he made reference in the vilest language to her
raskolnikov said , turning and walking away
then he recovered immediately
they were an eyesore to me and so i started to sketch them
on the fourth day he turns to his father and straightforwardly and seriously tells him that he will die soon , shows him the red spots on his body which are a sign of infection , gives him the medical term for his illness , and coldly refutes the timid objections of the broken old man
it may be that you fear it without even knowing it—because you ’ re young !
why do you think that ?
i told you last time
i have a beneficial aim
but it was impossible to figure that out
the greatest twist on this metaphoric use of metaphor is bazarov 's own use of metaphor : as he lies dying , he metamorphoses into a romantic of the kind his scientism previously had caused him to scorn
by the way , i just mentioned the word happiness
toward the end of the vacation bazarov dies , almost by accident , becoming infected from a decomposing body , and kirsanov marries , having fallen in love with odintsov 's sister
well , confer quickly , but not in latin ; after all , i know the meaning of 'jam moritur
yes , physics ; natural sciences in general
the fact is , instinctually he was beginning to realize that lebezyatnikov was not only a vulgar and stupid little man , but , perhaps , even a paltry liar , and that he had no more important connections whatsoever even in his own circle , and merely heard something thirdhand ; furthermore , perhaps he didn ’ t even know his own propagandistic business very well , because he would get all mixed up ; so how could he possibly be a denouncer ?
she stood there a little while longer , regarded him with compassion , and left the room
in my personal opinion , you ’ re absolutely correct : force is an abomination
i thought all the time
i agree that ghosts appear only to sick people , but that merely proves that they can appear only to sick people , and not that they don ’ t exist at all
‡‡ slide , slide , the basque step !
he bowed and left
as soon as he saw the earrings , he forgot all about the apartment and about mitka , grabbed his cap , ran off to dushkin , and , as is known , received a ruble from him , lying to him , saying that he found them in the street , and then he went off on a spree
a drawing can show me at one glance what might take ten pages in a book to describe
he recalled how he had just passed petrovsky park , and even thought about it with revulsion
bazarov said all this with a look on his face as if he were thinking : you can believe me or not , it 's all the same to me !
next , he slowly reached into his vest pocket , extracted an enormous bulging gold pocket watch in a case , opened it , glanced at it slowly and lethargically , and put it back in his pocket
people who give up their intellectual independence and substitute servile worship for criticism , by giving themselves over completely to one or another prevailing theory , reveal that they are narrow , impotent , and often harmful people
to hell with the wine !
raskolnikov could have sworn that he had winked at him , only the devil knew why
remarked zosimov , almost licking his lips as the two of them emerged onto the street
oh , you silly children !
muttered pulkheriya aleksandrovna , but somehow unconsciously , as if still not taking in everything that had just happened
he began shivering and for a minute regarded the black water of the little neva with particular curiosity and even with a question in mind
why do you ask ?
even as recently as last week !
do you believe it ?
porfiry petrovich , however , seemed not to have heard these strange words
perhaps he has some intention
but somehow he failed to open the dresser : none of the keys fit the locks
you say that my article was unclear ; i ’ m prepared to explain it to you , as best i can
it was the first time he had addressed her after yesterday ’ s disagreement
besides , you yourself told me yesterday you were not satisfied
halfway up the stairs he could already hear the noise and lively conversation of the large gathering
successful is another question , but the very
that makes sense—they share the same temporal modality— the one to which their husbands have submitted and the one that is clearly valorized by the narrator in that last scene at marino
i thank you , kind sir , she began from on high
he looked at the children : they were all on their knees at the coffin ; polechka was crying
he 's a student in the medical faculty , observed nikolai petrovich and fell silent
if in my proposal there was even a one-millionth part of calculation , i wouldn ’ t have made it so openly ; and i wouldn ’ t be offering her only ten thousand , when only five weeks ago i was offering her more
the love of the fathers for the sons , however , hardly needs demonstration ; instances can be found in every scene in which they appear together
he muttered , with his half-witted glance fixed on the little girl ’ s bare feet
and i also wanted to tell you , but you interrupted me , that you were right just now when you decided not to try to learn these mysteries and secrets
he added with a bitter smile
besides , it doesn ’ t matter ; they still don ’ t know anything , he thought , and they ’ re already used to thinking of me as an eccentric
he will be up and dancing in three weeks !
i love the comforts of life , sitnikov intoned pompously
he frequently and deliberately emphasizes his plebeian origin , as in the ironic reference to his similarity to the great speransky , his sharp reaction to his father 's apologies , his feelings about pavel kirsanov , and in numerous turns of speech that the english translation can not convey completely
odintseva has accomplished what she intended : she has come to know herself
allow me to ask , as a father in all candor , what do you think of my evgeny ?
there 's a kind of charm in that young , fresh feeling
since then i have grown calmer , if not wiser
do you know what ?
just as soon as raskolnikov had opened the door to the street , suddenly , there on the stairs , he met razumikhin , who was coming into the tavern
what are you talking about ?
seeing that she now stood blocking the doorway and wouldn ’ t let him pass , he advanced directly on her
i want to lay it all out to you , how it all occurred , the whole story of that entire confusion , so to speak
all this happened in a moment , while walking , and the passerby , trying not to let his interest show , went on farther , reducing his speed , as if waiting for someone
were all the words spoken honestly between them , or did they both understand that each of them felt the same thing in her heart and mind , and there was no reason to utter it aloud or to talk about it
are you afraid you revealed some secret ?
if it ’ s on business , it ’ s too early
put your cap down , sir , it looks as if you plan to leave at once ; really , it ’ s uncomfortable to see it
would he not be terribly amazed and disconcerted if he were suddenly approached with the question whether his theorem was progressive or reactionary ?
why are you afraid of pavel petrovich ?
katya understands family and perfect peace ; the narrator gives her beliefs their due , but still seems to sense in them the air of rural sybaritism , of gogol 's old world landowners and , perhaps most of all , of oblomovka , the vegetable idyll
dunya smiled and extended her hand to him , but the worried look didn ’ t leave her face
in a word : let 's be friends just as we were before
suddenly he jumped as if someone had torn him from the sofa
he 's cut four new teeth already , and now his gums are swollen again
cried raskolnikov , raising himself on his pillow and staring at him with a piercing , flashing glance
we will not discuss here the description of nature , of russian nature , which is so difficult to describe and in describing which turgenev is such a master
perhaps you yourself were taken aback by it ?
the train was terribly late
but i would not have called that unhappiness
he caught himself having all sorts of
aren ’ t these all signs of madness ?
all is concise and clear , the sum is tallied , the account is rendered , and from the point of view from which the author approached the problem everything is perfectly correct
no , it is you , sir , rodion romanych , you , sir , and no one else , sir , porfiry whispered sternly and compellingly
well then , in the second place ?
that ol ’ nag ain ’ t good for nothin ’ !
that i killed a vile , malicious louse , an old moneylender , needed by no one ; to murder her would pardon forty sins ; she used to suck the lifeblood out of the poor , and you call that a crime ?
he is ruled only by his whims or his personal calculations
the difference in question was most succinctly formulated by kant in the previous century when he defined an aesthetic idea as one that could only be grasped intuitively , in contradistinction to a rational idea , to which no intuition could ever be adequate
he was drunk and wound up under the horses ’ hooves !
the old woman was merely an illness
you should make a statement to the police , porfiry replied with the same businesslike expression , to the effect that , having learned about such and such an occurrence , that is , about the murder , you request , in turn , to inform the examining magistrate who was delegated to this case that such and such items belong to you and that you wish to redeem them
i was joking just now , of course , but look : on the one hand , here ’ s a stupid , mindless , worthless , spiteful , sick old hag , needed by no one—on the contrary , causing harm to everyone ; she herself doesn ’ t know what she ’ s living for , and she ’ ll die of her own accord tomorrow
i just learned about it from pashenka
give me yours , too
the narrator understands this position , understands above all the warmth of the life it makes possible , but clings unsurely to his disapproval of prosaic routine as deadening and lethargic
his pale , exhausted face even flushed with color
why pose such empty questions ?
he just came to , said nastasya
but whatever happened , the main thing was we did not need each other ; there was too much—how can i put it ? —
so this is how you live , sonya !
here he comes himself onto the porch of the house
but the person he really feared was svidrigaylov
bazarov is no longer haunted by wondering : the question of the date of the approaching anniversary has been answered and we have come to the scene of bazarov 's grave , to the grieving parents , to turgenev 's assertion that the flowers speak of eternal reconciliation and not just of
he could not get the sound of her voice out of his ears ; the very folds of her dress seemed to hang in a special way , more gracefully and elegantly than all the rest , and her movements were particularly smooth , yet natural at one and the same time
what does it mean to run away ?
i ’ ve told him so much about you at different times
either he did it on purpose , or else he was very drunk
at the age of twenty-eight he would already earned the rank of captain ; a brilliant career lay ahead of him
so she hands the promissory note over to this chebarov in payment for something , and he lodges a formal claim , and won ’ t be put off
you ’ ll drive yourself mad this way , i can assure you
once he began to recover , he recalled his dreams when he ’ d lain there in a fever and delirium
in public carriages or in shops , seizing upon some listener , she would lead the conversation to her son , his article , how he helped a student , how he was burned in the fire , and so forth
there is nothing left for me but , in the words of the gipsy song , to take off my hat with a very low bow
but especially avdotya romanovna
i ’ m fond of children in general , very fond of them , svidrigaylov said with a laugh
zametov seemed a little confused , but not overly so
what does talent and even erudition have to do with that ?
it must have been that the young man glanced at her with some special sort of look , because her former distrust suddenly flashed in her eyes again
well , just imagine that as i was on the train on my way here , i was counting on you to tell me something new and on the fact that i might be able to borrow something from you !
i ’ ll head out now , to petrovsky park : somewhere in there i ’ ll choose a large bush , dripping with rain , such that if i touch it at all with my shoulder , millions of drops will splash down on my head
but raskolnikov , expecting something completely different , regarded him vacantly and pensively and made no reply , as if he were definitely hearing petr petrovich ’ s name for the first time
they all live together in one room ; sonya has her own room , with a partition
any sort of excitement can be harmful we will talk more about it
the forms and types with which we can be contented and feel no need to look further have not yet been and perhaps never will be created by life
you must excuse my persistence ( i ’ m really sorry to bother you like this ) , but don ’ t you see : you ’ ve managed to reassure me now about my mistake , confusing your two categories , but
if i know , raskolnikov continued , staring steadfastly at her face as if he lacked the power to look away
he began to appear everywhere as soon as he became an officer
there must be some other motive , but what is it ?
well , here you are !
this boulevard was always deserted , and now , after one o ’ clock and in such heat , there was almost no one there at all
he surveyed raskolnikov ’ s cramped and shabby ship ’ s cabin with uncertainty , even with the pretense of a certain fright , almost as though taking offense
who spit on them ?
do you understand what it is that angers me most ?
after about ten minutes , however , she felt significantly calmer
he went on at length , trying to show off his erudition , and then left , tail between his legs
ja , herr kapitän , and he vas a nein respectable guest , herr kapitän , in mein respectable haus
then he said that he himself was not wealthy and that his entire estate would pass to his children , who are now living with their aunt
the crisis of culture , wrote the russian philosopher nikolai berdyaev in , reveals itself in a longing to escape from the middle course into some sort of all-resolving end
what will i do with them , rodion romanych !
what do you think ?
when he ’ d bowed to the earth a second time in the haymarket , turning to the left he ’ d glimpsed sonya some fifty paces away from him
her scarlet lips were aglow , burning or what ?
her light blond , slightly grayed hair was thickly smeared with grease
comforting oneself in the hard moments of life with a lofty goal is , if you will , just the same as drinking unsweetened tea while gazing on a piece of sugar hung from the ceiling
providence , accident , irony or fate ?
you have comforted me greatly
dunechka smiled at him , blushed , quickly withdrew her hand , and followed her mother out , also feeling happy for some reason
well this , my esteemed laviza ivanovna , is my last word , and i won ’ t tell you again , continued the lieutenant
yes , i ’ m really a louse , he continued , clinging to his thought with malice , burrowing into it , playing with it , enjoying it
is what they say about her completely true , huh ?
besides , i was looking for you , gentlemen , not to pay you any compliments ; in the first place , i wanted to let you know we will be eating soon ; in the second place , i wanted to warn you , evgeny you are a clever lad , you understand people , and you understand women ; therefore , you will forgive them your mother requested a church service to celebrate your coming home
you should have seen how i chatted with her papa and mama !
he ’ ll be cared for by his own people ; they ’ ll help right away , or else he ’ ll die before he gets to the hospital
luiza ivanovna , why don ’ t you take a seat ?
while i , perhaps , so to speak , have burned with devotion and lofty feelings ; in addition , i have importance , rank , and position !
raskolnikov himself lay on his back in silence and stubbornly , though without thinking , studied the gentleman who had just entered
i hope you ’ ll be cured of your mental illness and your shortsightedness
nastasya , who came in at ten o ’ clock the next morning , roused him with difficulty
he ’ s only known her since yesterday , and he didn ’ t even recognize her when she entered
perhaps , i ’ ll come
this is his doctor , who ’ s just examined him
what else was it that i wanted to say , he continued , trying to recall
how does it go in that tale
here i am , you see , just like cincinnatus , preparing a bed for some late turnips
that settled all my doubts ; he ’ s the culprit , no doubt about it
nikolai petrovich was forced to rummage through twenty boxes and trunks to find them
will not raise the question of talent and artistic merit but rather whether its author is the historian or ringleader of the party
you won ’ t know it even an hour before that you ’ ll come forward with a confession
it was a green cotton shawl , probably the same one marmeladov had mentioned back then , the family shawl
how your understanding still hinders you !
he added in a timid voice
he would have calmly overstepped all those obstacles
not a word here , or i ’ ll
what a thing to say , sir
pavel petrovich kirsanov was educated first at home , like his younger brother , nikolai , and subsequently in the corps of pages '
meatless cabbage soup with cockroaches in it ?
so you see , evgeny , said arkady , finishing his story , how unfair you were to judge my uncle !
where your free mind draws you
arkady and bazarov spent their fifteen days at odintseva 's in just such a manner
i almost got into a fight !
and it would have been to no avail !
he left quietly , without hurrying , unaware of his fever , full of an immense , new feeling of full , powerful life surging within him
the small nobleman 's house built in the moscow style where avdotya ( or evdoksiya ) nikitishna kukshina lived , stood on one of the recently burnt-out streets in the town of ; it 's a well-known fact that our provincial towns burn down every five years or so
even before the novel was published his editor , mikhail katkov , protested to turgenev
according to you , they are fine fellows , is not that so ?
katya dropped both hands and the basket into her lap ; she lowered her head , her eyes following arkady for a long time
pavel petrovich once again turned the book over in his hands and glanced at his brother from under his brows
but tell me this : how does one distinguish the extraordinary people from the ordinary ones ?
i ’ m fed up with all of this , sir , do you hear , and have been for some time
yesterday i was in great danger and thought all was lost ; today things have improved
some of them were over forty years old , but others were only about seventeen ; almost all had black eyes
hey , bring me some water !
death is bearable because life goes on
once and for all i realize that it ’ s not for me to try to understand or demand to know your reasons
what on earth are you saying ?
i think tea 's ready , odintsova announced
nowhere is there anything firm or solid ; nowhere is there any core
who knows , perhaps we were talking at the very same moment he was lying here , devising his own plan
good-bye , rodya , that is , until we meet ; i don ’ t like saying good-bye
there was something infinitely disgusting and offensive in that laughter , in those eyes , in all the nastiness in the child ’ s face
it seems that now
instead , this letter arrived this morning
fedka served the meal , obviously encumbered by unfamiliar boots ; he was aided by a woman named anfisushka , who had a masculine face and only one eye , who performed the duties of housekeeper , poultry keeper , and laundress
did he reproach himself for his own weakness ?
well , and if you ’ re not up to it , will you repent ?
the older girl , half awake , trembled like a leaf
razumikhin stood there deep in thought and uneasiness , trying to ponder something
paris , march ( ) , i have not yet received a copy of my tale , but three letters have already arrived about the thing from pisemsky , dostoevsky , and maykov
go out for a stroll ; but don ’ t go too far
you ’ re lying , you slanderer !
however , just to one side , about fifteen paces away , at the edge of the street , stood a gentleman , who , by all appearances , also very much wanted to approach the young woman for some purpose
instead , arkady , who has absorbed much more of the homely prosaic values of his mother and father than he realizes , comes to appreciate katya bit by tiny bit , while she is still in the background and his attention is focussed mainly on odintsova
did you see him ?
raskolnikov paused in the entryway
the certificate of merit was immediately passed around by the drunken guests , which katerina ivanovna did not prevent , because it really did indicate en toutes lettres that she was the daughter of a decorated court councillor , and as a result , almost in fact a colonel ’ s daughter
a little surprise , sir , right here , waiting on the other side of my door , hee-hee-hee !
you ’ re exactly what i want , he cried , grabbing him by the arm
the sanctioning of bloodshed as a matter of conscience ; why , in my opinion , that ’ s more terrible than an official or legal sanction to shed blood
he regarded them closely
this man has become used to looking on dreams as on a whim , peculiar to idleness and aristocratic pampering ; he has begun to consider moral sufferings to be products of daydreams ; moral aspirations and actions as imagined and ridiculous
you imagine that you are progressive ; you should be sitting in a kalmuck wagon !
and he set off toward sonya ’ s apartment
he was suddenly struck by the fact that sonya wanted to go with him
the idea ( ie , the form ) of fathers and sons is biographical
that old pawnbroker says ?
oh , where is the golden age of our youth ? )
he stared cautiously and distrustfully at the unexpected guest
you have probably experienced this more than once yourself
the obvious poverty of their apparel managed to convey to both ladies a look of special distinction , which always happens with those who know how to wear humble clothes
moreover , we ’ ll devise our own casuistry , we ’ ll learn from the jesuits , and perhaps we ’ ll reassure ourselves for a while , persuade ourselves that it ’ s necessary , really necessary for a good cause
raskolnikov entered almost exactly at the same time they were returning from the cemetery
managing the estate did not arouse any revulsion in him : he even used to dream about agricultural activity with pleasure , but at the present time other thoughts were swarming in his head
that 's also hard to believe
fenechka sat down in silence on the edge of the armchair
bazarov is my favorite child , for whom i quarreled with katkov , on whom i expended all the colors at my disposal , bazarov , that bright man , that hero—a caricature ?
he considers it completely unnecessary to lay any restraint whatsoever on himself
and right now , this very minute , without delay !
he felt terribly distressed
and just who might you be , sir ?
you see how i trust you , arkady ivanovich , that ’ s just how she put it
bazarov extended his long , tough fingers arkady turned around and prepared , as if in jest , to resist but his friend 's face appeared so malicious , his twisted grin and gleaming eyes contained such an earnest threat , that arkady felt an instinctive fear
what sort of truth is that ?
he was afraid of sonya
they both went out at last
she cried in a heart-rending wail and rushed to katerina ivanovna
i endured all the torment of this chatter , sonya , and wanted to shake it all off my shoulders : i wanted , sonya , to kill without casuistry , to kill for myself , for myself alone !
i heard about that murder before you told me , and i ’ m very interested in it
bryullov replied : art begins where the tiny bit begins
he was agitated and didn ’ t try to hide it
you don ’ t understand a thing , not a thing !
but instead of that , his head slid down onto the pillow again ; an unbearable chill rendered him numb once more ; he pulled his coat over himself again
her pale cheeks flushed once more , and her eyes expressed her torment
anna sergeevna wanted to say a kind word or two to him , but did not know where to begin
in general he was an extremely well-preserved man who seemed much younger than his years
the food 's well prepared , is not it ?
petr petrovich moved his arm around in a circle , displaying the banknote to everyone
you know , my precious rodya , it seems to me , for several reasons ( however , by no means related to petr petrovich , but just so , for some of my very own , personal , perhaps even old-womanish whims ) —it seems to me that perhaps i ’ d be better off if , after their wedding , i were to live on my own , as i do now , and not with them
vasily ivanovich left the room
it 's all the same thing
he crossed himself several times
in a word , he chooses the lesser of two evils , although he feels no attraction even to the lesser evil
everything receded immediately , and his thoughts became clear
porfiry was silent , as if pondering
he wrote that turgenev , with his devotion to timeless truth and beauty , only wanted to describe reality , not to judge it
several times , however , it happened that she herself began a conversation in which it became impossible , in answering her , not to mention where rodya was at the present time ; when the replies were , of necessity , unsatisfactory and suspect , she suddenly became extremely sad , gloomy , and taciturn , which condition continued for a very long time
besides , who wants to be a cardsharp ?
we arranged all that to upset you , therefore we intentionally spread the rumor that he would leak to you
well , just like that he ’ ll circle , circle around me , like a moth around a flame ; his freedom will no longer satisfy him ; he ’ ll start thinking , become confused , leading himself all around ; he ’ ll get tangled up in a net and worry himself to death !
then he declared that he himself would seek a meeting with you , by any means possible
it was completely unbecoming , sir
someone stood imperceptibly next to the lock and , precisely the way he was doing outside , was listening , hiding inside , apparently , also pressing one ear to the door
her light blue dress trimmed with white lace spread out around her chair like a balloon and filled almost half the room
raskolnikov was already entering the apartment
revolution , while clearly anticipating his portrayal of yelena and insarov in on the eve
soaked to the skin , at twenty minutes past eleven he called at the crowded apartment of his fiancée ’ s parents on vasilievsky island , at the corner of malyi prospect and the third line
who made me a judge to decide who gets to live and who doesn ’ t ?
it was an attempt to give flesh and substance to his image of the new men , whose mysterious , implacable presence , he declared , he felt about him everywhere , and who inspired in him feelings that he found difficult to analyse
almost crying herself ( which didn ’ t hinder her incessant and uninterrupted rapid speech ) , katerina ivanovna pointed at her sniveling children
did you , i ask , see mitrei ?
although petr petrovich was kind enough to take upon himself a portion of the cost of our journey to the capital , namely , he offered to convey at his expense our baggage and a large trunk ( somehow through his acquaintances there ) , we still have to consider our arrival in petersburg , where we can ’ t show up without a kopeck , if only for the first few days
the rudins did not become practical men , from them came a new generation , which regards its predecessors with reproach and mockery
his head was spinning
where do we put him ?
and now you stand here looking so beautiful
children are a social question and one of primary importance , i agree ; but the question of children will be resolved in another manner
here 's an example : in a few minutes it will be ten o'clock and i know full well you will chase me out
yet can our interpretation of the novel stop here ?
i embrace you very , very warmly and kiss you endlessly
around one o'clock in the morning , he made an effort to open his eyes and saw before him in the lamplight his father 's pale face and ordered him to go away ; he obeyed , but immediately crept back in on tiptoe and , half-hidden by the
so , i ’ m amusing myself for the sake of fantasy : games !
if they ’ d both left , the door would have been locked with a key from the outside , and not with the bolt from inside
it is not adequate , he insists , to think of ideas only as being highly formulated ; they need not be pellets of intellection or crystallizations of thought , precise and completed
he didn ’ t want to ask anyone about anything
according to me , bazarov objected , raphael is not worth a damn and they are no better than he is
the sun shone so brightly in his eyes that it was painful for him to see and he felt very dizzy—the usual sensation of a feverish person who suddenly comes outside into the blinding sunshine
cholera began to make an appearance here and there in the neighborhood and even carried off two people from marino itself
i still wo not understand a thing
the connection between the two appears even more ineluctable to anyone who has seen the famous photo of secenov , taken in , the year turgenev completes fathers and sons : we see a fierce-eyed , hirsute young man sitting at his work table in the medico-surgical academy , complete with bunsen burner , electrical charging mechanism and a laboratory clamp from which are suspended—of course—three frogs
raskolnikov said all of a sudden
mama writes that you can tolerate many things
bazarov separates himself from ordinary life
the titles alone are worth the price !
in his own work he is lost in the woods
i began telling him everything that happened , and he began pacing around the room , beating his chest : what , he says , what are you scoundrels doing to me ?
the previous , horribly tormenting , hideous feeling returned to him all the more distinctly and vividly ; he shuddered with every sound , yet it seemed more and more enjoyable to him
cried porfiry petrovich cheerfully
you were a student or you ’ ve studied at the university !
andrey semyonych thought about this and remembered it subsequently
a student , naturally , or former student !
but , my goodness , what sort of clothes is he wearing ?
am i much too agitated ?
she took a commission , went about on business , and had a large clientele because she was so honest and always set the best price : whatever price she stated , she stuck to it
if you dare take even one step forward , i swear , i ’ ll kill you !
bring them back , sonya , bring them back !
you can imagine how that ’ ll affect her
what do people usually say ?
so , we meet again , as you promised
why do i hate them now ?
so , you don ’ t love me ?
listen : he knows the merchant vakhrushin !
oh , you ’ re so rude , you even interpret—forgive me—the word development ’ in a stupid manner !
he 's embittered and gloomy—that 's what 's so terrible
or can i perhaps take him away from you ?
out , — experience again told me—perhaps mistakenly , but , i repeat , scrupulously ; there was no reason for hair-splitting , and i had to depict him precisely that way
are you in good health ?
excuse me , but i must say that the rumors that have reached you , or , better to say , those conveyed to you , haven ’ t the least trace of solid foundation , and i
perhaps everyone will join you
this amount ( i can now explain it all to you , precious rodya ) she ’ d accepted mostly so she could send you sixty rubles , which you needed then and which you received from us last year
pushkin felt that deeply ; not for nothing did he write in his immortal sonnet , that sonnet that every beginning writer should memorize and remember like a commandment ;
forgive a stupid old woman like me
at that moment his father , who ’ d been chasing him , finally grabs hold of him and leads him away from the crowd
und no shkandal , none vatever , und zey came trunken , und i vill tell all , herr kapitän , und i ’ m not guilty
besides , this businesslike and earnest man seemed in such disharmony with the entire gathering ; in addition , it was clear that he had come for something important , probably only some unusual reason could bring him into such company ; therefore something was about to happen , something would occur
saying good night to his mother , he kissed her forehead ; she embraced him and stealthily crossed him three times behind his back
does he really take me for an innocent man ?
hey , listen to an old man , i ’ m speaking in earnest , rodion romanovich
was he grasping at straws ?
and this is called nihilism , bazarov repeated again , this time with particular rudeness
be so good as to provide the required response
but then , on the slope of a gently rising hill at long last there appeared a small village where bazarov 's parents lived
ah , you ’ re not asleep ; well , here i am !
what ’ s the matter , rodya , i don ’ t know , she said at last
i prefer cigars , too , but it 's extremely difficult to obtain them in remote areas like this
only where his trousers were frayed and the fringe hung down did there remain some thick spots of dried blood
but in the doorway , her rear end collided with a stately officer who had a fresh , open face and who sported a splendid , thick blond mustache
even organ grinders can scrape money together ; now everyone will pay special attention to us and will realize that we ’ re a poor , respectable family of orphans , reduced to poverty
bazarov 's whole depiction in this novel is only the beginning , the embryo of some future figure
thanks for the offer , anna sergeevna , and for the flattering opinion of my conversational skills
but why should pisarev 's ideal interest us ?
soon his eyes came to rest on little lidochka ( his favorite )
i must attend the funeral of that same civil servant who was trampled by horses , about whom you
here one must hold one 's personal antipathy in check since under some conditions it can turn into the involuntary slander of people who do not have the opportunity to defend themselves with the same weapons
he went right to sonya ’ s room
haven ’ t you done the same thing ?
in essence , then , through the dialectic , chaos metamorphoses into cosmos , duality into unity
isn ’ t dunya home , mama ?
and this can happen with the cleverest fellow , with a psychologist or a writer , sir !
katya went to the piano unwillingly ; arkady , although he really did love music , followed her unwillingly
she stared intently at the bed and at the priest ; she was also panting from running so fast
this stillness is because of the moon , thought raskolnikov
when the cuckold ’ s horns are worn openly , as in a common-law marriage , then they no longer exist ; they ’ re inconceivable and even lose the designation as horns
that ’ s the worst thing you could do !
and if he had no other way open to him , he would have strangled her without letting her utter a sound , without even stopping to think !
and all of this was about to fall through !
at the one place in the novel where he exposes his inner feelings with ruthless honesty , the scene beneath the haystack , there is the following solemn exchange :
that 's what i think , too
an enraged razumikhin roared at last
it 's all the same , sir ; i express myself so i will be understood ; i am no seminary rat
so that ’ s my fault as well ?
he said to himself
andrey semyonych can bear witness to all this
he grabbed the bottle of wine and hurled it offhandedly out the window
that alyona ivanovna ’ s really terrified you !
everyone gets rich in his own way , so i also wanted to do so quickly
did you promise to marry her , perhaps
did you think i had water in my veins ?
perhaps you ’ re just telling lies , replied raskolnikov
what ’ s it matter to you ?
they had been awake since seven , or even earlier
at least in a properly organized society it wo not make any difference whether a person 's stupid or clever , bad or good
he asked suddenly and burst into puzzling laughter
did you really see him ?
i ’ m completely certain of it even without you
bazarov and odintsova argue about art and the ideology of love , about nihilism versus romanticism , but something else that they do not notice is happening
perhaps we ’ ll become closer
is that also a moral phenomenon ?
no—i needed her tears ; i needed to see her fear , to see how her heart aches and how she suffers !
oh , how bazarov would have made fun of him , if only he would known what he was feeling at that moment !
bazarov is a man ready for life , and can not find it
sonechka replied suddenly , in a strong and swift whisper , and then suddenly dropped her eyes again
it was apparent that he was prepared to wait a long time
pavel petrovich asked with studied courtesy
the princess had retired to her own room upstairs ; she could not stand guests in general , especially these new wild-looking ones , as she called them
don ’ t worry , i won ’ t let him get her , sir , said the mustachioed policeman and set off after them
even so , i have forgiven him !
a doctor was here , a priest , too , and everything ’ s in order
it ’ s clear as day , clear as day , nikodim fomich repeated excitedly
done for , no doubt !
raskolnikov couldn ’ t keep from laughing
perhaps he ’ ll never love anyone , replied razumikhin abruptly
when he is sick , he takes medicine , although he feels no direct inclination to swallow castor oil or assafetida
in its own way
he muttered , growing pale and moving toward the wall
in his heart and soul he was delighted with his friend 's proposal , but he considered it his obligation to conceal his emotions
love dunya , your sister , rodya ; love her as she loves you , and know that she loves you without limit , more than she loves herself
it must be so , because as soon as sofiya semyonovna entered the room , petr petrovich asked me , were you here ?
she held the gun ready
she finally grew so sick and tired of him , even though at first she would say that she would have been completely lost had it not been for this obliging and generous man
he braced himself with all his might , preparing for some terrible and unknown catastrophe
i do not want to become delirious , he whispered , clenching his fists , what nonsense that is !
so you won ’ t be at katerina ivanovna ’ s tomorrow ?
in the corridor they bumped into luzhin : he showed up precisely at eight o ’ clock and was searching for the number of the room , so all three of them entered together , but without looking at or greeting each other
in general , something oppressed him inside , but not too much
in particular , don ’ t ask him about his health
oh , these vile characters !
when would you appear , at what moment ?
then , all that morning , as if intentionally , one unpleasantness followed another
it was as if during all this horrible time his heart had suddenly softened
have you ever heard how people with this illness breathe
even your hands are trembling !
what book do you have there ?
bazarov 's appearance on the scene offers her a chance to escape from this temporal stagnation ; after all , he is the quintessential man of history pss ,
katerina ivanovna immediately emphasized to her that since she was a slut , she couldn ’ t judge what genuine nobility really was
well , yes something like an epidemic
the sun was scorching ; a smell of warm rye bread wafted from the dark passage of the carriage inn
as is well known , turgenev spent the winter of - in berlin , where he shared quarters with a fellow hegelian , mikhail bakunin , and attended lectures on hegelian philosophy given by the letter 's berlin disciples and interpreters
bazarov is something else
bazarov looked around the room
the proximity of the haymarket , the abundance of certain establishments , and , primarily , the population of tradesmen and craftsmen , all crowded into these streets and lanes of central petersburg , sometimes filled the general panorama with such subjects that it would be strange to be surprised at all on meeting another such figure
i can ’ t just up and reveal everything to you , hee-hee !
and he himself would not now deny the fact that he ’ d known it all at the time
he merely felt and knew that everything had to change , one way or another , no matter how , he repeated with desperate , resolute self-assurance and decisiveness
the old woman dug into her pocket for her keys and went into the other room behind the curtain
all of a sudden he shuddered
they ’ ve simply detained them , but one shouldn ’ t assume
well , and has arkasha been here again ?
bewildered figure simultaneously attacked by frantic democrats from the left and threatened by armed fathers from the right , as he stood helplessly between them
half an hour ago , ilya petrovich , the police superintendent ’ s assistant , on the staircase
one doesn ’ t have to go far : do you know how , a year and a half ago , he astounded me , shocked me , and was nearly the death of me , when he decided to marry that girl , what ’ s her name—the daughter of this zarnitsyna woman , his landlady ?
vasily ivanovich grew animated
oh , that was a long time ago !
he couldn ’ t even imagine such brutality , such rage
you ’ re being pursued and tormented on a stupid , foul suspicion
he said suddenly in a low but clear , intelligible voice
how do you explain his finding the earrings , if he really found them as he maintains ?
annoyances stemming from running the household depressed him ; it always seemed to him that nikolai petrovich , in spite of his zeal and love for hard work , did not set about things in the right way , although he was unable to specify the exact nature of nikolai 's failings
please do not be angry , evgeny , continued vasily ivanovich , wo not you let me check your pulse ?
what lies you ’ re telling !
i merely said that in his own way he was a good man !
there was a dresser against the third wall
his movements were precise and assured , his certain intentions clear
excuse my audacity , but you do not love me and never will , is not that so ?
thousands of lives saved from wrack and ruin—for one life ?
only now do i see clearly the full absurdity of my faintheartedness , now that i have resolved to face this unnecessary shame !
i didn ’ t leave the country for seven years
marry fenechka she loves you ; she 's the mother of your son
in spite of all my desires , i was unable to meet you yesterday
he was very poor and he alone supported himself completely , earning money by some sort of work
what do you think , judging by the nature of our legal system : will they accept such facts , are they even capable of accepting them—based exclusively on a psychological impossibility , on their mental disposition—as irresistible facts obliterating all accusatory and material evidence , no matter what they are ?
ilya petrovich had seated himself and was rifling through some papers
listen , arkady that 's the way contemporary young people should express themselves !
no shouting , if you please !
who do not pay their quitrent ?
thank god , i am free , i have no children what was that i just said ?
raskolnikov was out of breath and didn ’ t finish what he was saying
besides , the state councillor ivan ivanovich klopshtok—have you ever heard of him ?
he ’ s worn that shirt of his too long , like some old rag , and torn it all to pieces
even nastasya hadn ’ t touched it
i myself am renting a room from lodgers
toward morning the fever worsened a bit and he became slightly delirious
ah , you don ’ t know her ?
what a slippery fish you are !
sometime i will tell you the story of my life but first you must tell me yours
are you all ears ?
then you don ’ t know such a virtuous man !
razumikhin opened the door and stood on the threshold for some time , as if in thought
the coach headed in the direction of nikolskoe
i ’ d still like to have a few words with you
you smoke , do not you ?
for a moment , he left the young woman and approached the gentleman
it was delivered only a quarter of an hour ago , raskolnikov replied loudly and over his shoulder , also suddenly and unexpectedly growing angry , even taking a certain pleasure in this feeling
he made a complete confession to her
it turned out that a doctor lived two houses away
why did you come looking for me when i first fell ill ?
but , in spite of the fact that we may very soon be meeting in person , i ’ ll still be sending you some money in a few days , as much as i can
but if that were the case , of course they ’ d be coming for him at any moment , because
this was the first time he would become aware of any distance between him and his son ; he felt that with each passing day this distance would increase
you bushy beard , you
the present condition of the people demands it , arkady added pompously
cried porfiry petrovich , emerging from his momentary stupor
and when we started scrutinizing your article then , when you began expounding on it—we understood each and every one of your words in two ways , as if there were another word implied by each !
she had been singing her rhymed ditty with the same serious and respectful look on her face
he ’ s insane , thought raskolnikov
arkady lowered his eyes
either in the family or in the social sphere , that does not deserve absolute and merciless rejection
he thought suddenly in a fit of unlimited malice
what seems to enrage bazarov is that arkadi can accept the unity of life and death , can see death as a part of life rather than as its negation
so , what should i do , tell me !
repeated lebezyatnikov , staring directly at him
they ’ ll be carted off to the police
even i know she wasn ’ t a louse , he replied , looking at her strangely
one way or another , i can state once more : there would ’ ve been no unpleasantness if it hadn ’ t been for the incident in the garden
he is not interested in the trifles of which commonplace human relationships are composed ; it would be impossible to insult him with obvious disdain or to make him happy with signs of respect ; he is so full of himself and stands so unshakably high in his own eyes that he is almost completely indifferent to other people 's opinions
he whispered at last
about ten minutes passed
they ’ ll come to an agreement !
no , what do you think , the same one about whom it ’ s said that this girl
she was shy and compliant , but only to a certain extent
greift nur hinein ins volle menschenleben !
raskolnikov rushed after him
evgeny vasilich , tell me , what 's going on ?
it was very dark on the narrow , steep stairs
so they ’ re really in there !
another reference to chernyshevsky ’ s novel what is to be done ?
you have to trick the cleverest person with the simplest matter
aniska doesn ’ t make them like this
she would smile and bow to them ; they all loved it when she smiled at them
but when he reached the bottom , he suddenly heard hurried footsteps behind him
svidrigaylov muttered to himself , frowning
a quotation from nikolai gogol ’ s ( – ) comedy the government inspector ( )
let me kiss the hem of your dress , let me , please !
i haf respectable haus , herr kapitän , und respectable vay of life , herr kapitän , and i never , never vanted no shkandal in mine haus
ah , rodya , all this happened before two o ’ clock
he looked at this unhappy deranged woman almost with torment
he spat in disgust and hastened back to the crystal palace to interrogate zametov as quickly as possible
like kukshina—she still has the nicest pair of shoulders i have seen in a long time
first , that an interplay between science and literature is possible because both are , in the end , exercises in language
suddenly he wanted to understand precisely what was so strange about her
there was nowhere to hide
you may be right ; an outsider can see things more clearly
i must tell you
anna sergeevna started to say , but the wind came up , rustled the leaves , and carried her voice away
moreover , each does so in the same way , by psychologically entrenching a sense of self in a single temporal stage : one in the past , one in the present , and one in the future
he has become an icon
it ’ s past ten o ’ clock !
five months after the criminal ’ s confession came his sentencing
he 's more deserving of compassion than mockery
imagine , one of my neighbors , a retired major , also treats patients
dunechka shuddered and came to herself
at the beginning of his prison term , he ’ d thought that she would torment him with religion , that she would talk about the gospel , and pester him with books
dunya was in a frenzy
really , i thought i would have some sort of fit ; i never imagined that i could reach such a state of frenzy
and she also didn ’ t like her cap with the new ribbons : isn ’ t this stupid german woman taking pride in the fact that she ’ s the landlady and has agreed to help some poor lodgers out of charity ?
asked nastasya , holding a saucer in her open hand and sipping her tea through a lump of sugar†
why did you lead her on then ?
he found bazarov at the inn where they were staying and spent a long time persuading him to visit the governor
at least , that was how he saw it
she timidly prepared herself to listen to him
guzbery jam , lots of fresh flowers , and a songbird in a cage
it was a spacious , lofty room , furnished rather elegantly , but without any particular taste
he rejects life yet at the same time lives profoundly and strongly
he ’ d arrived there , removed his cross , a silver one , and asked for a glass of vodka in exchange
i got all mixed up !
yet i am assured that i was on the side of the fathers i , who in the character of pavel kirsanov even erred against artistic truth and overdid it , practically turned his faults into caricature , made him comic !
with that , and conveying my special regards to the respected avdotya romanovna , i beg you to accept my feelings of respectful devotion ,
i ’ m certain that she already understands half of it
we physiologists know what these relations are
i ’ ve reached the conclusion that it ’ s now best for us to be forthright with one another , continued porfiry petrovich , tilting his head back slightly and lowering his eyes , as if not wishing to embarrass his former victim with his gaze and disregarding his previous tricks and subterfuge
but what 's to be done ?
he starts to cry
what are you doing ?
that , of course , was the catch , because it was the very point pulkheriya aleksandrovna was now too afraid to mention
cried the young man
i ’ ll grab hold of you , tie you up in a bundle , carry you home under my arm , and lock you up
you know rodya ’ s character best of all , and you can advise us best of all
that morning he scrubbed himself diligently , with soap provided by nastasya ; he washed his hair , his neck , and especially his hands
seeing this , she neither pulled the door back nor let go of the handle , the result being that he almost yanked her out onto the landing along with the door
just half an hour ago , while escorting raskolnikov home , although he had been excessively talkative , as he himself would admit , he ’ d been feeling completely fearless and almost renewed , in spite of the enormous quantity of alcohol he ’ d consumed that evening
about the murder of the old woman , the pawnbroker , the civil servant ’ s widow
he was standing near the wall , arms folded across his chest , regarding her with a fiery gaze
no , i ’ m gloomy : i don ’ t do any harm , just sit in a corner ; sometimes they can ’ t make me talk for three days in a row
consider that varents spent seven years living with her husband , abandoned her two children , and in her letter she quipped to her husband , i realized that i couldn ’ t be happy with you
ritter toggenburg ( the knight toggenburg )
he himself had requested it from her not long before his illness , and she ’ d brought him the book without comment
i confess , i even wanted to call on you and have it all out , but i thought that perhaps you ’ d
and the main thing is , he ’ s so crude , filthy , with manners of the tavern ; and
we will have to tell him we quarreled over politics
pour monter notre ménage
he ’ s had a fever since yesterday , she added
but immediately , at that very moment , she understood everything
odintsova turned her head slightly
but , having decided to do something stupid , the friends maintained an even more stubborn silence than before and even seemed angry
were you in your right mind then ?
drunks are leaving the taverns , he thought
raskolnikov said , brushing him aside , after listening with disgust to the strained playfulness of his account of the purchase of the clothes
and so he rages at others but feels that he should really rage at himself more than at them
she would inherited her mother 's love of order , common sense , and propriety ; but she was so young and lonely ; nikolai petrovich was such a kind , modest man there 's no need to tell the rest
i began with a purpose , but all of this chatter for self-amusement , all these incessant , endless commonplaces , over and over again , have become so loathsome to me over the last three years , that , so help me god , i blush when other people utter them in my presence , let alone when i myself say them
nikolai petrovich wrung his hands surreptitiously , while pavel petrovich laughed and made jokes , especially with bazarov ; he put on a fine white linen shirt , a fashionable morning jacket , and a fez ; he did not allow the curtains to be drawn and complained amusingly about the need to refrain from eating
it was about eight o ’ clock , and the sun was sinking in the sky
they sat her up in bed , supporting her on both sides
just think : i struck her only twice with a riding switch ; it didn ’ t even leave any marks
you must be interested in the women 's question
now the giant 's only task is to die in a decent manner , even though no one really cares about that either all the same , i am not going to start wagging my tail
that 's what got him sent to st helena , father aleksei replied and trumped the ace
bazarov 's appearance reassured him immediately , although a more experienced eye might have discerned in the still energetic , but haggard figure of his unexpected guest signs of internal agitation
i consider such fine talk indecent
did the doctor really say that ?
right then and there i did myself in , forever !
they are not capable of accommodating themselves to its conditions , not one of them ever attained the rank of head of a department
to a v toporov
but now , at least , i can no longer count on it and , in particular , i don ’ t wish to interfere with the communication of arkady ivanovich svidrigaylov ’ s secret proposals , which he authorized your brother to convey and which , as i see , have an important , perhaps even extremely pleasant significance for you
i even had the pleasure of interesting you in my opinions
bazarov leaves almost completely rejected and again begins to be amazed at himself and to upbraid himself
that 's why i heard you coughing last night , said arina vlasevna
what are you talking about ?
dmitry prokofich , thanks be to him , drops in to see me and talks all about you
svidrigaylov led the astonished raskolnikov farther away , into a corner
fix your dress , polechka , the shoulders have slipped down , she remarked through her cough as she caught her breath
that ’ s precisely how it was !
what can one do ?
it is high time , he wrote p v annenkov in , for the french people to take a look at themselves , inside their own country , and to see their own ulcers and try to cure them
in precisely this way arkady and bazarov spent about two weeks at odintsova 's
that ’ s exactly what i thought !
you can see that they ’ ve been worn , but they ’ ll do you for the next two months or so , because the material and the workmanship are foreign
i ’ ll go at once
it seems that if i could form a strong attachment to something
the traits are so minute here that strong mental magnifying glasses are needed for understanding them , and not everyone is obliged to have them
if bazarovism is a disease , then it is the disease of our time , and must be endured to the end no matter what palliatives and amputations are employed
in other words , there 's something to be gained
it ’ s the last and largest request i make of you
raskolnikov sat there and listened in silence and with disgust
yet here , in this case , one could adopt a whole new approach
valued is even not quite appropriate here : i simply could not and can not work differently ; and in the final analysis there was no reason for me to do so
you say that katerina ivanovna ’ s mind is muddled ; your mind is muddled , too , he said after some silence
the service began , quietly , decorously , somberly
we act on the basis of what we recognize as useful , bazarov replied
and there ’ s one key that ’ s bigger than all the others , three times bigger , with a notched tip ; it ’ s not for the dresser , of course
i don ’ t even know if there was any money there , he added quietly , as if in deep thought
the revelation that oppositions mask an identity is profoundly dialectical in the hegelian sense
the caretaker was standing at the door of his little room and pointing him out to a small man who looked like a tradesman , dressed in a vest and some sort of long robe , and who from a distance very much resembled a peasant woman
he had passed the whole night alone , god knows where
when raskolnikov arrived at his building , his temples were damp with sweat and he was breathing heavily
at first pulkheriya aleksandrovna was speechless with elated surprise ; then she seized his hand and dragged him into the room
well , listen : i came to see you because besides you , i don ’ t know anyone else who could help
then he left the courtyard and headed off to the square
he thought it necessary to inform his son so he would not get angry
arkady went up to his uncle and once again felt the touch of his fragrant mustache against his cheek
he ’ ll begin to run ahead , butting in where he ’ s not asked for , he ’ ll begin talking incessantly about those things he really should keep silent about , he ’ ll use sly allegories , hee-hee !
everyone knows that our real representatives , that the carriers of thought in our generation , have long ago renounced being practical , that active participation in the life around them had long ago become impossible
it was another matter altogether when he met some of his acquaintances or former comrades , whom , in general , he didn ’ t much like seeing
i wouldn ’ t trade him for five lessons in any merchant ’ s house
nothing more ’ s needed today
but upon arrival in petersburg two days ago , he quarreled with me at our first meeting and i drove him away , to which event there are two witnesses
nikolai petrovich explained his state of mind briefly , then moved on
he looked at her in silence and without any particular thoughts
yes , friend , he said , that 's what it means to live with feudal types
when he calls the life a dream , is his point their happiness or the sleepiness of that way of living ?
that 's not the source of their superiority ; is not it that in them there are fewer traces of the slave owner than in us ?
she asked in fear , unintentionally taking a step back
perhaps porfiry ’ s angry that there are no facts and so he burst out with all that
is that a good sign ?
the hotheaded lieutenant was obviously bewildered
i told you all this before , don ’ t you remember ?
do not deny the child anything that comforts him you know what i mean
forgive me for disturbing you , she began , stammering
but it still seemed somewhat harsh to me , and i conveyed this to dunya later
in any case , i must see svidrigaylov as soon as possible , he decided definitively
a hero or a devil ?
you ’ ll suffer and die suffering , she repeated , stretching her arms toward him in desperate entreaty
it is this legacy and its meaning for turgenev 's reputation that i wish to examine
just a little while ago when i was with her , i felt this in my heart !
i have come to put a question to you
just then a whole group of men entered from outside , already quite drunk , with the sound of a rented accordion and the soft , cracked voice of a seven-year-old child singing the little farm
raskolnikov ’ s appearance attracted almost no attention
some sort of prophet ?
you do not believe me ?
half an hour later anna sergeevna entered the study accompanied by vasily ivanovich
in part that was due to the order she maintained in both her house and her life
anna sergeevna 's auntie , the princess kh , a short , slender woman with a face pinched like a fist and nasty , steady eyes under a gray wig , came in
porfiry petrovich was laughing and wished to be laughing , but it was obvious that he needed some sort of explanation
the absence of flirtatiousness and the very harshness of his judgments
over there was freedom ; over there lived other people , not at all like the ones on this side of the river ; it was as if time had stood still there , as if the age of abraham and his flocks had not yet passed
and i , said anna sergeevna , i was depressed at first , god knows why , and even thought about going abroad , just imagine !
can it be that she is only amusing herself with impressions and is not capable of becoming carried away by them ?
she was about to yank the door open so she could let loose a storm of abuse at them , but in the doorway she bumped into mrs lippevekhsel herself , who had just heard about the accident and come running in to restore order
but it turned out to be too much for turgenev ( or for his poetics ) to do what the late dostoevsky did in the brothers karamazov ; that is , to finish the novel , leaving the young heroes alive and their fates open , to call the novel in question only a prehistory—or to refer to that
what sort of surprise ?
i even looked for you under your sofa !
let 's do our duty , precisely as you say , and let 's see if we can achieve happiness in the bargain
but calm down , madam , calm down !
just imagine , it 's pure chance , he replied ; turning to his carriage , he waved his hand five times or so and shouted , follow us , follow us !
he also remained true , i believe , to the idea 'that revolution brings it into effect ' ( yeyo privodit v deystviye revolyutsiya )
where does his father live ?
lately , she ’ d begun chatting more often and at greater length with her elder little girl , the ten-year-old polyenka , who , even though she didn ’ t understand all that much , knew very well that her mother needed her , and therefore followed her with her large clever eyes , pretending with all her might that she understood everything
zosimov started laughing even more than before
i remember everything , to the last detail , but just think : i really can ’ t explain why i did what i did , where i went , or what i said
these three characters are all tragic , therefore , in that none can partake of any intimate relationship with an individual psychically rooted in a phase of time other than the one with which their identity is entwined
unnatural condition , if i may express it that way
the accident of fate that kills him comes only after he has been defeated in every possible social and personal encounter : it is the summation of those encounters
i never expected to die so soon ; to tell you the truth , it 's a most unpleasant circumstance
is that terebeva the same one you told me about , the one who ’ s entered her third common-law marriage ?
the same words could be uttered about turgenev by anybody who has come into close contact with his fiction , essays , and correspondence
they washed the floor ; will they paint it ?
for two years he ’ s been nagging me , telling me to take this thousand and pay him six percent interest
but katerina ivanovna could no longer stand it and rapidly , for all to hear , blurted out that perhaps amaliya ivanovna never even had a vater , that amaliya ivanovna was simply a drunken petersburg finn , and that most likely she had worked somewhere as a cook before , perhaps even worse than that
it 's from lamp oil and sweet clover , said bazarov , yawning
and if there was an attempt to avoid exiling me , they ’ d all go mad from righteous indignation !
for heaven 's sake , the logic of history demands
at last razumikhin looked more cheerfully at avdotya romanovna
it makes no difference !
a little peasant on a white nag was trotting along a dark , narrow path next to the grove ; he was clearly visible , all of him , including the patch on his shoulder , even though he was in the shadows ; the horse 's hooves could be seen plainly rising and falling in a pleasant fashion
in that case i really do not understand that gentleman
this idea alone drove him into a dark rage
he was angry and he was conscious of the fact that he was committing a folly but , nevertheless , went on committing it , because his desire to live for his pleasure was stronger than his desire to be consistent
i did write an article in connection with some book about six months ago , when i left the university , but i sent it to weekly discourses , not periodical discourses
remember that however subtle and complex the inner structure of some tissue in the human body , the skin , for example , nonetheless it is comprehensible and homogeneous
but i must make her acquaintance
you yourself say it ’ s mere psychology ; meanwhile , you ’ ve veered off into mathematics
he wants a radical change and does not shrink from brute force
he took his time ; he even seemed afraid of something
you ’ re our hope , you ’ re our everything !
the policeman understood everything in an instant and thought about it
he ’ s a fine fellow , my friend , you ’ ll see !
besides , the interior door swung open , and several curious onlookers peeked in
all of these circumstances had a certain positive influence on raskolnikov ’ s fate
but the tenderhearted mama immediately began in a low voice and rapid speech to resolve certain important quandaries , namely , that arkady ivanovich was an important man , a man of affairs and connections , a wealthy man—god knows what he had in mind ; he might up and leave , might give away money , and , therefore , there was no reason to be surprised
i ’ ll go back to my own apartment
don ’ t try to make me come back ; it ’ s too late for that
it ’ s a good thing you ’ ve come to , my friend , he said , turning to raskolnikov
if i ’ ve been crying a long time , it ’ s because my maternal heart has foreseen misfortune
and they ’ ve gotten used to it
true , it comes with a guarantee : if you wear this one out , they give you a new one next year at no cost , so help me god !
and you asked for the fringes from your trousers , in such a tearful voice !
one instance ended for the exposed personage in a particularly scandalous way , and the other almost ended in an extremely troublesome manner
i ’ ll tell you everything , because he ’ s such a fool
and odintsov , like all the other characters , becomes interested in him , as she probably had not become interested in anyone else in her whole life
you ’ ve forsaken them , abandoned them
love for one ’ s future partner in life , for one ’ s husband , must exceed the love for one ’ s brother , he announced sententiously
he turned pale , and his lips began to tremble
well , you should know that the murderer ’ s been found ; he himself has confessed and presented all the evidence
setting aside the question of money—you ’ ll excuse me for mentioning it , he said , turning to zosimov , i don ’ t know why i deserve such special attention from you
surely it was impossible to arrive at any other correct interpretation except for one
and so what if in eight years he would be only thirty-two and could start to live his life all over again ?
perhaps you ’ re not a boor at all , he said
the best discussion of this phenomenon is t s eliot 's , in his article , tradition and the individual talent : no poet , no artist of any art , has his complete meaning alone
oh , lord , what would i have thought ?
i could hear it outside on the stairs
then why did you need me ?
that is , you ’ d enjoy someone ’ s hospitality and then spit on it , the same as you would on those who invited you there
besides , he ’ s a very prudent man and of course will realize that his own conjugal happiness will be more assured the happier dunechka is with him
why such a racket ?
however , there ’ s no way of knocking you off track !
thank heaven for that
she said gently and affectionately , as if surprised to see her there
we have to sing something much more respectable
i used a riding switch only twice during all our seven years together ( if you don ’ t count a third time that was , however , extremely ambiguous ) : the first time—two months after our marriage , right after our arrival in the country , and now this latest incident
oh , what dreadful people !
raskolnikov , with pale lips and immobile eyes , quietly approached him , stepping up to the desk ; he rested his hand on it , and tried to speak , but was unable to ; only incoherent sounds emerged
after taking the policeman by the arm , he pulled him over to the bench
yes , repeated bazarov gloomily ; you are still a fool ( [ ] )
now your vaulted sense of self-dignity has betrayed you , bazarov observed phlegmatically , while arkady flared up , his eyes flashing
in a corner on the right was a bed ; near the door leading into the other apartment stood a simple wooden table covered in a blue tablecloth ; two cane chairs were next to the table
in the readers ' eyes bazarov emerges the victor from his trials
a perplexed razumikhin repeated , trying with all his might to refute raskolnikov ’ s conclusions
why indeed did you slip it secretly into her pocket ?
it had all been decided long ago : throw everything into the canal : get rid of all traces and that would be the end of it
his face expressed a certain agitation
in turgenev , heteroglossia and language from the dialogic imagination : four essays by m m bakhtin , edited by michael holquiest , translated by michael holquist and caryl emerson
his soft , loving nature , striving for faith and sympathy , is jarred by corrosive realism ; his delicate esthetic sensibility , not devoid of a large dose of aristocratism , takes offense at the faintest glimmer of cynicism ; he is too weak and sensitive to bear dismal repudiations ; he must become reconciled with existence , if not in the realm of life , at least in the realm of thought , or , more precisely , dreams
i am not lying , pavel petrovich
if he is disliked as he is , with all his ugliness , it means that j am at fault and was not able to cope with the figure i chose
besides , they are russian and i am russian , too , are not i ?
other names were written on the wrappings of the items , and other people came forward on their own , when they heard about it
he had long ago prepared a needle and thread , and they had lain wrapped in paper in the little table
it led to a neighboring apartment with a different number
he ’ s been back with us for a while , since this morning !
but nikolai was left with the feeling of a life well-spent , and his son was growing up before his very eyes ; pavel , on the other hand , a lonely bachelor , was entering into that troubled , twilight phase of life when regrets resemble hopes , and hopes , regrets , when youth has passed , but old age has not yet set in
why , even now she had a right : she was suffering , and that was her fund , so to speak , her capital , which she had the absolute right to expend
me , continued svidrigaylov , shaking with laughter
pavel petrovich found it difficult even when princess r was in love with him ; but when she cooled , and that happened rather soon , he almost lost his mind
for example , you know beforehand , absolutely , that this most well-intentioned and most useful citizen won ’ t give you money under any circumstances because why , i ask , why should he ?
she announced in a thin voice , fedosya nikolaevna is not feeling well and ca not come ; she told me to ask if you will pour the tea yourself or should she send dunyasha ?
he was breathing hard ; his whole body was trembling visibly
the scene produced a strong impression on me and as a consequence the other characters and the action began to take form in my mind
it was at that time i thought , sir , i ’ ll wait , sir !
said bazarov at last
it was almost nine o ’ clock when he passed through the haymarket
i didn ’ t want to travel anywhere ; marfa petrovna invited me to go abroad several times , seeing that i was bored
sonya ’ s letters were filled with the most ordinary reality , the simplest and clearest description of the circumstances of raskolnikov ’ s life as a convict
he was speaking to her but looking to one side , as if he wanted to avoid staring her straight in the eye
herzen , whose disillusionment as a result of was far greater than turgenev 's , spoke of don quixote in a different sense , as the embodiment of the crisis that had overtaken utopian idealism , as the failed idealist who went on repeating the old revolutionary slogans
she repeated to herself
brother , now i know everything , everything
and why , precisely , did they involve you—i also think it superfluous to say
consequently , you ’ re selling yourself for money ; and , consequently , in any case , you ’ re behaving in a vile manner
lebezyatnikov started to head for the door
both , for example , regard self-control as the mark of respect for human dignity and obligations
if they had commanded him to serve them by immediately casting himself headlong down the stairs , he would have done so at once , without considering or hesitating
just imagine , she rushed to where they were eating
it was almost evening ; the sun was hidden behind a small grove of aspens that stood about half a verst from the garden : its shadow stretched endlessly across motionless fields
attractive and feminine coiffures
like a rose in springtime !
the first i heard was from afanasy pavlych , the third day , in the tavern
he added in a loud voice
he plans to cut them up , pavel petrovich observed
john garrad ( new haven : yale university press , ) - , -
what good would it have done to send bazarov to london ?
katerina ivanovna , he began , last week your late husband told me the story of his life and all the circumstances
kukshina also wound up living abroad
it was on the tip of my tongue
that was the more important for me since people whom i trust very much ( i am not talking about kolbasin ) seriously advised me to throw my work into the fire—and only recently ( but this is confidential ) pisemsky wrote me that bazarov is a complete failure
they had already heard from nasta­sya what this capable young man had done for rodya all during his illness ; that phrase was how pulkheriya aleksandrovna raskolnikova herself had described him in her intimate conversation with dunya that very evening
of course , that ’ s what would happen
i think so , too , said pulkheriya aleksandrovna with a defeated look
you see , i haven ’ t been to petersburg in the last ten years
and i ’ d heard about you before , from my late father
do you know , sonya , that low ceilings and cramped rooms oppress the soul and the mind !
listen , he began decisively , as far as i ’ m concerned , you can all go to the devil
perhaps he didn ’ t have enough strength to answer
du hast diamanten und perlen
don ’ t be angry at what i say
it is scientism as a language , as a discursive practice claiming a unique relation to truth that turgenev will test in his fiction
that 's very comforting news
well , just think , porfiry , he could barely stand on his feet , but as soon as we , that is zosimov and i , let him out of our sight yesterday—he got dressed , slipped out , and was up to some mischief almost until midnight , and all this in his total delirium , i tell you
he could have tolerated everything , even shame and disgrace !

no , my friend , no but
† dostoevsky himself endured such an experience in ; he was pardoned and sent into exile
he ’ s not a bad fellow
does he have something on his mind , huh ?
the two young men shared an apartment under the distant supervision of a cousin on their mother 's side , ilya kolyazin , an important man
in general bazarov said very little in the presence of the little old kirsanov men ( as he called the two brothers ) , but that evening he was in a bad mood and sat in silence drinking cup after cup of tea
turgenev 's art , his aesthetic and social thought , involved as they are with limits and compromises in all areas of human existence , constitute a powerful counterweight to the utopian and the apocalyptic in russian social and political thought and ideology
he immediately began stuffing everything into this hole underneath the torn wallpaper
in the first place , you ’ ve needed a change of air for some time
meanwhile , nikolai petrovich had also awakened and set off to see arkady , whom he found already up and dressed
so that 's how it is !
you won ’ t believe , you can ’ t imagine , polyenka , she said , pacing the room , how cheerfully and splendidly we lived at home with your papa , how that drunkard destroyed me , and how he ’ ll destroy all of you , too !
could it really be half past seven ?
the office was about three hundred yards from his house
i was going to your apartment to look for you , began raskolnikov , but why did i suddenly turn into obukhovsky prospect from the haymarket ?
the worshipper of eternal truth and eternal beauty , he had the proud aim of showing the eternal in the temporary and to write a novel neither progressive nor reactionary but , so to speak , constant
she ’ s simply in a frenzy—that is , not sofiya semyonovna , but kate­rina ivanovna is in a frenzy ; but so is sofiya semyonovna
he cried at the top of his lungs
honest faces grew red with indignation at the mere mention of his name '
she lost consciousness again , but this oblivion lasted only a short while
she cried , jumping up from her place
this brutal , fanatical , dedicated figure , with his unused powers , is represented as an avenger for insulted human reason ; yet , in the end , he is crushed by heartless nature , by what the author calls the cold-eyed goddess isis who does not care for good or evil , or art or beauty , still less for man , the creature of an hour ; he struggles to assert himself ; but she is indifferent ; she obeys her own inexorable laws
cried the workman apprehensively
they even loved her gait and would turn to look at her as she went by and would praise her ; they even praised her for being so small ; they didn ’ t even know what else to praise her for
sonya stood in the same place , as if unconscious : she didn ’ t even seem very surprised
i repeat , cried raskolnikov in a fury , i can ’ t tolerate this any longer
if we examine it attentively , we will find that that higher something is not a character but that life which inspires them
a few minutes later bazarov does still worse : he discloses a longing to choke his tender friend arkady , to choke him for no particular reason and in the guise of a pleasant trial already spreads wide his long and hard fingers
what if during that time the axe was needed , she began looking for it , and started yelling—that would arouse suspicion or , at least , grounds for suspicion
but you should know in advance that i don ’ t believe you !
did you know , mikolai , a certain widow and her sister on that day and at that time were murdered and robbed ?
well , now , we ’ ll see what you ’ ve come up with
only the chosen ones are in a position to convey to posterity not only the content but also the form of their thoughts and views , their personality which , generally speaking , does not concern the public
although it was as stuffy as before , he greedily inhaled the stinking , dusty air contaminated by the city
dunya said with a laugh , also agitated
to hell with life !
i wish you happiness
rodion romanych , rodion romanych !
sonechka , my little sweetheart , had merely provided the money , while for the time being , she said , she thought it wouldn ’ t be proper for her to visit us too often , except after dark , so no one would see her
in general , it livens things up
think , mademoiselle , he began sternly , as it were , still exhorting her , consider carefully
to cut other people down to fit your own measure is to fall into narrow-minded intellectual despotism
phew , how people shove each other !
laugh several people in the crowd
you think they won ’ t ?
what ’ s happening there now ?
i wo not argue with that , bazarov said , interrupting
pavel petrovich exclaimed with a sudden burst of emotion
petr petrovich paused and waited , but since nothing followed , he continued :
i merely wanted to say that i ask your forgiveness , mama , he concluded abruptly and sharply
petr petrovich stood up , indicated that sonya should stay where she was , and stopped lebezyatnikov in the doorway
a candle was burning down on the table ; there was an almost empty decanter of vodka , some goblets , bread , glasses , cucumbers , and dishes from tea that had been consumed a long time ago
pushkin has prepared this final statement in stanza : as i caress a sweet little child
perhaps he would have replaced his anger with favor and would have ceased to regard us with reproach and mockery
why did she turn up there ?
and i read about it in the papers !
was it really that the desire for life was so strong and so difficult to overcome ?
there wasn ’ t even anything to be gained by it !
i can ’ t be making a mistake in the amount , because just before your arrival , i ’ d finished my counting and found the total correct
he bent his head down and covered his face with his hands
she may be a fool , just like i am , but what about you ?
her children to kiss her hand in the morning , and gave them her blessing at night—in a word , she lived life just as she pleased
in my opinion , much of this , very much , was unnecessary ; but such was marfa petrovna ’ s character
i do not know how to thank you ; you are really very kind
as a matter of fact , about five minutes later , lebezyatnikov returned with sonechka
a small table stood in front of the sofa
there was a globe depicted on the back of the case
you must have spent several days without anyone to talk to , raskolnikov said
he 's always asking me
he looked timidly at avdotya romanovna ; but at that moment her haughty face expressed gratitude , friendship , and such complete and unexpected respect for him ( instead of mocking glances and the involuntary , badly concealed scorn he had expected ! )
he inquired , going up to pavel petrovich
you see , here ’ s the entrance to sofiya semyonovna ’ s ; you see , no one ’ s home !
you seem to find it wrong that i talk about women in this way ?
in general there is a sobriety to turgenev 's approach to russia and the russian people that is absent from the utterances of so many of his peers , radical and conservative alike
cried his poor mother
he ’ ll certainly die within five or ten minutes
i ’ ll tell you one thing , rodion romanovich , old boy , about myself , to explain my character , so to speak , porfiry petrovich continued , still bustling about the room and , as before , avoiding meeting his guest ’ s eyes
when , one month ago , mr lebezyatnikov beat my wife with his own hands , as i lay there drunk , don ’ t you think i suffered ?
i have money and friends
she was also struck by petr petrovich ’ s dry , businesslike tone , even full of some contemptuous menace
enough , mama , he muttered in embarrassment , squeezing her hand without looking at her
that one , sofiya semyonovna , who was just there
she said very little , but her words revealed her knowledge of life ; from several of her remarks arkady gathered that this young woman had already managed to feel and think a great deal
dunya was simply indispensable to him ; it was unthinkable that he might have to lose her
so then , it ’ s not a gift from her suitor , thought razumikhin , and for some reason felt overjoyed
he turned and left and never came again
then when could it come about ?
well , let ’ s suppose those greenhorns succeeded ; let ’ s suppose each one got away with a million rubles ; well , then what ?
he was already on the first step
porfiry suddenly asked with alarming familiarity
katkov is horrified by that force , power , superiority to the crowd , and ability to subjugate people which he noted in bazarov ; he says it is the contemporary raised to an apotheosis , and despairs for thought and science when people like the author of the tale instead of fighting with the corrupting tendency , strike the colors before it , yield before it , give up , venerate in thought its empty , phosphorescent , and deceptive lustre
in the first place , could you guess , dear rodya , that your dear sister has been living with me for the last month and a half , and we ’ ll no longer be separated in the future
and wrapped himself up in his overcoat
that would be infinitely more advantageous for you , for me as well—because it would be a load off my mind
a couple of years in a row ; then we moved around
well , sir , here ’ s my opinion : i don ’ t sympathize at all with the gentleman who struck that german woman , because , as a matter of fact , what ’ s there to sympathize with ?
must we really consider your every wish our command ?
and he adds , with reference to fathers and sons : there is no personal immortality , no god who cares for man ; nature is even a disease beyond reason—this seems the message turgenev wants to convey
his blood caught fire as soon as he thought about her ; he could have easily coped with his blood , but something else had taken root in him that he would never been able to admit , something he would always mocked , something that irritated his pride
( bazarov was a great lover of women [ velikii okhotnik do zhenshchin ] ;
are you rodion romanovich raskolnikov , a student or former student ?
without boots , you can ’ t go teach
but it was impossible ; still trembling from his chill , he began taking everything off and examining it again
what , after all , is the usual experience of youthful political idealists ?
grown so accustomed ; but it would also be awkward for him to stay on alone
what a mess , just think !
the huge , round copper-red moon shone directly in through the windows
razumikhin brought it to me
why ’ s this policeman coming after me ?
he walked along , looking around absentmindedly and spitefully
the door flew open and on the threshold appeared a squat , short old woman , wearing a white cap and a short colorful blouse
this is a most unpleasant sensation
in addition , he felt endless moral exhaustion , even though his reasoning was functioning better than it had for all these last few days
his novel , the career of a nihilist , paid more than lip service to turgenev 's celebration of the youthfulness of the revolutionary vocation ; it gave overt expression to the religious aspect of it or , as stepniak described his aim in his preface : ' i wanted to show in the full light of fiction the inmost heart and soul of those humanitarian enthusiasts , with whom devotion to a cause has attained the fervour of a religion , without being a religion
god knows whether that 's a good or a bad thing !
otherwise , i won ’ t allow it ; therefore , farewell for the time being , since there ’ s nothing now left for the two of us to talk about
is he not showing off ?
i understand , i do , and it ’ s been a pleasure
their points are well known : crime is a protest against the abnormal structure of society—and that ’ s that , nothing else ; no further reasons are permitted—nothing more !
it is these two types of temporality which , kristeva says , have traditionally been linked to female subjectivity , even though they are not fundamentally incompatible with masculine values
nikolai petrovich merely sighed ; he did not even suspect to whom these words might pertain
we reject more things !
or something of the sort—however , they ’ ll write it for you
but after the generous acquiescence you have demonstrated , i have no right to complain so , everything 's been settled by the way , you do not have any pistols , do you ?
you were wrong to say that , dunya !
to begin with , the dialectic neatly describes the shift in the alignment of characters that occurs in the course of the novel
the remarks and judgments of people whom i am accustomed to believe were extremely unfavorable
a few curious onlookers crowded into the doorway
only in time did other , more flexible approaches to the notion of realism become possible
it ’ s impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion about that
she wept and wept so much today !
your uncle 's a bit of an eccentric , bazarov said to arkady , sitting down next to his bed in his dressing gown and smoking a short pipe
it 's a pity you have not worked him out a little more
when did you manage to lock it ?
some editions now produce a handsome profit !
he fell upon raskolnikov even with some voraciousness , as if he also hadn ’ t spoken with anyone for a whole month
well , what ’ s to be done ?
during this conversation , he had glanced at her frequently but fleetingly , for only a moment , and then looked away immediately
that much i knew
down to answer what is to be done ?
a beggar ’ s song from a french melodrama
dream , to pursue an ideal , to aspire to an unattainably lofty goal
[ arkady pointed to peter ]
whispered razumikhin in a fury , seizing hold of raskolnikov ’ s shoulder
the one in whose house i ’ m living ?
especially me , a future medic , a medic 's son , and a sexton 's grandson did you know i am the grandson of a sexton ?
bazarov would not have been portrayed as an awkward student dominating the people around him through the natural strength of his healthy mind ; he , perhaps , would have been turned into the embodiment of the ideas which make up the essence of this type ; he , perhaps , would have manifested in his personality the clear expression of the author 's tendencies , but it is doubtful whether he would have been bazarov 's equal in faithfulness to life and roundness of characterization
then there ’ s that fellow , perhaps , this petr petrovich !
let ’ s assume that luzhin didn ’ t want to do it right now , he began , without looking at sonya
his recollections of his recent successes at work seemed to invigorate him , and some were even reflected in his face by a sort of radiance
there are laws about such things
arkady it 's nikolaich , is not it ?
the insistence upon complete equality of the sexes also induced men of the new generation to cast overboard the ballast of chivalry and stylized gallantry
i was his guardian at one time
well , who would feel sorry for the likes of me ?
did they question nikolai while you were still there ?
therefore , there must be some kind of box or chest
here ’ s the caretaker of our building ; he knows me very well ; he ’ s bowing to us ; he sees that i ’ m coming with a lady , and , of course , he ’ s managed to observe your face ; that will serve you well if you ’ re afraid of me and suspicious
that turgenev did alter his text as a result of katkov 's pleading is certain ; he may , however , have restored some , at any rate , of the original language when the novel was published as a book
and if he is called a nihilist that word must be read as revolutionary
well , yes , so , you are denouncers—that 's what it seems to be called
little by little he arrived at diverse and curious conclusions ; in his opinion , the main reason was contained not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime , but in the criminal himself : the criminal himself , almost every one of them , at the very moment of the crime , is subject to some failure of willpower and reason , which are replaced , instead , by phenomenal childish thoughtlessness , precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed
then don ’ t believe it !
i ’ d have been to the yard beforehand and have looked for a large rock , weighing some forty or fifty pounds , somewhere over in a corner , near a fence , that had perhaps been there since the house had been built ; i ’ d have lifted up this rock—there ’ d have to be a space under it—and i ’ d have placed all the items and the money into that space
sonya turned the pages of the book and searched for the place
asked porfiry petrovich , who had turned to go
he exchanged glances with razumikhin
sonya blushed , but katerina ivanovna suddenly burst into tears , remarking that she was a nervous fool and was too distraught , that it was high time she stopped , and since the meal was finished , it was now time to serve tea
but she picked up the book
one of the women remarked , shaking her head at duklida
the novel is representative of its time in perhaps just this sense : that such imagination was still possible
i have some matters to attend to
in the face of all the natural revulsion avdotya romanovna felt toward me , and in spite of my gloomy and repulsive appearance—at last she began to feel pity for me , pity for a fallen man
is he responding like this from a sense of obligation ?
nikolai petrovich asked fenechka
luzhin repeated his question and was silent for several seconds
however , he ’ ll come to me and tell me everything
incidentally , you know that formerly i never really appreciated your close friendship with arkady nikolaevich ; i considered him rather insignificant
bazarov was not fated to awaken again
he whispered , what are you saying ?
one could hear how on every floor , up and down the staircase , a crowd was gathering ; voices could be heard , exclamations , as people came out , knocked on doors , slammed them shut , and then clustered
you are not a hunter ?
there is such a thing , he says , as being too fair ; this leads to its own brand of distortion of the truth
they ’ ve upset you again !
it ’ s my opinion that with all your merits , you aren ’ t worth the little finger of that unfortunate young woman at whom you ’ re casting stones
not god , but man makes pot and pan !
on the other hand , arkady
here the concept of an idea was simply transferred , unchanged , from the sphere of life to the sphere of art—and the transfer involved a relative neglect not only of the presence of art in a given work , but of the radical difference between idea inside and outside a work of art
and put your stockings next to it
raskolnikov turned toward the wall and the soiled yellow wallpaper with little white flowers ; he chose one ungainly white flower with some little brown lines and began staring at it : how many leaves did it have , how many serrations on each leaf , how many brown lines ?
using only psychological facts , one could show how to follow the right path
here ’ s the third floor
is he cutting new teeth ?
you left so suddenly will it bore you ?
yes , he will be living in a white cottage , while the nettles are growing out of me
but if you don ’ t kill me
he took a few dainty steps , then rushed around like a hunted hare at the edge of the woods—and suddenly , almost in fear , almost in a wail , announced that he too intended to leave
then , if you contribute another thousand from your three thousand , we ’ ll have enough in the first instance ; we ’ ll form a partnership
it can ’ t be that !
now she ’ s demanding payment according to this acknowledgment of debt : judge for yourself !
will i tell them or not ?
and you , she says , arkady ivanovich , in the midst of all your bustle today , you forgot to wind the clock in the dining room
in dresden , on the brühl terrace , between two and four in the afternoon , the most fashionable time for strolling , you can meet a man aged about fifty , already quite gray , seeming to suffer from gout , but still handsome , elegantly dressed , with the special air conferred only on those who have spent considerable time mixing with high society
you were told to come at nine o ’ clock and it ’ s now already past eleven !
you will see her , evgeny ; but first we must have a little chat with the doctor
and jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , father , i thank thee that thou hast heard me
well , after all that , isn ’ t it really an amusing job ?
i would not be so sure about that !
evgeny vasilich , muttered peter with difficulty ( shaking as if in a fever )
he wanted to sit down and was searching for a bench
but i tell you without flattery that i await your opinion in order to ascertain definitely what i should think
and why , when i was standing there on your threshold , and you were lying there on your sofa with your eyes closed , did you pretend you were asleep , when you really weren ’ t asleep at all ?
katerina ivanovna and i recently calculated it all , and there ’ s enough to provide for the funeral repast
she came here alone , sat down , and spoke with me
would you go up with him ?
trying not to look at her , raskolnikov proceeded quickly into her room
enough , that ’ s enough of your vile , base stories , you debauched , base , voluptuous man !
however , he was surprised to learn that the relatives he would invited had chosen to remain in the country
the kirsanovs , father and son , have settled down at marino ; their fortunes are beginning to mend
i learned for certain that some merchants ’ shop assistants and some office clerks wanted to insult us in the worst possible way by tarring the gates of our house so that the landlord would demand that we vacate our apartment
they ’ ve sent for one !
no , rodya , my dear , don ’ t resist , because it ’ ll be too late ; i won ’ t sleep all night , because i bought it merely guessing your size
there are times when society is so impervious to the kicks of criticism , when intellectual life softens so completely into the blur of gentility , that the rebellious man , who can tolerate everything but not being taken seriously , has no alternative to rudeness
he leaves her house the day after this incident ; afterward , he sees anna sergeyevna twice , even visits her in the company of arkady , but for both of them past events prove to be irrevocably past , and they regard each other calmly and speak together in the tones of reasonable and sedate people
you would be better off not respecting yourself , but doing something
and it was true that here and there some small strands of hay were sticking to his clothes and even to his hair
only old man prokofich did not like him , served him his food at the table with a gloomy expression , referred to him as a swindler and a knave , and asserted that with his side whiskers he looked just like a pig in a poke
the wind rushed violently into his cramped little room and clung to his face as if with cold hoarfrost , and to his chest , covered only by a shirt
the star pupil ’ s been caught
that was all true !
there was loud laughter
in turgenev 's russia ( ) victor ripp brings this line of thinking to its last stop : the meanings of turgenev 's fiction are so accessible , the questions his characters raise and the values they endorse are so easily comprehensible , that commentary seems superfluous
but if i am right
you can ’ t go to the landlady
fathers and sons : fathers and children
raskolnikov ran out after her , and lebezyatnikov followed
or , suddenly rousing himself , he would begin again :
not for anything , not until you give me your hands !
the next four hours were spent in insignificant discussion of this and that ; anna sergeevna both listened and talked without smiling
she felt ashamed for some reason , even a bit timid
he turned to one of them
that ’ s not why i came
the sun 's rays , for their part , made their way into the grove ; penetrating the thickets , they bathed the aspen trunks in such warm light that they began to resemble pine trees , and their leaves looked almost dark blue , while above them stretched the pale blue sky , slightly reddened by the sunset
norton critical edition page numbers appear in brackets
if , during turgenev 's visit to england in , at the close of his ventnor holiday that august , when he and annenkov had visited herzen at bournemouth , they had discussed—
and what ’ ll happen to our mother then ?
that ’ s where i come in
but i don ’ t want to burden myself anymore
soon he found out that her illness was not dangerous
§ a radical sect of old believers who fled from every sort of obedience to social institutions
petr petrovich , i beg you , said dunya , let ’ s not talk about svidrigaylov
he knows all about last evening !
do you really think that i went like a fool , without thinking ?
luzhin smiled caustically and haughtily
you say he was avoiding you , he said with a cold grin , but surely it 's probably no secret to you that he was in love with you ?
katya repeated , without changing her position
he remembered at once that his mother and sister already knew in passing , from luzhin ’ s letter , about a certain young woman of notorious conduct
he was afraid that he might let go of the axe and drop it
nihilist , said nikolai petrovich
that is , not that they ’ re able , but who have every right to commit any kind of outrages and crimes , and that the laws do not apply to them
i was at church last week , too
his son 's return had excited nikolai petrovich
he grabbed his large pocketknife and cut off the fringe
pochinkov ’ s house , number , babushkin ’ s apartment , remember !
but destitution , dear sir , destitution—that is a vice
see through it : if you ’ d done that , would you let it slip that you saw the workmen
illusoriness of aesthetic control in a world that is fundamentally messy and in which value is to be discovered only in aesthetically imperfect experience
you do like to joke
you were with anna sergeevna a long time today , arkady said , without replying to his question
he had been expecting this
what do you need razumikhin for ?
porfiry petrovich caught his breath for a moment
the metamorphosis of actaeon into a stag is , however , present in all versions of the story—a transformation that , if we interpret the tale as being about man 's urge to violate woman , seems to be less the consequence of diana 's curse than of actaeon 's own desire
bazarov asked , interrupting him
perhaps even more significant is arkadi 's behavior to his uncle
it also seems true that he should have a woman near him , she added in a thoughtful mood
i won ’ t let him out of my sight !
however it may be , bazarov is defeated all the same
the origin of the term nigilistka ( female nihilist ) is just as difficult to trace as that of the word nigilist
he had noticed dunya some time ago and was signaling to her
of course , i understood very little , but dunya explained to me that although he is not a well-educated man , he is clever and , it seems , kind
strakhov ( - ) was a philosopher and literary critic , and a close friend of tolstoy 's and dostoevsky 's
did not the local doctor have any caustic ?
bazarov had not been home for three years
all that , of course , is annoying , raskolnikov muttered in reply , but with such a distracted and almost inattentive look that dunechka regarded him in astonishment
is it true i ca not fall in love ?
but now , at last , all this uproar , which had gone on for a good ten minutes , gradually began to subside
it is a strange thing : you blame me for parallelism , but others write me why is not anna sergeyevna a lofty person , to contrast her more fully with bazarov ?
if bazarov were starving to death , then he probably would do both
let us assume that he has finally found that theorem
exactly the same ideas had recently arisen ?
and they mine it !
ilya petrovich opened his mouth wide
well , sir , i won ’ t keep you any longer , he said , turning to the agent
seeing her situation , with the unfortunate young children , i would like—as i already indicated—to be useful in some way , as best i can , that is , as best i can , but no more
what would i reply to you then , all the more so since your version ’ s more credible than his , because his testimony is pure psychology—which doesn ’ t fit his mug at all—while you hit it right on the mark , because that scoundrel drinks heavily and that ’ s even very well known
i wonder if it might be better for the time being
from this it in no way follows that newton had the right to kill anyone and everyone he pleased , or to rob people every day at the market
my nose tells me something 's not quite right
—bound hand and foot with graveclothes ; and his face was bound about with a napkin
well , we ’ ll talk about her later
just look , he ’ s gathered some rags and is sleeping with them , as if they were a treasure , nastasya said , then went off into fits of painfully nervous laughter
you yourself sent me to the crossroads ; why now , when it ’ s time for action , do you have cold feet ?
asked bazarov , as he downed a third glass
i drove her away just like a dog
the bad thing is that i ’ m almost delirious
you go to the right , while i turn to the left
he didn ’ t resist it ; two tears formed in his eyes and clung to his eyelashes
why is he here ?
to attach importance to preaching would mean to admit intellectual activity , to admit that men are ruled not by the senses and need , but also by thought and the words in which it is vested
four five go on , brother , go on ; you can even stand behind the tree and cover your ears , but do not close your eyes ; and if anyone falls , come help him up
she ’ s quiet , gentle , meek , and agreeable , agreeable to everything
my brother 's galloping toward us !
the second component is more directly implied in the novel 's title as the conflict between generations , apparently an inherent problem in human nature , though manifesting itself in different forms and in different degrees
excuse us , please , he began with forced embarrassment
well , i ’ m telling you that i spent a terribly long time suffering over this question , as a result of which i became extremely ashamed when at last i guessed ( somehow all of a sudden ) that not only wouldn ’ t he be repulsed , but it wouldn ’ t even have entered his head that this wasn ’ t colossal at all
twenty-two in all , timofeich observed with some dissatisfaction
sonya , sonya steal his money ?
lord , what should i do ?
still , she has pampered herself ; oh , how this lady 's pampered herself !
petr petrovich glanced around quickly
they give away everything
what are you doing in the meantime ?
i merely learned that this match , already settled , and which didn ’ t take place only because of the bride ’ s death , was not at all to mrs zarnitsyna ’ s liking
this passage has always struck me as intriguing : on the one hand , it provides evidence of the systematic investigation of time and space introduced by the new empirical and experimental science of the nineteenth century of which bazarov is a staunch advocate ; on the other hand , it sounds very modern—an inkling of einsteinian relativity in the middle of a classical russian novel
here 's a servant for you , he added , pointing to a closely cropped young boy wearing a blue caftan with worn-out elbows and someone else 's boots
he walked around the room again
i cough , sir , i have a tickle in my throat , and i ’ m short of breath
but wait a minute , it 's out of your way and quite far to my place
and i said , i have to leave , because i didn ’ t want to read ; i ’ d stopped by mainly to show some collars to katerina ivanovna
what do you think of him ?
think about where you ’ re staying !
she was easily amused , and when she found something funny , she laughed inaudibly , her whole body rocking and shaking until she felt sick
i have money ; i can get a ticket in three days
the wound 's not serious
katerina ivanovna stood there , inhaling painfully , holding her arms across her chest
coarse , heartless , ruthlessly dry and brusque the fault is mine ; i have not succeeded in my task
many speculations are possible , but it seems to me likely that dostoevsky , the great poet of the living life , would surely have responded to turgenev 's portrayal of bazarov the nihilist as a man doomed by his preoccupation with death
porfiry petrovich inquired for some reason
he doesn ’ t wait to hear what people are saying
the old woman stood up from her chair
he fell silent again and clenched his teeth : once more the image of dunechka appeared before him , exactly as she had been when , after she ’ d fired the gun for the first time , she ’ d been terribly frightened
he told peter to report to him the next day at dawn for some important business ; peter thought he planned to take him along to petersburg
two hours later he knocked at bazarov 's door
now it ’ s time for me to leave , too !
for some reason , he ’ d become friends with razumikhin—that is , not exactly friends , but he was more sociable with him , more honest
anna sergeevna objected ; but arina vlasevna did not hear her , and vasily ivanovich merely repeated : angel !
james himself saw in turgenev a class of very careful writers whose line is narrow observation , and whose manner is that of a searching realist a devoutly attentive observer
the blood , which was almost dry , was smeared on his hand ; he looked at it sullenly ; then he soaked a towel in water and wiped his temple
even though you don ’ t appear to be a person of consequence , my experience tells me that you ’ re an educated man and not accustomed to drink
he tormented himself with this question and was unable to understand why , when he ’ d stood above the river , he could already sense a profound lie in himself and in his convictions
please , old boy , or else i ’ ll think you ’ re angry
his exhaustion was quickly increasing
it even seems to me that you come from very good society or , at least , if need be , you know how to behave like a decent person
i was just there
avdotya romanovna couldn ’ t finish what she was saying ; her breath literally failed her
he respected me , he respected me very , very much !
and then—i ’ m afraid of her breathing
walking onto the bridge , he paused by the railing and began looking at the water
see how much money i have !
translated by ralph e matlaw
i called him an idiot , just as he deserves
resounded the voice of pavel petrovich behind them
he is too softhearted for both sets
i began that same day
two things : the kirsanov family and the story in which they appear ; fathers and children and fathers and children ; ordinary virtues and an extraordinary act of storytelling
you are a slavophile
the doctor , whom he implored to stay , would nod his head in agreement , give the patient lemonade to drink , and asked first for a pipe for himself , then for something
i repeat what i have said before
he was about fifty , taller than average , portly , with broad , sloping shoulders that gave him something of a stooped look
a commune is organized so that there won ’ t be any roles like that
arkady called after him in fear
you ’ re an anxious , weak scoundrel
† the russian word is dobro , which means property or goods as well as good ( as opposed to evil )
you ’ re a font of goodness , purity , reason , and
your present berth reminds me , my dear sirs , he began , of my military life in bivouacs , dressing stations , somewhere like this next to a haystack , and we were grateful for it
the doorman showed him the way immediately
he still wanted to look into her soft , clear eyes , but somehow couldn ’ t manage it
have a great heart and be less afraid
he ’ s a man of means , and she doesn ’ t seem repulsed by him
besides , in your eyes it 's all romanticism
if necessary , you know , and even the large majority of them do it
just consider these last few days !
of course , not for long ; but i ca not help expressing what i what we how much i how much we
if she ’ d been lame or a hunchback , i probably would ’ ve loved her even more
ne sait quand reviendra
the whole second floor of the house on the left was occupied by a tavern
i have met your father on two occasions and have heard a great deal about him , she continued
that ’ s how this town ’ s affected me from the very beginning , with its familiar stench
how things have turned out !
she gained control of herself , suppressed the throat spasms that had broken her voice at the beginning of the verse ; then she continued reading the eleventh chapter of the gospel of john
thus , dear rodya , he might prove extremely useful for you in all sorts of ways ; dunya and i have already supposed that you , even from this day forward , might definitely launch your future career and consider your fate now clearly determined
can she stand over her own ruin , directly above that stinking pit into which she ’ s being drawn , and can she wave her arms and block her ears when she ’ s being told about the danger ?
the door to the landing was open , so that some of the waves of tobacco smoke coming from the other rooms could disperse ; it was making the poor consumptive woman cough long and hard
his heart was about to burst
another thing : what do you mean , how could it be advantageous to you ?
he suddenly wondered to himself
he walked along , looking down at the ground
that ’ s why i drink , because i ’ m seeking compassion and feeling in this drinking
god knows what she says , and she doesn ’ t explain her purpose to me !
little by little he began to feel calmer ; he used all his strength to urge himself to cheer up and gather his thoughts
fenechka liked bazarov ; but he liked her , too
and get me a little sausage from the sausage maker , the cheapest sort
that surprises me , she began
flashed through raskolnikov ’ s mind , and he cast a swift glance at everything in the room to take it all in and remember its arrangement
he must have turned at once into the first stairway
do not you like that ?
raskolnikov noticed all this and was also alarmed
he said to arkady the next day
he stopped suddenly when he emerged on the embankment of the little neva on vasilievsky island , near the bridge
his entire spiritual struggle of the last few months came to him at once
accustomed to victory , he soon achieved his goal with her , too ; but the ease of his victory did not dampen his enthusiasm
excuse me , please , he said , turning to porfiry with trembling lips , for disturbing you with such trivial nonsense for the last half hour
my argument may be stated in a number of theses , which i will first list , and then go on to specify
he stashed them all in various pockets in his coat and in his right trouser pocket , trying to make it all look less noticeable
what do you want here ?
it ’ ll even be better if she begins tearing it out !
he remembered afterward that he was very focused , careful , trying hard not to get smeared
the ragged fellow , who had returned with the veal and tea , couldn ’ t refrain from asking once more , do you need anything else ?
i myself wanted to do good for people and i ’ d have done hundreds , thousands of good deeds instead of this stupid thing , not even stupid , but simply clumsy , because this idea was not at all as stupid as it seems now , given my failure
charming little feet , she thought , slowly and lightly climbing the stone steps of the terrace baked by the sun
me of insulting the younger generation , of being out of touch , of obscurantism , inform me that they burn my photographs with contemptuous laughter—others , on the other hand , indignantly reproach me with grovelling before that same younger generation
he added to himself ,
once he gave her a present of a ring with a sphinx carved on a stone
sometimes it seemed that he ’ d been lying there for about a month ; another time , that it was still the same day he had fallen ill but about that—he had completely forgotten about that ; on the other hand , he constantly recalled that he had forgotten about something that he should not have forgotten about—he suffered and agonized , trying to remember ; he moaned , fell into a rage or into horrible , unbearable fear
on the three occasions when he condescends to him he does
just imagine : it was all very sudden !
he has such noble instincts , and how simply , delicately he ’ s resolved yesterday ’ s misunderstanding with his sister—merely by extending his hand with such a fine look
i ’ ll tell you more later , but for now i have my own affairs
later they won ’ t have to lie
it really was a strange spectacle , capable of arousing the interest of a street crowd
grigorev ( - ) was a brilliant though eccentric critic extolling traditional russian life , and a good poet
they ’ re all drunk and singing songs ; next to the tavern porch stands a strange kind of cart
it 's all the same thing
not only is fathers and sons dedicated to turgenev 's old friend belinskij , the still-invoked conscience of the russian intelligentsia , but it was as well a central document in the intellectual—not only the artistic or political—life of russia during one of its most formative periods
true , during the whole time he constantly felt she was indulging him , that he ought to feel grateful to her but young hearts are not burdened much by this feeling
arkady declared that he dare not trouble her further and began chatting with her about mozart
dunya jumped up and rushed toward the door
of course he crushes the man with the fragrant mustache and others !
i think that has to be changed : one must not approach such a special phenomenon of life so directly and indiscriminately
i happen to know that my sister received some sort of letter this morning
today 's friday , your exc-c-cellency
raskolnikov regarded him with surprise , not understanding where he had come from , and not recalling him in the crowd on the street
the old woman came back
you ’ re leading up to something again
we must dispense with the notion that the novel portrays the conflict of generations and recognize that from the russian novel from pushkin to pasternak , ed
what depth and breadth of spiritual life among the most ordinary life that does not rise a jot above the lowest level
hear me out to the end !
he lay there on his sofa facedown , still dazed from his recent stupor
razumikhin was about to criticize the rooms forcefully , but , recalling luzhin , he kept silent , felt embarrassed , and then was overjoyed when pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s questions finally rained down on him without interruption
the moth flies right into the flame
jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee , that if thou wouldst believe , then thou shouldst see the glory of god ?
bazarov spares arina vlasyevna ; he tells her that he has caught cold ; on the third day he goes to bed and asks for lime tea
i don ’ t know what to say
raskolnikov wondered to himself
i know one thing : i started with no preconceived idea , no tendency ; i wrote naively , as if myself astonished at what was emerging
bazarov may regard pavel petrovich as an archaic phenomenon , but the archaic phenomenon retains social power
not a doll or a plaything , says gieroglifov , but a woman of knowledge who rejects the archaic , the passive , and the impotent and embraces the new , the creative , and the forceful
he also picked up all the five-kopeck coins , the change from the ten rubles spent on clothes by razumikhin
let 's go , arkady ; good-bye , gentlemen !
fortunately , i can probably become convinced of this even today
wax before the face of the lord ; he melts like wax !
asked vasily ivanovich in a whisper
do me a favor , raskolnikov continued with irritation
cried raskolnikov , not so much angry as astonished
i dare ask you for such publicity because it corresponds completely to the truth and , of course , in no way contradicts your convictions
the next day , early in the morning , anna sergeevna summoned bazarov to her study and with forced laughter showed him a folded piece of writing paper
polechka , terrified , cowered with the children on a trunk in the corner , where , embracing the two little ones and trembling , she began waiting for her mother ’ s return
there ’ s nothing i can tell you
you promised to prove it : well , speak !
i take this to mean that he is unlike tolstoj or dostoevskij insofar as he is not a thinker : he is precisely what the most characteristic strand of russian criticism would have most vigorously objected to , ie , someone who is only an artist , someone who provides merely aesthetic pleasure
perhaps you do not know it , but i am very much afraid of you
as i was leaving , i said that i might be saying good-bye to you forever ; but if i came today i would tell you
he said to sonya , returning to his room and looking directly at her
bazarov , like the underground man , is sick , and turgenev is extremely acute in diagnosing bazarov 's disease : he is suffering from an illness that is the opposite of dostoevskij 's anti-hero , who suffered from an excess of consciousness ; bazarov , on the contrary , suffers from an unconsciousness of the metaphoric nature of language
then you must share proudhon 's opinion ?
he robbed us and went off to the tavern with the money
torments and tears—that , too , means life
no , she decided once and for all , god knows where it might have led ; one must not fool around with this kind of thing ; serenity is still better than anything else on earth
i ’ m not marrying him without being convinced that he values me and appreciates me
arkady nikolaich , do not you think it 's a bit absurd ?
i ’ ve been meaning to look in on you for some time ; i was passing and thought—why not drop in for a visit for five minutes or so
i have heard leibig has made some astonishing discoveries concerning the fertilization of fields
and especially if one ’ s naturally inclined to be so , he added , laughing again
i was so surprised when i saw it : you fool , you , i thought to myself , here ’ s what he ’ s been doing , here ’ s the answer to the riddle !
said pulkheriya aleksandrovna , looking at her daughter , full of alarm and anxiety
it 's very important ; in my opinion all the happiness of your life depends on it
he took money and some items
nikolai petrovich rang and called , dunyasha !
lizaveta ivanovna , you indescribable beauty !
cried bazarov with a contemptuous laugh
svidrigaylov was suddenly naïvely alarmed , without paying the least attention to the epithet characterizing his intentions
it might be possible
here ’ s one , sir , he continued , offering his guest a cigarette
perfect for the dissection table
he turned around quickly , threw her a devouring look—and , seizing both her hands , suddenly drew her to his chest
did anyone disturb you at all ?
i decided this a while ago
the agent was here a while ago , from vakhrushin ’ s office
who had called upon him to judge ?
it 's you , herr sitnikov , said bazarov , continuing along the sidewalk
why do i agree now to live like this ?
she was not alone but was surrounded by kapernaumov ’ s four little children
i ’ ll come and go
razumikhin blushed desperately at this idea ; all of a sudden , as if intentionally , at that very moment , he clearly recalled how he had told them yesterday , standing on the stairs , that the landlady was jealous of avdotya romanovna with regard to him
razumikhin cried in ecstasy
lizaveta gave it to me ; i asked her for it
did he come on his own ?
but doubts still remained : let ’ s suppose he returned an hour later to put it back , but nastasya was also there
in such circumstances that must mean something
on the staircase he hid from kokh , pestryakov , and the caretaker in the empty apartment exactly when dmitry and nikolai had run out
after i ’ ve escorted you home , i ’ ll pour two buckets of cold water over my head right here in the canal , and i ’ ll be fine
meanwhile , razumikhin sat down next to him on the sofa , clumsily , like a bear , and put his left arm around raskolnikov ’ s head , in spite of the fact that he could have raised his head by himself ; with his right hand razumikhin carried a spoonful of soup to his mouth , first blowing on it several times beforehand to make sure he didn ’ t burn himself
fenechka started laughing again and even clapped her hands , so amusing did bazarov 's request seem to her
at first the elegant lady trembled as a result of this thunder and lightning
haven ’ t you seen them since then ?
a terrible , deep cough disrupted her words
i owe you an explanation and feel obligated to provide you with one , sir , he continued with a little smile and even tapped his hand on raskolnikov ’ s knee lightly
how could that be ?
the only good point about a russian is that he has a very low opinion of himself
but why did not you tell me i have a brother ?
in fact , not only does nikolai love her , but both his brother pavel and their houseguest bazarov find her very attractive , virtually irresistible
the influence of dostoevsky and chekhov on turgenev 's fathers and sons
this man used to love me !
he looked at fenechka carefully , almost mournfully
such pacing from corner to corner in deep thought was avdotya romanovna ’ s usual habit , and her mother always feared interrupting her reflections at such times
blood was flowing from his face and head ; his face was all beaten , battered , and mangled
she rushed from one person to the next
he was so poorly dressed that someone else , even someone used to seeing such , would be ashamed to appear on the street during the day wearing such ragged clothes
meanwhile , now , as soon as he had said it , it suddenly seemed to her that it was just as if she had foreseen exactly that
then i became so fed up with all this chatter , so very fed up !
not friendship , but the feeling of a man and a citizen , the feeling of humanity and love for the almighty
bazarov can be brusque to his parents but never treats them with the rudeness with which he treats everyone else
are they all being interrogated ?
a little path ran right past the bushes that concealed the portico
that ’ s the only song she knows , and everyone sings it !
it was not for nothing he was a nihilist !
no , it ’ s not , replied dunya resolutely
sonya understood that he was tormented
bazarov 's purpose is not the discovery of scientific truth , else he would not peddle cheap popular tracts—büchner and the rest
arina vlasevna was very kind and , in her own way , not at all stupid
but we will see what we shall see
even in turgenev , however , this unitary language is very far from poetic absolutism
but petr petrovich didn ’ t accept the reproach ; on the contrary , he became more and more annoyed and irritated with every word , as if he were starting to enjoy it
today i ’ ve noticed , my friend , that since morning you ’ ve been in an unusually excited state
the policemen had gone , except for one who stayed a little longer and tried to push the spectators who had come in from the stairs back out again
he was also in a state of some agitation
at first , arkady thinks that passion most interests him , but he does not notice that really he is most occupied with prosaic love , a love that values trifles—that is , what appear like trifles from the perspective of romance
to live for hap for hap for happiness
for a long time now i have reacted to that accusation with contempt
or else , you could lie down on the couch—you ’ d still be among us
having returned home from abroad , pavel went to visit his brother with the intention of spending a month or two , to share his happiness , but he could stand no more than a week of it
but it 's very hot
anyway , he seemed like a fool
she was nearing the words of the greatest and most unprecedented miracle , and a feeling of immense triumph took hold of her
finally arkady could stand no more
she really loves it—well , it began with a song ; but you ’ re a virtuoso on the piano , a maestro , a rubenstein
oh , by the way , nikolai petrovich began , obviously eager to change the subject of conversation
prokofich did not take his eyes off him and merely chewed his lips
what good 's my youth to me ?
the conversation struck him as interesting and significant , and he ’ d enjoyed it very , very much—so much so that he had brought a chair in order that in the future , even tomorrow , for example , he wouldn ’ t have to subject himself again to the unpleasantness of standing on his feet for a whole hour , but he could make himself more comfortable , so that he could derive pure enjoyment in all regards
this expression is well-chosen and characterizes our hero perfectly
it ’ s not time that matters , but you yourself
in one of them , at that moment , there was a loud noise and a commotion that filled the whole street ; a guitar was being strummed , songs were being sung , and it was all very cheerful
if rudin has partly been created in turgenev 's own image , bazarov , the hero of fathers and sons , is a figure in opposition to that image
what will i say ?
and how much that irritated you then and became mixed up with your illness
it is , she muttered
but raskolnikov was no longer listening ; he greedily snatched the document , searching for a solution to the riddle
it was being redecorated ; there were workers inside ; that seemed to astound him
she ’ s only doing this today , sir
arkady has become a zealous proprietor and the farm is already bringing in a fairly substantial income
have you ever seen people in my condition not set off for the elysian fields ?
her marriage to nikolai is described in no less than idyllic terms ; had she lived longer , one presumes she would have produced more children and provided them with a loving and secure childhood
exactly like them he lives in the mental sphere for the time being and spends his spiritual forces on it
turgenev 's new novel affords us all those pleasures which we have learned to expect from his works
and they didn ’ t even know how to exchange the counterfeit notes : one of them walked into the bank office , exchanged five thousand rubles , and his hands were shaking
will there be chilled cream with the raspberries ?
i wo not forget myself precisely because of that feeling of self-worth that was so cruelly mocked by mister by mister doctor
and , let ’ s assume he knows he ’ s a decent fellow , at least a little
he sat down on the deserted bench
after getting undressed , trembling all over like a horse driven to exhaustion , he lay down on the sofa , pulled his coat over himself , and immediately lost consciousness
a moment of silence ensued
he stood regarding the entire company with a severe and attentive glance
perhaps one in ten thousand ( i ’ m speaking approximately , by way of illustration ) is born with even broader originality
and they ’ re all so full of bile , so very full !
but why do they love me so much , if i ’ m not worthy of it ?
first , he had to make a loop and sew it into his coat—that would take only a minute or so
schophenhauer 's influence on turgenev 's thought dates from no later than , and scholars have singled out the great pessimist as the inspiration for at least certain aspects of poezdka v poles ' e ( ) , prizraki ( ) , dovol'no ( ) , and senilia ( )
we sense the narrator 's perceptiveness of social forms , practices , and values at every moment ; we never forget his sophistication , his infinite superiority over nikolai petrovich , to whom , however , he is indulgent
how dare you , you scum !
ten years later , at the time of the emancipation of the serfs , turgenev , anticipating dostoevsky 's skepticism about russia 's foundations , asks in a letter to the countess lambert : has history made us as we are ?
in chapter , when odintsova asks whether happiness exists , bazarov can answer only : you know the proverb : it 's always better where we do not exist
yes , maybe it ’ s true
finally there were some who detected that the author himself was not wholly sure of what he wanted to do , that his attitude was genuinely ambivalent , that he was an artist and not a pamphleteer , that he told the truth as he saw it , without a clear partisan purpose
you will come back to us later , wo not you ?
i cite the article of harai golomb ; though it deals with chekhov 's plays , his words are applicable to the mature work in general
because only peasants and the most inexperienced novices flatly deny everything during interrogations
as soon as i saw you the first time , back then , that evening , you recall , when we first arrived here , i guessed it from your look alone ; my heart faltered then
i simply pushed her away
why do you want to know ?
why are you looking at me like that , as if you don ’ t recognize me ?
imagine , sonya , that you knew all of luzhin ’ s intentions beforehand , you knew ( that is , for certain ) that as a result katerina ivanovna would come to grief , and the children ; and you , too , in the bargain ( since you consider yourself worthless , let ’ s say in the bargain )
asked the younger lad
of course , they set off as fast as possible to find mikolai
just imagine , she talks about the most trivial things ; you have to marvel at her : that ’ s just what makes me so angry
it ’ s true , it ’ s all true !
no , it is not banal , sir !
for heaven 's sake , what are you saying ?
it turned out that this time porfiry petrovich was alone
why , it was you
perhaps i won ’ t sleep at all tonight
but odintsova and bazarov do , eventually , come to bless the ordinary love they can neither share nor truly appreciate
they do this with absolute sincerity
there was a strong odor of perfume
for example , during his second visit , after he ’ d already received her consent , he expressed in our conversation that previously , even before he knew dunya , he ’ d intended to marry an honest young woman , but one without a dowry , and certainly one who ’ d already experienced poverty ; because , as he explained , a husband should in no way be obligated to his wife , and that it ’ s much better if the wife considers her husband to be her benefactor
you ’ ve heard about that , too ?
white winter had arrived with its cruel stillness of cloudless frosts , thick , squeaky snow , pink hoarfrost on trees , pale emerald green sky , caps of smoke above chimneys , clouds of steam from doors opened hurriedly , people 's fresh faces nipped by the cold , and the brisk trot of shivering horses
your article is absurd and fantastic , but there ’ s a flash of such sincerity ; it contains a youthful , incorruptible pride , and the audacity of despair ; it ’ s a gloomy article , sir , but a good one , sir
you talk nonsense , but if it ’ s your own , i ’ ll kiss you for it
you ’ re causing him to faint !
now this seems strange and unintelligible
modern scholarship has frequently noted turgenev 's debt to schopenhauer , for instance
i wanted to call on katerina ivanovna
bazarov said , cutting him off abruptly
bazarov scratched the back of his head
he had found out , he had suddenly , abruptly , and completely unexpectedly found out that tomorrow , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , lizaveta , the old woman ’ s sister and the only person who lived with her , would be away from home , and , as a result , the old woman , at precisely seven o ’ clock in the evening , would be at home alone
you ’ d better not get up , nastasya continued , feeling sorry for him and seeing that he was lowering his legs from the sofa
for example , it might be possible to organize a subscription for her , or a lottery , so to speak
as for bazarov , he was 'honest , truthful , a democrat to his fingertips '
i dreamt of a figure that was grim , wild , huge , half grown out of the ground , powerful , sardonic , honest—and doomed to destruction nevertheless—since it nevertheless still stands only at the threshold of the future—i dreamt of some sort of strange pendant to pugachev , etc—
i just told you that the silver watch , which is worth very little , is the only object left from my father
it all depends on the environment , and the person himself means nothing
it was all still only circumstantial
razumikhin would remember this moment for the rest of his life
here , i ’ ve brought the pledge i promised a few days ago
as you like , he said at last
she has struggled too hard to mold her immediate circumstances to suit her sense of responsibility to her sister and to satisfy her own need for psychic stability
and that old crone wrote down the date in pencil !
the point is that she was much older than me ; besides that , she constantly kept some sort of clove in her mouth
there ’ s something else : i ’ m certain that in petersburg there are many people who walk around talking to themselves
i will answer you like an echo , 'where ?
after examining her swollen red eye closely , he prescribed and prepared a lotion , and , tearing his own handkerchief into small pieces , showed her how to apply it
where do you live ?
i ’ m not the least bit worthy !
well , then , i ’ ve come to tell you
well , ma ’ am , how about it ?
one can find evidence of turgenev 's thorough study of hegel 's most important writings in the well-annotated copies of enzyklopädie der philosophischen wissenschaften , geschichte der philosophie , wissenschaft der logik , phänomenologie des geistes , and vorlesungen über die philosophie des geistes contained in the writer 's personal library
my maternal grandfather built it
she whispered with effort
there was a whole society of them
so , where are you ?
he remembered how he had constantly tormented her and rent her heart ; he recalled her little pale , thin face , but now these reminiscences had almost ceased torturing him : he knew how his infinite love would compensate for all her suffering
what , rodya , are you leaving already ?
you laid hands on yourself , you destroyed your own life
you—with your ambition—a district doctor !
no , i ’ m absolutely sure it ’ s possible
neither lady seems ever to have thought of taking the indispensable precaution of reading her version to a russian holding the russian text , who would at once have spotted the dropped-out negatives and the cases of one word mistaken for another
but mr razumikhin is the sort of person who won ’ t endure indignation
she spends most of her time eating and sleeping , and has but one occupation—she runs their modest household with ruthless efficiency
he wanted to cry out and—woke up
first in command of a brigade , then a division—and who always lived in the provinces , where , as a result of his rank , he came to play quite an important role
in the barn next door he ’ d fastened his sash to a beam , made a noose , then he stood on a stump and was trying to put the noose around his neck
that ’ s why i invited you , so we could speak privately and consider it carefully
do you recall how he started to introduce her ?
there ’ s a man who engages in trade here on this corner , with a woman , his wife , right ?
and so , it 's all settled : fenechka will be my belle-soeur
a body that is indeed no more than its physical makeup
you ’ re someone who ’ s said to be not lacking in connections
but however intriguing this passage may be , i do not want to talk about it or about any of the male characters in the novel
remembering this , he began shaking
how 's he so different from us ?
the criminal firmly , precisely , and clearly reaffirmed his testimony , without confusing the circumstances , not mitigating them in his own interest , not distorting the facts , and not forgetting the slightest details
when raskolnikov looked around , he saw even more inexplicable examples
if bazarov could only hear that ! ]
you know , sonya , only now , just this moment , did i understand : where i was asking you to go yesterday
she will be very upset , arkady said , and so will he
cried ilya petrovich from where he was sitting , also attending to some documents
i should think so !
she began tidying up the apartment and preparing for the reunion , began to arrange the room intended for him ( her own ) , to polish the furniture , to wash and hang new curtains there , and so on
i believe you found it impossible to avoid this duel , which which , to a certain extent , can be explained by the persistent antagonism that exists between your respective views
as far as your brother ’ s concerned , what can i tell you ?
marfa petrovna was completely astounded and once again crushed , as she herself acknowledged ; on the other hand , she was fully convinced of dunechka ’ s innocence
i called him names , but don ’ t pay any attention
i told you previously that i wasn ’ t able to support myself at the university
you see , i don ’ t have any lessons either , but i don ’ t give a damn ; there ’ s a bookseller at the flea market by the name of kheruvimov who ’ s a kind of lesson in himself
when i proposed to the object of my affections that she run away with me to america or switzerland , perhaps i nourished the most honorable feelings in myself and even thought i was making arrangements for our mutual happiness !
the poor little horse ?
after a brief silence he added : she 's a duchess , a regal personage
were the sounds so special , so noteworthy , or what ?
asked razumikhin , following them down the stairs
but that lasted only a moment
'yes , bazarov repeated weightily , 'you are still stupid
after dinner we will sit down to a game of cards and i will clean him out
almost all of them have been identified , and you were the only one who ’ d yet to come forward , replied porfiry with a barely noticeable shade of mockery
rather than forsake that time warp , odintsova finds an appropriate mate and invites him to join her there
raskolnikov could make out the girl ’ s thin but pretty little face ; she smiled at him , regarding him cheerfully , in a childlike manner
she cried , squeezing him in her embrace and kissing him
one of them , where he led our friends , was called the study
for that and for some other reasons i wo not list
i wanted to hurry up and overstep
he sobs , but his breath falters , and his words emerge as screams from his constricted chest
now called fedosya nikolaevna , she wears a silk dress , a broad velvet band in her hair , and a gold chain around her neck—all the trappings of her office as mistress of the house
i have seen your father 's entire establishment , bazarov began again
he added haughtily , as if addressing some dark force and calling upon it
let ’ s go : you ’ ll be a witness
what do you think ?
where did you find him , katya ?
as for me , i swear to god that i ’ ll arrange matters and contrive things there ’ in such a way that your appearance will seem as if it were completely unexpected
by the way , evgeny vasilevich , you really must drop in on a certain lady who 's completely capable of understanding you , for whom your visit will be a real treat ; i think you may have heard something about her
what will you tell them ?
if i haven ’ t thanked you properly before , then
why did you have your child taken away ?
how do you like my dress ?
the rudins and bel'tovs begat bazarov
on the other hand , there are young , fresh forces , going to waste for lack of support , by the thousands , all over the place
muttered the unfamiliar gentleman , and he began climbing the stairs after her
and one for your mother
hey you , you svidrigaylov !
the caretakers didn ’ t go to the police , but i did
imagine , i went to your room ; i ’ ve been looking for you
the ladies quietly followed razumikhin up the stairs
in the arbor sat fenechka with dunyasha and mitya
from habit he speaks of the rights and duties of the aristocracy , and from habit proves in arguments the necessity for principles
it seemed to her that by his signals that he was summoning her and asking that she not call her brother and leave him in peace
and just where are you planning on going ?
oh , no , what are you saying ?
perhaps he ’ d have to reveal himself to razumikhin as well ?
the tradesman paused and suddenly bowed once again , touching the floor with his finger
we may regard lavrov 's words as so much obituary rhetoric
raskolnikov kept silent and didn ’ t resist , even though he felt he had sufficient strength to raise himself up and sit on the sofa without anyone ’ s assistance
forgive me for my slander and my malice
we must make a man out of you
the impression that man made on me was very strong and at the time not entirely clear : at first , i could not myself make him out clearly , and i intently listened and examined everything around me as though i wanted to verify the justness of my own feelings
why should i read to you ?
the small sooty door at the end of the stairway , at the very top , was open
that damned tradesman was sitting behind the partition in my office—can you imagine that ?
i ’ ve been away from home five days ; they ’ re looking for me , it ’ s the end of my job , and my uniform is left in some tavern near the egyptian bridge ; i traded it for these clothes
it must be posing a riddle now
as he went down the staircase , he even paused several times , as if suddenly struck by something
it seems to me you have nothing to complain about
i remember you and love you
raskolnikov smiled silently and sarcastically ; razumikhin winced deeply
but what ’ s really original in all this—and belongs exclusively to you , to my chagrin—is the fact that you sanction bloodshed as a matter of conscience and , excuse me for saying so , even with such fanaticism
petr petrovich doesn ’ t conceal the fact that he was educated on the cheap ; he even boasts of having paved his own way , remarked avdotya romanovna , somewhat offended by her brother ’ s new tone
this idea took hold of them
then will we understand all things !
are you really ill ?
experience , my dear sir , repeated experience !
eliot , trollope , and tolstoy share an ethical sense foreign to turgenev ; for they see the ground of ethics in the activities of specific small communities and regard individual goodness as possible only in the realm of inherited customs
are you satisfied with your hired laborers ?
sonya wailed pitifully , suddenly crossing her arms in suffering
he repeated gloomily and insistently
said sonya , strangely and passionately agitated by his words
oh , very well , if you wish it !
a lamp was burning in the corner in front of a small icon
but , they say , we have the facts
nothing happened , replied arkady
let ’ s begin : we ’ ll start at the top
but it proved to be very difficult to get rid of
ilya petrovich even extended his hand
about my acquaintanceship with
however , to respect oneself and submit—that i understand , that 's happiness
giving it to you is the same as giving it to him
he stood there and gazed into the distance intently and for a long time ; this place was very familiar to him
she could scarcely remember her mother
it ’ s not polite , porfiry petrovich ; perhaps i won ’ t allow it , sir !
what ’ ll she have left after she arrives in petersburg ?
why am i explaining all this to you now ?
i ’ d borrow a nice , soft armchair for you ; my landlord has one
then i ’ ll rush back here and , in a quarter of an hour , my word of honor , i ’ ll bring you news : how he ’ s feeling , whether he ’ s asleep , and so on
meanwhile , darya frantsevna , a malevolent woman well known to the police , had reported her to the landlady several times
but those little scarves will add only twenty rubles a year to her hundred and twenty , that much i know
it ’ s not where you ’ re looking
of course , you didn ’ t tell him about it , did you ?
raskolnikov said , growing irritable
is that our forest up ahead ?
i began speaking about you—and she asked me to stop
she said loudly and harshly , turning to amaliya ivanovna with an extremely stern expression , which caused the latter to cringe , not like those overdressed tail draggers of yours who wouldn ’ t have been admitted as cooks into my papa ’ s kitchen ; and my late husband , of course , would ’ ve done them a great honor receiving them , even though it was only out of his inexhaustible kindness
it would be difficult to specify precisely the reason why the idea of this ridiculous funeral feast was conceived in katerina ivanovna ’ s distraught brain
he yelled after the mustachioed policeman
seeing that the cartoon figure of kukshina would be used as a weapon of ridicule against all advanced women , he suggested that , however ridiculous the unripe , progressive female might appear , the traditional upper-class woman was even more ridiculous
while his shirt was being changed , because it was going to be washed that night , the little boy sat up on a chair silently , straight and motionless , with a serious look on his face
on the first-floor landing , the window frame had been removed from one window
eh , it ’ s all nonsense !
but father twin heroes and inseparable friends in greek mythology , also called the dioscuri ; probably both sons of zeus
their extra-scientific claims for science become subject to all the confusions and historicity of natural languages , the limitations of which for anyone seeking to express extrahistorical , ultimate truths are all too obvious
clearly it was unnecessary to be dejected now or to suffer passively , merely considering these questions insoluble ; instead , it was absolutely necessary to do something right now , as soon as possible
their prolonged kiss in the arbor eventually provokes the duel with pavel , resulting in bazarov 's departure and nikolai 's decision to marry fenechka
she reminded him that he was a father and the head of a household , and , finally , she said how vile it was for him to torment and distress a young woman who was already in distress and defenseless
nikolai petrovich began cheerfully
later i was told , i found out , that you ’ re a young writer and even a scholar
svidrigaylov ’ s clothes were fashionable , summery , and light ; his linen was particularly elegant
no , that 's not what i wanted to say
does it for old time 's sake
he even managed to gain control of himself , at least outwardly
how many serfs does your father own ?
that ’ s what it ’ s come to
their son works somewhere in the provinces , but he doesn ’ t help out
where are you going , rodya ?
he looks down on people and rarely even takes the trouble to conceal his half-disdainful , half-patronizing attitude toward those who hate him and those who obey him
and i myself confessed to you candidly , several times already , that this psychology cuts both ways , and the second way is greater and more credible than the first ; and , besides that , i have nothing more against you at this time
clucked porfiry petrovich suddenly , at once altering his tone and his look ; he stopped laughing immediately
but they spent the whole day trying to convince each other constantly that this couldn ’ t possibly be ; they were calmer when they were together
but he hadn ’ t shuddered because of that thought
the plural emphasizes the universal implications of his action , and the transition from contradiction to reconciliation is entirely consonant with the logic of the dialectic
between them occurred something like the scene of their first meeting at raskolnikov ’ s room when he was asleep
we even dared mention a few words on this account to petr petrovich
nikolai and arkady 's ability to deal with the social problems of the day is limited but need not give cause for despair ; bazarov 's disgust with the gentry and with limited , gradual reform is understandable , but his solutions are wrongheaded
he did not belittle himself , nor did he offend others ; incidentally , he enjoyed a chuckle over seminary latin and rose to the defense of his bishop ; he drank two glasses of wine , but refused a third ; he accepted a cigar from arkady , but did not smoke it , saying he would take it home with him
won ’ t you have a seat ?
he added , turning to raskolnikov as if apologizing
he asks , for example , what day is it ?
a real man , he says , is one whom it 's no use thinking about , whom one must either obey or hate
you were carried away !
don ’ t you see that from the very beginning everything he said during the interrogations was the sacred truth ?
after the service , raskolnikov went up to sonya
nonetheless , tied to a mode of existence characteristic of the past , pavel petrovieh finds life hard ( : [ p ] )
vasily ivanovich 's bronze cheeks turned dark red
his mother and sister were sitting on the sofa in his room and had been waiting for him for the last hour and a half
poem , indeed , is a major passage in the conclusion of one of turgenev 's most important early works , diary of a superfluous man ( dnevnik lishnego chelov-eka )
he did not try to clarify his own thoughts , yet felt he wanted to preserve that blessed time with something stronger than memory ; he wanted to feel once more the presence of his marya , experience her warmth and breath , and he could already imagine above him
playful wit and abstract conclusions of reason merely tempt you , sir
there was almost no furniture at all in this large room
is that fellow raskolnikov there ?
to hell with it all !
he blurted out suddenly , surprising even himself ; but at once , recalling what he had just said about her brother , he turned red as a beet and became flustered
hear that , mityukha , said another driver who was standing nearby , hands thrust into the rear slit of his sheepskin coat
pavel petrovich oppressed everyone , even prokofich , with his frigid courtesy
when i think of russia , h g wells wrote in , i think of what i have read of turgenev
after seeing no one in the courtyard , he strode through the gates and noticed at once , right next to the gate , a trench dug along the fence ( the kind often found in buildings with many factory workers , craftsmen , cabdrivers , etc
it seemed that there was still plenty of time before the fateful moment , a great deal of time remaining , and he could think about many things
then he stood up , bowed imposingly and cordially , and was escorted out with blessings , warm gratitude , and prayers
is not it all the same thing ?
oh , what did he care about all this torment and suffering ?
so , mr zametov , was i in my right mind yesterday or delirious ?
the dialectics of turgenev 's ottsy i défi
at that moment in his imagination there flashed the figure of ilya petrovich , lieutenant porokh
her eyes met bazarov 's and she blushed slightly
she started crying right there in the shop in front of the merchants , because we didn ’ t have enough money
then he thought about sonya
only the young people ate : the master and mistress had eaten their dinner some time before
on the face of it , bazarov 's ideas have little to do with politics , yet he is acute enough to think of them in political terms ; he recognizes that they are functions of his frustrated political passion
i saw it when you entered , and that ’ s why i turned to you right away
in his government inspector gogol said there was a single honorable character in the play—laughter
no matter how smart you young fellows are , old man paracelsus spoke the truth when he said : in herbis , verbis et lapidibus you know , i do not practice anymore , but two or three times a week i am obliged to relive the past
you have to gain strength by means of strength , that ’ s what they don ’ t know , he added proudly and self-confidently
signs of such a reliance in both writers are the frequent pauses and ellipses ; and particularly the eloquent gestures , quite as telling as words ( eg , the way on first meeting bazarov nikolai petrovich firmly grasps the uncovered red hand , which
well , sir , my idea is that you notice more and learn more when observing our younger generation
bazarov 's jeers did not in the least perturb vassily ivanovich ; they were positively a comfort to him
he waved his arm dismissively , foreseeing that this would turn out to be a bothersome affair
these ethereal young ladies in tarlatan gowns and outlandish crinolines—the phrase is kovalevskaya's—bedecked themselves with jewelry and swept their hair into
muttered the old woman as she came running from the living room
bazarov is not only an empiricist , he is also an uncouth rowdy , who has known no life other than the homeless , laborious , sometimes wildly dissipated life of the poor student
i wanted to tell you , mama
so , if you were not such a fool , not such a vulgar fool , an absolute fool , a translation from the original
for some reason , he ’ d imagined that he would find the place just as he ’ d left it then , perhaps even with the bodies in the same place on the floor
this was not at all the way he had planned to announce it ; he himself didn ’ t understand what was happening to him
cried ilya petrovich , extremely pleased to be teased in that manner , but still sulking
here ’ s the third floor ; should he go on ?
we ’ ve heard all that before , and it ’ s just an attempt to frighten us , but now ?
you ’ ve become friends ; i heard that , sir
everythin ’ you could possibly wish for !
excuse me , not here
five minutes later , he stood on the bridge , at the very same spot where the woman had thrown herself into the water not long ago
raskolnikov extended his hand and shook his host ’ s , still apparently with extreme effort to suppress his good cheer and to utter at least two or three words to introduce himself
and allusions—it ’ s all very clear
it divides life from eternity
just imagine what it ’ s like !
no , just think about this , he cried
i don ’ t drink , sir , that ’ s the whole problem , hee-hee-hee , that i don ’ t drink , sir , it is a problem !
i beg you , most respected amaliya ivanovna , remember the words you just spoke here in the presence of witnesses
i ’ ll say you did !
and my mother 's all right : her day 's full of all sorts of activities , 'oohs ' and 'ahs , she 's no time to think ; while i
his heart pounded in agitation
what , then , what must we do ?
as for pavel kirsanov , we need only think of prince andre 's disdain for speransky in war and peace to judge the gulf that in pavel 's mind separates bazarov from him
the old man was the only one laughing ; arkady managed to smile
odintsova quickly turned to face him
in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness , though he was in the highest degree well bred and poised , as though there was some false note—not in vronsky , he was very simple and nice , but in herself , while with levin she felt perfectly at ease
it ’ s true that all the way here in the train i was thinking about how we ’ d get to see each other , how we ’ d talk about everything
you think i want money ?
screams mikolka in a fury
but bazarov 's ridicule did not upset vasily ivanovich in the least ; it even comforted him
really in total delirium ?
this pledge , however , wasn ’ t really a pledge at all , but simply a smoothly fashioned wooden block , no larger than a silver cigarette case in size and thickness
abroad in the same period , and it is in at least one of these , in at least one of his works ( fathers and sons ) that turgenev 's importance both as a thinker and as a figure whose work had consequences in real life should rather be sought
stop it , he said , exchanging glances with arkady , who was standing near the carriage while even the peasant sitting on the box had turned away
i ’ m telling the truth !
and i would have told him the whole story
having learned , in turn , that he was depressed and concerned about her , sonya sent him a note written in pencil , informing him that she was much better , that she had caught a simple , mild cold , and that she would come to see him where he worked soon , very soon
sonya recalled how svidrigaylov had told her yesterday that raskolnikov had only two roads before him—siberia or
why is that the case ?
one of the convicts was about to attack him in a rabid frenzy ; raskolnikov waited for him serenely and in silence : he didn ’ t budge ; not a single feature of his face quivered
he stood there , stared , and didn ’ t believe his eyes : the door , the outer door from the entrance hall onto the landing , the one he ’ d rung and entered not that long ago , stood open , open as wide as his hand : no lock , no bolt , all the time , during all this time !
do you know what ?
that doesn ’ t happen here on earth , but up there
wouldid he hiccup a great deal ?
i gave away all my money
once nikolai petrovich had fenechka bring him a glass of lemonade ; pavel petrovich stared at her intently and emptied the glass
i thought about it all night and found where you are mistaken
of course , here you have a common commercial transaction , an undertaking for mutual profit with equal shares ; in other words , he ’ s splitting their expenses in half ; bread and salt in common , but bring your own tobacco , as the proverb says
ah , fichtrre , pst , pst , mon bibi , and so on
she repeated as if distracted and embraced him again
you can imagine her suffering !
turgenev does not depict this conflagration—though he alludes to it—for the same reason that he does not depict the meaningless ( bessmyslie ) or the formless ( hezobrazie ) : his novel is itself an icon of that culture he defends—restraint , order , form
what nonsense i just blurted out , eh ?
what do i have in common with this
the old woman kept coughing and wheezing
she turned abruptly and headed for the door
and i felt such a hatred for this poorest peasant , this philip or sidor , for whom i am to be ready to jump out of my skin , and what do i need his thanks for ?
the frying pan lebezyatnikov had mentioned was nowhere to be seen ; but instead of that , katerina ivanovna began to clap out the time with her hands as she forced polya to sing and lyonya and kolya to dance ; then she herself even began to join in the singing ; but , as a result of her tormenting cough , she broke off each time on the second note and collapsed into despair again , cursed her own cough , and even wept
he has often seemed to us to have left much unsaid , to have , as it were , only drawn the skin from his subject
petr petrovich , pulkheriya aleksandrovna proclaimed in a dignified manner
she was planning to come see you ; avdotya romanovna tried to restrain her , but she didn ’ t want to listen
how could i have possibly given her anything more ?
bazarov 's thoughts are expressed in his deeds , in his treatment of people ; they shine through and it is not difficult to make them out , if only the reader carefully organizes the facts and is aware of their causes
a year or so passed
this is the best time ; i couldn ’ t pick a better one !
and the person who calls him a scoundrel for that is also a scoundrel , he added a moment later
there 's no need for me to explain to you at this time why i sit here with my arms crossed , as you so kindly put it
he was even beginning to rave
poor vasily ivanovich hastened to reply
was it the arrears , or what ?
all of a sudden her arms , thin as matchsticks , embraced him very tightly , her head rested on his shoulder , and the little girl began crying softly , pressing her face more and more tightly against him
you conceived a theory and felt ashamed that it failed , that it proved to be not very original !
in that regard , we have here in petersburg
his role as a spokesman for his age , and for his position as cultural intermediary between russia and western europe
what i found out—and that ’ s exactly why i came here—about the murder of the old woman , the civil servant ’ s widow , he said at last , almost in a whisper , drawing his face extremely close to zametov ’ s face
pavel petrovich turned slowly on his heels and slowly withdrew ; nikolai petrovich followed him
luiza ivanovna hastened to curtsy very deeply to him ; hopping up and down with her rapid little steps , she flew out of the office
in vino veritas , and now the whole truth had emerged , that is , all the filth of his crude , envious heart !
the floors were strewn with freshly cut grass , the windows were open , and a fresh , light , cool breeze was blowing into the room ; the birds were chirping under the windows , and in the middle of the room , on tables covered with white satin shrouds , there stood a coffin
by it—yet you have invited two students to visit you here
she replied , but then directed the conversation in a different direction
finally , in one of the conversations between bazarov and pavel petrovich , one of them mentions cavour , directly citing a passage in the contemporary
nastasya cried suddenly and burst out laughing
he entered in a mood as somber as night and greeted them awkwardly , for which he grew angry at once—at himself , of course
anna sergeevna 's estate stood on the slope of a bare hill , not far from a yellow stone church with a green roof , white columns , and a fresco over the main entrance depicting the resurrection of christ in the italian style
gentlemen , gentlemen , please , let 's not get personal !
so all of that was just nonsense , and you don ’ t have your own girl , and so , most likely , you must be insane !
that ’ s all you need to say
he was breathing heavily , deeply , and infrequently ; blood had oozed from the corners of his mouth ; drops of sweat stood on his forehead
he began to fear his every word , every gesture , which , of course , would be embarrassing for anybody , especially for a person so unsure of himself
i ’ m getting married for myself , because i find things difficult ; of course , i ’ ll be glad if it also turns out to be of use to my family , but that isn ’ t the main reason for my decision
an enormous number of unresolved points and doubts still remained
what do you mean , the one ’ ?
i knew she vas a thief !
but peasants live there , genuine , homespun russian peasants ; so our contemporary , a developed person , would sooner prefer prison than life with such strangers as our peasants are , ha-ha !
i know , i know !
her only good feature was her eyes , not really her eyes themselves— they were small and gray—but their gaze , quick and deep , uncaring to the point of audacity , pensive to the point of despondency—
there were only two workmen , both young lads , one older , and the other much younger
thus , v v vinogradov found a whole multitude of realisms in the russian nineteenth century :
i can , but you can ’ t : she won ’ t take you in because
he was still on his knees
everyone who knew him found this man difficult to deal with but acknowledged that he knew his business
he finally found what he was looking for and began reading ; the lines jumped before his eyes ; however , he read the entire news item and greedily searched through following issues for the latest additions
you may laugh at me , but my mother ’ s come to visit—he turned to porfiry suddenly—and if she finds out , he said , quickly turning back to razumikhin , trying hard to make his voice tremble , that this watch has been lost , then i swear , she ’ ll be in despair !
what did svidrigaylov say to you ?
allow me to ask , have you known my evgeny for long ?
for two whole weeks !
i really don ’ t care ; i ’ m not here to cure you , but , of course , you understand me
breathed new life into hegel 's dusty triads
at this point raskolnikov became confused and was about to make a significant mistake
but that wasn ’ t the case !
he took a chair and sat down opposite raskolnikov
if i ’ d been racing or hadn ’ t called out to him—but i wasn ’ t going fast , only at a moderate pace
besides increasing in number , bazarov 's images of disease and death are now applied to himself : the machine 's become unstuck
and he will judge and forgive everyone , both the good and the evil , the wise men and the humble
as i was coming here
zosimov cried cheerfully as they entered
bazarov is a strong man , no doubt—and very possibly had he lived beyond his twenties he might have become , beyond the horizon of the novel , a great social thinker , a prominent physician , or an active revolutionary
it seems that you came to see me before you found out i was capable of having what you call my own opinion , observed raskolnikov
she , too , felt agitated all that day , and that night she even felt sick again
and it ’ s improper for me , an examining magistrate , to be carried away like that ; i had mikolka on my hands , and already had facts—say what you will , there were facts !
rest assured that he spoke about you with rapturous respect
ones , not only the nihilists like bazarov who were mentioned , but also the superfluous men , the failed quixotic idealists of herzen 's and turgenev 's generation , men perhaps like bakunin ; and if that conjecture is correct ( for it has to be admitted that it is only conjecture ) , then it is probable that turgenev may have decided to rehabilitate the reputation of his own generation of the intelligentsia by turning his failed idealist of a hero , dmitry rudin , into a revolutionary through the addition of the final short epilogue describing his death on a paris barricade
but my father 's all right ; he 's been around , had his ups and downs
i ’ m very , very glad to have made your acquaintance
then , like a spider , i took refuge in my corner
but in reality , it is actually marvelously clear , unusually attractive , and throbs with warm life
‡ long live perpetual war ( french )
raskolnikov took his cap ; still deep in thought , he left his room
and what makes it even worse , they apologize for not asking my advice and for deciding the matter without me !
who knows what might happen ?
how can that be explained ?
he thought to himself
tame and not the excitement of the wild
arkady turned around and saw a tall woman in a black dress standing near the door of the room
nikolai petrovich , fenechka 's voice rang out nearby
katkov took me to task for making bazarov into an apotheosis
what a swine you are !
you wo not believe me now , but let me say this : you and i fell into the society of women and found it very pleasant ; see above , p , n
if bazarov , for example , possesses the reader 's attention and sympathy , he does so because in reality all these words and actions flow out of a living soul , not because each of his words is sacred and each action fair
a feeling akin to suffering showed through it , but at the same time there was something immobile , almost insane
so you ’ ve come back !
at their last meeting , svidrigaylov explained to raskolnikov that he had made provisions for katerina ivanovna ’ s children and had been successful ; that he had , thanks to some connections , located certain people with whose help he had been able to place all three orphans , immediately , in an extremely respectable institution ; that the money he had set aside for them helped a great deal , since it was much easier to place orphans who possessed some capital than impoverished children
he was not to be found right away : he would made his way to the very depths of the garden and , resting his chin on clasped hands , sat there , lost in thought
believe me , i wish i were something ; well , a landowner , a father , a lancer , a photographer , a journalist
lizaveta ’ s work , thought the young man
katerina ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during the last week ; the red blotches on her cheeks burned even brighter than before
to his own astonishment , arkady constantly thought about ni-kolskoe ; previously he would merely have shrugged his shoulders if anyone had told him he could be bored under the same roof with bazarov , and whose roof at that—his father 's !
let ’ s go , mama , let ’ s just leave the room for a minute , a frightened dunya whispered
the next day he was supposed to leave for marino to see nikolai petrovich
i don ’ t want to !
kind sir , kind sir , you don ’ t know a thing !
a certain peasant named dushkin , the keeper of a tavern opposite that same building , appears in the office and brings in a jewelry case with gold earrings and tells a whole long tale : a fellow comes runnin ’ in two days ago , he says , toward evenin ’ , just after eight o ’ clock
it ’ s the blood , she replied at last , softly and as if talking to herself
and so , my young colleagues , i address myself to you
in spite of the fact that pulkheriya aleksandrovna was already forty-three years old , her face still preserved traces of her former beauty ; besides , she seemed much younger than her years , something that happens almost always with women who maintain their clarity of spirit , freshness of impressions , and honest , pure intensity of heart as they age
from my hands into yours
the door to the staircase was open wide , and he could hear shouts and arguments
a little while ago , i said to an offensive fellow that he wasn ’ t worth even your little finger
pavel petrovich turned quickly and frowned ; but his brother was looking at him so joyously , with such gratitude , he could not help but return a smile
you ’ ve been waiting for them !
moreover , the very form of a literary work , considered apart from its content , so far as that is possible , is itself an idea !
i ’ m so fed up with all of it !
let 's let bygones by bygones , she said , all the more so since , in all honesty , i was at fault then , if not for flirting , then for something else
she cried , resting after every word
he could hear women squawking
namely : he could never understand or explain to himself why , so tired and worn out , when it would have been most advantageous for him to go home by the shortest , most direct route , instead he headed home across haymarket square , which was completely unnecessary
when my only daughter went out for the first time with a streetwalker ’ s yellow ticket , † then i went out , too
you ’ ve lost your faith and you think i ’ m flattering you crudely ; but have you really lived much yet ?
perhaps you ’ re not in a good state ; you ’ re tired , she said gently
i am glad he 's come home
in this respect , the nihilism of the younger generation and the romanticism of the older generation are equally far from prosaic values
his work has become pure art
you have brought yourself , she said
i myself was present at some disgraceful affair
i ’ ll say too much again
i knew that you ’ d holler ; but , in the first place , even though i ’ m not wealthy , i have ten thousand rubles to spare , that is , i have absolutely , absolutely no need for them
but now he didn ’ t feel very afraid ; in fact , he didn ’ t even feel afraid in the least
from what heights of majestic serenity do you utter these philosophical prophecies ?
dunechka hastened to ask
that reconciliation , or at least the attempt at reconciliation , occurs on at least three levels
no , ma ’ am , this is not very nice , ma ’ am !
so then , what do you think ?
yes i have to
perhaps he ’ s saving you for something
she said , turning suddenly on raskolnikov
oh , what can be done now ?
as a result of prejudice , she might not agree to see me alone without a recommendation ; on the other hand , with your help , i can count on
some five minutes passed
are you going to a name-day party now , sir ?
but i ’ m a coward
so that ’ s what your convictions are !
when i ask him where he got ’ em , he says he ’ d found ’ em in the street
vasily ivanovich attended him in silence ; arina vlasevna came in to ask him how he was feeling
what sort of income ?
petr petrovich examined all those present with a hopeful look
the conductor conveyed it without any charge to you
you see , it 's sometimes useful for a man to take himself by the scruff of the neck and pull himself up like a radish from a row in the vegetable garden ; i did that several days ago i wanted to have one more look at what i was leaving behind , at the row in which i would been planted
indeed , the great effect of the ending is achieved not through bazarov 's speeches but by communicating the despair of his parents
he glanced up—it was zametov , the very same , looking the same , with rings and chains , his curled and pomaded black hair parted in the same way , wearing a fashionable vest , a somewhat worn jacket , and dirty linen
he ’ s a political conspirator !
by the way , do you believe in ghosts ?
and sometime , afterward , in a few years , after you ’ ve lived a while , perhaps you ’ ll come to understand what they meant
i don ’ t understand , whispered sonya
at the same time , i ’ ll let zosimov know , although he should have been here a while ago , since it ’ s already past eleven
he knew as well as anyone that in political terms there was a great gulf fixed between the representatives of the russian empire and the representatives of the russian exiles in paris , of whom lavrov was a recognized leader
behind the church a large village extended for some distance in two rows of cottages with chimneys visible here and there over thatched roofs
by the very way in which the butler met them on the steps of odin-tsova 's house , the friends realized they would acted unwisely in yielding so suddenly to a passing whim
so much so that even antonovich ( striking proof ! )
just now i wanted to throw it all into the water , the purse , together with all the items that i haven ’ t even looked at
hey , i ’ m an aesthetic louse , nothing more , he added suddenly and burst out laughing like a madman
the certificate ’ s still in her trunk , and she recently showed it to our landlady
where , though , in the final analysis , does a turgenevan ideal emerge ?
still less can he be reproached for abusing that superiority and that power
take care of your health , your health , sir
although razumikhin could rarely drink enough to get drunk , this time something was amiss
arina introduced order into the household
he 's such a good , kind man !
i have heard so much about i am an old friend of evgeny vasilich and can even say—his disciple
we were legally married , and she carried me off at once to her estate in the country , as if i were her treasure
no , you are a fellow artist , extending your hand in brotherly gesture to your friend
a strange smile distorted his face , a pitiful , sad , weak smile , one of desperation
were you friendly with lizaveta ?
you were asking the caretaker
he raised himself and sat up , but said nothing to her and looked at the floor
her eyes were wide open as if they wanted to jump out , and her forehead and entire face were wrinkled and distorted by a spasm
you think they ’ ll come and steal you away ?
tolstoy has anna read—
he cried , as he went through the gate
what , for example , could be more lowly than to teach a peasant to read , to help him , to found hospitals , etc ?
he made no reply and sank onto a chair
and you dared call me as a witness ?
let ’ s not sing a hussar leaned on his sword , § for heaven ’ s sake
what are you so glad about ?
zis izn ’ t ze place
the movement of the plot is dialectical as well , pitting tragedy and comedy against each other
i have never experienced anything of that sort , thanks to my sister ; i mentioned my income simply because it seemed appropriate at the time
i should ’ ve known all this , he thought with a bitter grin
thirty kopecks , yes , sir
fenichka , fedosya nikolaevna , after her husband and mitya , adores no one so much as her daughter-in-law , and when the latter is at the piano , she would gladly spend the whole day at her side ( [ ] )
from there the clattering of billiard balls could be heard
he took off his coat and jacket , wrapped himself up in a blanket , and lay down on the bed
with a shout he pushes his way through the crowd and runs to the mare , embraces her bloody , lifeless muzzle , and kisses her , kisses her eyes , her lips
as a matter of fact , some people really were laughing , while others were shaking their heads ; in general , everyone was curious to see this madwoman and her terrified children
well , go on and beat me , but don ’ t play with me like a cat with a mouse
so tenderly , with affectionate respect , with embraces , with loving compassion and gentleness
meanwhile my daughter from my first marriage has grown up ; i won ’ t describe what she had to suffer while growing up , my daughter , from her stepmother
i am sure you would not ever be the first to express your feelings , no matter how strong or sacred they were
that 's what she herself said
what can i do with a few five-kopeck pieces ?
once somehow , about two months ago , they were about to meet on the street , but raskolnikov turned away and even crossed over to the other side of the street so he wouldn ’ t be noticed
he deserted his mother and sister
i don ’ t recall , sir
a bit harsh , muttered nikodim fomich , sitting down at the table , where he started signing documents
i asked you for one reason ; i came for one reason : so you wouldn ’ t leave me
but his own lips and eyebrows were also twitching , his chin trembling obviously he was trying to control his emotions and appear almost indifferent
he ’ d even managed to slip something into the policeman ’ s hand
one morning arina came into his study and , after bowing deeply as usual , asked him if he could help her daughter , who had a spark from the stove in her eye
dostoyevsky mocked it and mocked turgenev 's interest in it
he used to meet her most often in the early mornings , in the garden or courtyard ; he never went to her room , and only once did she come to his door to ask whether or not she should bathe mitya
the trip to town , its purpose to look at people , also is not without consequences for him
the purse was crammed full ; raskolnikov stuffed it into his pocket without examining it and tossed the crosses back onto the old woman ’ s chest ; this time he also grabbed the axe and rushed back into the bedroom
you want to have contact with people , even if it 's only to abuse them , you still want to have contact
what will happen to you ?
he found razumikhin easily , as everyone already knew the new lodger in pochinkov ’ s house
pavel petrovich stood up from the table
a real man should not care ; a real man is someone you do not have to think about , but someone who should be obeyed or despised
going well beyond chernyshevsky , he insisted that love was not to be seen as a purely personal who scoffed at religion , customs , and convention ; those who busied themselves exclusively with studying the exact sciences ; and political radicals
arkady has become zealous in the management of the estate , and the farm now yields a fairly good income
amaliya ivanovna rushed to pick up the money
no , my friend , not at all
his legs were ready to give way beneath him , but he kept going
razumikhin asked suddenly , growing heated
the pain from the whip ’ s lash had eased , and raskolnikov forgot all about the blow ; one anxious and somewhat hazy thought now preoccupied him exclusively
in the background , katya , with her quiet sensitivity , her appreciation of daily rhythms , and her attentiveness to small gestures of sensitivity and kindness , plays the key role
they avoided her ; the conversation they would overheard accidentally would not leave their minds
good lord , pierre sapozhnikov why he 's always at lidiya khostakova 's
at least petr petrovich immediately pitied her
about the murder , he confirmed what he ’ d said before : i don ’ t know nothing and don ’ t have no idea ; i heard about it only two days ago
bazarov emerged as a simple man , free of all affectation , and at the same time firm and powerful in soul and body
i ’ m not talking about clues now
having thought it all through , while preparing for a new struggle , he suddenly felt that he was trembling—indignation even began to seethe in him at the thought that he was trembling in fear before the hated porfiry petrovich
the magical world he would already entered , arising from dim mists of the past , was shaken and then vanished
i ’ ll put on my sock !
the confession and communion ended
vasily ivanovich laughed and sat down
she said aloud to herself
what should i give him ?
no one can gain the upper hand over you
it seems we met somewhere
oh , if only i could guess the meaning of its secret ,
just imagine , rodion romano­vich , they found a gingerbread rooster in his pocket : he was dead drunk , but he was thinking about his children
because she ’ ll take the same road
i ’ ll be dirty , filthy , drunken , and to hell with it !
napoleon , the pyramids , waterloo—and a scraggly , vile widow , an old woman , a moneylender , with a red trunk under her bed—what a mouthful even for porfiry petrovich to swallow !
i don ’ t recall that i wrote any untruth , ma ’ am
his heart skipped a beat
we have to talk about something , don ’ t we ?
even without that , everyone he met would look up , stare at him , as if he was all they had to be concerned about
both virtues and shortcomings are more clearly apparent when regarded from a detached point of view , and , for this reason , a detached , severely critical view of bazarov proves , at present , to be much more fruitful than indiscriminate admiration or slavish worship
arkady turned to katya
raskolnikov folded his arms and began listening
raskolnikov stared in horror as the bolt jiggled in its latch , and he waited with dull fear for the bolt to pop out
dunyasha , she cried , please bring mitya here
perhaps it ’ s a good idea , but then again , god only knows
that compensates me for the unpleasantness of undeserved reproaches
that alone seemed somehow strange to raskolnikov : he ’ d just come from there , and here they were talking about her
porfiry petrovich will also be there ; he ’ s the local examining magistrate
he loves to dupe people , that is , not dupe them , but fool them
drink at least a little bit !
third , when arkadi agrees to give his father kraft und stoff to read , approving this choice because it is a popularization ( chap
while some accuse foreigners simply can not understand the merciless reproaches directed at me for bazarov
so far as the father and mother are concerned , it would be difficult to find anything more touching
he had something to say on that account that was both progressive and propagandistic and could console his esteemed friend and undoubtedly promote his subsequent development
they ’ re all you ever think about
as to whether he knows how to conduct the business , there ’ s no doubt about that either
you can ’ t imagine , rodion romanych , what cowards people are about having their own opinions !
consider the impact of the climate alone !
well , my friend , hell , i ’ ve gone on and on
what ’ s the matter with you , rodya ?
and nikodim fomich , of course , was also missing
raskolnikov identified himself , provided his address , and , with all his might , as if it concerned his own father , tried to persuade them to carry the unconscious marmeladov home as quickly as possible
gave herself to a man ; she wrote to her mother and father that she didn ’ t want to live among prejudices and was going to enter a common-law marriage ; people thought this was being too rude to her parents , that it should have been possible to spare them , to express it more gently
the translations of turgenev into french—though some are by mérimée and turgenev himself—have a tendency to strip him down to something much barer and poorer
i know one hand that could knock me over with a finger , if it wanted to
well , my boy , he said at last , give me a cigar , will you ?
what do you want her for ?
of course , we were careful not to let anything slip out about these future dreams of ours , especially about your becoming his partner
but tell me this : you seem to know the daughter of the deceased man , that very frail girl !
what ’ s there for me to ask ?
when i meet a man who can hold his own next to me , he said with slow deliberation , i will change my opinion of myself
the 'generation of the forties ' , his own and turgenev 's , may have been fatuous and weak , but does it follow that their successors—the brutally rude , loveless , cynical , philistine young men of the sixties , who sneer and mock and push and jostle and do not apologize—are necessarily superior beings ?
that means someone ’ s at home
he turned his pocket inside out in an instant and—so it was—there were spots , traces of blood on the pocket lining !
first , there seemed to be many people surrounding him , wanting to pick him up and carry him somewhere ; they stood over him , arguing and quarreling
i won ’ t sign it
but here arkady 's eloquence failed him ; he lost his train of thought , stumbled , and was forced to fall silent for a moment ; katya still did not raise her eyes
ah , here ’ s the news : a woman fell down the stairs—a tradesman burned up as a result of drink—a fire in the sands—a fire on the petersburg side—another fire on the petersburg side—izler—izler—izler—izler—massimo
of course , the fact that i killed the old woman—that was a bad thing
a chill seized raskolnikov at this hideous answer
it used to be that i ’ d lie around like a beast , and receive only abuse !
well , what about that poor mikolka , whom you must have tormented and tortured , psychologically , that is , in your own way , until he confessed
well , she asked after a little while , did it help ?
just at this time , some other steps were heard ; the crowd in the entrance divided , and a priest , an old man with gray hair , appeared on the threshold , carrying the sacraments
arkady , who at this point is just beginning to free himself from his discipleship to bazarov , allows himself to challenge his friend :
because we were alone , completely alone , she said in a plaintive voice and suddenly broke off , having recalled that mentioning petr petrovich was still rather dangerous , in spite of the fact that everyone was completely happy again
around the eating houses on the filthy , stinking lower floors of the buildings on haymarket square , and especially in the taverns , were gathered all sorts of craftsmen and ragpickers
if we have come this far , we might as well go through with it
razumikhin was also remarkable in that no failures ever troubled him and no adverse circumstances could ever seem to weigh him down
upon reaching the corner , she also turned into that street
yes , sir , fenechka replied
when he finished all this , he relapsed into gloomy thoughts once again
we met yesterday at your place , he said casually
it ’ s either me or luzhin !
one must not live in a disorderly fashion in the country , boredom takes over ( viii , [ p ] )
cried katerina ivanovna , indicating the dying man
the man was silent and suddenly bowed deeply to him , almost down to the ground
he ’ s not drunk at all !
but has come inside , has in fact become a part of odintseva herself
dmitry prokofich told me and explained everything
spite was seething in him more and more intensely , and if he ’ d encountered mr luzhin at that very moment , he might just have killed him !
terrible impatience pulled him farther and farther in
meanwhile pavel petrovich left the garden ; walking slowly , he made his way to the woods
he even followed the development of contemporary literature , though with casual condescension , it 's true : in the same way a grown man who meets a line of young boys on the street will sometimes fall in behind it
there was also this particular little theory of his—an ordinary one—according to which people are divided , don ’ t you see , into raw material and special people , that is , people for whom , by means of their high position , the law has not been written ; on the contrary , these people themselves create the law for others , for the raw material , the rabble
of course , i ’ m prepared to bow down before them , but you ’ ll agree , it would be terrible if there were very many of them , wouldn ’ t it ?
try to read a bit of it
what do you think ?
besides , she was proud , extremely proud
how do you do , arkady ivanovich !
for what is culture if not the measuring , the accumulation and preservation of values ?
well , the hell with all that , let ’ s get down to business !
mama also sent me
i will tell you straight out , like a peasant , god grant you health for your kind and good letter !
but painters—no , i don ’ t recall any painters
you know , he has something on his mind
later it seemed to zametov that the strangest thing about that moment was that their silence lasted a full minute , and for that minute they stared directly at each other
mikolka swings a second time , and another mighty blow lands on the unfortunate mare ’ s back
i live only once , and i also want to
the study of the mutual interaction , struggle and succession of forms and types of realism , together with their interrelations with other methods and systems of artistic representation in the history of russian literature in the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries is one of the central problems of the history of the russian literary art
if someone had come in , what would he have thought ?
the man noticed him right away , looked at him quickly , but lowered his eyes once more
that you ’ ve felt , felt a great deal—all that i ’ ve known for a long time , sir
your father always was a bit of an eccentric , he observed , playing with the tassels of his magnificent velvet dressing gown
for you a book , a pen behind your ear , learned research—that ’ s where your spirit soars !
i went back an hour later , but they wouldn ’ t admit me ; the third time i came—they let me in
razumikhin stood there , thought for a while , and removed his hand
nikodim fomich was about to add something more , but , glancing at the head clerk , who was also staring at him intently , he fell silent
raskolnikov turned to her and looked at her with agitation : yes , that was it !
last of all , i ’ m at least twice as strong as you are
leaning out over the water , he absentmindedly regarded the last pink glow of sunset , the row of houses , which grew darker in the deepening twilight , one distant little window , somewhere up in an attic along the left bank , shining with a flame from the last ray of sunlight that struck it for a moment , and the darkening water of the canal ; he seemed to be staring at the water with particular attention
we ’ ll see what the doctor says !
they do not know how to suffer , they will not complain , but at times they feel only that all is empty , boring , drab , and meaningless
you repeat that—forgive the blunt expression—silly reproach
snapped razumikhin , then turned abruptly to zosimov to resume their previous conversation
he asked upon entering an extremely spacious and even orderly tavern that consisted of several rooms , though they were rather deserted
well , go shoot yourself ; or don ’ t you feel like it ?
is he counting on my frayed nerves ?
you ’ ll drive him to madness and he ’ ll betray himself
in his autobiography he writes i was accused of proposing a nihilist philosophy [ he writes in obvious bewilderment ] unfortunately the censorship rules of the time prevented me [ from defending myself against such a charge ] such an explanation would have at once put an end to such misinterpretations
without the least delay , he began stuffing them into the pockets of his trousers and coat without sorting them or opening the wrapping or the cases ; but he didn ’ t manage to get very far
you ’ re the spit and image of him , not merely in your looks as much as in your souls
they would all begin a new life together
such is my nature !
directly , not stealthily—at his face , which was stern and irritable , his eyes downcast , signs of contemptuous resolution visible in every feature , and she thought , no no
some peasants were waiting inside
we must also say a word or two about peter
hear what the gentleman called you ?
to the memory of bazarov , katya whispered into her husband 's ear , clinking glasses with him
look , said arkady suddenly , a dry maple leaf 's broken off and is falling to earth ; its movements are like those of a butterfly in flight
she reached out her hand to take it
said ( yes , he ’ d said it clearly ) that he couldn ’ t live without her any longer
you both may be mistaken about rodya , pulkheriya aleksandrovna declared , somewhat offended
suddenly i look and see a girl of about thirteen , well dressed , dancing with a professional ; there was another one in front of her , vis-à-vis
at first marfa petrovna approved , but then she grew afraid that i ’ d overdo it
but also of fear
so , perhaps you can tell us something about him
yes , spring 's in full bloom
moreover , new motifs appear : insecure megalomania supersedes self-confidence , hostility to arkadi replaces condescending but genuine friendship
nikolai petrovich has been made one of the mediators appointed to carry out the emancipation reforms , and works with all his energies ; he is forever driving about over his district ; delivers long speeches ( he maintains the opinion that the peasants ought to be brought to comprehend things ,
you are being much too generous and modest , pavel petrovich objected
yes , the priest ; he 's going to dine with us i did not expect it and advised against it but that 's how it turned out he did not understand me well , and arina vlasevna besides , he 's very nice and reasonable
here ’ s the thing : an honest , sensitive man confides in a friend , while a businesslike man listens but keeps on eating , and then devours the other person
of course , i ’ m an ass , he said , black as a storm cloud
so much sorrow , grief , curses , and tears hidden from everyone , so much , because you ’ re no marfa petrovna , are you ?
but you know , evgeny vasilich , i have managed to figure you out : i was poor and ambitious like you ; i may have gone through the same trials as you
so , do you love her ?
katya drank the glass at one go , the way women usually drink , that is , in twenty gulps , without pausing ; she took the banknote , kissed svidrigaylov ’ s hand , which he had solemnly extended to her for that reason , and left the room ; the boy with the hand organ trailed along after her
did i ever think yesterday in the train that i ’ d feel grateful for this ?
where will justice be found afterward ?
brother , brother , what are you saying ?
there are sciences , just like there are trades and vocations ; but science in general does not exist
you have to do something right now , do you understand ?
in spite of the fact that he was almost collapsing , he managed to make a detour and approach his house from the opposite side
however , they don ’ t have any facts , not one—it ’ s all a mirage , it cuts two ways , merely a passing fancy—and they ’ re trying to use insolence to confuse the matter
anna sergeevna walked behind him slowly and , after calling katya , took her by the hand
here 's timofeich come to pay his respects to you , evgeny
you bound me by your word , and now you ’ re going back on it
you ’ re crying , sister , but are you able to give me your hand ?
what ’ s the matter with you ?
when bazarov leaves odintseva on the first night , the narrator describes her as she sits in solitude :
it ’ s a feverish blush , svidrigaylov thought , but it was more like a flush from wine , as if she ’ d been given a whole glass to drink
i wouldn ’ t have touched it for a year , or two , or three—well , just try to find that murderer !
it would be impossible for me to quote an excerpt from this magnificent episode ; it would destroy the integrity of the effect ; i should really quote the whole ten pages , but i do not have the space ; furthermore , i hope that all my readers have read or will read turgenev 's novel
and you would like to know the reason for my reserve ; you would like to know what 's transpiring within me ?
you ’ re in a government office
he added suddenly , looking at her
one enthusiast shouts from the crowd
it ’ s not his stinginess or miserliness that ’ s important here , but the tone of it all
turgenev 's narrator , voyeurlike , watches from jane costlow , worlds within worlds , pp
i ’ m not talking about you
the next morning , at precisely eleven o ’ clock , when raskolnikov entered the department of criminal investigations in the building housing the district police station and asked to be announced to porfiry petrovich , he was somewhat surprised by how long it took for him to be admitted : at least ten minutes passed before he was called
knowles , equally pessimistic about turgenev , is a good deal more patronizing :
my sister 's never been so favorably disposed toward you as she is now , much more so than on your first visit here
test , even then i understood perfectly well that i wouldn ’ t endure it
another unpleasant circumstance furthered katerina ivanovna ’ s irritation : at the funeral , almost no one , not one of the lodgers who had been invited , showed up , except for the little pole , who even managed to make it to the cemetery ; but at the wake—that is , for the refreshments—the most insignificant and poorest of them appeared , many of them even already intoxicated , the wretched good-for-nothings
we haven ’ t arrived at any truths without having uttered nonsense beforehand fourteen or so times , perhaps even one hundred and fourteen times , and that ’ s honorable in its own way ; well , we can ’ t even talk nonsense by relying on our own intelligence !
once he says the following to his friend arkady : you said , for instance , to-day as we passed our bailiff philip 's cottage—it 's the one that 's so nice and clean—well , you said russia will attain perfection when the poorest peasant has a house like that , and every one of us ought to work to bring it about
and i was eavesdropping here , sitting on this chair , two evenings in a row , for about two hours each time—and , of course , i was able to find out a thing or two , don ’ t you think ?
only after four hours does bazarov come to his father 's room and cauterize the sore spot , without concealing either from himself or from vassily ivanovich that this measure is useless if the infected matter from the corpse has entered the blood
the location must have registered in your memory automatically
what i wish to emphasize , rather , is what saternikov has in mind when he says the remarkable demonstration with which [ secenov ] illustrated his lectures acquainted students with the most recent techniques of scientific experiment and taught them to use the language of facts
as for the old aesthetic , literary culture , it will crumble before the realists , the new , tough-minded men who can look the brutal truth in the face
the only thing missing was for him to place his hand on his cheek and to lean his head to one side for him to resemble a peasant woman
in an instant , he shoved everything under his coat and fixed his eyes on her
dunechka ’ s already decided , and i ’ m in complete agreement with her , pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to say
in a good sense , my dear boy , arkady nikolaevich , in a good sense !
the next form for incorporating and organizing heteroglossia in the novel—a form that every novel without exception utilizes—is the language used by characters
what an eccentric you are
suddenly svidrigaylov appeared amidst this large crowd
my sister sonya , the little girl replied , smiling even more cheerfully
well , go on , said zosimov
martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , lord , by this time he stinketh : for he has been dead four days
turgenev 's view of russia , like chekhov 's , is nonetheless sadly relevant to twentieth-century russian history , particularly in the years of the development of the bolshevik revolution
it ’ s worth something , right ?
and as for zametov
this is in spite of the fact that she understands some of these questions perfectly
lebezyatnikov rushed over to him
the authorities ' choice fell upon matvei ilich kolyazin , son of the kolyazin whose patronage the kirsanov brothers once enjoyed
murder her and take her money and then use it to dedicate yourself to the service of all humanity and to the common good : what do you think , wouldn ’ t thousands of good deeds make up for one little , tiny crime ?
everything she did appeared to be done on purpose , as children say , that is , neither simply nor naturally
as soon as razumikhin left , raskolnikov stood up , turned to the window , bumped into one corner and then another , as if he had forgotten how small his room was , and
what will happen if you get taken away to a hospital tomorrow ?
as soon as he heard that his guest had a small matter to discuss with him , porfiry petrovich immediately asked him to sit down on the sofa
like luzhin and , probably , following his example , that nasty scoundrel lebezyatnikov had also failed to show up
[ fathers and sons , ch ]
young lady , young lady !
i treat you as a person ennobled by education
it is just as hesitant , ambiguous , and inconclusive about this intra-generic debate as it is about the inter-generic debate between the novel and the utopia or tract
other factors enter in : compromises of principle come to be accepted as expansion of experience , as recognition of life 's ambiguities ; more specifically , those who have created life and come to love what they have created are less willing to contemplate its destruction in the name of some abstract goal
bazarov drew a line on the ground with the toe of his boot
raskolnikov turned his pale , almost sad face to him and made no reply
and as far as anna sergeevna 's concerned , you recall , she agreed with bazarov about many things
he always frightens me
and her dress is torn
have some of the jellied fish , that ’ s the best
in the next room , somewhat larger than his own , there were two guests
- : the text of turgenev 's novel literally swarms with pauses and ellipses
whenever we put two emotions into juxtaposition we have what can properly be called an idea [ my italics—df ]
upon reaching her house , sonya turned in at the gate ; he followed her and seemed to be somewhat surprised
she collapsed onto the floor at once
in setting off to spend time with his parents and with friends bazarov had no particular aim in mind
suddenly flashed through arkady 's mind
she ’ s not that kind of woman
forms mustn ’ t hamper the interrogator at every step
when the question arose as to whether to shave his stubble or not ( praskovya pavlovna owned an excellent razor that had belonged to her late husband , mr zarnitsyn ) , the question was answered in the negative , even with some bitterness : let it stay like it is !
did you hurt yourself ?
i decided not to keep any of the freed serfs who used to be house servants , or , at least , not to assign them any duties carrying responsibility
as you can see , this is a task of vital importance , substantial and complex ; i probably will not be able to cope with it but i am willing to try
after a few hours of sleep the fever passed , but it was late when he woke up : it was two o ’ clock in the afternoon
when you still can ’ t walk , when your mug ’ s still pale as a ghost , and you ’ re gasping for breath !
you ’ re making things much easier for me , avdotya romanovna !
he felt oppressed , confined , and somehow awkward about having come here
now , if this old woman pawnbroker was killed by one of her clients , it must have been someone of higher social standing , since peasants don ’ t pawn gold items—how , then , do we explain this depravity of the civilized part of our society ?
he cried , wanting to extend his hand to her
will you be there ?

having arrived here and now having decided to undertake a certain
she has such a kind face and eyes
meanwhile the doors of the inner rooms were beginning to be opened again by curious onlookers
while chatting with his organ of local government concerned with issues of trusteeship , foundling hospitals , and credit operations , including the mortgaging of estates
they think i ’ m sick !
this also surprised avdotya romanovna
the choice of the word primirenie strongly suggests a hegelian subtext , and the entire passages attempts to create harmony out of discord
bareheaded and all wearing cotton dresses and goatskin shoes , they were chatting in hoarse voices
what do you want ?
i didn ’ t kill to help my mother—that ’ s nonsense !
how can you take such bad care of yourself ?
i mean , will she really let you go ?
and someone else , as well
and yet the father is not only not offended but rather happy and satisfied
the sound of carriage springs , particularly noticeable in the depths of the countryside , suddenly reached his ears
she approached me , took my hand , and shook her head at me harshly , so harshly , as if she was censuring me
is there really no justice ?
§ a reference to nikolai chernyshevsky ’ s ( – ) influential novel , what is to be done ?
nikolai petrovich surmised that his brother 's loathing for bazarov had not diminished in the least
he ’ s innocent and very impressionable
raskolnikov entered the room and sat down on a chair in exhaustion
i ’ m an honest man , rodion romanych , and i ’ ll keep my word
the first is the thematic , where one of the major themes in the novel , if not in fact the major theme , is that all children rebel against their parents , thus embodying a principle that russian hegelians would identify as negation
evgeny , you know i have always been honest with you ; i can assure you , i can swear to you , you are mistaken
wait a moment , you derelict !
here ’ s where he lives , in this building , he thought
now , my friend , i ’ ve found out all there is to know about you ; it was not for nothing that you confided to pashenka when you were still on good terms with her , and now i ’ m speaking out of love
at the mitrofanyevsky cemetery , and then to come to our apartment
why are you all so tedious ?
about a minute passed
is he really trying to distract me with his foolish chatter ?
and thus the incident occurred
if a writer belonging to our younger generation and profoundly sympathizing with the
you ’ ve confused me completely
but he did not feel timid or agitated for very long ; odintsova 's serenity was communicated to him as well
a young girl was lying amidst the flowers ; she was wearing a white tulle dress ; her hands were folded and pressed against her breast—as if they were chiseled out of marble
i might be able to toss out an idea , a seed
'tell me honestly , he wrote to one of his most caustic critics , the satirist saltykov ( who complained that the word 'nihilist ' was used by reactionaries to damn anyone they did not like ) , 'how could anybody be offended by being compared to bazarov ?
bazarov , come over here and sit down on the sofa next to me
all i have to do is go down the stairs !
phew , what a fine young lad you are !
where are you going ?
his head is very badly injured
why , if i suspected you in the slightest , why would i proceed in that way ?
that was my money , my own , really mine
trying to untie the knot and turning toward the light from the window ( all of her windows were locked , in spite of the stuffiness ) , she left him alone for a few seconds and stood with her back to him
if it had been some other word , well then
are you therefore denying him any moral feeling ?
get some water right away , you devil !
regarding my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary , i agree that it ’ s somewhat arbitrary , but i ’ m not insisting on exact numbers
i do not wonder , incidentally , that bazarov has remained an enigma for many people
well , no , bazarov replied
there ’ s no reason to recall it !
in three years or so , you won ’ t be getting up to treat anyone
he still didn ’ t know why it was impossible ; he merely felt it , and this tormenting awareness of his frailty before this necessity almost overpowered him
three days ago there was another scandal in the tavern : a fellow ate his dinner and didn ’ t want to pay for it ; i ’ ll put you , he says , into my satire
but i told you sincerely , the whole truth !
is he also a relative of yours ?
which i mention in my diary is not love ) —then things are altogether bad
but the final words of the text , eternal reconciliation and life everlasting ( : [ p ] ) , convey the opposite message ; they take the novel beyond the confines of time itself
where am i standing ?
but where was that ?
and how , how will i feed them tomorrow ?
this doesn ’ t involve a question of permission or prohibition
ilya petrovich is here , and he ’ s beating the landlady !
bazarov and pavel petrovich , both distant from family life , argue over dinner , and we may , in the process of following the exciting and dramatic discussion , forget that a third set of values is tacitly present
with this thought , raskolnikov stared at him intently
turgenev begins this description of odintseva with an enumeration of her unresolved longings , her lack of passion ; he ends with a description of her in a moment of solitude—bathing—that both in allusions and rhetoric defies the decorum that odintseva so meticulously observes
on the other hand , if we take the novel 's tragedic side out of context , we are led to the view that life , ruled by fate and the irrational , is essentially meaningless : death is triumphant
i am writing this on the assumption that rodion romanovich , who seemed so ill during my visit , suddenly recovered within two hours , and that consequently , leaving his own room , he may be able to visit you
by this difference had diminished : nikolai petrovich had lost his wife and pavel petrovich , his memories ; after the princess ' death he tried not to think about her anymore
baden-baden , may ( june ) , [ original in german ]
i take the bet !
at times a shiver ran up and down his spine
rodya ’ s given me permission
or that if i posed the question , is a person a louse , then of course that person is not a louse for me , but is a louse for someone to whom that question never occurs and who acts without asking questions
is that possible now ?
i guessed it as if seeing through a clear pane of glass ; if i hadn ’ t been waiting for you in that exact way , then i wouldn ’ t have noticed anything about your laughter
he recognized that voice : it was that of ilya petrovich
he was crushed by poverty , but even his constrained circumstances had ceased to burden him of late
she also listened very attentively when i told her about the workers ’ associations in france
sometimes , upon emerging from a fragrant bath , all warm and soft , she would fall to musing about the insignificance of life , its sadness , travail , and evil her soul would be filled with unexpected boldness and seethe with noble aspiration ; but a draught of wind would blow in from a half-opened window and anna sergeevna would retreat into herself , complain , and feel almost angry ; the only thing she needed at that moment was for the nasty wind to stop blowing on her
don ’ t be angry , brother ; i ’ ve come for only a few minutes , dunya said
and do you believe in them ?
is there someone in my room ?
she cried out suddenly to one of them , have you had any pancakes ?
each of us has our own steps to take
we ’ ll translate , publish , and study , all together
such a sartorial ethos , requiring long hours of grooming and primping , gracefully underlined the leisure values of the society , the lady 's inability to work , and a sweet , sheltered femininity
from that point of view bazarov is a direct and immediate imitator of onegin , pechorin , rudin , and lavretsky
as even you must know , i didn ’ t have the honor of knowing your papa at all
my god , dunechka , what will happen ?
if only one could be other than oneself , or resemble oneself as little as possible !
this morning she chatted with me for half an hour , and it was very sensible and interesting
her braid became undone and curled around her shoulder like a dark snake
he was rushing to attend to some matter
i have friends ; i know useful people
bad idea , very bad !
arkady said with a tender smile
but she ’ s an awful bitch
he seemed to be grasping at anything and smiled coldly when he realized that fact , because he had definitely decided to go to the police station and knew for sure that everything would soon end
and there i was agreeing to live on one square yard of space !
he stood there awhile , smiled again , turned around , and once again headed up to the office
how did you say : to rob her , but you didn ’ t take anything ?
cried raskolnikov with exaggerated irritation
or anyone of that sort ; therefore , not being one of them , i can ’ t possibly provide you with a satisfactory explanation of how i would act , if i were
was clear : i knew very well that my attitude toward the character i had introduced was not only honorable and free of prejudice but even sympathetic , for i valued the calling of an artist , of a literary man too highly to be hypocritical in such a matter
all of these factors strongly furthered the conclusion that raskolnikov was not completely like an ordinary murderer , a robber , or a thief but something altogether different
the poor woman shouted in despair
i thought you ’ d cry out again , ah !
raskolnikov approached the gate and began looking : would he glance back and beckon to him ?
how dare you take ten rubles from him !
even i didn ’ t know the whole truth then
the preparations for the wake in katerina ivanovna ’ s room aroused his curiosity somewhat
vasily ivanovich sat next to bazarov
what do you want ?
first of all , you must get well
i ’ ll say she does !
svidrigaylov was busy making all the funeral arrangements
that ’ s sensible : you must cut your coat to fit your cloth ; and you , mr luzhin , what about it ?
but the peasant woman , who would come to complain that she felt
he had blustered only a little ; he hadn ’ t even managed to say everything ; he ’ d simply been joking , had gotten carried away , but it had all ended so seriously !
they do not retreat one iota from their rights , and consequently , they respect the rights of others ; they demand the fulfillment of obligations owing to them , and consequently , fulfill their own obligations
i can be both a public official and in the service , but i ’ m always obligated to feel that i ’ m a citizen and a human being myself and to render account
therefore , i must leave
he ’ s said to be a reasonable fellow ( which his surname shows ; he must be a seminarian ) ; well , let him watch over your sister
no , brother , you ’ re not telling the truth : the environment ’ plays a large role in crime , i can assure you
it ’ s well known what a fellow raves about in his delirium
he pulled some money out of his pocket and kept showing it to a policeman
razumikhin told me only yesterday that you were still delirious
on more than one occasion , upon returning home from a tender meeting with her , kirsanov would experience that lacerating and bitter annoyance that overwhelms one 's heart after a definitive failure
but that hurts more , sir , much more , sir , when they don ’ t reproach them !
n-no , sonya whispered innocently and timidly
after a fretful day spent in endless fantasies , in joyful daydreams and tears , that night she fell ill and in the morning was in a fever and delirium
or fashionable people , for example , people in high society , there ’ s always something to talk about , c ’ est de rigueur , but people in the middle , like us—that is , those who think—we ’ re always embarrassed and not talkative
it seemed that if he took another step , she would scream bazarov bit his lips and left the room
he needed to hurry and , at the same time , to make a detour : he wanted to approach the building in a roundabout way , from the other side
bazarov 's response to arkady is to insist on what is hidden , to insist that outer form dissolves to reveal something darker : his citation of a popular proverb ( still waters you know how it goes ! )
he looked at her
she shouted for a whole hour and finally ordered that dunya be sent back to me in town on a simple peasant ’ s cart , onto which they tossed all her things , linens , dresses , in any which way , untied and unpacked
she claims she ’ s only thirty-six and has a right to say so
he ’ s not a drunkard ; he never drinks !
the highest elected official in a province
what if that were true ?
never mind : he ’ ll come !
i ’ m waiting for him to come at any moment and recant his testimony
wait a bit , i told you only the beginning
when after repeated promises to return not later than in a month 's time , bazarov finally managed to tear himself away from the embraces that held him and climb into the coach ; when the horses set off , the harness bells began to ring , and the wheels began to turn ; when there was nothing left to see , the dust lifted , and timofeich , stooped and tottering as he walked , crawled back to his room ; when the old folks were left alone in their own little house , which now suddenly seemed shrunken and decrepit , vasily ivanovich , who for several moments continued bravely waving his handkerchief good-bye on the back porch , sank down on a chair , his head dropped to his chest
thus herzen had every right to claim that turgenev was more of an artist than people think in his novel , and so lost his way—happily , from my point of view : he was heading for one room but wound up in another and better one
you rang the bell , pulled it , but they didn ’ t open ; that means they ’ ve either both fainted , or else
for all that bazarov 's nihilism accurately reflects a phase of russian and european history , it must be taken more as a symptom of political desperation than as a formal intellectual system
by the way , don ’ t you recall , rodion romanovich , how several years ago , during the time of beneficial openness , a certain landowner—i forgot his name ! —was slandered for having beaten a german woman in a railway car , don ’ t you remember ?
well , i do , replied the officer , staring attentively at his impassioned comrade
it smelled of a freshly painted floor , as well as of camomile and melissa
you ’ re such a strange fellow
furthermore , i want to have a necessary and thorough discussion with you regarding one particular matter , about which i wish to learn your opinion
the offended young woman cried
despite his coolness bazarov begins to waver
she ’ s very nice , and all this is nonsense !
porfiry asked politely , extending his hand with excessive courtesy
he definitely had to hurry !
bazarov 's relationship with odintsov is brought to an end by a strange scene which takes place between them
no , rodion romanych , i ’ m not making a mistake
show it to me , mama
’ cause i was very afraid
is that an eating place upstairs ?
that ’ s all there is to it !
fenechka blushed , but glanced up at pavel petrovich
be so good as to choose
so then , my friend , so as not to go on too long , at first i wanted to unleash an electric current here throughout , in order to root out all the prejudices in this place at once ; but pashenka was victorious
she was breathing hoarsely and with difficulty , as if something were caught in her throat
however passionate , guilty , rebellious the heart concealed in the grave , the flowers growing over it gaze at us serenely with their innocent eyes : not only of eternal peace do they speak to us , of that great peace of indifferent nature ; they speak also of eternal reconciliation and of life without end
now i have a steward who 's a townsman ; he seems to be a sensible fellow
ten years passed in this way
( that ’ s a good phrase ! )
poetry can become outmoded because it is in a language that is false
their idealism is repulsive too
hey , wait a moment !
there was another one on a steamer last week : someone abused the family of a state councillor , his wife and daughter , with the foulest language
you know , i sometimes suffer from an excess of bile , pavel petrovich replied serenely
goodness , papa , whatever for ?
i ’ m entrusting them to you , so to speak , razumikhin
and immediately turned away
the hell with them ?
bazarov , meanwhile , falls prey to her charms , and flirts with her almost from their first meeting
if you didn ’ t believe that this could have happened , why have you taken the risk of coming to see me alone ?
but this is all nonsense , as i see now
no , indeed , it ’ s just that i ’ m interested , strictly , in clarifying the meaning of your article , merely in a literary sense , of course
tell me , why should i restrain myself ?
it wo not be easy to break the news to them
at least i try , as far as possible , not to let any grass grow under my feet , as they say , not to fall behind the times
what 's to be done , madam ?
well , let ’ s suppose there is evidence , sir , but evidence , old boy , cuts two ways , for the most part , sir
sonya looked at him , as he walked away , as if he were mad ; but she herself was like a madwoman , and she realized it
i ’ m talking about that question , how they themselves understand things !
raskolnikov took out whatever coins he had : three five-kopeck pieces
where could he run to , ha-ha !
how can i let him go away alone now ?
then , right after church , without making any stops , she came to us and told us everything
but i really don ’ t need any lessons
( they recalled it later )
no , sonya , that ’ s not it !
n-no , replied dunechka , growing more animated
leave me in peace !
it was very likely that he hadn ’ t washed or changed his clothes in those five days
magnificently well is the task performed ; but we should like to have seen the carcass disembowelled and hung up
i don ’ t need any
whispered the old woman , i would like to put an amulet around his neck , but he would not let me
here is another proof of the extent to which you familiarized yourself with that character : in the meeting between arkady and bazarov , at that place where , according to you , something was missing , bazarov made fun of knights and arkady listened to him with secret horror , etc
the rustic locus represents an escape to a simpler , less corrupt society
that 's what it 's called by your sort , is not it ?
nature ) , and is casting one last longing , almost nostalgic glance at monumental time ( eternal reconciliation and life everlasting )
have to well , then
he said , waving his hand irritably
raskolnikov was tormented by the fact that this senseless delirium lingered in his memory so sorrowfully and painfully , that the impact of these feverish fantasies was taking so long to fade
you can end up with a fever if such impulses happen to irritate your nerves and you go around at night ringing doorbells and asking about blood !
i ’ m not talking about the constant , universal robberies and arsons
he added , both catching and avoiding the inquisitive glance katya was directing at him
he hadn ’ t even thought about them just now as he was inspecting his clothes !
but there absolutely is a definite law and there must be one ; it can ’ t all be a matter of chance
besides , he ’ d known all this before and it was not a new question for him ; last night when he ’ d decided to throw it all into the water , it had been decided without any hesitation or objection , just as if that was how it ought to be , as if it couldn ’ t be otherwise
what did you really think of me ?
however , what could they have in common ?
i have no idea how they scraped the money together to provide me with a decent uniform , eleven rubles and fifty kopecks
why did you go out ?
what ’ s wrong with all of you ?
your fingers are like a dead person ’ s
[ fathers and sons , ch ]
it seems to me that i ’ m completely candid : i ’ m telling you all these things for nothing , and i ’ m not even asking any reward , hee-hee !
nikolai petrovich was afraid of the young nihilist and had some doubts about his influence on arkady ; but he listened to him eagerly and attended his experiments in chemistry and physics willingly
you ’ re still showing signs of yesterday ’ s drinking bout
oh , how you torment yourself !
well , enough of this , however
how gray he 's become , the poor old fellow !
he explained it psychologically , in his own way
he will leave now , thought fenechka , but he did not , and she stood there before him as if rooted to the spot , her fingers fidgeting weakly
i ’ ll go to the governor-general himself
confess , my dear young man , that you ’ d really like to know what i ’ ve been reading about
raskolnikov slid the bolt and opened the door—he heard nothing ; all of a sudden , completely without thinking , he went out , closed the door behind himself as tightly as he could , and headed downstairs
i didn ’ t mean that at all !
turgenev brilliantly uses these characters ' psychological connections to time in fathers and sons as a means of illuminating the costly sacrifices that may be required by subscription to his moral program
i much preferred to lie there thinking
do you hear , sister ?
in any case , it ’ s unforgivably insolent
she stood with her side facing the table
right here in front of you—right here , just now , she confirmed to everyone that she received nothing from me but the ten rubles
you and i , my dear woman , he said to her , pestered enyusha too much on his first visit here : now we have to be smarter
no , brother , do not say that : bazarov 's clever and he knows his stuff
toward morning he felt a bit better
who saw me with you ?
society is deaf and implacable toward them
almost all the lodgers at mrs lippevekhsel ’ s apartment had spilled out of the inner rooms ; at first they crowded only in the doorway , but later they came bursting into the room itself
pavel petrovich , anna sergeevna , and bazarov , however forceful their personalities , are sufficiently psychologically fragile to require the support provided by identification with a single temporal phase
it was a moment of complete , spontaneous , pure animal delight
well , you know what happens to a prisoner who attacks a supervisor with a weapon : he accepted his suffering
as far as i can recall from yesterday , from zametov ’ s account , about half the matter came clear to me
that 's not much , is it ?
he continued to ask , addressing the stranger
that 's not one of my habits
principle , rather than say what really bothers him
what a delectable body !
on his way to see razumikhin , he hadn ’ t thought about having to come face-to-face with him
one must behave in the most delicate manner , act in the most skillful way , but she carried it out so that this newly arrived fool , this haughty creature , this insignificant provincial woman , simply because she ’ s some sort of major ’ s widow who ’ s come to petition for a pension and is beating down office doors , and who , at the age of fifty-five , dyes her hair black and wears both powder and rouge ( this is well known )
all of a sudden , now with a cheerful face , he burst into laughter himself , as if nothing had happened , and went up to porfiry petrovich
but all of these were just trifles he hadn ’ t even begun to worry about , and there was no time to do so
he closed the door behind himself again and waited a little while
chernyshevsky 's novel was indeed a successful manifesto ; it recruited countless thousands into the radical movement and led lenin ( who is known to have read it at least five times ) to declare , [ it ] profoundly transformed me and created hundreds of revolutionaries
as a result , it was terribly stuffy
said the beggar woman in a mournful voice
but it ’ s as you like , sir , and i ’ ll be very , very , very
it has to be
he could drink without limit , but could also abstain totally ; at times he could be unacceptably mischievous , but he could also refrain from mischief completely
he wondered ; but the mistress turned out to be russian , a woman about fifty , neatly dressed , with a good-looking , intelligent face and a measured way of speaking
and he brought in his psychology , too ; i had to devote some time to him , because this was a matter of life and death
did she really give you any ?
he brought the book nearer to the candle and began thumbing through its pages
not all of them , replied bazarov with a short yawn ; it was obvious he did not want to continue the discussion
well , tell me what to do now !
yells mikolka , and now , as if beside himself , he jumps down from the cart
i am even afraid i might be ill
nearly a half century later , on the eve of the russian revolution of , the liberal historian of literature d n ovsyaniko-kulikovsky , confident that russia was marching boldly along the progressive path of western european social development , scolded turgenev for the pessimistic and skeptical attitude he had displayed in his correspondence with herzen toward russian reality , the russian people , our history , our whole past and , at least , our near future
i ’ ll have to take that into consideration , he thought
imagine , she made good on her promise and took the children !
but now , strange as it seems , a peasant ’ s small , scrawny , light brown nag is harnessed to such a large cart , one of those horses—he ’ s seen it often—that sometimes strain to pull some huge load of firewood or hay , especially if the cart has gotten stuck in the mud or a rut
he already knew that a german , a civil servant , had been living there with his family : it must be that the german ’ s moving out now and , consequently , on the fourth floor , on this staircase , on this landing only the old woman ’ s apartment will be occupied for a certain time
you see , ladies—he stopped suddenly , as he was now climbing the stairs to their rooms—even though my guests are drunk , they ’ re all honest ; and even though we ’ re talking nonsense , because i ’ m also talking nonsense , we ’ ll finally lie our way to the truth , because we ’ re on a noble path , while petr petrovich
it seems to me that your arrival will have an extremely beneficial effect on him
who sent the letter ?
well , thank you , rodya , for telling me this
we ’ re neighbors , he continued in a particularly cheerful way
) —now i can confess to you frankly , that i noticed this idea of theirs a while ago , all this time , it goes without saying , merely as a hint , a creeping suspicion
true , since that morning a great deal of time had elapsed , too much , much too much , and there had been no news at all about porfiry
then i recalled your little article in that journal , you remember , the one we talked about at length during your first visit
don ’ t torment me ; say what you have to say !
( oh , what will happen to them now , what ? )
the scene in the hall , near the lamp , hadn ’ t passed unnoticed
judge for yourself : why should they call the caretaker , if they ’ d done the deed ?
bazarov did not become abased , and the meaning of the novel emerged as follows : today 's young people become carried away and go to extremes ; but this very tendency to get carried away points to fresh strength and incorruptible intellect ; this strength and this intellect , without any outside assistance or influence , will lead these young people on to the right road and will support them in life
you count badly , raskolnikov interrupted him
bazarov dies amidst that light and that warmth
there he seemed to feel better and even more alone
replied svidrigaylov , smiling vaguely
this definition of a real man precisely fits bazarov himself : he continually seizes the attention of the people surrounding him at once ; some he frightens and antagonizes ; others he conquers , not so much with arguments as with the direct force , simplicity , and integrity of his ideas
all the money was to be left to a monastery in the novgorod province , for the eternal remembrance of her soul
it made me very glad , the more so as my confidence in my own work was badly shaken
what a gold mine they ’ ve discovered !
in the hallway , among the crowd , he noticed the two caretakers from that house , the same two he ’ d told to fetch the police that night
examining her closely , he guessed at once that she was completely drunk
but what a temperament you have !
he stood up from the table , paced the room for a long time , and then stopped next to the cardplayers , as if rooted to the spot ; but he did not go home any earlier than usual that evening
and so the novel sets up a parallel structure , with the proponents of great abstract theories and grand romantic passions yielding to those cherishing the quiet virtues of daily life
it ’ s after two o ’ clock
he began to question her ; the girl came to life and very quickly began to babble something to him in her childish language
we destroy because we are a force , arkady observed
she ’ s looking for justice
they were stretched across the path , blocking their way ; people were swearing at them from all sides ; they were on top of one another like little kids ’ ( the actual expression used by the witnesses ) , screeching , fighting , and laughing , each trying to outdo the other with his laughter , making the funniest faces
( our people sent us ) touchingly demonstrate
he passes himself off everywhere as a worthless fellow ; he lives like a fool and will die the same way
don ’ t interrupt me , sonya !
he thought , walking slowly and limply along the canal embankment
and suddenly raskolnikov remembered clearly the whole scene from two days ago under the gateway ; he recalled that in addition to the caretakers there had been several people standing there , including some women
we started to congratulate him
however , he decided to leave in a few minutes
however , these rumors were very significant
it ’ s better to run away completely
why didn ’ t you come sooner ?
he said suddenly and decisively ; and she won ’ t visit me in prison !
i am thinking : my parents have a pretty good life !
you ’ re right that i have acquaintances , svidrigaylov replied , bypassing the main point
it seemed to me
another clerk was about to take a seat in the corner
[ he waved his hand weakly ]
he ’ s a clever fellow , clever , even very smart , only he has a special cast of mind
take you , for example : you avoid society , feel oppressed
i do , repeated raskolnikov , raising his eyes to porfiry ’ s face
before , this zosimov said he was afraid rodya might lose his mind
then i have the honor of proposing the following : we will fight early tomorrow morning , let 's say at six o'clock , beyond the grove , with pistols , at a distance often paces
were you drinking with him ?
i merely believe in my main idea
in a word , i haven ’ t looked into the glass retort in which all this happens
however , emotion had been awakened in him ; looking at her , his heart contracted
death will disprove you , and that 's all !
good heavens , evgeny , you are speaking just as you should
to act , destroy , he continued
do me a favor , leave all those vulgar tales alone , svidrigaylov replied squeamishly and with revulsion
i found it even back at the time , sir ; god sent it to me !
and yet he is extremely nice
i am surprised at you !
but consider the fact that a mistake is possible only on the part of those people in the first category , that is , the ordinary ’ people ( as i called them , perhaps very inauspiciously )
sometimes the poor come for my help
( and , seeming to draw her breath with pain , sonya read clearly and compellingly , as if she herself was confessing for all to hear : )
who sees time as his project
but you can ’ t endure it , and if you remain alone , you ’ ll lose your mind , just as i will
since even these results , that in the final analysis deny thought any meaning , are in themselves the results of from a a grigorev , sochineniya , edited by n n strakhov ( st petersburg , ) -
what do you have there , leeches ?
the two together might , like dostoevsky 's shatov and kirillov , come to a whole man ; but they are not together , they alternate in russian life , as in russian literature , each testifying to the social impotence that has made the other possible
whose hand is that ?
in a word , there were many problems ahead
but that ’ s not true , not at all !
sometimes it seemed to him that a change was also taking place in odintsova , that something special had appeared in her expression , that perhaps but at this point he usually stamped his foot or clenched his teeth and shook a fist in his own face
i know even more so that drunkenness is not a virtue
and you , katya , she added , play something for arkady nikolaevich ; he loves music , and we will listen , too
admit that you believed me
he expressed himself cautiously and said that of course , since he wouldn ’ t be able to get along without a secretary , naturally it would be better to pay a salary to a relative , rather than to a stranger , if that person turns out to be competent to carry out his duties ( as if you could turn out to be incompetent ! )
well , sir , good-bye , sir
the next morning right after breakfast anna sergeevna set off botanizing with bazarov and returned before dinner ; arkady did not go anywhere and spent about an hour with katya
it ’ s funny-looking , and therefore noticeable
raskolnikov jumped up from the sofa , stood there a few seconds , and sat down again without saying one word
bazarov denies close bonds between parents and children ; the author does not reproach him for it ; he only develops a picture of parental love before us
what 's the matter with you ?
that sort of thing happens quite frequently , you know
was it in any way permissible for him , razumikhin , to harbor such a dream ?
he made her acquaintance accidentally ; she was very timid and shy , and their courtship consisted of half-words and half-smiles
it goes without saying that to label all these systems or forms of realism critical realism is too general and calls for concrete historical differentiation
what ’ s the worst part of it ?
cried razumikhin , shaking and squeezing the two women ’ s hands
i may be a scoundrel , but you mustn ’ t be
pulkheriya aleksandrovna was also about to bow to sonechka , but somehow didn ’ t manage it ; she left the room hastily
love him , love my brother !
svidrigaylov stood up and recovered his senses
† david livingstone ’ s ( – ) account of his travels in central and southern africa
suddenly a clock struck once from somewhere
go buy me a roll
eh , he ’ s in a hurry !
here 's our mr nihilist come to grace us with his presence , he said in a low voice
you ’ re not involved in it , so the hell with them ; we ’ ll laugh at them later ; and if i were in your place , i ’ d still try to mystify them further
a stream of blood trickled down his white trousers
so that ’ s what you ’ re driving at !
i was feeling very generous yesterday
his conversation seemed to arouse general , though listless attention
he was indifferent to food , but it was so bad , except for sundays and holidays , that at last he willingly accepted some money from sonya to provide for his own tea every day ; as for all the rest , he asked her not to trouble herself , assuring her that all her worries merely annoyed him
bazarov 's jocular tone , but , of course , bazarov pays not the slightest attention and keeps on talking about odintsov 's beautiful shoulders , he asks arkady whether this lady is really ooh la la ! , he says that still waters run deep and that a cold woman is just like ice cream
the matter was most ordinary and didn ’ t involve anything unusual at all
am i right in what i say ?
after an even more imposing silence than before , he continued :
why had he stood over the river and then chosen to turn himself in ?
whether you confess or not—it makes no difference to me now
one can always forgive that kind of lie , because it always leads to the truth
perhaps i found a treasure somewhere—how do you know ?
the key concept here is aufheben , hegel 's term for a transition wherein contradictions from a lower stage pass into each other and are simultaneously annulled and preserved in a higher stage
i ’ m sure that you have already formed an opinion about this mr luzhin , a relative of mine through marriage , even if you spent only a half hour with him or heard something about him reported faithfully and accurately
at that moment an adjutant came rushing up and asked her to dance a quadrille
vasily ivanovich cheered up a little
i found all this out recently from a very magnanimous man , to whom i gave myself ; we ’ ll establish a commune together
it ’ s almost ready now
he shouted at him , almost in a fury
bazarov shook peter by the collar and sent him off for the droshky
however , he finally found something to do
in addition , he felt in his own heart that groundless grief familiar only to those very young
do you think i ’ m not in favor of their telling lies ?
she , too , will understand
zosimov asked , addressing raskolnikov , staring at him directly and seating himself next to him at the foot of the sofa , where he made himself as comfortable as possible
at first she shunned him and once , toward evening , meeting him on a narrow footpath through a field , she turned off into the tall , thick rye , overgrown with wormwood and cornflowers , so as not to be seen by him
the peasant turned his dull and weak-sighted face to the two friends
what sort of a dirty trick was it ?
after removing everything , even turning his pockets inside out to make sure nothing was left , he carried the whole pile over to the corner of his room
she said rapidly , greeting him in the middle of the room
soldiers were carrying out a sofa , and i had to press up against the wall
i can ’ t imagine anyone more horrible , dunya replied , almost with a shudder , frowning
yes , yes , i ’ ll come , he replied , rising and hurrying
are you and i gods , then ?
the words burst forth at last from sonya ’ s constricted chest
you see , at the time i kept asking myself : why am i so stupid , what if other people are stupid and i know for sure that they are ?
i ’ ve decided this for certain
he explained all the reasons to sofiya semyonovna ; at first even she didn ’ t believe what she heard , but at last she believed her own eyes , her very own eyes
he went abroad , lived in germany and france , and returned to russia only on flying visits
lord , how stupid it all is !
won ’ t you help me learn to deal with him ?
i arrived at the station at daybreak—i ’ d dozed off during the night , exhausted , barely able to keep my eyes open—to get some coffee ; i look—and marfa petrovna suddenly sits down next to me , holding a deck of cards
he ordered tea , sat down , and lapsed into deep thought
no , my friend , it 's all that lack of discipline , shallowness !
raskolnikov said slowly , as if recalling something
so then , what do you think ?
odintseva in a moment of literal nakedness ; the narrator 's own transgression , however , is matched by odintseva 's
it was a sorry and pitiful sight to see her running , crying , and gasping for breath
to present the appearance of simplicity and homogeneity , yet in fact reveal the full complexity and variety of individual and social consciousness : herein lies a cardinal feature of turgenev 's art
these paroxysms of pride and vanity sometimes occur in the poorest and most downtrodden people and at times turn into irritating and irrepressible necessity
as you please , just as you please ; of course , katerina ivanovna would find it rather difficult to understand ; but are you aware that in paris they ’ ve already conducted serious experiments regarding the possibility of treating the insane , using only logical persuasion ?
he must have seen us today , he thought
pavel petrovich gave a little shudder , but then gained control of himself
from the beginning—or , rather , for a long time before—he ’ d been preoccupied by one question : why are almost all crimes so conspicuous , so easily discovered , and the traces of almost all criminals revealed so obviously ?
( i owed a total of seventy thousand )
this tavern , his debauched appearance , his five nights on a hay barge , his bottle , and , at the same time , this painful love for his wife and family disconcerted his listener
i have got lots of experience ; i have been around , you know
you know , i sometimes imagine it like that
in spite of her triumph and vindication—after the first fright and the passing of her stupor , when she had grasped and understood everything clearly—a feeling of helplessness and insult weighed painfully on her heart
they both approached the crossing
vasily ivanovich adjusted his hat
not true , they ’ re not more effective
nikolai petrovich exclaimed , rising to his feet
all right , what ’ s your little idea ?
it was hard to sink lower or become more slovenly , but raskolnikov found this aspect even pleasant in his current frame of mind
the business concerning your sister had been wrung out to the last drop
he gave him some medicine , a powder , i saw it , and then you arrived
if you correct society , you wo not have any more illness
continued raskolnikov with a cruel smirk
this was some sort of infinite self-humiliation
we will merely add that in general the factual , purely material difficulties of this affair played a very secondary role in his mind
on a funeral feast
the servant entered and informed him that the chairman of the provincial revenue department had arrived , an old man with sugarsweet eyes and wrinkled lips , who loved nature deeply , especially on a summer 's day , when , in his own words , every little bee takes a little bribe from every little flower arkady left
no , that ’ s not right !
but mr luzhin gathered his strength and , it seems , resolved for the time being not to notice any of this strange behavior
the owner of the establishment was in another room but frequently entered the main room , coming down the stairs from somewhere above , indicated first by the appearance of his fashionable shiny boots , with their large red tops
at that moment , he would have liked to strangle zametov
yes , yes , i ’ ll come , of course , of course , i will
raskolnikov hadn ’ t been here since then
turgenev 's every word was mannered ; he contributed no new word to russian literature
half an hour later bazarov and arkady entered the drawing room
i must observe that from a legal standpoint , this matter is extremely obscure
they were spouting such nonsense !
she began after a brief silence
porfiry could count on my answering like that and saying what i saw to establish credibility ; then i ’ d bring up something to explain
raskolnikov lay in the hospital all during the end of lent and the holy week of easter
how did you kill them ?
they ’ ll hear you and come in !
say , for example , to kill and rob ?
what do you mean too late ?
the student did so with some particular enjoyment and kept laughing , while the officer listened with great interest and asked the student to send this lizaveta around to him to mend some linen
fifi gladly ran out in the hope that someone would take her for a walk , but when left alone on the other side of the door , she began scratching and whining
raskolnikov desperately wanted to hear the words that were being sung , as if that were the most important thing
naturally , it ’ s impossible , but
mr bazarov referred disrespectfully to sir robert peel
in fact , everyone is in love with her : arkady , of course ; but also her father-in-law nikolai , since she shares so many of the values of his beloved first wife marya , and has even named her first-born kolya , after him ; even fenechka ( who will be discussed below ) is very fond of katya , and for good reason
raskolnikov stood up and began walking around the room
the next morning bazarov woke up before everyone else and left the house
i merely want to say that aristocratism is a principle , and in these times only immoral or frivolous people can live without principles
something whizzed sharply past bazarov 's ear , and , at the same moment a shot rang out
turgenev permits him to maintain his character by shifting the problem of generations to its ultimate form , that of death
surely you must know it was solely out of respect for you that i did not fulfill what you justly describe as my obligation
who ’ s this marfa petrovna ?
i love to meet young people
the major disagreements concern the questions of which characters actually represent the novel 's heroes and with which characters and ideologies turgenev 's sympathies lie
when andrey semyonych finished his lengthy explanation , with such a logical conclusion at the end of his speech , he was terribly tired ; sweat was even dripping from his face
the lines became confused in front of her because things darkened in her eyes , but she knew the passage by heart
if i agonized for so long about whether napoleon would ’ ve advanced or not , then clearly i felt i was not a napoleon
and there were little woodlands and winding ravines covered in sparse low-lying shrubs that called to mind their characteristic representation on ancient maps in the time of catherine the great
you know , rodion romanych , i threw an inkwell at him
in general you do not pay enough attention to such things , and you have such nice little feet !
in those days of national renewal , wrote elizaveta vodovozova , a representative woman of the 's , the young intelligentsia was moved by ardent faith , not by sweeping negation
there are romantics of realism they long for a reality and strive toward it , as former romantics did toward the ideal
and i await your family , that is , your mama and sister , at any moment
a carriage driver struck his back soundly with a whip because raskolnikov had nearly stumbled and fallen under the horses in spite of the fact that the driver had shouted to him three or four times
he must have stepped carelessly into that puddle then
at the most he sometimes wants to look at people
is that the case ?
razumikhin blurted out without turning around
he said ; suddenly he felt his voice trembling
dunya couldn ’ t help feeling that he was still very angry with her ; pulkheriya aleksandrovna kept examining him timidly
ye are made in the image of the beast and ye bear his mark ; but ye also shall come forth !
they were in the southern army , on the fourteenth of december , you understand [ here vasily ivanovich pursed his lips knowingly ]
meanwhile , katerina ivanovna seemed not to hear anything more ; like a madwoman she was embracing and kissing sonya
i love her more than anyone !
her composure was not shaken , but she felt sad , even shed a few tears , not knowing why , but not from any insult inflicted on her
i ’ m annoyed that all these stupid , boorish mugs will surround me now , stare and gape at me , ask me all their stupid questions , which i ’ ll have to answer—they ’ ll point at me
svidrigaylov said with a laugh
yesterday , in my drunken state , as we walked home , i blabbed about all sorts of stupid things
that witch , she set the time herself
in essence , chizhevsky argues that hegelian philosophy contributed hardly anything to turgenev 's works
and if we are wrong , so what ?
you were out walking the streets ?
beneath the rough , deformed , artificial , and affected forms , the profound vitality of all the phenomena and characters brought to the scene is heard
his face expressed infinite suffering
something was happening within him , something new , and at the same time he felt a kind of yearning for people
it leads to reflection precisely because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity
through this , if one were to judge the novel superficially , it is not very comprehensible , presents little that is appealing , and seems to consist entirely of an obscure logical construction
i do not know how to reply
is that the way to do it ?
you were in my lair , you saw it
domesticated , a fate bazarov will not choose
arina vlasevna summons you to tea , said anfisushka , walking past with an enormous dish of ripe raspberries
katerina ivanovna simply couldn ’ t resist : a week before she ’ d had a really terrible quarrel with the landlady , amaliya fedorovna , and now she ’ d invited her to come for a cup of coffee
why have you turned so pale ?
his former landlady , the mother of raskolnikov ’ s late fiancée , the widow zarnitsyna , also testified that when they were still living in another building , at five corners , during a fire one night , raskolnikov rescued two young children from an apartment that had already been enveloped in flames , and that he himself received burns in that fire
pavel petrovich began , without hurrying , to spread some butter on his bread
as he was leaving , svidrigaylov met razumikhin in the doorway
luzhin made a sour face and fell into a dignified silence
do you know how to dance ?
the form hasn ’ t gone away , sir , you ’ ll see for yourself !
he ’ s in such a state !
the cypress cross , that is , represents the common people , the copper cross—that ’ s lizaveta ’ s
they shared one strange trait : the more definitive they were , the more outrageous , the more absurd they immediately became in his own eyes
suddenly the lantern brightly lit the unfortunate man ’ s face : he recognized him
until yesterday he was constantly delirious
he very much wants to present you with ten thousand rubles and wishes to see you once in my presence
where did you see me this morning ?
i swear , i ’ ll shoot again
the dust we raise will blind your eyes , our mud will splatter you , but you have not reached our level ; you admire yourself unconsciously , take pleasure in abusing yourself ; but we find all this boring —give us someone else !
all right , arkady replied lazily
as the science he feels to be most scientific is physiology , it is not surprising that body imagery dominates his rhetoric
odintseva 's justification of her insistence on routine is that , otherwise , one would perish of boredom :
pisarev pointed out that her counterparts in real life were not nihilists , but false nihilists and false émancipées
i didn ’ t kill a person , i killed a principle !
how did you decide to do this ?
i think you have the right
i agree completely with all your observations ( the more so since v p botkin also finds them just ) , and tomorrow i will begin work on corrections and revisions , which apparently will be of considerable scope , and i have already written katkov to that effect
do you know what it 's for ?
he thought swearing an oath ; just as he was opening the door , he returned to take another look at her , to see whether or not she was asleep
dunyasha will do it if you are not there ; sit here for a while with a sick man
perhaps you ’ ll change your mind and come ?
the conversation about odintseva , however , is not merely a dialogue of chivalry and bravado ; the entire exchange is an assault ( on bazarov 's part ) on a culture that dissembles , presenting elegant form as a mask for something unseemly
it ’ s not your revolver , but marfa petrovna ’ s , whom you killed , you villain !
she approached him gently , sat down on the bed next to him , and waited , without taking her eyes off him
it ’ s not at all like you , for example , or that mr razumikhin , your friend !
i consider you one of those people who , if their innards were being cut out , they ’ d stand there smiling at their tormentor—if only they ’ ve found faith or god
but we do not find a psychological analysis or a coherent compendium of bazarov 's thoughts ; we can only guess what he thought and how he formulated his convictions to himself
although both interpretations have validity , neither takes into account the extent to which these themes are overshadowed by the fact that fathers and sons is very much a novel about time itself
marmeladov obediently and calmly raised both his arms to the sides to make it easier to search his pockets
still those same methods of yours : how is it you ’ re really not fed up with them ?
the author clearly started by wanting to do something for the fathers , but they turned out to be such nonentities that he 'became carried away by bazarov 's very extremism ; with the result that instead of flogging the son , he whipped the fathers
allow me to introduce myself , he began with a polite bow
every once and a while it 's allowed , muttered the old man
all because i left the veal on the table
it ’ s very , very important for them !
by the way , i have to speak with you
order is needed in all things , she replied
the most serious charge against turgenev of this kind would seem to have been made by d s mirsky : there had always been in turgenev a poetic or romantic vein his attitude to nature had always been lyrical even in his most realistic and civic novels the construction and atmosphere are mainly lyrical
phew , these shameless beasts , always pesterin ’ me !
the third sentence of this paragraph , while being a part of the author 's speech if judged by its formal syntactic markers , is at the same time in its choice of expressions ( this son of a medico ) and in its emotional and expressive structure the hidden speech of someone else ( pavel petrovich )
turgenev does indeed resolve his novel with a celebration of form and order—but an order that is open , not repressive
he was a man with a kind soul !
you can always get some money from her
in turgenev , we see only the results at which bazarov arrived , we see the external side of the phenomena ; that is , we hear what bazarov says and we know how he acts in life , how he treats various people
and when he learned you were studying law and that as a result of circumstances you were unable to complete the course , he said , what a pity !
everything , bazarov repeated with indescribable composure
but we , the speaking and writing realists , are now too carried away by the mental struggle of the moment , by this fiery skirmish with backward idealists , with whom it is not even worthwhile to argue ; we , in my view , have gotten too carried away to maintain a skeptical attitude toward ourselves and to submit to rigorous analysis the possibility that we might have fallen into the dust of the dialectic battles which go on in journalistic pamphlets and in everyday life
what terrible things you say !
even if i were guilty ( which is not at all what i ’ m saying ) , for what reason should i come to you and confess , when you yourself say that if i ’ m arrested , i ’ ll be at peace ?
almost anything could happen now !
he suddenly wanted to abandon the whole thing again and escape
near the big locked gates of the house stood a little man , leaning his shoulder against the building ; he was wrapped in a soldier ’ s gray overcoat and was wearing a copper achilles-like helmet
on that score , i can even tell you about a most interesting incident , one that continues up to now
you took offense at something he said and were unable to restrain yourself , nikodim fomich continued , turning courteously to raskolnikov , but that was to no avail : he ’ s one of our best men , our ver-r-r-ry best men , i tell you , but he ’ s like gunpowder , pure gunpowder !
a young person , carried away by his own wit , overstepping all obstacles ’ ( as you were pleased to express it in the wittiest and cleverest fashion ) , never even thinks about this
besides the danger of such an ecstatic , morbid mood , there was always the chance that someone might recall raskolnikov ’ s name from the former legal process and begin talking about it
i still can ’ t do it !
there ’ s justice and truth on earth , there is , and i ’ ll find it !
too great a passion is aroused in bazarov , while odintsov 's inclination does not rise to real love
he always seemed to take her hand with reluctance , always greeted her with a kind of annoyance , sometimes maintaining his stubborn silence all during their meeting
pavel petrovich remained alone and this time looked around with special attention
'civilization ' , meaning the civilization of the west , was the one and only item in the plethora of left-wing and right-wing ideas which turgenev was prepared to defend
for a moment , everything seemed to be spinning around raskolnikov
a hundred rabbits never make a horse , and a hundred suspicions never make a proof , as an english proverb has it , but that ’ s merely good sense , sir
one glass of beer , a piece of rusk , † and then , in a minute , my mind grows strong , my thoughts grow clear , and my intentions are reinforced !
as soon as i read the letter , i went out
i myself have always respected education combined with heartfelt feelings , and in addition , i ’ m a titular counselor
rodya , don ’ t spoil me too much : stop by if you can ; if not , then there ’ s nothing to be done about it ; i ’ ll wait
you know that was not the cause of our separation
he muttered in a low voice , as if not fully aware of what he was saying , and walked out of the room
what 's there to apologize for ?
don ’ t worry : nothing was divulged about the countess‡ but much was said about a bulldog , earrings , some chains , krestovsky island , a courtyard , nikodim fomich , and ilya petrovich , the assistant to the superintendent
then a strange thought occurred to him : perhaps all of his clothes were bloodstained , perhaps there were many spots , and he merely didn ’ t see them , didn ’ t notice them because his reason had been weakened , shattered
he went to church to pray with the other men
it became unbearable : he turned his deathly pale face toward her ; his lips twisted helplessly , trying to utter something
in a word—he was almost shouting , aware that the words about his illness were even more inappropriate—in a word : please either ask me whatever you want to , or let me go , right now
he pulled out the keys right away ; as before , they were all in one bunch , on one steel ring
after considering my proposal , you will see it 's replete with common sense and simplicity
however , there wasn ’ t much preparation to be done
her , arkady repeated meaningfully
i wanted to renew the conversation we began yesterday
you are healthy , independent , rich ; what else is there ?
fenechka blushed with embarrassment and joy
she gave him a welcoming , joyful smile but extended her hand to him timidly , as usual
she cast a sidelong glance at him
he went to the door , opened it , and listened ; but that wasn ’ t it
the worse it is , the better
ten years passed like a dream
if he does not come to love him , i repeat—i am at fault and have not attained my aim
how can you ask that ?
razumikhin shouted after him
they ’ ll all be
it ’ s you , you vile man , who may have been drinking , not me !
it was not only about you
she asks that you do us the honor of attending the funeral in the church tomorrow , and then come to a repast at our place
what do you want ?
why , it would be more just , a thousand times more just and more reasonable to plunge your head into the water and end it all at once !
listen to me , sir , he began in measured tones , using all his strength to restrain himself , but gasping for breath nonetheless
dunya recoiled from him in fear
petr petrovich , get out of here !
i said 'lousy little aristocrat , replied bazarov , lazily sipping his tea
he associated with these clerks precisely because they both had crooked noses : one ’ s nose turned sharply to the right , while the other ’ s turned to the left
cut off the whole million and reduce everything to a question of comfort !
would you like a cigar ?
even such a keen person as the poet baratynsky , called upon to look over the papers of pushkin after the latter 's death , could not help exclaiming in a letter : can you imagine what amazes me most of all in these works ?
but i was still a thousand miles away from supposing that she could represent this matter in a form so distorted by her fantasy
well , in that case , i will visit him , too evgeny vasilich , introduce me to your
leaving the civil service in which his father had by favor procured him a post ,
i ’ ve seen him only twice , but he seemed horrible to me , horrible !
he did not not know
that ’ s because i can feel it all
still the question remained for him : how could she have stayed in her present situation for so long and not lost her mind , if she wasn ’ t strong enough to throw herself into the water ?
do as you like
suddenly it seemed that the door to her bedroom was opening slightly and there , too , someone was laughing and whispering
i ’ ve been waiting for you here for some time
i do not deny the strange nature of our duel , but i consider it my duty to warn you that i intend to fight seriously
as for where he could acquire an axe , that detail didn ’ t faze him in the least , since there was nothing easier
he remembered why as he was passing an establishment , something like an eating house , and felt that he wanted to have a bite to eat
and it happened the same time i sent you that letter , that very day !
zosimov interrupted nastasya ’ s chatter with a certain displeasure
you wrote , raskolnikov began abruptly , without turning to luzhin , that yesterday i gave some money not to the downtrodden widow , as i really did , but to her daughter ( whom i ’ d never met before yesterday )
but what am i saying ?
the note asked him to cease these personal declarations and secret meetings that he ’ d insisted on
he cried insistently and irritably all of a sudden
if you were to say to him : ivan sergeevich , you do not like bazarov , but what would you prefer ?
it was a sudden death !
but as soon as he reached the stairs , he suddenly heard porfiry petrovich ’ s voice again
and remember , it ’ s with the same guarantee : if you wear these out , next year you get others for no charge !
lebezyatnikov immediately yielded and withdrew politely
bazarov , who had noticed her the instant she appeared at the ball , speaks to arkady about her , involuntarily intensifying the usual cynicism of his tone , partially in order to conceal both from himself and from arkady the impression that this woman has made on him
no , after what you have just said , you are not russian !
i have had a lot of trouble with the peasants this year , said nikolai petrovich , turning to his son
the waiter at the tavern , filipp , was already an acquaintance and fawned over him
if turgenev did not depict all fathers and sons , or not those fathers and sons who would like to be different , he splendidly described fathers in general and children in general and the relationship between those two generations
his conviction was fortified by his vanity and a level of self-confidence that could best be described as self-infatuation
as if they were right !
he only wanted to kill the old woman
the next day we hear that alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna had been killed with an axe
katya gave arkady a sidelong glance
that is , no one ever dared utter it aloud because it ’ s such ridiculous nonsense , especially after they arrested that painter
some second-major or other ; he served under suvorov
you can even find preencesses there
so that ’ s why you
kirsanov knows full well we are no croesuses and you do not own a palace
grinding his teeth once again , petr petrovich called himself a fool—of course , only to himself
he didn ’ t know and didn ’ t even think about what direction he was taking
i intend to fight seriously , repeated pavel petrovich and went to take up his position
odintsova soon appeared in a simple morning dress
of fate involved , something stronger than the author himself , something independent of him
well , yes , i am prepared to admit in front of this gentleman here that i had a certain passion in my youth—that 's true ; i certainly paid for it !
that sometimes happens with those monomaniacs who are too focused on something
should i take a cab ?
however , yesterday i , too , was
oh , rodion romanych , don ’ t believe everything i say ; perhaps you won ’ t be at peace at all !
would you like to know how we met ?
the door to the caretaker ’ s lodge was closed but not locked ; therefore , he was probably at home
are you strong enough ?
there are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities , avdotya romanovna
he found svidrigaylov very suspicious ; he decided to follow him
at times he wanted to begin swearing at them , taunting them , until they managed to force the door open
and fulfill my obligations
i like him very much
to fasten it from inside , someone has to be at home , do you understand ?
her father had managed to avoid all contact with his neighbors ; he despised them and they , him , each in his own way
a man must refresh himself with pleasant sensations ; life without pleasant sensations , even if all the vital needs are satisfied , turns into unbearable suffering
i had such dreams , strange , diverse dreams ; there ’ s no point in trying to tell you about them !
i don ’ t see her at home very often ; she leaves me all alone
he was thinking about her
it would not take much to present him as an ideal ; but to make him a wolf and justify him just the same—that was difficult
she must be around forty years old
i would like to
though the soup was barely lukewarm , raskolnikov greedily swallowed a spoonful , then another , and a third
herzen 's disparagement of the educated class in russia provoked turgenev into an for a discussion of the possible influences to which turgenev was subjected while he was in ventnor , see my article 'turgenev at ventnor ' ( slavonic and east european review , vol
fedosya nikolaevna really does not feel well today and will come out later
in short , who are you and what are you ?
i came by to see you , you know
the agent handed over the money and withdrew
as he emerged from voznesensky prospect into the square , he suddenly saw on his left an entrance to a courtyard surrounded by windowless walls
i ’ ve moved today , completely , with my uncle
that ’ s why you became so upset yesterday when i told zosimov that porfiry was questioning the people who had pledges !
in this instance he may be compared to a mathematician who tries to find some important theorem
time provides not merely a backdrop but a central focus of this masterpiece
the thing is that i really did cause significant trouble and unpleasantness to your sister , whom i greatly respect ; therefore , feeling genuine remorse , i sincerely desire—not to redeem myself financially or pay her for the unpleasantness , but simply to do something advantageous for her , on the grounds that i have not reserved the right for myself to perform only evil acts
he called me over to the window so he could question me in secret
what sort of a person are you ?
why do you , sofiya semyonovna , assume all these contracts and debts so thoughtlessly ?
it was then i conceived an idea , for the first time in my life , one that nobody had ever thought up before me !
he had attached himself to the idea of progress and to our younger generation out of eagerness
he ’ s also generous and kind
then , once on the staircase , he reconsidered and wanted to return
show him , aleksandr grigorevich
yet it was clear to him once again that sonya , with her character and the upbringing she had nonetheless received , could in no way stay as she was
silence prevailed once again
a year ago this young woman died from typhus , while , however , i continued to be a tenant there as i had been , and the landlady , as she moved into the apartment where she now resides , said to me
what will i replace it with ?
certainly , sir , replied fenechka , how much would you like ?
i ’ ve brought you
he stretched forward , leaned over , and raised the hook
well , damn it all !
why was it so necessary for him to ruin her life ?
i was very interested in it
well , yes , yes , yes , razumikhin said hurriedly , for some reason agreeing with everything
he remembered a great deal afterward
but the humane andrey semyonovich ascribed petr petrovich ’ s disposition to the lingering effects of yesterday ’ s break with dunechka ; he was burning with a desire to speak about that subject
on his first visit , he stated that he was a positive person ; he shares to a large extent , as he himself explained it , the convictions of our younger generation , and he is an enemy of all prejudices
her head also began spinning
katya threatened him with her finger
he left the eating place and set off almost at a run
for her part , katya did not prevent him from feeling despondent
man 's deliverance to fate and chance and the love between generations , the continuity of generations as man 's only consolation for the knowledge of his inevitable mortality
' i can not act now , thinks each of these new people , ' i will not even try , i disdain everything around me and will not conceal my disdain
we will each fire twice ; and , just in case , each of us will have a short note in his pocket blaming himself entirely for his own demise
and though mikolai isn ’ t a drunkard , he does drink , and i knew he was workin ’ in this here house , paintin ’ , together with mitrei , and they ’ re both from the same place
if only , if only i could rush up to him , embrace him , and weep—but i ’ m afraid , afraid
that evening anna sergeevna also thought about her guests
i will right away , and i will write to her myself
they may be frightened by it , they may be puzzled , but that is where the road to the future lies
i am afraid of them , of frogs , observed vaska , a lad about seven , with hair as pale as flax , a gray smock with a stand-up collar , and bare feet
at last he walked away , not even remembering where he was ; but when he reached the middle of the square , he suddenly experienced a tremor , a sensation overcame him at once , seized hold of him entirely—both his body and his mind
i hope these words do not refer to me , arkady objected with some annoyance
these days i can hardly think straight
what do you think , brother ?
i idolize my son ; as for the old woman : you know how mothers are !
no one answered her
it ’ s a steep climb to golgotha† hmm
it was as if it had been waiting to ambush him !
exclaimed the extremely elated pulkheriya aleksandrovna
that i was drunk , but
the light was no longer so bright in the courtyard
well , rodya , let ’ s not detain our guest
ah , my goodness , dmitry prokofich , you still don ’ t know
then for some reason she rushed to collect her silver spoons from the table
he had never before heard such unnatural sounds , such howling , wailing , gnashing , weeping , beating , and cursing
deep in thought , he sank down on the bench , weak and exhausted , looking at no one , oblivious of his surroundings
what is important is that he recognized himself and others like him in bazarov and supplied what was lacking in the book
well , sir , that ’ s where i ’ m coming from ; it ’ s already my fifth night
he hardly survived the blow and his hair turned gray in the course of a few weeks ; he was hoping to go abroad to distract himself a bit but then came the events of
she was terribly offended , and i thought to myself : what 's to be done ?
but then a strange thing happened , something so unexpected in the normal course of events that neither raskolnikov nor porfiry petrovich could have counted on such a denouement
finally it seemed to achilles that something was amiss ; here was a sober man , standing only three paces away from him , looking him right in the eye , saying nothing
dunyasha giggled with him gladly and would give him sidelong , meaningful glances as she ran by like a little quail ; peter , an extremely vain and stupid man whose brow was eternally furrowed under the strain , a man whose entire merit consisted in the fact that he looked respectful , could read haltingly , and frequently brushed his jacket—even he would smirk and brighten up as soon as bazarov paid him any attention ; the peasant boys ran after the doktur
this brief gesture struck raskolnikov with confusion ; it was even strange
especially in the evenings , nastasya was frequently away from the house : either she ran off to the neighbors or to a shop , and the door was always left wide open
anna sergeevna left quietly
he soon found a purely literary career more appealing , however , and the rest , as they say , is history
this little idea of mine is so very playful
he said at last , placing his hands behind his head
svidrigaylov might also be another way out ; but porfiry was another matter
now i am going to return to my dogs
lord rest her soul !
there were no traces of blood left on it , but the wood was still damp
in a few minutes bazarov had covered all the paths in the garden , looked over the cattle sheds and stables , and come upon two local lads whose acquaintance he made at once ; he set off with them to a small marsh , about a mile from the manor house , to search for frogs
one must simply exercise one ’ s willpower and all one ’ s reason over these difficulties , and they will all be overcome in their time , when one becomes familiar with all the details of this affair in all of its precision
thus , turgenev does not fully sympathize with anyone or anything in his novel
the worst part is that you really do feel sad about something !
my , you ’ re a pretty one !
then he opened the notice with trepidation and began reading ; he read for a long time and finally understood
tell me what the peasant mir is all about ?
it ’ s all a mistake
she hadn ’ t come through the wall
aren ’ t you ashamed now , dunya ?
i ’ d go see him a day after that
he threw off his overcoat and looked at his father with such a young boy 's joyous face that his father embraced him once again
you ’ re still mocking me
do you love them , yevgeni ?
for almost two hundred years , we ’ ve been weaned away from any action
i will not expatiate on the impression made by that tale ; i will only say that when i returned to st petersburg , the very day of the notorious fires in the apraksin palace , the word nihilist had already been taken up by thousands of voices , and the first exclamation that burst from the lips of the first acquaintance i encountered on the nevsky was see what your nihilists are doing !
petr petrovich proved to be clever enough to accept this explanation immediately
papa , what are they doing ?
and does not conceal his hero 's blunders from the reader ; many express the desire that bazarov had been presented as an irreproachable man , a knight of thought without fear and reproach , and that thereby the superiority of realism to all other schools of thought would thus have been proved to the reading public
in the first place , i will have to risk getting shot and i will have to leave ; then there 's arkady and gentle old nikolai petrovich
everyone came running , crowding all around
and to put all this alongside avdotya romanovna !
i say this to both of you , he whispered over and over to himself
petty interests all the time , that 's what makes it so awful !
moreover , could he not ingratiate himself somehow with them and deceive them , if they really were all that powerful ?
following him , with a completely disconcerted and ferocious expression , as red as a peony , lanky and clumsy , came the embarrassed razumikhin
the term muslin miss or bread-and-butter miss
note-that his second marriage to the peasant girl fenechka is even more radical
all together they ’ re worth about five or six rubles , but they ’ re valuable to me as mementos
his thoughts , already painful and incoherent , began to get more and more confused , and soon a light , pleasant sleep came over him
at last he noticed that it had grown as light as day
it turned out poorly , that ’ s true , but you ’ re still not a hopeless scoundrel
well , now i can understand why we have become friends ; you are just like me
i understand only one word : useful !
once again an uproar , once more thunder and lightning , tornadoes and hurricanes !
how can i ever thank you ?
she ’ s a person who hungers and demands to accept some sort of torment for someone else , and if she ’ s denied this torment , then she might throw herself out a window
a chill ran up and down his spine
the mainstay of our enterprise consists in our knowing precisely what to translate
nature sometimes follows art : bazarov affected the young as werther , in the previous century , influenced them , like schiller 's the robbers , like byron 's laras and giaours and childe harolds in their day
† an area between nevsky prospect and the smolny institute
a moment later he heard the bolt being thrown
besides , my principal and most pressing request was not fulfilled
he exclaimed with an expression of tender and good-natured triumph on his face
in the first place , here are three shirts , coarse cotton , but with fashionable fronts
logic can anticipate three possibilities , but there are a million of them !
he has a fine face , does not he ?
katya took out mozart 's sonata-fantasia in a minor
i came to see you precisely because i ’ m wicked
she ’ d be very upset if it were to disappear !
no , i didn ’ t imagine it !
she muttered with a sinking heart , as if imploring someone like a frightened child
there was not a moment to spare
yes , sonya , the most amusing thing of all may be that this was exactly how it was
if it ’ s bad , i swear , i ’ ll bring you back here ; if it ’ s good , then you can go to bed
look , a guest has come with evgeny
you know , dunya , i was looking at both of you
the term nihilists has long been employed by both sympathizers and critics to describe a large , diffuse group of russians who made their appearance in the late 's and early 's and who formed the pool out of which radical movements emerged
stay with them tomorrow and
in complete despair , he headed back downstairs to confront them : come what may !
listen , said raskolnikov , here
raskolnikov passed by just then and didn ’ t overhear any more
petr petrovich , who had fought his own way out of poverty , had become accustomed to admiring himself to an extreme degree ; he valued his own intelligence and abilities highly , and even sometimes , while alone , admired his face in a mirror
well , i asked the local doctor if i could ; and , well , i cut myself
i really don ’ t know what to say
that ’ s all there was to it
only tell me where you live
besides those two drunks he met on the staircase , a whole group left right after them , about five men with an accordion and a young girl
listen : sometimes i wake up at night
his wife has it , too
in addition , his eyes were almost always sore
i wanted to ask you , raskolnikov said , turning to her abruptly , how have things been today ?
i am odintsova , she said
nastasya , why don ’ t you say something ?
razumikhin corrected himself suddenly
but there such a terror awaited him—one , of course , that he ’ d never experienced before
maybe they won ’ t fit !
the news about petr petrovich was well received
you promised to visit me ; bring your friend with you
hey , brother , you ’ re frightening me with this nonsense and trying to trick me !
no , no , it ’ s good that you came !
she ’ s aiming right for the head
—that tear should be mended ; take a needle right now and sew it up as i taught you , or else tomorrow
there ’ ll be just a square yard of space—ha !
razumikhin was greatly astonished , but all of a sudden , rage , genuine rage flashed menacingly in his eyes
no more medicine or anything ; i ’ ll look in again tomorrow
she received a letter ?
we ’ ll observe here that if katerina ivanovna bragged about anyone ’ s connections and wealth , it was without any self-interest , without any personal calculation , but was completely innocent , so to speak , out of the fullness of her heart , the sheer pleasure of bestowing praise and conferring more value to the person being praised
i ’ m not excited at all , razumikhin said , wincing
razumikhin exclaimed at last
welcome , replied kukshina and , fixing bazarov with her round eyes between which was a forlorn , turned-up , very little red nose , she added , i know you , and she shook his hand , too
it is symptomatic of turgenev 's aesthetic , both that he will veil those elemental acts , and that his narrative will work to reestablish the violated order
she said , gradually blushing all over
an ironic attitude toward emotion of any sort , toward dreaminess , lyrical transports and effusions , is the essence of the internal cynicism
bazarov is not an abstract theoretician who solves all problems and is completely calmed by that solution
the point may profitably be compared to a similar one in the red and the black where , in stendhal 's happier imagination , julien sorel rises to the top , only to insist perversely at his trial on his peasant origin and to accuse his jury of seeking to punish in me and to discourage forever that class of young men who , born in an inferior station and in a sense burdened with poverty , have the good fortune to secure a sound education , and the audacity to mingle with what the pride of rich people calls society
sonya ’ s face was distorted with horrible fear
that ’ s it , of course
you stay here while i run down for the caretaker
will that actually happen ?
she dared not accept any orders or work without the older woman ’ s permission
she didn ’ t even notice the cruelty of his words ( of course , she also didn ’ t notice the meaning of his reproaches and of his peculiar view of her disgrace , and this was obvious to him )
i ’ ve been lying for a long time
in any case , i regard you as a most honorable man , sir , even possessing the rudiments of magnanimity , although i don ’ t agree with all your convictions , which i consider it my obligation to inform you about in advance , directly , and in complete sincerity , primarily because i don ’ t wish to deceive you
what do you mean by that ?
petr petrovich was laughing wholeheartedly
but raskolnikov couldn ’ t see a thing and had already turned the corner
raskolnikov opened his eyes and lay back again , clasping his hands behind his head
raskolnikov raised himself up
it ’ s sodom , sir , of the most hideous kind
holding his greasy dressing-gown across his stomach with two fingers , and smoking his pipe , he used to listen with enjoyment to bazarov ; and the more malicious his sallies , the more good-naturedly did his delighted father chuckle , showing every one of his black teeth
you must fulfill what justice demands
yes , a wonderful thing , replied raskolnikov , regarding him almost with a smirk
actaeon is destroyed for an involuntary transgression : to see diana naked is , apparently , to enter a realm of taboo in which volition is irrelevant
besides she wouldn ’ t have understood anything
are you coming from enyusha ?
it was very dark and deserted in the entryway ; there was not a soul , as if everything had been removed
what ’ s the meaning of this ?
vasily ivanovich gave him some water and managed to feel his forehead
he passed through it and turned left , onto the street
où va-t-elle la virtu se nicher ? § you know , i ’ ll tell you such tales on purpose , just to hear your shrieks
a book lay on her dresser
razumikhin interrupted with passion
he sat down right in front of porfiry and looked directly at him , without batting an eyelash
he devised so many scenes , so many delightful episodes in his imagination on this seductive and playful theme as he rested after a long day tending to his business affairs !
he ’ s up to something , that ’ s clear , but if we get mixed up in it , it won ’ t be easy to get out
where is the patient ?
he suddenly stepped aside to allow a priest and a deacon who were climbing the stairs to pass
you think , pulkheriya aleksandrovna continued passionately , my tears would have stopped him then , my entreaties , my illness , my death , perhaps , from our anguish , our poverty ?
( it ’ s all the same ! )
( kiseinaya de-vushka ) was given greater currency at the time by pomyalovsky 's story meshchanskoe schaute ( ) and pisarev 's review of it ( soc/i , , - )
they tricked her , that ’ s for sure
those doorbells , in that illness of yours , in your semi-delirium ?
perhaps you think you wo not be missed ?
understanding the relationship between comedy and tragedy in ottsy i deti helps us understand in formal terms the initial and continuing furor created by the novel
that mikolka may even be right to want to suffer
when their glances met , the door slammed shut with such a bang that pulkheriya aleksandrovna almost cried out in fright
she always extended her hand to him timidly ; sometimes she didn ’ t even offer her hand at all , as if afraid that he would push it away
repeated the old man and sank into thought
you can see for yourself what ’ s happened to semyon zakharovich ; he ’ s dying
and there she glimpsed not even an abyss , but emptiness or formless hideousness
arkady felt some timidity in his heart when , at the first sounds of the mazurka , he sat down next to his partner ; preparing to engage her in conversation , he merely passed his hand through his hair , unable to think of anything to say
so , you can go home !
that ’ s very understandable , and i don ’ t condemn you
forget all about me
a poet must be a psychologist , but a secret one , turgenev wrote in a letter to k d
he got what he wanted !
science tells us to love ourselves first of all because everything on earth is based on personal interest
was it your first time ?
oh , for pity ’ s sake
there were lessons to give ; i was offered half a ruble for each
precisely through bazarov was ( and still am ) bespattered with mud and filth
happy are those who have no reason to lock their doors , right ?
no , no ; why trouble yourself again ?
discussion and questions followed ; arkady spoke most of all , especially during supper , which lasted until long after midnight
pavel petrovich himself calls her an empty creature
take me , for example : i advocate a negative point of view—as a result of my sensations
now the other pocket , there , there !
and i really might not have been there !
now he ’ s speaking so politely , but i ’ m afraid !
and now , brother , i think it 's time for us to chat with the steward
stay here , stay here !
time was passing , one minute , then another—no one came
i doubt that , sir
what ’ s happening to me ?
raskolnikov replied insistently and irritably , suddenly raising himself on the sofa , his eyes flashing ; then he fell back onto the pillow again and turned his face to the wall
the two women asked together
excuse me , sir , replied luzhin , trembling with rage
i didn ’ t believe in that thunderbolt even for a moment , as you could see !
the laws of art will again exert their power
be sure not to scare my brother , pavel petrovich said to him
he dreamt of his childhood , while they were still living in their little town
there 's an english washstand in my room and the door does not lock
is evgeny vasilevich still alive ?
polechka , my name is rodion
the prince knew me when i was young and unmarried , and he remembers semyon zakharovich very well , to whom he showed his favor many times
although the word had been used previously in russian thought , it was in the 's that it assumed its familiar meaning
we consider this immodesty , peering so deeply into the soul of another , to be very significant
ah , her poor deceased father !
yes , i was ; now come into my rooms ; there ’ s nowhere to sit here
when you were shown out , then i was also shown out , and they began to question nikolai
there was a thick fog outside , and it was impossible to see through it
she looked at him , not understanding a thing
sonya also has to buy makeup , he went on , grinning sarcastically as he walked along the street
i consider it my obligation to inform you that i do not share that opinion
pavel petrovich knitted his brows sternly , while nikolai petrovich appeared embarrassed
vasily ivanovich was astounded
all children behave well with me , replied bazarov
no sign , replied the servant a second time
have they sent for me , or what ?
i ’ d twist his nose if he so much as dreamt of it !
all of this had been kept hidden under the sofa in his room until the right moment
arkady began telling her about his friend
but we have philosophized enough
anna sergeevna gave him a drink without removing her glove , drawing her breath apprehensively
but she didn ’ t take her eyes off raskolnikov , feeling that he was her best defense
porfiry petrovich addressed raskolnikov directly :
all of a sudden he recalled marmeladov ’ s question from the day before
n n strakhov fathers and sons
there was a scandal right here , in the third room
i was hardly constrained by that document
so , he came to see you last night ?
his dark blond hair , long and thick , did not conceal the prominent bulges in his capacious skull
can it possibly be that you still haven ’ t received any news ?
while arkady and bazarov argue , bazarov 's parents overwhelm them ( and us ) with the ordinary kindnesses they take to extraordinary degrees
he kept pushing this thought away , foreseeing to what degree of rage and fury could it drive him , and feeling that he might lose his mind from that rage
the passage is secular rather than religious : life is without end not eternal ; it is life on earth , not in the hereafter
raskolnikov started shouting again
but even in him , despite the apparent distortion there are living and even energetic vibrations of the heartstrings
did you go far from here ?
running away is vile and difficult ; most of all you need life , a defined position , and suitable air ; well , what sort of air would you have ?
or else , why bother ?
i ca not pass judgment on him
he turned to razumikhin
for a dialectical reading of turgenev 's finest novel , however
the chain was made of steel
what a torment to bear !
you must know everything already
do you like to fight ?
wondered raskolnikov and began following him
no , he says , not in the last two days
colossal illnesses go with a great people
razumikhin , it goes without saying , was preposterous with his sudden passion , fueled by drink , for avdotya romanovna ; but , seeing her , especially now , as she was pacing the room , her arms folded , sad and pensive , perhaps many people would excuse him , without any mention of his extraordinary condition
what ’ s the matter , polechka ?
i agree that a decent man is obliged to be bored , but still
this same reproach is often directed at falls upon young men , even when they no longer deserve it ; and if i had more self-confidence [ help me , please help me !
zosimov observed him carefully
during the second week of lent , it was his turn , with those in his barracks , to fast before taking communion
petr petrovich noticed this smile and immediately held it against his young friend
and he wouldn ’ t even have understood one bit : what was there to be repulsed by ?
but why , why is he prompting me this way ?
suddenly arkady comes up to me and silently , with an expression of such tender compassion , very gently , as if i were a little child , takes my book away and places another one in front of me , a german one he smiles and then leaves , carrying away my pushkin
why did that fool razumikhin abuse the socialists a while ago ?
well , it ’ s just not , that ’ s all there is to it !
well then , good-bye ; i ’ ll drop in on you , very soon
arina vlasevna set about preparing the tea from lime flowers , while vasily ivanovich went into the next room and tore his hair in silence
turgenev has studied bazarov 's character , he has pondered its elements and the conditions of its development , and he has come to see that for him there can be neither occupation nor happiness
today i was sitting and reading pushkin as i recall , it happened to be the gypsies
however , this quest is only a transitional moment , an incomplete process
all the furniture and everything else
now i see what a practical fellow you are
or have you already decided to be discreet about it ?
it ’ s the various practical cases i still find troubling !
yes , so dark-skinned , as if she ’ s a disguised soldier , but you know , she ’ s not really a freak
you say , it ’ s me or him
no , that would be shameful
by the way , sonya , when i was lying there in the darkness and imagining all these things , was that the devil who was misleading me ?
the handkerchief was covered in blood
well , what ’ s there to be proud of in being a decent fellow ?
the attack from the left was a good deal more virulent
i have a good memory for faces
she seemed pale by the light of the single lamp , shaded in gauze of cutout paper
the woman , noticing a stranger , paused distractedly in front of him ; having returned to her senses momentarily , she seemed to be wondering why he ’ d come in
they had arrived at the entrance to bakaleev ’ s house
( everything seems stupid in failure ! )
their feel-yourself orientation was at odds with the imperatives of underground activity
arkadi and his father , riding
how do i get there ?
a tormenting , dark idea arose in him—the idea that he was behaving like a madman and that at this moment he was no longer able to reason or defend himself , and that perhaps it was totally unnecessary to do what he was doing now
he hastened to reassure her and seated her at the table opposite himself
they were not expecting you today , sir ; no beef 's been delivered , said timofeich , who would just dragged in bazarov 's case
once more she glared at arkady , but he raised his voice and , exchanging glances with katya , who was sitting next to him , continued reading
an arrogant young man , by your words you ’ re admitting the possibility of breaking the promise you made to me
we have no right to complain to the author that he did not choose a broader task and limited himself to the narrower one
i thought i might find you here , he said , turning suddenly to raskolnikov
poor , meek creatures with meek eyes
look , you monster , it ’ s empty ; there was a handkerchief and now the pocket ’ s empty , you see !
scarcely greeting the guests , she lowered herself into a large velvet-covered armchair , in which no one else had any right to sit
all the more reason , sir
amaliya ivanovna , i humbly request that you , in your capacity as landlady of this apartment , pay special attention to the conversation i ’ m about to have with sofiya ivanovna
it is precisely bazarov 's magnetic influence that for a while prevents arkady from coming to terms with his true , non-nihilistic self , after which recognition he proposes to katia
raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to stop by tomorrow without fail
despite all his views , bazarov eagerly seeks love for people
at least there i can lock my door
i also found out many interesting details yesterday from mr razumikhin , dmitry prokofich
scarcely ten days had passed since his return to marino when , on the pretext of studying how the sunday schools were functioning , he galloped off to town and from there to nikolskoe
it ’ s impossible to keep silent when you feel—you feel by instinct—that you could help in this case , if only
have you nothing else to say to me ?
i ’ ll add that he expressed himself a little more gently and affectionately than i described , but i ’ ve forgotten his exact words , and recall only the idea ; besides , he said it without any premeditation
or else i won ’ t have anything to do with you !
and those aren ’ t his clothes !
don ’ t be embarrassed , razumikhin rattled on
do you understand , sir ?
she became his wife ; he was happy as few people on earth ever are but ,
to k k sluchevsky
however , there ’ s no need !
arkady , not without embarrassment , explained to him in a few words who fenechka was
even outside it ’ s like being in a room without ventilation
and you , rodya , should go out , take a little walk , have a rest , lie down , and then come to see us soon
the latter buried his face in his cambric handkerchief
well , hell , that ’ s not the point , but this is : you ’ ll spend tonight in the landlady ’ s apartment ( i managed to persuade her !
till our next most pleasant meeting , sir
and he whips her and whips her again ; in his frenzy , he no longer knows what he ’ s doing
furthermore , turgenev 's general attitudes toward the phenomena of life which make up his novel are so calm and disinterested , so devoid of slavish worship of one or another theory , that bazarov himself would not have found anything timid or false in these attitudes
at the conclusion of comedy the blocking characters are either incorporated into or expelled from the given society , and as a result the hero and heroine are free to wed thus , comedies often conclude with a wedding and the birth of babies , often as not in a rural setting
i told her you were a fine , honest , hardworking man
afterward this same marfa petrovna asked dunya ’ s forgiveness , and now she ’ s suddenly died
why couldn ’ t that scoundrel petr petrovich have found you better rooms ?
asked bazarov , sitting down next to her
there was a time when i thought
in short , from the hannibal 's oath against serfdom at the beginning of his life to the work about revolutionaries planned at the end of his life , turgenev was concerned with the forces which would change the life of russia
i said this to arkady the day after he arrived here and i say it again
you ’ re lying and teasing me , so i ’ ll give myself away
you yourself said you wanted me to go to prison , but now you ’ re frightened ?
you should drink some water , my dear boy , this is an attack , sir !
will you come back here afterward ?
i ’ m ready , ma ’ am , and will answer for it
even in the country you did me more harm than i did you , while here
even if one were to speak of realism as the single , fundamental method of the classical novel , one might do that basing one 's construction of the term on other considerations ; eg , on the position and viewpoint of the reader
sonya asked weakly , glancing at him full of suffering , but at the same time not at all surprised by his suggestion
his face and entire figure were at that moment really ridiculous and justified raskolnikov ’ s laughter
she 's a retrograde woman and nothing more !
by disclosing arkady 's true sentiments bazarov destroys the masks of civility—he effects a drawing room attack on that civilization he so ardently denounced in polemic with pavel
why should there be any compensation ?
his sense of aesthetics would interfere : would a napoleon stoop to crawl under an old woman ’ s ’ bed ?
razumikhin and raskolnikov were facing pulkheriya aleksandrovna—razumikhin was closer to luzhin , raskolnikov next to his sister
he ate a little , without much appetite , three or four spoonfuls , as if automatically
in the experience of the world as we know it through his writings he emphasized both the ephemeral ecstasy that can suddenly transform life completely and the poignancy of lives sacrificed in the name of a revolutionary ideal
fair hair in little ringlets like lamb ’ s wool , full , rosy lips , little feet—charming !
i just woke up and wanted to come , but my clothes delayed me ; yesterday i forgot to tell her
cried luzhin , unable to believe up until the last moment in such an outcome and , therefore , having lost the thread completely
he left moscow to go abroad to improve his health and took up residence in dresden , where he associates mostly with the english and with visiting russians
this is how it happened
it ’ s so stuffy in here
is he expecting something ?
did you sleep well ?
but no one could suspect him , in that instance , of pleasure in the feeling of his
well , now i see i have overestimated your powers of observation
such is bazarov 's image for us , too
that was everything in the room
† a hard , dry biscuit
is he going to stay here with us ?
perhaps she had even seriously considered many times in her despair how to end it all , so seriously that his suggestion almost didn ’ t surprise her
but something strange happened to him
muttered dunechka through her deathly pale lips ; she was gasping for breath
these ideas and attitudes can gain point only if bazarov brings them to political coherence , and the book charts bazarov 's journey , as an uprooted plebeian , in search of a means of expression , a task , an obligation
why are you sleeping ?
economic truth adds that the more private businesses we have in society and , so to speak , the more cloaks remain intact , then the firmer its foundations and the more will be accomplished for the common good
at least , that was what he was hoping
yes , that ’ s it precisely , businesslike
it seems you weren ’ t expecting this ?
why are you examining my room ?
in a word , a certain fire flared up in them more brightly and more carelessly , and that fire frightened her , and she found it hateful in the end
what ’ s the matter with me ?
he rushed to the door and threw the bolt
if she ’ s gone out of the house , she ’ ll come to see you herself , he added peevishly
evgeny vasilich , i am here
is it twelve yet ?
but ten thousand—is a fine thing on occasion
but he couldn ’ t even conceive of carrying out his intention : either there were rafts moored at the bottom of the stairs where women were washing their linens , or else boats were tied up and the stairs were teeming with people ; in addition , from there along both embankments one could be observed , noticed : it would look very suspicious if a man intentionally went down the stairs , paused , and threw something into the water
who was he compared to such a young woman : just a drunken lout and yesterday ’ s braggart ?
none of this would have occurred !
katya gave him a silent , serious look ; the princess even made the sign of the cross under her shawl , so he could not see it ; on the other hand , sitnikov was completely disconcerted
in the first place , everything would be changed , even his own situation : he would have to reveal his secret to dunechka immediately
i trust there wo not be any , evgeny vasilich i am very sorry your stay in my house had such an ending
in her eyes he was both an excellent doctor and a simple man
your grandfather was a well-respected man , a true soldier
at which one of them , in a transport of defiance , shouts : down with all authorities !
they ’ re not all as clever as you are
it 's true that one was a foreign decoration , and not all that distinguished
why even talk to him ?
some other time we will talk about this subject in greater detail with you , my dear evgeny vasilich ; we will learn your opinions and express our own
you can be sure , amaliya lyudvigovna
in other words , he had grown weak , instantly and radically !
he ’ s fast asleep , soundly and peacefully ; god willing , he ’ ll sleep for ten hours or so
however , i confess that you stated it almost correctly , even , if you like , completely correctly
suddenly porfiry seemed to wink at him with his left eye again and chuckle inaudibly , just as he had before
it does not matter to me whether i am young or old
vasily ivanovich listened with great attention , blew his nose , twisted his handkerchief in both hands , coughed , ruffled his hair—and , at long last , could not stand it : he leaned over to arkady and kissed him on the shoulder
i ca not fight with them myself , my principles wo not allow me to summon the local police , and one ca not accomplish anything without the fear of punishment !
pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s illness was a strange nervous ailment and was accompanied by something like insanity , if not completely , then at least partially
as for that wretched general
raskolnikov , now perplexed , suddenly flew into a complete fury ; but , strange to say , once again he obeyed the order to speak more quietly , even though he was suffering a strong paroxysm of rage
razumikhin thought for a moment
you have such an awful room , rodya
he felt he was not exciting enough to interest odintsova ; he became timid and confused when left alone with her
bazarov 's treatment of his parents will predispose some readers against the character , and others against the author
at that time nikolai petrovich had just settled into his new manor house and , not wishing to keep serfs on as house staff , he was looking for hired laborers ; the mistress , for her part , complained about the small number of travelers who came to town and about hard times ; he suggested she come to work for him as a housekeeper ; she agreed
and i ’ d hardly be able to do so
he stood in the middle of the room , deep in thought
it was for you that i
did they find him ?
it suddenly seemed to him that her long black eyelashes were fluttering and winking , as if they were about to open , and from under them looked a sly , sharp , somehow unchildlike eye , as if the little girl were not asleep , and only pretending
she realized that true personal autonomy required psychological independence , though not separation , from men
but apparently it can not be helped
the second level at which turgenev attempts a dialectical reconciliation lies within the plot , where comedy and tragedy coexist and interact to produce a monistic view of life
i ’ m a man who ’ s finished with life , nothing more
bazarov spent the whole day in his own room , feeling bitter and angry , dropping in to see the patient for very brief visits ; he happened to meet fenechka a few times , but she scurried away from him in terror )
nor drunk , sirs , and they will not believe two acknowledged atheists , troublemakers , and freethinkers who are accusing me out of personal revenge , which , in their own stupidity , they even admit
the servant , out of a sense of propriety , or perhaps because he did not want to remain under his master 's eye , had gone to the gate and lit his pipe
bazarov does not put on airs before other people , he does not consider himself a man of genius misunderstood by his contemporaries ; he is merely obliged to regard his acquaintances from above because these acquaintances only come up to his knees ; what else can he do ?
it 's already more than four hours since it happened
the most natural thing would be not to play him at all
indeed , after passing through the gateway and emerging into the courtyard , the tradesman suddenly turned around and seemed to beckon to him again
little by little he came to the conviction that if the summer garden could be extended to include the entire field of mars and even connect it with the gardens at the mikhailovsky palace , that it would be a splendid and most useful thing for the city
in her fury , katerina ivanovna grabbed luzhin and dragged him over to sonya
bazarov has called on his guardian angel ; whether he realizes it or not he is aware for the first time of his vulnerability to death ; he is subconsciously asking pushkin 's question : is the hour already near ?
you are a dangerous gentleman ; you are such a critic
moreover , i take the liberty of adding the earnest and , dare i say , insistent request that rodion romanovich not be present at our meeting , inasmuch as he insulted me unspeakably and impolitely during my visit to his sickbed yesterday
well , do you understand now ?
of course he had returned home dozens of times without recalling the route he took
in each cart there were one or two peasants wearing unbuttoned sheepskin coats
you were counting on it
don ’ t you want to see the little surprise i have ?
was he a positive or a negative figure ?
dunya asked , approaching him
it is understandable how the passionate , candid , simpleminded , honest , strong as a folkloric hero , and inebriated razumikhin , never having seen anyone like that , would lose his head at first glance
yes , yes , he would say to some peasant woman in a man 's coat and horn-shaped headdress , as he handed her a bottle of goulard 's extract or a jar of white ointment , my dear , you should thank god every minute of the day that my son 's visiting us : now you are being treated with the most scientific , most up-to-date methods , do you understand that ?
who ’ ll pay any attention to that ?
that means you ’ d be willing to introduce her into the company of your mother and sister ?
what are you saying ?
he would already begun to submit to her ; katya felt this and was not at all surprised
bazarov 's mother , arina vlasevna , is yet another representative of cyclical time , but one who seems to have taken it to the extreme , almost to the point of parody
thoughts were spinning like a whirlwind in raskolnikov ’ s head
it does happen , especially when you wear out a man ’ s last drop of patience , but , in any case , it ’ s rare
he himself never told me a thing about that episode , razumikhin replied cautiously , but i heard something about it from mrs zarnitsyna herself , who ’ s also not the most communicative person
stamping his feet because i disturbed him
nevertheless , his speech produced an extraordinary effect
she ’ d sell herself for a dear , beloved person !
after making your acquaintance , i felt an attachment to you
now i ’ ve clarified it all to myself , continued raskolnikov , turning directly to lebezyatnikov
he bowed deeply and watched her go ( her figure seemed so graceful to him , draped in the grayish sheen of black silk !
listen : when i went to the old woman then , it was only a test
it seemed to me that i did
yes , yes , he continued , it 's not for nothing you are related to anna sergeevna ; you are just as independent as she is , but you are more discreet
talk about whatever nonsense you want , but sit next to her and talk
he added , after a little while

go on ahead , she said , with apparent serenity , though her face was very pale
he 's not opposed to playing cards , and even this is strictly entre nous smokes a pipe
the hell with it !
next year he hopes to qualify as a doctor
you ’ ve made me very happy , rodya , by dropping in , but she missed you by taking a walk ; when she returns , i ’ ll tell her : your brother was here while you were out
it will take me a while to climb the stairs , he thought
however , i didn ’ t really feel it coming since you seemed to arrive out of nowhere
incidentally , anna sergeevna : you should know that all this is not in my line
dunechka wasn ’ t at home
he looked for the caretaker and received vague directions for where to find the tailor kapernaumov
the things a person imagines !
once again the poem sheds light on fathers and sons
i communicated to him the thoughts that occupied me and with speechless amazement heard the following remark : but have not you already presented a similar type in rudin ?
such exclamations do not surprise me ; but neither will they make me renounce one iota of what said
however , when no one turned him away and anna sergeevna even introduced him to her aunt and sister , he quickly recovered and began chatting merrily
of course , that ’ s true , replied raskolnikov
by hearsay , bazarov replied angrily
i couldn ’ t just fill my letter with nonsense about this and that , when i felt such sorrow in my soul
who 's weeping over there ?
that ’ s a fact , sir
you see what an ugly spectacle i am : a worm half-crushed , but still writhing
he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov
nikolai petrovich was surprised : fenechka , bashful and modest , never displayed any affection in the presence of a third party
at that hour , on clear days , the sun always passed over his right wall with a long stripe of light and lit up the corner next to the door
she uttered , with feeling , looking intently at him
your mama sent it to you ; or did you forget that , too ?
he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from its loop but didn ’ t remove it yet , merely keeping hold of it with his right hand under his coat
the meaning of a literary idea ( )
he thought , glancing around , this place is not much to look at
and i stand before it
i might not have become a napoleon , but i might have become a major , sir , hee-hee-hee !
that ’ s none of your business , sir !
what a fine little lad you have here , he said and looked at his watch
his room was so small that he could undo the hook without even getting out of bed
the fact that it was
how quiet it was , even frightening
ask any of your peasants which of us—you or me—he recognizes as his fellow countryman
it ’ s way past six !
at the very moment she accepted your proposal , that you were extremely pleased that
it ’ s almost as if there were two contradictory characters alternating within him
meanwhile , pulkheriya aleksandrovna , without her daughter ’ s support , was apparently in a state of indecision
it was so enjoyable and required so little effort !
and , of course , the fellow got very angry
raskolnikov was about to speak again but wasn ’ t allowed to do so : everyone was shouting and crowding around luzhin with curses and threats
that saying is strikingly true not only of art but of all life
people cried out from the crowd
in chapter he illustrates a nonmedical argument to odintsova by an analogy with the lungs of a consumptive
she aspires in every way to participate in the masculine modality : her disheveled appearance , her slovenly study , her intellectual pretensions , her aggressive conversation , etc
then it was this , that , who , how , how old—twenty-two ’ —so on and so forth
we would better speak russian , said the old man
and now it seems one isn ’ t supposed to eavesdrop behind the door
the crisis has come the crisis has gone
with the english he behaves simply , almost modestly , but not without dignity ; they find him a bit of a bore , but respect him for being a perfect gentleman ,
she understood only that he was terribly , infinitely unhappy
besides that , they say the young woman was not very attractive , that is , they say she was even rather plain
well , you have to agree that you can ’ t just say , karl from ze pharmazist ’ s shop from ze fear his heart vas vounded , and that he ( the snotnose !
the whole matter depended on your social position and its associated habits
do you know what really irritates me ?
began arkady in a sad tone of voice
such bells could be found in almost all similar small buildings
on the other hand , in their brief introductions to their collections they respond to turgenev the man and writer so indifferently and tritely as to make the reader wonder what drew them to their enterprise in the first place
he was hardly able to stand and merely repeated , katya , katya while she wept innocently , laughing softly at her own tears
do you have any water ?
he 's a person of consequence now and writes that , as a relative , he wants to see us and has invited us and arkady to town
cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna , agitated in the extreme
his eyes were gleaming , and he took two more steps forward
raskolnikov maintained a gloomy silence and lowered his head ; he thought for a long time and smiled again at last , but his smile was meek and gloomy
fenechka in particular felt so comfortable with him that one night she even summoned him : mitya was having convulsions
she stood up and said , if he went out , then he must be well and he ’ s forgotten his mother ; that means it ’ s improper and shameful for his mother to stand on his doorstep and beg for affection , as if for alms
i thought you knew everything
they shouted at him
he asked a moment later
he wants to give thanks at a special church service , ha , ha , ha
in my opinion , that ’ s all nonsense : it wasn ’ t necessary to write more gently ; on the contrary , on the contrary , it ’ s necessary to protest
in my personal view , if you like , one can even say that something has been achieved : new , useful ideas have been widely circulated , several new , useful works have been disseminated in place of the previous fantastic and romantic ones
but he knows how to fill a pipe
but now , finally , he , too , seemed to have quieted down ; his voice could no longer be heard
of course , he values himself highly , perhaps too highly , but i hope that he ’ ll also come to value me
only by being so strict was it possible to restrain him somewhat
how could you have gone out unless you were delirious ?
with levin she is at ease , at home ; with vronsky there is the prospect of brilliance and adventure
according to our conditions , each of us still has one shot left
or else he , too , simply didn ’ t know anything and hadn ’ t seen anything with his own eyes ( and how could he have seen anything ?
such an approach is taken by the american hispanist stephen oilman when he writes : the novel may be defined as the kind of literature which presents a fictional world not necessarily resembling our own , but in a fashion resembling the way we experience our own—thus its natural realism less of mirrored content than of unfolding process
and i fell for it !
well then , now did you hear ?
to hell with me !
kukshina 's a marvelous person
you should know that !
just look more carefully and you ’ ll see !
the feeling of infinite revulsion that had begun to oppress and torment his heart as he ’ d been coming to see the old woman had now reached such proportions and was so palpable that he didn ’ t know where to hide from his anguish
he lay on his back and didn ’ t stir
only then did sonya notice him
are not you doing a lot of talking , too , just like all the rest ?
i didn ’ t bow down to you ; i bowed down to all human suffering , he uttered madly and went over to the window
—i do not completely understand that designation—answered arkady
ralph matlaw , in his preface to the valuable norton critical edition , explains that he has chosen the widely used english title fathers and sons rather than the literal fathers and children because 'sons ' in english better implies the notions of spiritual and intellectual generations conveyed by the russian deti
and i promised her so much then—the hell with it !
nikolai petrovich listened more intently arkady made no reply
however , it was not shame that seized him but a completely different feeling , more resembling fear
odintsova had heard all about this
at least one of his liberal friends who had read the manuscript of fathers and children told him to burn it , since it would compromise him for ever with the progressives
evgeny , for heaven 's sake
but what is to be done ?
except for champagne , nothing at all , and only one glass of champagne for the whole evening , and even then my head aches
bazarov enters odin-tseva 's chambers as a figure possessed , whose passion has driven him to the solace of violent midnight walks ( he would set out for the woods and walk through them with great strides , breaking branches in his way and cursing under his breath both her and himself—viii , [ p
incidentally , i told them not to unhitch my horses
she ’ ll consider it her duty to make her husband happy , and he , in turn , will concern himself with his wife ’ s happiness , which , for the time being , we have no major reason to doubt , even though , i must admit , this whole affair was concluded rather quickly
bazarov asked arkady coolly , as soon as the door closed behind the two brothers
the whole province will be singing his praises—he can do without us
we will rest at home , papa ; have the horses harnessed
he tried to catch it , but the mouse didn ’ t jump off the bed ; it darted back and forth in zigzags , slipped out of his fingers , ran across his hand , and suddenly plunged underneath the pillow ; he threw the pillow down , but felt at once that something jumped onto his chest and was running across his body , down his back , under his shirt
the question has been debated recently : does a member of the commune have the right to enter another member ’ s room , a man ’ s or a woman ’ s , at any time
it is impossible to erase it , it must be accepted
i have come ; if you need anything , ask me ; if not , then let me go
there 's no reason for her to be ashamed
an ironic reference to the ideas of jean-jacques rousseau
open up , will you ?
why in the world did i come to torment you with this ?
he remembered seeing her for the first time
as a result , the girl went away in complete ecstasy
well , it ’ s all nonsense , but when she realized that you were no longer a student , that you ’ d lost all your pupils and shed your decent apparel and , with the death of her daughter , that there was no longer any reason to keep supporting you as a member of the family , well , she suddenly got scared
it was dark in the room ; he lay on the bed , wrapped up in the blanket as before , and the wind howled outside the window
on one occasion a peasant from the neighboring village brought his brother , who was sick with typhus , to see vasily ivanovich
all that is not the least bit interesting , he said aloud , especially for you ; you and i are somber people
meanwhile , the sun was already setting
inside the portico it was cool , even at midday
today i asked , where does mr raskolnikov live ?
a new position in the russian civil service created by the legal reforms of , to carry out investigations into allegations of criminality
she was not surprised and did not ask any more questions at this time
arkady 's face retained its expression of the previous day ; katya had a worried look
scent ; that he played whist in a masterly fashion and always lost ; and finally , they respected him for his incorruptible honesty
it 's something like prince kuchumov or current russian dramatic literature in general where there is talk for talk 's sake and where a kind of repellent , tepid , and fetid psychology reigns
but turgenev just says calmly and simply : this is the sort of young people there are nowadays !
the tavern keeper said loudly
the extraordinary ferocity with which razumikhin reacted to this genuine laughter lent this scene the appearance of the most sincere merriment and , most importantly , naturalness
his best friends realized this , and everyone liked him
he got up and put on his jacket and coat , which were still wet
you ca not hide a pig in a poke ; i will take it upon myself to prepare peter in an appropriate manner and bring him along to the site of our bloody battle
the second category consists of people who break the law , destroyers or , judging by their abilities , those predisposed to be so
therefore , even the subscription , in my personal opinion , must be carried out so that the unfortunate widow , so to speak , doesn ’ t know about the money , but that you , for example , are the only one who knows
it 's a doctor from anna sergeevna odintsova , he said , bending over to his son 's ear
that 's from the latin nihil , nothing , as far as i can tell ; therefore , the word signifies a person who acknowledges nothing ?
she would eat only black bread and drink only water rather than sell her soul or give up her moral freedom in exchange for comfort ; she wouldn ’ t trade it for all of schleswig-holstein , ¶ let alone for mr luzhin
the last page of the novel shows bazarov 's elderly parents kneeling and weeping at their son 's grave ; this poignant scene occasions turge-nev 's rhetorical eloquence in a famous passage , one just as intriguing as bazarov 's haystack rumination on time and space quoted at the beginning of this paper , and one closely linked to it in its theme : however passionate , sinful , rebellious the heart buried in the grave , the flowers growing on it look out at us serenely with their innocent eyes ; they tell us not only of that eternal peace , that great peace of indifferent nature ; they tell us also of eternal reconciliation and life everlasting
he thought to himself , biting his nails in anger
there was nothing particularly caustic or burning about it ; but from it there arose something constant , eternal ; he had a premonition of endless years of this cold , deadening sadness , a premonition of some eternity in one arshin of space
he couldn ’ t feel whether he was standing on his own two legs
all this time i thought you were fed up with us , but now i see from everything that a great misfortune is in store for you , which is why you ’ re so upset
without suspecting any danger , however , firmly confident of himself , bazarov goes to visit odintsov , at nikolskoe
but the mirage was dispelled
the old man leaned his small head to one side
no , i can ’ t go through it , i can ’ t !
he spent exactly ten minutes there and managed to convince them completely and appease pulkheriya aleksandrovna
later , he said weakly
you ’ re staying at the kapernaumovs ’ !
very energetic people often exaggerate the prevailing tendency ; on these grounds , bazarov 's overly indiscriminate repudiations and the very one-sidedness of his development are tied directly to the prevailing striving for tangible benefits
understand this : i need dolts like him
why are you suddenly scared ?
and do not tell me they are worthless
the civil servant regarded the others in the tavern , even the owner , as somehow ordinary ; he was even bored by them ; at the same time , he felt a trace of haughty scorn , as if they were people of a lower order or a lower cultural level , to whom there was nothing to say
is he going to stay here long ?
there was something crafty contained in this question
such a hideous dream !
you really should decide on your own , lizaveta ivanovna , the tradesman was saying loudly
he did not even think of marriage , of course
however , please stay here during my conversation with her
she would drawn a pair of crossed lines over the sphinx and asked that he be informed that the cross was the solution to her enigma
can you vouch for the fact that avdotya romanovna regards me with loathing ?
don ’ t look , don ’ t look at me like that !
but there was no other vacant room ; all the others were occupied
don ’ t madmen make sense ?
you yourself described him as a monomaniac when you called me in on the case
not really , pour vous plaire
drenched to the skin , svidrigaylov made his way back home , where he locked the door , opened his bureau , took out all of his cash , and tore up several papers
go fetch sonya , quickly
no , it 's all right , it 's fine , replied pavel petrovich
and this same dunechka is planning to marry that seems !
i could tell you something
but you do not know , arkady replied , what a social lion he was in his own day
do you know that fellow
he made no reply
a moment later , he was out on the street
petr petrovich was even nervous , rubbing his hands , deep in thought
i ’ ll go with you to prison !
he looked at it fleetingly and said , wait , and continued to deal with the lady in mourning
dear sir , dear sir !
in a word , it all began with a fit of uncontrollable voluptuousness
should i go in ?
( my past and thoughts , volume iv ) : i would like to save the younger generation from historical ingratitude and even from historical errors
pavel petrovich announced solemnly
but you handed over all twenty-five !
take this for yourself , strictly for yourself , and let this remain between the two of us , so that no one else knows , no matter what you hear later
turgenev as author quite wickedly conflates his own imagery in his authorial voice with bazarov 's imagery : turgenev as author says bazarov 's eyes gleamed with their last light , but has bazarov say in his own voice , goodbye breathe on the dying lamp and let it go out enough now , darkness
the point here is not that arkady is not being wholly honest or sincere—which of course he is not
i think one ought to hint at her new psychological state with some sort of striking turn , otherwise it will turn out something like a japanese snuffbox , which contains miniature trees with fruit , ponds , and boats ; and that 's the more annoying since the general tone of the tale is sharp , in relief , and its progress completely solid
she said , raising the edge of her kerchief a little so she could look at him , and in so doing bared her arm to the elbow
i hate that so-called doctor ; in my opinion , he 's simply a charlatan ; i doubt he knows that much about physics , even with all his frogs
lads : instead of singing a folk song , they were bawling out some romance : 'the true time has come , my heart is full of love
it ’ s hard to spend your whole life as a governess earning only two hundred rubles and traipsing around the provinces ; but still i know my sister would sooner go work with negroes on a plantation or with latvian peasants for a baltic german # than defile her spirit and her moral feelings by a relationship with a man she doesn ’ t respect and with whom she has nothing in common—forever , merely for personal gain !
all of a sudden she pulled a revolver from her pocket , cocked it , and rested her hand with the gun on the little table
but now we are hungry as wolves
well , ma ’ am , how about it ?
arkady was amazed and did not understand katya immediately
the father-son and son-father relationships are , on the other hand , respectful , affectionate , and deeply loving , despite the faint note of menace at the very outset , on the ride home after arkadi 's father has met him and bazarov at the station
dunechka made no reply ; her decision had been made some time ago , and she was merely waiting for evening to arrive
we led a life of wandering , trudging around towns for the most part
that ’ s why one mustn ’ t get on his nerves
you see , rodya , i admit , you ’ re clever , but you ’ re still a fool !
it was even impossible to think of her as pretty ; on the other hand , her blue eyes were so clear and , when they came to life , the expression of her face so kind and sincere , that one felt involuntarily attracted to her
and it fell through !
yes , sir ; yes , sir ; i have seen quite a bit in my time , i have
crowds of people were walking along the streets ; craftsmen and workers were returning home , others were out for a stroll ; the air smelled of lime , dust , and stagnant water
every time the young man passed , he felt a painful and fearful sensation , one that he was ashamed of and that made him wince
the whole type in toto is a condemnation of the savage society wherein he could be born , and if that type becomes known to foreigners , it will be used by them as proof of that coarse , nomadic , brutal condition in which our state finds itself , though it has a gloss of books from the leipzig fair
sufferings will accompany the birth of the new russia , and they are inevitable
why do you thrust yourself upon us , for what reasons ?
she pounced on him at once and sat him down at the table on her left side ( amaliya ivanovna was sitting on her right ) ; in spite of her constant fussing and concern that the food would be served properly and that there be enough for everyone , and in spite of the tormenting cough that plagued her continually and choked her and , it seems , had worsened particularly in the last two days , she constantly turned to raskolnikov and in a half whisper hastened to pour out to him all her pent-up feelings and all her righteous indignation over the unsuccessful funeral feast ; this indignation alternated with fits of the most cheerful and most unrestrained laughter at the assembled guests , primarily directed at her landlady
raskolnikov stirred and was about to say something
and you can be sure that i won ’ t interfere with you
first i said that i wouldn ’ t convey anything to you
i dropped in on you two days ago , in the evening ; you didn ’ t know that ?
but , if you please , i ’ ll return to the previous subject
the aristocracy gave england its freedom and supports it
it had descended upon him like a fit : it started burning in his soul like a spark and suddenly enveloped him completely , like fire
but i could not have foreseen it
i paid the mailman three kopecks
neskol'ko slov po povodu ottsov i detei , turgenev writes that he has an interesting collection of documents and letters from readers who accuse him of doing totally contradictory things in his novel
from the crowd , silently and timidly , a young woman forced her way in ; her sudden appearance in this room was strange , amid the poverty , ragged clothes , death , and desperation
they ’ ve gone to bed next door , he thought , no longer seeing light through the crack
and could you shoot yourself ?
that ’ s not exactly what i said , he began simply and modestly
yes , a woman , an unexpected chance
she would died in paris , in a condition bordering on insanity
on the wall between two windows , above a small washstand , hung some rather poor photographs of nikolai petrovich in various poses taken by an itinerant artist ; there was also a photograph of fenechka that was a complete failure : a face without eyes and a forced smile staring out of a dark frame—it was impossible to make out anything else—and above fenechka , general ermolov in a circassian cloak was frowning menacingly toward distant caucasian mountains , peering out from under a little silk pincushion that had fallen over his forehead
there 's no need to rely on others ; one must do one 's own work
i think i wrote you that people whom i trust advised me to burn my work
if it had been possible for him to go somewhere at that moment and remain completely alone , even for the rest of his life , he would have considered himself fortunate
several times he was about to say something—but could not
meanwhile , raskolnikov had crowded in closer and had bent over the victim
the devil knows why we ’ re talking about this !
haven ’ t you seen children here , on street corners , whose mothers send them out to beg for charity ?
damn it all , he ’ s pretending !
did i ever think that i ’ d be so afraid of a meeting with my own son , with my dear , dear rodya , as i am now ?
in this way it took her several days to visit everyone in town , so that some people felt offended that she was partial to others
your father 's a good man , bazarov said , but he 's antiquated ; his song 's been sung
you mean to say you ’ re cruel ?
first , when arkadi , smiling affectionately , tells him that his shame at his relationship with fenichka is
the narrator goes on to say that , even at such moments , her blood remained quiet in her charmingly slender and quiet body
you seem to think i have some special aims ; therefore you regard me with suspicion
the traditional results were romance , courtship , and marriage , followed by years of disappointing boredom or domestic tyranny
in my own view , these two little insignificant things are not trifles at all
yes , sir , i do have a book , sir
mustard plasters on the stomach bleeding , he kept saying anxiously
he continued his reflections
it ’ s always the same with these schilleresque beautiful souls : ‡ up to the last moment they dress a person in peacock feathers , until the last moment they hope for the good , not the bad ; and although they have a feeling about the other side of the coin , they won ’ t utter a single word about it to themselves for any reason
once more he covered his face with his hands and bent his head down
why , he says , did you wash away the blood ?
to hell with him !
he lives near here , in kozel ’ s house
really , if you think about it—it is rubbish , he muttered with the look of a person unaware of himself and in delirium
to a n maykov
bazarov looked at anna sergeevna
the door was locked , but when they arrived with the caretaker , the door was unlocked
i can ’ t argue that perhaps he contributed to hastening the course of events , so to speak , by the moral impact of his insult ; but as far as his conduct is concerned and , in general , the moral character of the person himself , i ’ m in agreement with you
a russian has no need of them whatsoever
the only thing i managed to do was to kill
now it ’ s just happened
de rougement , it will be recalled , took his stand firmly on the side of ordinary , happy , family love , and against passion , romance , and the love of troubadours and minnesingers , which leads to a david lowe , turgenev 's fathers and sons ( ann arbor : ardis , )
he would have given everything on earth in order to remain alone , but he felt that he wouldn ’ t be alone even for a moment
i know only that it ’ s along one road ; that i know for certain—and only that
however , to judge in an impartial way about certain people , it ’ s necessary to discard some preconceived notions and one ’ s habitual way of regarding the people and objects that usually surround us
he raised his head and noticed that he was standing next to that same house , near the gates
die dogs , if you ’ re not happy !
i won ’ t allow it !
that had a powerful effect on her !
what right do i have to help ?
and it ’ s like that every step of the way , sir !
feared her son incredibly ; she left the running of the estate to vasily ivanovich—and refused to interfere in any way : she used to groan , wave her handkerchief , and raise her eyebrows higher and higher in horror as soon as her husband began talking about the impending reforms and his own machinations
yes , he replied , and you are that sphinx
you did not understand me
timofeich hesitated and made no reply
when you look from the side or from a distance at the empty life our 'fathers ' led , you think : what could be better ?
these people have a certain way of thinking
laughter redoubles in the cart and among the crowd , but mikolka grows angry and in his rage strikes the little mare with more blows , as if he really thinks she ’ ll be able to gallop
it will tear even more , she cried in a violent outburst
bazarov tossed his pistol away and approached his opponent
while his letters clearly do not show the same care in composition his facility for writing is notable
our great writers did not hold to any single and exclusive system of realistic depiction
raskolnikov said , turning suddenly to a gentleman , no longer young , who was standing next to him near the organ grinder and had the look of a flâneur
but he understood completely how monstrously she was tormented , and had been for some time , by the thought of her dishonorable and shameful predicament
i came , sir , to explain myself , so to speak ; i consider it my sacred obligation
they might even have seen him , but they didn ’ t notice him since lots of people pass by there
well , sir , that ’ s enough !
how could he do it ?
leaning over he planted a kiss firmly on her parted lips
everything in him fits his strong character unusually well
raskolnikov glanced at him over his shoulder , regarded him attentively , and said just as quietly and lazily :
excuse me if i ’ m interrupting , but i ’ ve come on rather important business , ma ’ am , petr petrovich remarked to everyone in general , not addressing anyone in particular
lebezyatnikov asked in surprise
therefore , the only exculpatory evidence is that they were punching each other and laughing
i will be right back , fenechka replied and left quickly
the connection with the grass snake in the portico seems clear
petr petrovich seemed not to have expected such an ending
you ’ re up to your old tricks , porfiry petrovich !
yesterday you noted that i have been remade during my time here ,
i would , replied raskolnikov
still , i ’ ll end it because i want to
porfiry petrovich and zosimov were among those invited to the ceremony
on the way to the duel , bazarov notices a peasant , who has gotten up early to attend to his daily tasks
i know it by heart
what 's so important about a kiss ?
raskolnikov stood up and took his cap
i don ’ t care at all ; i merely asked
let ’ s go , he says , to the police station , and i ’ ll tell you everything
has he gone back to his room ?
something extraordinary shone in that gaze even when her tongue was uttering the emptiest phrases
going back to sleep !
the only thing slightly unpleasant about him was that from time to time he would slowly and carefully raise his hand to capture a fly on his own face and sometimes squash them there
they had only about two or three hundred paces to walk
i wasn ’ t worthy of beholding her with my own eyes
sometimes bazarov would set off for the village and , in his usual mocking manner , enter into conversation with some peasant
let him , let him go wherever he pleases for now ; i know that he ’ s my prey and won ’ t get away from me !
he celebrated the triumph , no matter how short-lived , of a revolutionary ecstasy that could transform human life and human relationships
just let me hug you once more , enyushechka , arina vlasevna moaned
what , don ’ t you think that such wildly imaginative types can come from the common people ?
fathers and sons is not
you want to frighten me
he was always very patient with her , even courteous
have you ever seen any ?
asked pavel petrovich politely , but without the slightest smile
i see all too well that you ’ re fearless !
all other human feelings he reduces to the activity of the nervous system ; consequently , the enjoyment of the beauty of nature , of music , painting , poetry , the love of a woman do not seem to him to be any loftier or purer than the enjoyment of a copious dinner or a bottle of good wine
because it may be only an accident
you ’ re like a little child : asking to play with fire !
i needed to have something to cling to , some reason to delay , to see another person !
will you come to see me in prison when i have to spend time there ?
moreover , katerina ivanovna was not downtrodden : circumstances might defeat her entirely , but they could not crush her morally , that is , they could not intimidate her or overpower her will
twenty or thirty years from now who will remember all these storms in a teacup and my name , with or without a shadow cast upon it ?
allow me to state , sir : she said precisely that once i gave her this document , she ’ d extend as much credit to me as i required once again , and never , never , for her part—and these were her exact words—never would she use that letter before i myself paid my debt
our dust will eat out your eyes , our dirt will spoil your clothes , you have not risen to our level yet , you still ca not help admiring yourselves , you like castigating yourselves , and that bores us
he left , trembling from some wild hysterical feeling mixed together with unbearable pleasure—he was feeling gloomy , however , and horribly tired
has he been here long ?
you still love her !
what have you done , what have you done to yourself ?
well , i ’ d give only one for you !
finally , a large , ungainly sofa took up almost the entire wall and about half the width of the whole room ; at one time it had been covered in chintz , but now it was in tatters and served as raskolnikov ’ s bed
you know each other , don ’ t you ?
for the contemporary reader is not only pisarev , herzen , chernyshevsky , annenkov , strakhov , and company ; in view of the ambiguity at the heart of the adjective , the contemporary reader may be with equal justice construed as the reader of the late twentieth century , russian and non-russian alike
i wrote naively , as if i was struck myself by what came out
i also feel sorry for katya !
she clasped her hands together
you are looking at me incredulously and thinking : here 's an 'aristocrat ' speaking , all dressed up in lace , sitting on a velvet armchair
bazarov stopped talking to arkady about odintsova and even ceased mocking her aristocratic ways ; it 's true , he continued to praise katya as before , merely advising arkady to restrain her sentimental tendencies , but his praise was hurried , his advice , dry ; in general he talked with arkady much less than before as if avoiding him , feeling ashamed of something
are you really leaving ?
imagine his astonishment when he suddenly saw that not only was nastasya home this time , and in the kitchen , but that she was busy working : she was taking the laundry out of a basket and pinning it up to dry !
it is nevertheless the more positive sides of his character that must have impressed those who knew him well , concludes knowles in a more consoling spirit , for almost everyone liked him and children adored him
a cold smirk distorted bazarov 's lips
ah , good lord , my dear , it ’ s impossible to trouble you with anything !
perhaps i still don ’ t need to say anything , flashed through his mind
he said , as if he ’ d made up his mind
what ’ s wrong with him ?
we heard , rodya , that petr petrovich was kind enough to call on you today , pulkheriya aleksandrovna added with some timidity
he looked at the old woman and was in no rush to leave , just as if he wanted to say or do something else , but it seemed as if he himself didn ’ t know precisely what
after sitting her in an armchair , he gave his father another quick hug and then introduced arkady to him
marmeladov struck his fist on his forehead , clenched his teeth , closed his eyes , and placed his elbow firmly on the table
she might be of use to you if you were a bit more sensible
muttered the girl , waving her arm again
was it a joke ?
by force of habit he headed for the haymarket , the usual path of his previous walks
the meeting with her struck him as a particularly happy omen ; he was delighted to see her , as if she were family
zametov flinched , and although he did not exactly take offense , he was extremely surprised
you don ’ t believe that ’ s what she said ?
as i was comin ’ down the stairs and turnin ’ into the gateway at full speed , i run right into the caretaker with some other gentlemen , i don ’ t remember exactly how many , and the caretaker begins shoutin ’ at me , and the other gentleman also begins shoutin ’ ’ cause me and mitka are blockin ’ the way
it was all the same to me ; it wasn ’ t any of my business : was it logical or not for them to console themselves like that !
i was disturbed by the following fact : i did not even find a hint in any work of our literature of what i seemed to see everywhere ; against my will i was beset by doubts : was i not chasing a phantom ?
you should carry a whip in your hand !
so she really died ?
i ’ ll take him to see rodya and then bring him to you
what if there ’ s already been a search ?
pulkheriya aleksandrovna intervened angrily
but it was strange : she didn ’ t even stir under the blows , as if she were made of wood
i ’ ve retained only the money that marfa petrovna gave me a year ago
then why not leave me in peace , raskolnikov muttered with a frown
romantic loves seeks events and obstacles , and imagines that real life is to be found in passion and struggle
are you both joking , or what ?
the fascination of a charming , virtuous , and educated woman could embellish his path to an astonishing degree , could attract others to him , create an aura
at least , that ’ s the way it seems
but , nothing , i have no specialty !
we know the type !
a forty-four-year-old man , a pater familias , living in such-and-such district—and plays the cello !
you say he 's unhappy : you ought to know ; but all his foolishness still has not gone out of him
ask kapernaumov ; she leaves her key with them
this whispering hadn ’ t ceased from the moment he had entered his room
i don ’ t wish to be mistaken in my choice , nor should i for you , i ’ d have to break off with my brother ; for my brother , i ’ d have to break off with you
the inattentive reader may come to the conclusion that bazarov has no internal substance and that his entire nihilism consists of an interweaving of daring phrases snatched from the air and not created by independent thought
but neither katya nor arkady even understood her
brought the standoffish gentleman up short ; he almost turned to face razumikhin , but managed to restrain himself in time and turned back to zosimov
i agree that perhaps in your eyes i ’ m overly concerned about these trifles ; but you can ’ t consider me an egoist or a greedy man
he was mistaken in his calculations : pulkheriya aleksandrovna threw herself at him , grabbed both his hands , and almost started kissing them
now , reminding dunya with bitterness that he had decided to take her despite those nasty rumors about her , petr petrovich was speaking in complete sincerity and even feeling deep disgust toward such black ingratitude
at length , one person was about to appear in his dressing gown because he didn ’ t own a suit , but this was so inappropriate that the combined efforts of amaliya ivanovna and the little pole succeeded in excluding him
clearly , he was concerned about making an impression and his vanity had overcome his good sense
he tries to lead his son away , but the boy breaks from his father ’ s arms ; beside himself , he runs toward the horse
when he ’ d paid his visit to raskolnikov , he had entered with the feeling of a benefactor preparing to reap the fruits and hear extremely gratifying compliments
and , assuming an air of indifference , pavel petrovich left the room at once
according to you , we stand outside humanity , beyond its laws
what is to be done ?
i have been looking all over for you but you have chosen an excellent spot and you are engaged in a splendid pursuit
well , this is splendid !
that 's the only thing i am proud of
old boy , rodion romanovich !
he rested his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head tight in his palms
only three men were sent to work there
it ’ s time , dunechka , it ’ s time !
i couldn ’ t recall this apartment because i ’ d never known about it
i drink to your health , eudoxie !
oh , god grant they will !
why has not evgeny come ?
anna sergeevna was so kind vasily ivanovich began
he raised his brooding glance to her face and suddenly noticed that he was sitting , while she was still standing in front of him
in drawing the character of bazarov i excluded everything artistic from his sympathies , i endowed him with harshness and an unceremonious tone—not out of a blind desire to insult the younger generation ( ! ! !
what a pretty girl !
if bazarov 's throwing open of odintseva 's window is a metaphor for his desire to rape her , it is also a metaphor for his political desires : his longing to break into the kingdom of order , that paternal realm over which odintseva presides
asked arkady , while the question , what use is it ?
raskolnikov went upstairs to the tavern
thus very clever people can be honorable through calculation and act openly where limited people would equivocate and lay snares
porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette
but let me ask you , what kind of tendentiousness in fathers and sons ?
said one woman , crossing herself
although bazarov is nothing to me , although i , perhaps , feel no sympathy for him , for the sake of abstract justice , i shall endeavor to answer this question and refute this silly doubt
perhaps you have never experienced this feeling ?
‡ a newspaper article published in attacked a woman in perm who read pushkin ’ s unfinished short story egyptian nights shamelessly and with provocative gestures
shall i open a window ?
but why are you so pale ?
did you notice that he was indifferent to everything , made no response to anything except for one point when he lost his self-control : the murder
what an efficient and
disregarding public opinion for your sake and restoring your reputation , of course i could very well have counted on some requital and even have claimed your gratitude
we ’ re to blame for embarking on this unseemly course of action ; i ’ m most at fault
people also gathered from the kapernaumovs ’ apartment , including kapernaumov himself , lame and blind in one eye , a strange-looking man with bristling hair and whiskers standing up straight ; his wife , who always had a frightened look ; and several of his children , their expressions fixed in constant astonishment and their mouths wide open
he was just blabbing , felt like wagging his tongue
he suddenly recalled sonya ’ s words : go to the crossroads , bow down before the people , kiss the earth because you ’ ve sinned before it , and say aloud to the whole world , i ’ m a murderer !
and was it worth it now , after all that had happened , to try to overcome these paltry new difficulties ?
that ’ s it , isn ’ t it ?
i don ’ t believe you !
but no , it should be explained more powerfully and imaginatively : looking at me at this very moment , it ’ s not a matter of can you , rather it ’ s dare you state positively that i am not a swine ?
raskolnikov didn ’ t sit down and didn ’ t want to walk away ; he stood in front of her in a quandary
some were in cases , others simply wrapped in newspaper , neatly and carefully , in double sheets , bound with ribbons
he tapped his forehead
he rushed at the axe ( it was an axe ) and pulled it out from under the bench , where it had been lying between two logs ; right there , before he left , he secured the axe in the loop , thrust both hands into his pockets , and left the lodge ; no one noticed him !
bazarov and arkady answered her with a silent bow , climbed back into their carriage , and , without stopping anywhere , headed home , to marino , where they arrived safely the following evening
shout several voices in the crowd
it vexes him to see a man , and a doctor besides , not daring to view the matter in its proper light
he was still preoccupied as he emerged from the gate
he uttered in a hoarse voice
bazarov , with his enormous sensitivity and vanity , feels out of place at the governor 's ball and at odintsov 's estate ( the wording of his request for vodka amazes the butler )
the tavern was dirty , dilapidated , and not even of average quality
on the first day after my arrival , i visited a number of foul places—well , after seven years , i threw myself into it
the most detailed portrait of a woman who actually participates in cyclical time is that of katya ; she enters the world of the novel carrying a basket full of fresh flowers , followed by a beautiful borzoi
dear madam , pulkheriya aleksandrovna ,
it was a twenty-kopeck piece
that odintseva fears , and shuns , an animal that is tame , is emblematic of her response to everything that lies beyond her manor walls
the tradesman squinted at him sullenly and examined him fixedly and carefully , without hurrying ; then he turned away slowly and , without saying a word , walked through the gate and into the street
he was very ashamed of his background and did not know whether to feel flattered or offended by bazarov 's unexpected familiarity in addressing him
) , instead of tying up the cabdriver , he clasped ze hands , und vept , und begt
that in truth it would have been easier for him if they had greeted him with abuse , because now it was all too confusing
oh , this happens very often !
she soon returned to her own room and reappeared only at breakfast
raskolnikov got as close as he could and finally saw the object of all this commotion and curiosity
but you have got no reason to get excited ; it does not matter to me
why do you keep asking ?
its effect , though , is to lock pavel petrovich into an eternal past , anna sergeevna into an eternal present , and bazarov into an eternal future
mädchen , was willst du mehr ? ¶¶
yet , knowing beforehand that he won ’ t , you still set off on your way and
here the narrator unequivocally attributes moral worth to ignorance of time 's passage , since such ignorance constitutes a psychic escape from the press of time 's chronological progression
sonya was silent for a long time , as if she could make no reply
raskolnikov hadn ’ t been to see him for the last four months or so , and razumikhin didn ’ t even know where his friend ’ s apartment was
he recalled how at that moment he had begun to feel sorry for her , as if his heart had contracted
he paused for a moment to catch his breath , to collect himself , in order to enter like a man
why don ’ t i serve , my dear sir ?
is the water ready ?
it happened in the morning , pulkheriya aleksandrovna continued hurriedly
i love you without limit
he took charge immediately , poured her tea , then poured another cup , forsook his own lunch , and sat down on the sofa again
was it a long time ago ?
was willst du mehr—the things he thinks of , the blockhead !
thus they must forgo pleasures that stronger selves can enjoy
he directed his sleepy gaze coldly at the approaching svidrigaylov
that turgenev retains the psychology of metamorphosis , the notion of a regression from the human to the animal , is suggested in his description of bazarov 's embrace and odintseva 's response : bazarov 's face is bestial , while odintseva 's own face is transformed by desire
i like it when they sing with an organ grinder on a cold , dark , damp autumn evening , absolutely on a damp evening , when all the passersby have pale green , sickly faces ; or , even better , when wet snow is falling straight down , without any wind , you know , and gaslights are shining through it
dunya believed blindly that he would fulfill all his intentions , and , in fact , she had to believe him : this man had an iron will
it ’ s hard to be effective ; it doesn ’ t just descend from the heavens
i don ’ t believe you !
perhaps there ’ s still time
i ’ ll go with you
no one , no one at all has ever seen them here before , and i ’ ve never seen them either ; why did they come , i ask you ?
all right , so be it ; but how would you decide ?
but that is the beginning of a new story , the story of the gradual renewal of a person , the story of his gradual rebirth , and gradual transition from one world to another , of his getting to know a new , hitherto completely unknown reality
i don ’ t believe it !
with all your heart and soul ?
i ’ m annoyed that i humiliated myself with zametov in the tavern yesterday
her expression was thoughtful , but not stern
she uttered with difficulty
so , you speak to me in french , i reply in latin
peter woke him at four o'clock ; he got dressed at once and left with him
oh , these high-strung people are too much !
you know , i am afraid he may not be comfortable sleeping on the sofa
if they stop him , all ’ s lost ; if they let him pass , all ’ s still lost : they ’ ll remember him
she looked at rodya
men have no time to waste on such trifles
razumikhin just told me that even now you ’ re accusing nikolai and you assured him of that
i ’ ve upset him with all my chatter !
svidrigaylov replied with a loud laugh
and again , 'while some accused me of
raskolnikov asked with a smirk
she ’ s so muddled ; she ’ s either agitated like a little girl , hoping that tomorrow everything will be right , the refreshments , and everything else
without understanding anything , right there in the hall , she threw herself at anna sergeevna 's feet and began kissing her dress like a madwoman
as far as petr petrovich is concerned , i was always certain of him , katerina ivanovna continued to raskolnikov
that is , on your voyage ’ ?
cried sonya , bending over her
there were eight items in all : two small boxes with earrings or something of that sort—he didn ’ t look very carefully—and four small morocco leather cases
he looked at sonya and felt how much love was directed at him ; strange to say , he suddenly felt oppressed and pained at being so loved
you could have lived by reason and spirit , but you ’ ll end up on the haymarket
he went out into the garden for a few moments , stood there like a statue as if overwhelmed by some inexplicable consternation ( a look of consternation never left his face the whole time ) , and returned to his son once again , trying to avoid his wife 's inquiries
if even one more scandal takes place in your respectable house , then i ’ ll have you hauled off to the slammer , as they say in the highest circles
under the influence of various vague emotions , an awareness of life passing by , a desire for novelty , she would forced herself to reach a certain point , to look beyond it—and there she glimpsed not even an abyss , but emptiness or formlessness
she stood there deep in thought
you ’ re doing all these things in your delirium !
he opened the door and listened : everything was absolutely still in the house
( a discreet private toast is proposed by the victorious and magnanimous katya to the memory of the erring and vanquished bazarov )
such an investigation may have profound significance
even if he had been convinced that all progressives were such fools , even then his uneasiness would not have been alleviated
why go to petrovsky park ?
i should ’ ve realized that
but in any case , it ’ s difficult for me as a man
it was completely different
both young men left right after supper
unfortunately , she 's still not very enlightened : she needs to become better acquainted with our evdoksiya
just wait 'til you see my little garden !
member of the previous generation who combines the manners of a parisian litterateur with an income derived from the labor of serfs
when do you plan to arrest me ?
how would you decide : which of them has to die ?
you are leaving us dear brother , you are leaving us , he began
he became flustered and fell silent
porfiry petrovich went to order the tea
do you know the details of that episode ?
furthermore , i recall , i develop the idea in my article , that all people
all of a sudden the door opened and avdotya romanovna walked in
he turned his back to the railing and looked around
he must be close by , however , in the courtyard , because the door ’ s wide open
raskolnikov put his cap down , maintained his silence , and listened seriously , with a scowl , to porfiry ’ s empty , disjointed chatter
we may remind them of pushkin 's lines :
i ’ ll follow you , i ’ ll follow you everywhere !
no matter how simpleminded andrey semyonovich was , little by little he still began to see that petr petrovich was deceiving him , that he secretly despised him , and that he was not the man he seemed to be
you can ’ t possibly imagine how demolished that fellow is now !
he remembered and thought about dunechka and his heart skipped a beat
if you like , i ’ ll take him abroad
i mean the prosaic set of values that center around the family and ordinary life , the life of fathers and sons ( or fathers and children , to translate the title literally )
you were bored there even when my wife was still alive ; now i think you would die of boredom
the person being reproached was sitting on a chair and had the look of a man who very much wanted to sneeze but was unable to do so
what nonsense , he thought
i live right here !
long luxuriant tresses and capacious crinolines , so obviously suggestive of fertility , were clearly parts of the feminine apparatus of erotic attraction
this creature not only didn ’ t think it fitting to appear , but didn ’ t even send a message of apology that she couldn ’ t come , as considered correct by the most ordinary rules of politeness in such circumstances !
well , go on , shoot !
thus anna sergeevna expressed herself , and thus bazarov expressed himself ; they both thought they were telling the truth
pulkheriya aleksandrovna smiled slightly , while raskolnikov roared with loud laughter
but it ’ s time for me to go ; i ’ ll drop in again , perhaps , and hope to find you here
the ball of paper hit him in the eye and bounced onto the floor
yesterday , when i asked you to come with me , i didn ’ t know where myself
his indignation was so intense that it immediately curtailed his trembling ; he prepared to enter with a cold , insolent appearance and promised himself to maintain his silence for as long as he could , to watch carefully and listen attentively , so that this time , at least , no matter what happened , he would conquer his own morbidly agitated nature
do you have a rendezvous ?
he muttered , as if to himself ; then , all of a sudden , he noticed raskolnikov once more
wondered pavel petrovich when left alone
all his thoughts now revolved around one main point—he himself felt that it was really the main point , and that now , precisely at this moment , he was all alone , face-to-face with this main point—and that it was even happening for the very first time after these last two months
what did those words mean ?
pulkheriya aleksandrovna immediately began thanking zosimov , in particular for his visit to their hotel room the evening before
he 's not home ; he usually gets up early and goes off somewhere
peter 's quavering voice croaked from behind
he cried in astonishment , but he kept smiling maliciously
he started walking along voznesensky prospect toward the neva ; but on the way , another idea suddenly occurred to him : why the neva ?
gentlemen , let 's talk about love , added evdoksiya , lowering her arm languorously onto the rumpled cushion of the sofa
he asked , his face assuming a most casual expression
i understand everything , everything !
there is no point in speaking of the many splendid details in that tale , and it is so absorbing that while reading it you think the first line stands next to the last one—the middle is swallowed up so quickly !
large tears were flowing down dunya ’ s cheeks
it had an indescribable effect on her
oh , you stupid children !
this is why it happened that a portion of the younger generation recognized itself in bazarov
rage overcame him : he began striking the old woman on the head with all his strength , but with each blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom sounded stronger and louder , and the old woman shook with mirth
avdotya romanovna began to reply irascibly , but immediately restrained herself
our road 's one of civilization , yes , sir , yes , my kind sir ; its fruits are dear to us
the head clerk was about to say solicitously , but he paused because he knew from his own experience that it was impossible to restrain the lieutenant except by force once he was so incensed
he was afraid of losing his self-control
how do you know ?
in poverty you can still preserve the nobility of your innate feelings , while in destitution you never do and no one does
only one of them , the goddess of silence , with her finger on her lips , had actually been delivered and set in place ; but that same day some boys from the estate had broken the statue 's nose , and even though a local plasterer had managed to provide her with a new one , twice as good as the previous nose , odintsov had ordered her removed
let me say that what you are arguing can be applied to all people in general
there you go , petr petrovich , always blaming rodion , yet you yourself told an untruth about him in your letter , pulkheriya aleksandrovna added , gathering her courage
so , what of it ?
it ’ s really a pity that there ’ s no one left !
he was terribly irate
kiss the master 's hand , you silly girl , arina said to her
well , sir , that ’ s enough !
anna sergeevna began , but after pausing a little , added : now he 's more confident and talks to me
i ca not listen with indifference when women are attacked , continued evdoksiya
well , even if he did not , he could have and should have , as a poet
he himself reported it all to her
( tsarstvoval ) , decorous ( prilichnyi ) , ministerial ( ministerskii ) : turgenev 's description of odintseva 's home conflates politics and decorum in the novel 's most extreme example of repression and constraint
it ’ s a stumbling block for anyone like you , and worst of all—you ridicule it before finding out what it ’ s all about !
it is not a question of satisfying one 's pride but in the assurance that you have not made a mistake and have not missed the mark , and that labor has not been wasted
sooner or later , of course , we end up asking where turgenev stands
i ’ m heading to the islands
at least let someone die in peace !
i discovered this would never happen , that people wouldn ’ t change , there ’ s no one to remake them , and it ’ s not worth the effort !
arkady 's glance disrobes odintseva—he sees her body beneath grey silk—but he will not admit to it , just as he finally will reproach bazarov on a matter of
he glanced at his brother and handed mitya to fenechka
he had hardly appeared in the kirsanov family when he immediately arouses irritation and hatred in pavel petrovich , respect mixed with fear in nikolai petrovich , the friendly disposition of fenichka , dunyasha , the servants ' children , even of the baby mitya , and the contempt of prokofich
kukshina—turgenev 's parody of a nihilist—
to hell with him !
if the feminists wanted to change pieces of the world , the nihilists wanted to change the world itself , though not necessarily through political action
let us leave for a moment the question of his emptiness ; i will return to it later
but now i see that i was foolish once again , because if you want to , you ’ ll achieve anything you desire with your intellect and talent
for example , he seemed a bit harsh to me at first ; but that could be precisely because he ’ s such a straightforward man , and it ’ s absolutely so
you turned here automatically , and without even knowing it , you came right to this address
he robbed them , that was the only reason
and that i did my sister an honor today when i sat her next to you
and he 's by no means stupid
his legs suddenly felt weak , and a chill ran up his spine ; for a moment , his heart skipped a beat , but then it started pounding , as if it had come loose
he began listening : someone was cursing and imploring the other person in tears , but only one voice could be heard
he made every effort to remember everything and forget nothing ; his heart was still pounding , thumping so hard that it became hard for him to breathe
it was given to me , she replied , as if reluctantly and without looking at him
the letter trembled in his hands : he didn ’ t want to open it in her presence : he wanted to be alone with the letter
it ’ s better to speak the whole truth
well , zosimov , believe it or not , that question was posed , in those exact words
that ’ s just why they ’ re going to exile me now , that ’ s what they need to do
and will you come to love me ?
they don ’ t even want to know you , and they want you to leave
and continued in a low voice to abuse the shafthorse for kickin ' with his headpiece ,
denounce him , if you like !
and she 's come as well
he suddenly roused himself , as if waking up
ah , katerina ivanovna , of course , you can ’ t miss her
the policeman also stood there , confused
but he was a kind and generous man who loved and respected his family ; his one fault was that out of kindness he used to trust all sorts of depraved creatures ; god knows who he used to drink with , people who weren ’ t even worth his shoe sole !
well , as far as the peasant commune 's concerned , he said , you really ought to talk to your brother
hey , goddammit , are you asleep or what ?
i ’ m sure that even now he could do something to himself that no one else could ever conceive of doing
this glorification of nihilism , he complained , was nothing but grovelling at the feet of the young radicals
it was not family feeling at all , but a simple sense of justice , arkady objected contentiously
she had probably done nothing generous in her life and will not do so again all her life
i do not care if you understand it
and she was already thinking about a pension , he-he-he !
when have you tried to destroy yourself ?
no , you must ’ ve gotten carried away somehow !
i merely didn ’ t want to pass a hungry mother , clutching a ruble in my pocket , while waiting for the common good
in that moment , an idea suddenly dawned upon him—as if it had been waiting to strike him forcefully
all the windows were open wide ; the tavern , judging by the movement of the figures in the windows , was packed full of people
then listen to the story : exactly three days after the murder , in the morning , they were still fussing over kokh and pestryakov , even though those two were able to account for their every step
when you finish that part—you ’ ll get another three rubles
it still does not prove anything
in a word , i ’ d like to
all of a sudden he stood up
people don ’ t rent apartments at night ; besides , you must come to see it with the caretaker
( aniska ’ s the seamstress in the country , a former serf , who learned to sew in moscow—she ’ s a pretty girl )
du calme , du calme , pavel petrovich would reply to this , while he himself would hum , frown , and tug at his mustache
she did not lose her head , however , and promptly summoned her mother 's sister , the princess avdotya stepanovna kh , a nasty , arrogant old woman , who , after taking up residence in her niece 's house , appropriated all the best rooms for herself , growled and grumbled from morning to night , and would not even go out for walks in the garden unless accompanied by her one servant , a gloomy footman in worn , pea-green livery with light blue braid , and a three-cornered hat
cried svidrigaylov , turning around
he ’ s at my place now , but he ’ s not drunk
you ’ re in quite a sentimental mood today , aren ’ t you ?
how did they wind up there ?
just the opposite : i ’ m so glad you finally decided to visit us
do you think it ’ s because we have no interest in social matters , or is it that we ’ re very honest and don ’ t wish to deceive one another ?
all at once her whole body shuddered
that ’ s not it at all !
even though you make fun of medicine , i am sure you can give me some useful advice
yes , i understand ; everyone will have the same spleen
raskolnikov stood there clutching his axe
but how can one destroy without even knowing why ?
water wears away a stone
perhaps i know more than you do
man ’ s a scoundrel : he can get used to anything !
they had to sit in the drawing room for rather a long time looking rather foolish
that ’ s what they consider the highest form of progress
but i find i have already spent too much time in spheres alien to my nature
bazarov had informed her of his impending departure with no intention of testing her or to see what might happen : he never fabricated
permit me to explain on my part that i ’ ve been living there for almost three years , from the time i first arrived from the provinces , and previously
dunya was too overwhelmed by svidrigaylov ’ s proposal
as he left the house , he pulled his cap down over his head with both hands , climbed into the dilapidated racing carriage left at the gate , and set off at a trot , not toward town
well , i thought , there ’ s a small detail at last !
so , ma ’ am , here i am again about the same sort of thing , raskolnikov continued , a little flustered and surprised by the old woman ’ s distrust
he did not manage to say good-bye to fenechka : he merely exchanged glances with her through the window
that , at least , is the latest news i received
the shout ended with a shriek ; the last sounds could be heard from outside in the courtyard ; then everything fell silent
there ’ s no way to deal with you ; you ’ re suffering from some sort of monomania
he raised himself up in a bad temper , feeling that he had been pummeled ; his bones ached
the errand boy at afanasy ivanovich ’ s shop is better dressed !
he dragged out his speech for no reason , avoided using the word papa ,
but this is all nonsense and beside the point
turgenev , no less than dostoevsky , was aware of the destabilizing forces in the individual and society , yet nothing was more nearly anathema to him in art and culture than maximalism
you see , she was taking some cure with her baths ; they have a cold spring , and she used to bathe in it every day , as soon as she entered the water , she suddenly had a stroke !
you could assist me in my agronomical work : you could give me some useful advice
he ’ s still a young man !
marmeladov cried suddenly , standing up , his arm outstretched , now genuinely inspired , as if he ’ d been waiting for those words
at least they ’ re not making any noise , only
when jesus therefore saw her weeping , the jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled , and said , where have ye laid him ?
they say that in consumption there are little tubercles that invade the brain ; it ’ s a pity that i don ’ t know anything about medicine
you will see he 's not the sort of man you think he is
why acacias of course
such an interesting young man
we lived very amicably , and she was always content with me
the shift away from turgenev was as noticeable in europe as in russia
i ’ m rodya ’ s friend , also a former student , and now i ’ m looking after him
and yet that love and falling in love are real and valuable human feelings
you ’ re stuck on your principles as if on loaded springs ; you don ’ t dare turn around on your own ; in my opinion , he ’ s a good man—that ’ s the principle , and i don ’ t want to hear anything else
he added suddenly in a loud voice and gave a brief laugh
so , in rejecting chivalric or tender attention from men , she often seemed blunt , for she deeply longed to be received as a human being , not simply as a woman
and really get to know each other well ?
he picked it up and examined it
he forgot to lock the door behind him , and he killed , he killed two people in accordance with a theory
one thing 's a nuisance—my mother 's so tenderhearted : if your belly does not swell and you do not eat ten times a day , she gets very upset
that ’ s also related , he concluded , as if talking to himself
many of our contemporary journalists and publicists will cry
raskolnikov frowned and stared directly at him
prosaics is one of the great anti-napoleonic arguments of russian literature
of course , nikolai petrovich observed , you were born here , so everything must seem special to you
you ’ re the murderer , sir
he does not follow us , but tranquilly gazes after us and describes our gait , telling us how we quicken our pace , how we jump across ditches , how now and then we stumble over rough places in the road
what else can she do ?
he spoke in a loud voice and stamped his feet , but his face looked haggard and he kept avoiding his son 's eyes
his father , a general who fought in , was a semiliterate , coarse russian , not in the least malicious , who worked hard all his life—
i ’ ll tell you later
although i agree with you that it ’ s unnecessary to recount
only , i believe , at the cost of ignoring its deepest layer of meaning and thus missing its consummate achievement
i had a feeling you ’ d ask me something like that , she said , regarding him inquisitively
her light-colored hair , sparse and with gray patches , smeared generously with grease as usual , was braided into a thin pigtail tucked under a comb of horn that stuck out at the nape of her neck
throughout , odintseva watches this veiled window—a window that stands as emblem of herself , of natural longing problematically hidden ; the epithets of the room—
so she comes to me , that one does , in the morning , says the elder to the younger , at the crack of dawn , all dressed up
have you seen a moth near a candle ?
rather than admit identity , the sudden collapse of barriers , odintseva insists that communication failed—an insistence that is itself an exemplary civil resolution
in life , in his relations to people , bazarov is not consistent ( with himself ) ; but in that very thing his vitality is disclosed
but she ’ d always had this
here , take this one , it ’ s cypress wood
upon reaching the corner , he crossed to the opposite side of the street , turned around , and saw that sonya was now following him , along the same street , not noticing anything
i have grown weak from all this heat
he kept having daydreams , and they were very strange , indeed : most often he imagined that he was somewhere in africa , in egypt , on some sort of oasis
the furniture , all very old and made of yellow wood , consisted of a sofa with an enormous carved wooden back , an oval table in front of it , a dressing table with a pier mirror standing between the windows , chairs along the walls , and two or three cheap pictures in yellow frames depicting young german ladies with birds in their hands—that ’ s all the furniture there was
both of them felt uncomfortable
insisted svidrigaylov with a mischievous smile
in a word , that i ’ m capable of being attracted and falling in love ( which , of course , doesn ’ t depend on our own will ) ; then everything can be explained in the most natural manner
such is the nature of this form of pseudo-objective underpinning : as befits a high official
he doesn ’ t want you to marry luzhin
it ’ s really true : you ’ re not a christian !
the first day , i arrived home from work in the morning and saw that katerina ivanovna had prepared two courses , soup and salted beef with horseradish , something we ’ d never even dreamt of before
all this flashed through his mind vaguely in one moment
porfiry cried in astonishment
and besides , what sort of father am i ?
cried razumikhin , banging his fist on the table
and why did he attack luzhin like that ?
where will i go ?
turgenev 's artistic method derives in part at least from his heightened awareness of the usually concealed relationship between surface manifestation and internal reality in the life and consciousness of people
polechka , how much did we collect ?
asked svidrigaylov , glancing at him inquisitively
thus , on the level of characterization , ottsy i deti proceeds in a manner entirely consistent with hegel 's dialectic : polarities and similarities shift and finally pass over into each other
petr petrovich ceremoniously escorted her to the door
how come you don ’ t work , huh , if you ’ re a civil servant ?
i do not see why it is not possible to say everything you have in mind
he is tempted , finally , by madame odintzov , the country-house delilah ; suddenly he finds his awkward callow tongue , admitting to her his inability to speak freely of everything in his heart
she is a caricature of the new woman , aspiring to play some role in history such as she imagines bazarov does
§ palmerston ( – ) was a british statesman and liberal prime minister
it 's hard to say now , but he will be famous
yet turgenev was absolutely correct in doubting that russia could or would overcome its historical ailments at least with respect to its near future
sonya was more embarrassed than before ; her face flushed with color once again
she buried her stepmother today : it ’ s not the sort of day to go visiting
whispered svidrigaylov in genuine horror
as for the items , some cuff links and chains—i buried those things and the purse the next morning in a courtyard on voznesensky prospect under a stone
well , for example take yesterday—as we were passing our bailiff , phillip 's cottage—and you said that russia will attain perfection when every last muzhik has such a place to live , and that every one of us ought to work to bring that about
all kinds of people trade here , replied the lad , taking raskolnikov ’ s measure condescendingly
don ’ t you earn some money every day ?
¶ an allusion to the views of the radical critic dmitry pisarev ( – )
nikolai petrovich cast a sidelong glance at his son ; the carriage traveled on for half a mile or so before their conversation resumed
raskolnikov asked with displeasure
have you already lost the strength to stop ?
raskolnikov had long since stopped listening
don ’ t torment me , sonya !
not for anything on earth !
at first when i came , he wasn ’ t there
conferred about it before , pulkheriya aleksandrovna began in her confusion
every last line in turgenev 's latest novel is deeply felt ; this feeling breaks through against the will and realization of the author himself and suffuses the objective narration , instead of merely expressing itself in lyric digressions
razumikhin asked , suddenly interrupting him
no , rodya , but he already knows about our arrival
apparently bazarov is a proud man , terribly egoistic and offending others by his egoism
raskolnikov spoke at last in a steady voice and stepped forward
he asked raskolnikov sternly , noticing his tattered clothes
to start preaching would mean to start going into abstractions , would mean calling logic and history to one 's aid , would mean to concern oneself with those things already admitted to be trifles in their very essence
turgenev hardly lost his interest in philosophers and philosophy , however
do make prokofich hurry , papa , and i will be right back
he ’ s just withdrawn a little , as if to roll a cigarette
yes , indeed , it was a mental imbalance that came upon me
no other russian writer evoked this ecstasy so powerfully
everyone would see them
now his mood resembled something like ecstasy and , at the same time , all the alcohol he ’ d consumed came rushing back to his head with redoubled force
the fiancée , however , had gone to bed much earlier , in a state of surprise and somewhat glum
bazarov bowed his head
how do you like that ?
suddenly her entire face turned red : she cried out and covered her face with her hands
the steps were heavy , even , unhurried
—some landowner just told me that this lady is— oh ho ho !
in what is to be done ?
the main thing is he ’ s a businesslike man ’ and seems to be kind ’ : what a joke that he took the conveyance of their baggage upon himself and that he ’ s shipping a large trunk at his own expense !
and you , gentlemen , he added with old-fashioned playfulness , allow a retired old veteran to invite you into his study
if only you would consider what it is you are supporting in russia with your vulgar maxim !
i gave the money yesterday to a consumptive woman , a devastated widow , not on the pretext of funeral expenses , but directly for the funeral , and not to the daughter—a young woman of notorious conduct ’ as he writes ( and whom i saw for the first time in my life yesterday ) , but to the widow herself
he was beginning to get angry and his face turned a particular rough coppery color
so much for the woman question
i ’ d very much like to see her once
is not that right , doctor ?
they are unhappy , distorted , and torment themselves with this very distortion as something completely inappropriate to their work
arkady , do you take your tea with cream or lemon ?
he took it out automatically
the peasant woman ’ s still cracking nuts and laughing
he thought very highly of himself ; his vanity knew no bounds , but he behaved simply , looked approvingly , listened indulgently , and laughed so generously that at first glance he might even be taken for a good fellow
she is beyond george sand ( a backward woman , knows nothing about education or embryology ) and correctly denounces proudhon , but in the same breath praises michelet 's l'amour !
he even liked this way out more than any other
do not stand on ceremony , arkady nikolaich , do have some
what if he or she is occupied at the moment with a natural necessity , he-he !
i ’ ll go see him
at each reading , people would line up who ’ d already heard the letter read several times in their own homes and in those of their other acquaintances
you get married , as soon as you can , and you build your nest , and you have lots of children
this observation of yours is even wittier than your last one
did you tell her ?
next he came to the apartment on the second floor where nikolashka and mitka had been working : it ’ s locked ; the door ’ s been freshly painted ; that means it ’ s for rent
as a remarkably intelligent man , he has never yet met his equal
he was probably lying
no , papa , i have not prepared anything
all of this business went smoothly
i won ’ t offer you coffee , sir , it ’ s not the place ; but why not sit here with a friend for five minutes or so for some amusement , porfiry chattered on without stopping , and you know , sir , all these official obligations
leave me , but don ’ t
one need only look at the face of our second
why do you say that ?
lizaveta replied slowly and pensively , as if unable to make up her mind
i must take care of these captives of mine
; and z a kamensky , russkaia ßosofia nachala xix veka i shelling ( moscow , )
she 's here i want to see her
how repulsive this all is !
i think bazarov constantly beats pavel petrovich and not the other way around
i don ’ t know from whom
instead of attacking them , you ought to read michelet 's de l'amour
that ’ s what it means to be in a certain mood
after his death she was left with three young children in a distant and dreadful provincial town , where i was also staying at the time ; she was living in such hopeless poverty—even though i ’ ve had many different experiences , i can ’ t even begin to describe her situation
he regarded his sister intently and intensely , but he hadn ’ t even heard or understood her words
this is not allowed on the streets , ma ’ am
only a few people in the whole world could be saved ; these were the pure and chosen , destined to found a new race of people and a new life , to renew and purify the earth ; but no one had ever seen these people , no one had ever heard their words or their voices
what ’ s the matter , you silly children ?
sonya repeated , crying hysterically and wringing her hands
her face still showed traces of illness ; it had grown thinner , paler , more pinched
katerina ivanovna , who was really distraught and very tired and already fed up with the funeral feast , immediately snapped at amaliya ivanovna and said that she was talking nonsense and didn ’ t understand a thing ; that die wäsche was the concern of the woman in charge of the linen , and not the director of a boarding school for noble young women ; and as far as reading novels was concerned , that was simply indecent , and she asked her to keep quiet
i am also something of a psychologist and physiognomist
this is a problem that occupies some of luc
you also said yesterday that you weren ’ t delirious , you even insisted on that !
she added that petr petrovich had specially ordered her to say that as soon as it became possible , he would come very soon to talk privately about business and to agree on what could be done and what to undertake in the future , etc , etc
raskolnikov kept silent , although he didn ’ t lift his anxious gaze from his friend ’ s face even for a moment
to have a requiem sung
i confess that i don ’ t understand him very well
you ’ ve begun to neglect your illness too much , sir
not only would the time to talk about everything never come , but there was nothing further for him to talk about with anyone , ever
he took from his pocket raskolnikov ’ s old , stiff boot , covered with dried mud and riddled with holes
asked razumikhin as soon as they got out to the street
i received a letter from kolyazin
by the way , how are the sunday schools getting on ?
it must be sacrificed for something more important , namely sophistication , aesthetic control , composure
until then , he didn ’ t want to meet anybody
how can we all descend on her at once ?
after seven in the evening
dunya must be protected from him
bazarov stood with his back to her
you , for instance , you wo not fight—yet you think you are a fine fellow—but we want to fight
he was pale , his eyes burning , all his limbs exhausted , but he suddenly seemed able to breathe more easily
i have gathered them now because it will soon be too hot and i wo not be able to go out
all during this scene , andrey semyonych stood next to the window or paced the room , not wishing to interrupt the conversation ; after sonya left , he suddenly approached petr petrovich and formally extended his hand
so , you would like to have an argument—by all means
you ’ ll have the account right away
and as he left , he quarreled with everyone
no he went out to the fields and i am not afraid of him but pavel petrovich
i know him , i do !
just think , it was he , he himself , who gave sofiya semyonovna that one-hundred-ruble note with his own hands—i saw it , i ’ m a witness , i ’ ll swear an oath !
the secretary of the english embassy sold them at the flea market last week ; he wore them only six days , but he really needed some cash
perhaps there ’ s no such thing as god , raskolnikov replied , even with some malicious delight
asked raskolnikov , as if alarmed
what time were you told to appear , kind sir ?
oh , god , what are we doing ?
well , if you were not such a fool , you ’ d be better off coming by my place today to spend the evening there than wearing out your new boots for nothing here
raskolnikov said with a laugh
is it the same mir that rests on three fishes ?
i myself will become one here !
that would really be better !
it is he , the polar opposite of the underground man , who holds up the extralinguistic proposition that x = as the ultimate argument for the truth of science
you can ’ t believe what that was like !
bazarov especially said almost nothing at all , but ate a great deal
but what have we said ?
well , of course , it did
arkady said nothing in reply to bazarov , and each of them lay down to sleep with his own thoughts
it would be better
he did sit down , but he didn ’ t let go of his cap
this was so strange !
as i ’ m telling him all this , i see him reach for his cap and get ready to bolt
razumikhin , positively embarrassed from having knocked over the table and broken the glass , regarded the fragments grimly , spit , and turned abruptly to the window and stood with his back to the others , his face wearing a terrible frown , looking out the window , but seeing nothing
is that pride , dunya ?
this doesn ’ t concern us
i understand , sir , everything you can say !
as if i couldn ’ t drop in on him now
tolstoy soon makes it crystal clear that the better love lies in the familiar and in the family , and not in brilliant happiness
by which he meant jerking his head
where do you live , may i ask ?
but i did not want to sugar-coat him , to use his own words , though through that i would have had the young on my side immediately
it was svidrigaylov , that same landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was working there as a governess
it would be better if you told me directly
the first bottle of champagne was followed by a second , then a third , even a fourth evdoksiya chattered without stopping ; sitnikov echoed her
i hope , however , that everything went without any particular difficulties
she cried rapidly , hurrying , gasping for breath , and coughing
nastasya , go away , for heaven ’ s sake ; here ’ s your three kopecks , only go away right now , for heaven ’ s sake !
this question of cesspools , in spite of all its vulgarity , had served several times as the cause of a dispute and disagreement between petr petrovich and his young friend
dunya immediately grabbed hold of his hand and squeezed it warmly , overjoyed and grateful
so you noticed that i told nikolai just now that he was using someone else ’ s words ’ ?
no , i didn ’ t see them , raskolnikov replied slowly , as if searching his memory , at the same time tensing his entire being , immobilized by the torment of trying to guess where the trap lay hidden , and hoping that he wouldn ’ t miss anything
polechka led the way , holding kolya and lyonya by the hand , both of whom were trembling and crying
now the crowd was dispersing from the stairway , everyone to their own apartments—exclaiming , arguing , calling to one another , first raising their voices to shout , then lowering them to whisper
he rushed to the door to ask for some water , but there in the corner , fortunately , was a carafe
know that too you have behaved sensibly ; you are not made for our bitter , tart , lonely existence
she embraced sonya and held her close , as if shielding her with her chest from everyone else
his writing is dense and substantial , yet it never marks time , always moves
katerina ivanovna remarked with contempt that her own background was known to everyone and that the same certificate of merit indicated in print that her father was a colonel ; while amaliya ivanovna ’ s father ( if she even had one ) was probably some poor petersburg finn who peddled milk ; that most likely she didn ’ t have a father at all , because even up to now amaliya ivanovna ’ s patronymic was still unknown : ivanovna or lyudvigovna
razumikhin was sitting here , too ; why didn ’ t it occur to him ?
are you crazy , or what ?
on the contrary , he became even more agonizingly , more intimately attached to this woman , in whom there remained , even when she surrendered herself to him entirely , something secret and inaccessible , which no one could penetrate
his attire was awful : all dirty , torn , and wrinkled , because he ’ d spent the previous night in the rain
raskolnikov turned pale and grew cold , hearing his own words to sonya
he ’ s a bit awkward ; that is , he ’ s a worldly man , but in another sense , i say he ’ s awkward
if you ’ re ashamed , then don ’ t talk about it !
und zat iz not proper in ein respectable haus , herr kapitän , und i ’ m shouting
why , you do not consider yourself useless
no need for what ?
he ’ s very impressionable , sir , and he forgot all about his elder and about everything else
nikolai petrovich looked after him and sank down on his chair in confusion
after all , it ’ s only a theory and my theory at that , sir , and what sort of authority am i ?
but at that moment , the door opened wide once more and in walked razumikhin , bending his head a bit because he was so tall
and he himself even tells me about it ?
fenechka , said pavel petrovich in a somber voice , i saw
he was so exhausted from his whole month of concentrated melancholy and gloomy agitation that he felt like taking a breath in another world , wherever it was , and in spite of the filth of his surroundings , he now remained in the tavern with pleasure
no one ’ s home out there , he said softly and unhurriedly
i confess that since that last time i ’ ve felt very sorry that we treated you the way we did
and here we have a man in tatters , an arrogant policeman , the beginnings of an illness , and such a suspicion !
what a swine i am !
i found my former wife
but the heat of midday passes , evening comes , then night , and the return to a quiet refuge where sweet sleep awaits all who are tired and tormented
the general character of the time is practicality : we all want to live by the rule that fine words butter no parsnips
pavel petrovich turned it over in his hands
the thought of dunya and his mother for some reason suddenly plunged him into some sort of panic
but didn ’ t you say she ’ s a freak ?
we ’ ll arrange everything
i won ’ t describe now what happened that evening with pulkheriya aleksandrovna , how razumikhin went back to them , how he tried to calm them down , how he swore that it was necessary to allow rodya to rest from his illness , swore that rodya would certainly come to see them , how he would come every day , that rodya was very , very upset , and that it was important not to irritate him ; how he , razumikhin , would look after him , find him a good doctor , the best , arrange for a consultation
we live in complete harmony , sonya said , suddenly agitated again and even irritated , just as if a canary or some other little bird had gotten angry
you can tell right away that in his own day he was a great latinist !
he cried , trying to convince pulkheriya aleksandrovna
it seems that the entire destitute family now depends on you alone
you ’ ve also stepped over
is of odintseva to herself—a revelation startling in its suggestion of her kinship with bazarov , a revelation from which she will flee to her familiar structures of order and repression
kokh began to stir
and his comparison of odintseva to ice cream—what is cold and solid melts—both attack surface stability
he leaned toward zametov , as close as he could get , and began moving his lips , uttering nothing at all ; he stayed like that for half a minute ; he knew what he was doing , but was unable to stop himself
we have to be merciful and forgive him a great many things
bazarov 's eyes glittered for an instant from under his dark brows
dunya recalled , moreover , her brother ’ s words to the effect that her mother had overheard her nighttime raving on the eve of that last fateful day , after the scene with svidrigaylov : had she perhaps found out something then ?
here , old boy , drink some , he whispered , rushing to him with the carafe
i ’ m all done in !
he told sofiya semyonovna all of this word for word ; she ’ s the only one who knows his secret , but she didn ’ t participate in the murder , neither in word nor in deed ; on the contrary , she was horrified , just as you are now
the parenthetical exclamation— how shapely her figure seemed to him , engulfed in the grey shimmer of black silk—is a glimpse into what that ritual of parting masks
she was about to grab the washbasin and hand it over to raskolnikov , as he had requested , but she almost stumbled with the heavy load
do you remember , mama , i was once in love and wanted to get married , he said suddenly , looking at his mother , who was struck by the unexpected manner and tone with which he had begun talking about it
i will introduce you to my sister ; she plays the piano very well
sonya was about to burst into tears : on the other hand , she considered herself unworthy of even looking at her
the devil only knows what sort of nonsense it all is !
the action of the novel takes place in the summer of
he stared steadfastly at the window
they gave it to him
he fell to his knees in the middle of the sidewalk , fortunately deserted this time
arkady 's glance at odintseva is parenthetical and hidden : bazarov approaches his friend and , in the spirit of male gossip , attempts to give expression to the hidden glance ; the words he uses are elemental , implicitly dismissive of attempts to dress up
thus the language and style of turgenev 's novels have the appearance of being single-languaged and pure
a quarter of an hour later both carriages stopped in front of the porch of a new wooden house painted gray and covered with a red iron roof
he was in an excellent frame of mind
have you thought up a lot of money ?
all her behavior presented a series of incongruities ; she wrote the only letters that could have aroused her husband 's justified suspicions to a man whom she hardly knew , and her love always retained a measure of sadness ; she no longer laughed or joked with the man she would chosen ; she listened to him and looked at him in bewilderment
what do you mean , what kind ?
you sybarite , muttered evdoksiya and began laughing
'no , friend , if you have decided to knock everything down , you must knock yourself down , too !
and i don ’ t think he values you very highly
amaliya ivanovna , for some reason , had also suddenly acquired unusual importance and unusual respect from katerina ivanovna , perhaps solely because the funeral feast was being prepared and amaliya ivanovna had resolved with all her heart to take part in all the work : she took it upon herself to set the table , procure the linen , crockery , and so forth , and to prepare the food in her kitchen
he added , his curiosity suddenly aroused
this is all nonsense , almost all idle talk !
after receiving a negative reply , he finally departed
( let it all come out in one clean sweep !
preaching would be that justification which , as we have seen , was superfluous for from n strakhov , kriticheskiya stat ' i , vol
no , you won ’ t run away
perhaps we could let some blood
your son deliberately exaggerated the meaning of my words to the point of absurdity , accusing me of evil intentions and , in my view , basing his allegations on your correspondence
yesterday i gave away all the money you sent me
whispered razumikhin , always inclined to exaggerate , turning forcefully in his chair
after twenty paces or so , you drop your head and clasp your hands behind your back
this , then , is a symbol that i ’ m taking up my cross , hee-hee !
in one she kept hold of the pledge
and he will forgive my sonya , he will ; i know that he will forgive her
† a community organized according to the plan of the french utopian socialist , charles fourier ( – )
but it was the devil that killed the old woman , not me
what does she say to you when she comes to visit ?
some console themselves by becoming professors and working for the future generation
he would not answer the question
she extended her hand to bazarov once again and responded to his handshake
it would be such a benefit that one would have to regard it as nothing other than a gift to us directly from the almighty
i will say this to console you , said bazarov
so you can ’ t guess ?
instead of a reply , raskolnikov stood up and went to the passageway , took hold of the bell chain , and yanked it
in any case , your items couldn ’ t possibly be lost , he continued calmly and coldly
i have already forgiven thee
wine , for example , i don ’ t drink at all
just you remember once and for all , you mighty gentlemen , that there are only four and a half of you , while there are millions of others who wo not let you trample their most sacred beliefs underfoot and who will crush you !
at such times he headed for the woods and walked with long strides , breaking any branches that got in his way , cursing both her and himself under his breath ; or else he took to the hayloft in the barn and , stubbornly closing his eyes , forced himself to sleep , which , naturally , he could not always do
i think he has a very good idea , he replied
beg for a loan of money without hope ?
we ’ ll totally disprove all this psychology , i ’ ll make all those suspicions against you disappear , so your crime will appear as the result of confusion , because , in all good conscience , that ’ s just what it was
don ’ t you see that ?
these very words are insincere in bazarov and childishly vulgar in his parody
he himself didn ’ t know ; as if grasping for straws , it suddenly seemed to him that he could live , there was still life ahead , and it hadn ’ t died along with that old woman
svidrigaylov pulled the trigger
well , then , sir , i ’ ll continue , sir : wit , in my opinion , is a majestic thing , sir ; it is , so to speak , the glory of nature and a consolation for life , and what tricks it can sometimes play , so that at times , it seems , it can bewilder even some poor little investigator , who ’ s distracted by his own fantasy , as always happens , because he ’ s also only human , sir !
the kirsanovs , father and son , have settled at marino
bazarov treats her with special respect ; it is evident that he is not indifferent to what she thinks of him , to the impression he is making ; contrary to his usual habit , he speaks quite a lot , tries to interest his listener , does not make cutting remarks and even , carefully avoiding topics of general concern , discusses botany , medicine , and other subjects he is well-versed in
i wasn ’ t quite well
what ’ s the matter with you ?
svidrigaylov provided drinks for her , for the organ grinder , the singers , and two clerks
from the distant opposite bank he could hear the sound of singing
i ’ m telling you this because i know for sure that you do love her , and i ’ m certain of the purity of your heart
and if you do question me , then only in the proper form , sir !
he calls this irony
bazarov , who for her embodies all that is unknown and unstable ahead , although mildly tempting , mostly fills anna sergeevna with horror
he asked whether she would chosen that sonata herself , or someone had recommended it to her
bazarov wanted to take it and leave
blood was still caked on her parched lips
but where are you going , avdotya romanovna ?
i came precisely to tell you everything and to bring this matter out into the open
you have talked with such clever women
for instance , after describing how fright-eningly quickly ten years had passed for pavel petrovich after an ill-fated love affair , the narrator then remarks , in no other country does time fly as fast as in russia ; in prison , they say , it flies faster still ( : ( p ] )
for some reason the singing and all that noise and commotion downstairs attracted him
you think i ’ m in a state !
perhaps everything will resurrect !
the silence lasted rather a long time
he must have heard the bells
holding his greasy dressing gown across his stomach with two fingers and smoking his pipe , he listened to bazarov with pleasure ; the more malicious his son 's quips , the more good-naturedly did he laugh , displaying every last one of his blackened teeth
his self-esteem , however , was quickly soothed and even flattered ; he realized that they really had been waiting for him as an oracle
he does not read anything in russian , but keeps a silver ashtray in the shape of a peasant 's bast sandal on his writing desk
you are crawling at bazarov 's feet !
do you really want to be a predator ?
before , you said , you used to teach children ; why don ’ t you do anything now ?
even if it ’ s the fourth , or the fifteenth , that ’ s all nonsense !
from all this it at least becomes apparent what a difficult task turgenev undertook in his latest novel and how successfully in our view he carried it out
i came home after dinner to have a little rest , and what do you think ?
you ’ re the moiderer , he insisted , even more distinctly and commandingly , with a grin of contemptuous triumph , and once more glanced directly at raskolnikov ’ s pale face and into his lifeless eyes
show me your finger
i didn ’ t take anything from you , sonya whispered in horror
my head aches very badly now
you do not believe in them ?
one has to be as inconspicuous as possible
yesterday evening , in the presence of my mother and my sister , and in his presence , i established the truth after proving that i had given the money to katerina ivanovna for the funeral , and not to sofiya semyonovna , and that two days ago i was still unacquainted with her and had not even once seen her face-to-face
like trained dogs dancing on their hind paws
it was apparent that this thought had already occurred to her many times before and that he had reminded her of it once again
now i am alone , completely alone !
this is the only time i can breathe
when dunya told him about you with such enthusiasm , he replied that one must first take a close look at anyone to form a judgment about him , and that he would reserve for himself the right to form his own opinion of you until he made your acquaintance
maybe we should ask the caretaker ?
the steps were very far off , at the bottom of the stairs , but he later recalled very clearly and distinctly that from the first sound , for some reason or other , he began to suspect that the footsteps were definitely coming here , that is , up to the fourth floor , to the old woman
he was afraid that he might have had a bilious attack during the night
if you only knew
who ’ s been just filling you full of champagne ?
arkady went out to join him
he ’ s dead , replied raskolnikov
they were definitely talking about me before we arrived !
i don ’ t want to speak against duty and conscience—but how are we to understand them ?
no matter what , he had to decide to do something , or else
apparently , this idea must have occurred to her already
i see the point of it : he simply wants to help me ; but last year i didn ’ t need it , and this year while i ’ d been waiting for him to arrive , i ’ d decided to take it
in the end , the image of their unfortunate brother stood out on its own , was drawn clearly and accurately ; there couldn ’ t be any mistakes , because all of it was based on true facts
she cried to the civil servant
raskolnikov made no reply ; he sat there pale and immobile , staring at porfiry ’ s face with the same strained attention
please , do not be offended : you probably recall my former opinion of katerina sergeevna
after he said this , raskolnikov felt inexpressible pleasure
she rushed around the room , pointing out luzhin to everyone
it ’ s consumption , sir ; the blood gushes and chokes the patient
the sun was burning behind a thin layer of solid whitish clouds
you know that at the time we even behaved in a dishonorable and ungentlemanly manner
i wasn ’ t asleep
in chapter he agrees to arkadi 's accusation of elitism : 'is it that you are a god while i am just one of the blockheads ?
what on earth can she do ?
why did zametov add that i spoke cleverly ?
the whole reason for the misunderstandings , the whole fault so to speak consisted in that the bazarov type created by me was not able to pass through gradual stages , as other literary types ordinarily do
i shall leave so as not to interfere with the further pleasantness of a family meeting and in the relaying of secrets
you become one yourself and take part in chivalric tournaments
there , in the immense steppe , flooded with sunlight , dark tents of some nomads were barely visible
of course , at first we were very surprised , since all this took place so swiftly and unexpectedly
but what am i saying ?
i might utter some stupid lie
do you need him right now , mama ?
insurmountable methodological hurdles often stand in the way of proving a philosopher 's influence on a poet or novelist , and hegel 's debt to fichte and schelling in the matter of the dialectic further exacerbates the difficulties in the present instance
this sudden , awful rupture now struck him like a clap of thunder
there ’ s someone with a hat
to hell with ya !
'technical beauties ' ) is exactly the sure way to 'human value ' , is exactly the business of the critic
he had in that moment been transformed ; his artificially arrogant and weakly challenging tone had disappeared
the stupid thing was that andrey semyonych was really angry
a young servant dressed in livery led the two friends into a large room , badly furnished , like all rooms
what should i do now ?
but nikolai suddenly sank to his knees
she ’ d have embraced this fate intentionally , and in the fourth or fifth century she ’ d have gone off to the desert in egypt and lived there for thirty years , nourishing herself on roots , ecstasies , and visions
perhaps i ’ m still a human being , not a louse , and i rushed to condemn myself
sooner or later everyone finds his niche , the late belinsky used to say
svidrigaylov struck his fist on the table with impatience
he really did say something to me yesterday about some dead man and about some young woman as we were going home , but i didn ’ t understand a word
if i ’ m to blame , forgive me ( although it ’ s impossible to forgive me if i am to blame )
he would only just come down to breakfast wearing a fashionable new outfit , this time not in the slavophile style ; the previous evening he would astonished the servant assigned to him by the amount of linen he would brought along
anna sergeevna lowered her eyes
but the aspect of secenov 's achievement i wish to stress has less to do with his specific work on the brain
anna sergeevna , who chatted mostly with bazarov , asked him whether he would like to play an old-fashioned game of preference with them
how can this be ?
petr petrovich began very imposingly , but rather tenderly
she would take off her last dress , sell it , go barefoot , and give it to you , if you needed it ; that ’ s the sort of person she is !
vasily ivanovich gave him his word not to disturb him , all the more so since arina vlasevna , from whom he would naturally concealed everything , had begun to pester him , wanting to know why he could not sleep and what was wrong with him
there are many young women just like her nowadays
what do we need all these abstractions for ?
dunechka paused on the threshold , not understanding why she was being invited to look , but svidrigaylov hastened to provide an explanation :
speaking of his blindness as a disease is a metaphor , but so is bazarov 's sickness in the novel : the great proponent of the concept that men are no more than the sum of the cells and chemicals of their physical bodies is himself brought down by an illness contracted from his dissection of a corpse , ie
what sort of strong opinion ?
it wasn ’ t the depravity
i ’ m willing to give you more time to reflect
what the hell , git in !
like a nervous woman or the plant touch-me not , turgenev shrinks from the slightest contact with the bouquet of bazarovism
the woman in the cap disappeared at once
last time i gave you two rubles for that ring , but you can buy a new one at the jeweler ’ s for a ruble and a half
it was conceived on sleepless nights and in a state of ecstasy , with much racing and pounding of the heart , with suppressed enthusiasm
in general , in russian society , those with the best manners are those who have been beaten—did you ever notice that ?
i ’ m sure that he was the cause of marfa petrovna ’ s death
no , i haven ’ t said a word to her , and i ’ m not even sure she ’ s home now
stop it , i beg you
but does he really , really not love us ?
they spoke about a doctor and a priest
well , yes , that ’ s it !
here are your rooms
as turgenev chose to present the matter it appears more as a social than political theme , but its motive force is just as operative
karmazinov chirruped still more sweetly
you have no facts
oh , yes , of course we do !
who in petersburg could she be receiving letters from ?
i ’ ll pay , i ’ ll be grateful , he muttered
cried dunya ; she turned deathly pale and rushed to the corner of the room , where she quickly shielded herself with the little table that was there
it 's hard to say why this was so , perhaps because she sensed bazarov 's lack of any aristocratic vestiges , any air of superiority that both attracts and repels
i will explain to her there 's nothing to be ashamed of in front of me
i was convinced of this by my own eyes , having seen him yesterday in the apartment of a certain drunkard , run over by horses , who died as a result , and whose daughter , a young woman of notorious conduct , he handed up to twenty-five rubles yesterday , on the pretext of funeral expenses , a fact that shocked me greatly , knowing the difficult circumstances under which you acquired that sum of money
would you believe that he intentionally staged that whole scene of a struggle with his friend and the laughter on the staircase , when those men were going upstairs , the caretaker and the two witnesses , precisely as a diversion
that ’ s not the point !
he remembered one voice proposing that he should be taken right to the police
it is only bazarov , in fact , who displays the slave owner 's mentality
young people today have become awfully sly , bazarov observed and also started laughing
he has a family , a wife , children , and one daughter
he ’ s wasted their lives and mine in a tavern !
he ’ s a terrible chatterbox !
is it an ideal simply through being balanced in an unbalanced age ?
upon hearing raskolnikov ’ s strange request with distrust , sonya moved hesitantly to the table
if i am infected , it 's already too late
well , wasn ’ t i telling the truth when i said that we were both cut from the same cloth ?
all chests have that kind of key
after reaching the chair , he sat down and regarded razumikhin suspiciously
then , puffing , he bent over and began peering into the keyhole ; but the key had been inserted from inside , and therefore nothing was visible
come forth , ye drunkards , come forth , ye weaklings , come forth , ye shameless ones !
boots , the finest calico shirtfronts , and a uniform : they threw it all together splendidly for eleven and a half rubles
when my sister sonya began speaking , mama also came up and said , hurry up , polyenka
on the stairs , he remembered that he was leaving all those things just as they were in the hole behind the wallpaper
after crossing the square , he found himself in a lane
bazarov glanced at her from under his brow
i very , very much hope that my name won ’ t be mentioned in connection with this gift
but i ’ m getting all tangled up
what new principles , what new constructive answers have they provided ?
one can even say that it ’ s the only thing they subsist on
i see that , her sister replied with a laugh
so much for turgenev the writer
you ’ re mistrustful , that ’ s why you weighed every word
in deep amazement , he listened intently to the frightened porfiry petrovich , who seemed affably solicitous of him
but no , that ’ s not right either !
of sublimated eroticism ; his duel with pavel sublimates violence in a highly conventionalized ritual
well , would someone ask about residence if he ’ d come with such an intention ?
bazarov spends his afternoon in dissecting frogs
good day , evgeny vasilevich , sir , the old fellow began with a broad grin , so that his whole face was covered in wrinkles
i couldn ’ t find the right way to say it
but when he reached the bridge , he stopped , suddenly turned onto the bridge , and went toward the haymarket
she came down to the last step and stopped right in front of him , one step higher
he seems , in fact , to play the role of a caricature of the narrator and to serve as the author 's honest attempt to concede what his own values often become in practice
suddenly , at that very moment , some light , hurried footsteps could be heard not far away on the stairs
i ’ ll look in first to see if he ’ s awake
meanwhile , he stood in the reception room while people who had no interest in him at all came and went
sonya ’ s breathing became labored
it was an old , three-story green house
field after field stretched as far as the horizon , first gently ascending , then descending ; here as a matter of fact , he 's free ( french )
but after feeding him a few spoons , razumikhin suddenly stopped and announced that they would have to consult zosimov about what to do next
the reader of his novel feels that behind the mirage of external actions and scenes there flows such a profound , such an inexhaustible current of life , that all these actions and scenes , all the characters and events are insignificant in comparison to that current
turgenev 's close look is focused on meaning in image and gesture , character and action
we ’ ll start small , grow larger , and at least we ’ ll be able to feed ourselves ; in any case , we ’ ll break even
after waiting a little while , he decided to advance into the next room
there are other reasons , completely different reasons !
just like today , i was passing by—and i thought , why not pay him a little visit ?
pavel petrovich grew pale
turgenev may have indeed modelled bazarov on a young provincial doctor , as he maintained in
in addition , i ask you not to forget that your beloved brother ’ s extremely curious secret lies completely in my hands
but life 's become a burden for him more than he suspects one need only catch a glimpse of him in the russian church , where , leaning against the wall on one side , he sinks deep into thought and remains motionless for some time , his teeth clenched in bitterness , then suddenly comes to his senses and begins crossing himself almost imperceptibly
i won ’ t ever forgive myself for not letting her do it !
why , why should we allow this opportunity to get away when one of the most important resources has turned up—our own money ?
paris , april ( ) , first of all , dear afanasy afanas'evich , thank you for your letter— and my thanks would be greater if you did not consider it necessary to put on kid gloves
he began again , suddenly raising his head as if struck and aroused again by an unexpected turn of thought
he assumes as true everything asserted of his subject , and then by its self-contradiction evolves the truth
razumikhin was in a state of extraordinary excitement
she ’ s mine ! † i can do what i want with ’ er !
well , if that ’ s so , replied svidrigaylov with some surprise , scrutinizing raskolnikov , if that ’ s so , then you yourself are a considerable cynic
it can be argued that one of the characteristics of great literature is that not everything can be made to fit any theoretical grid
folks come to me for advice—i ca not chase them away
i wouldn ’ t spit on it at all , but i would protest
he asked , barely audibly
order visibly reigned in the house : everything was clean , there was a kind of decorous scent everywhere , as in ministerial receiving rooms ( viii , [ p ] )
he answers in a bass voice and with such a pompous expression , as if the entire universe were observing him at that very moment
take me along , too , lads !
can one really talk the way she does ?
he was a bearded young man wearing a caftan who resembled a member of some guild
he has shown us how these forces are embodied in bazarov , in that same bazarov who denies them
he is broken , but not conquered
he followed from the opposite sidewalk without taking his eyes off her ; after covering about fifty paces , he crossed again to the side sonya was on , caught up with her , and followed her , staying about five paces back
about four years ago , i tried to read some geography and world history with her ; but since i myself was weak in those areas and we had no suitable textbooks , and the books we did have
on the contrary , i am sure i am right , arkady retorted
he needs to be restrained , said porfiry with a laugh
also in the house is nicolai kirsanov 's brother , paul , a retired army officer , a carefully dressed , vain , pompous , old-fashioned dandy , who had once been a minor lion in the salons of the capital , and is now living out his life in elegant and irritated boredom
and continue to recline , all clean , on velvet
she squeezed his hand
he lit the candle and examined his room more carefully
turgenev ends his novel by returning us to the world of pastoral , to the figures of baucis and philemon from ovid 's metamorphoses
day would come , and once again she was transformed into a society lady ; she would go out , laugh , chatter , and
and give me a napkin , a towel , something , quickly ; it ’ s still not clear where he ’ s been hurt
exactly so , ma ’ am , but mr svidrigaylov ’ s continual regime of persecutions and punishments compelled him or , more accurately , inclined him to his violent end
realizing that he had indeed come to , the landlady , who was peeking in from the doorway , closed it at once and hid
i said that you were afraid that he might
i have another one , a copper one ; it was lizaveta ’ s
you see how fine the weather is now ; let 's go for a ride and have a look at the town
worst of all , vanity , pride and vanity ; however , god only knows there might also be some good proclivities
is it that you ’ re following me and therefore you want me to know that ?
that world , after all , represents life 's mainstream
as far as bazarov 's concerned , please do not worry about it
he said , leaping in his direction
she had me invite you
they all clamber into mikolka ’ s cart with guffaws and wisecracks
they ’ ve brought in the prisoner , nikolai , someone ’ s voice was heard saying
i ’ ll grab zosimov , the doctor who ’ s treating him
that ’ s not completely true
why did you scream ?
have a tendency toward insanity
you boasted you were a philosopher , did not you ?
odintsov comes to say farewell to bazarov !
so , do you pray to god a great deal , sonya ?
what a thing to say !
tell them i will be there soon
after snatching the banknote from sonya , katerina ivanovna crumpled it in her hand and hurled it straight at luzhin ’ s face
so did you know that he , too , had left pledges there ?
she showed everyone dunechka ’ s handwritten letter to mr svidrigaylov , read it aloud , and even allowed people to make copies of it ( which , it seems to me , was going too far )
he thought once again about his late wife , not as he would known her through many years , not as a good , domestic housewife , but rather as a young girl with her slim figure , her innocent , inquisitive look , and her tightly knotted braid over her slender , childish neck
he invited kirsanov and bazarov to the ball and a few minutes later invited them again , taking them for brothers and referring to them as the kaisarovs
we ’ ve tormented you enough ; i don ’ t want to do so anymore !
but why are you being so underhanded now when you say , 'it 's a fine thing you do'—as if i did not know your views on marriage ?
the landlady was peering in from the half-opened door
take it to him tomorrow or
i ’ m too weak and will topple over any minute
and if they were to denounce him , then what for , exactly ?
why do you say very much ?
i can assure you that all this seriously interferes with my recovery , because it constantly irritates me
after an abrupt , fitful burst of laughter , raskolnikov suddenly became thoughtful and glum
that shows what i get for being tactful
there they are—our heirs !
he rushed to the little window
she was a small , dried-up miserable old woman , about sixty years old , with piercing , malicious little eyes , a small sharp nose , and her bare head
while all i know about myself is i am very unhappy
an exclusive military school in petersburg that enjoyed the tsar 's patronage
( several times during the last few days , raskolnikov had recalled fleetingly , in snatches , that scene with porfiry ; he couldn ’ t bear thinking about it as a whole )
exclaimed the student and burst into laughter
my board , raskolnikov stated loudly and distinctly
and how does it happen that you know my name ?
lives in a house that burns down every five years
he merely waited for a pretext to attack his enemy ; but for a long time no pretext presented itself
the hegelian dialectic explains the movement to overcome basic oppositions and dichotomies
all this is merely a phantom
father and son went onto the terrace under the awning ; next to the railing on the table , between large bouquets of lilacs , a samovar was already bubbling
he had never imagined that he would awake in such a state
that same morning , without tarrying , she set off right from our house to all the households in town , and in each one , shedding tears , she restored dunya ’ s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and behavior in the most flattering terms
anna sergeevna made an impatient movement
they were standing there waiting for something
and they were so pleased with him !
she was wearing her shabby old cape and her green shawl
arkady is capable of acting
it ’ s either me or luzhin
for a long time , sonya had grown accustomed to thinking the room was uninhabited
and really get to know each other well , agreed porfiry petrovich
later , after he 's grown used to me , arkady said indulgently , and the two friends left
he was not yet able to express it all , but he was trembling as if in a fever , as if a great weight had been lifted from his chest
where are you going ?
in any case i very much want there to be no misunderstandings about my intentions
i guess i thought it seemed too dark or too cold , hee-hee !
he himself said to me a while ago : take care of my sister
muttered porfiry , listening at the door
but the critics found it necessary to present me as a humiliated pamphleteer : leur siège était fait —and even this year i could read the following lines in appendix # to the cosmos ( p ) : finally everyone knows that the pedestal on which mr turgenev stood was destroyed chiefly by dobrolyubov and later ( p ) my bitterness is mentioned , which the critic , however , understands—
she said , sorting through the flowers with her fingers
of course , you know that already ; and i myself know that he came to see you afterward ; but what you supposed then didn ’ t really happen : i hadn ’ t sent for anybody and hadn ’ t made any arrangements at the time
why did he come here ?
for some people , it 's good ; for others , it 's not
let it depend on me
well , of course , he ’ s spinning an old wives ’ tale , lying like a dog , because i know this dushkin
ah , mama , how can he answer all these questions all of a sudden ?
time passes in strenuous efforts to puzzle out the vital enigma ; the intellect labors alongside the passions ; heavy , torturous sensations appear ; the whole romance of the relationship between a man and a woman takes on the strange character of a struggle
a ruble and a half !
dunechka ’ s eyes grew clear , and pulkheriya aleksandrovna even looked kindly at sonya
which way to your room ?
a reference to marie antoinette ( – ) , who was imprisoned in and executed the following year
the only sound was that of her intermittent sobbing
bazarov has emerged from this examination as a pure and a strong man
he was approaching the third floor
if you ’ re in complete control of your faculties , sir , i have thirty-five rubles to transfer to you , sir , since semyon semyonovich has received instructions from afanasy ivanovich , as he had previously , at your mother ’ s request
raskolnikov entered through the door again
and mama , why ’ s she splurging anyway ?
i ’ ve been here before , do you remember ?
go on , be witty !
as for wounded egoism , i will only note that dobrolyubov 's article about my last work before fathers and sons—
it 's true , there 's no shade , nikolai petrovich replied , wiping his brow
certain generalizations so reluctantly used by the adepts of our nihilism , which they flee and fear as the devil fears holy water , were nevertheless present at the conception of their theories
you really do have a poor opinion of russians
poison , pure poison , but i can ’ t stop !
that ’ s definitely the case
he quickly climbed the stairs , entered his unlocked room , and immediately fastened the door with the hook
the murderer was upstairs when kokh and pestryakov knocked , standing behind the locked door
i see that our shooting lessons in the country , which i had the honor of giving you , were not wasted
the body was there for so long
wrote chekhov on rereading the story called the dog
what will you say tomorrow ?
a painful feeling gripped his heart ; he stopped in the middle of the street and began looking around : what road was he on and how far had he come ?
razumikhin asked , suddenly turning to him
this is the final goal of our efforts !
it is at such moments , the narrator tells us , that odintseva thinks of life 's worthlessness and sorrow—but she is immediately checked in her thoughts by a cold draft from a half-open window
about certain extremely , extremely important matters
you , and you alone !
i did love you !
nastasya looked him over somewhat strangely
all last night your sister was talking in her sleep and kept mentioning you
odintseva and turgenev 's narrator manage , in this scene , both to observe propriety and to suggest its violation ; both point to an erotic imagination that was , in turgenev 's day , far more heavily veiled than in ours
along the way , one question troubled him especially : had svidrigaylov been to see porfiry ?
can ’ t i go with you ?
he apparently submits to every passing influence ; he is the most ordinary of mortals
well , good-bye for now
bazarov raised his eyes and looked at odintsova
running at full speed , she stumbled and fell
the author sees that bazarov loves no one , because around him all is petty , stupid , and flabby , while he himself is fresh , intelligent , and strong ; the author sees this and , in his mind , relieves his hero of the last undeserved reproach
that ’ s just what i was afraid of , that you wouldn ’ t need our reduction
she ’ s a good woman , very kind
does pavel petrovich believe or not ?
some sort of peculiar sadness had begun to manifest itself in him lately
turgenev did not grow fond of bazarov , but he acknowledged his strength and his superiority and offered him a full tribute of respect
that doesn ’ t matter , sir , replied porfiry petrovich , receiving this explanation of raskolnikov ’ s finances coldly
the troika of horses rushed on ahead , the driver whooping and whistling at them
passion that resembled malice and was perhaps even related to it
how could you keep from fainting ?
excuse me for being late to tea ; i will be right back
not for anything in the world would he have gone back now to the chest or even entered that room
but then , glancing into the kitchen and catching sight of a bucket half full of water sitting on a bench , he decided to rinse off his hands and the axe
vasily ivanovich accompanied italy 's struggle for independence from austria and for national unification was frequently discussed in the russian press during the s
she loves music , but does not believe in romantic love songs ( [ ] )
and just who are you ?
nor did his sense of multivalent truth and personal liberalism blind him to the indispensable role of conflict in the life of the individual and society
apparently bazarov , who so easily meets people , takes such lively interest in them , and so easily begins to feel rancor toward them , suffers more from that rancor than those for whom it is destined
i see you have made some changes in here , he added , casting a quick glance around , his eyes gliding past fenechka 's face
her slightly narrow shoulders she was constantly blushing and hastily catching her breath
some kind of insatiable compassion , if it ’ s possible to express it like that , was suddenly reflected in all the features of her face
everything went flying and splintering
it is not a difficult thing to write a novel with a progressive or reactionary tendency
one of the convicts , accompanied by a guard , went off to the fortress to fetch a certain tool ; another began to split firewood and load the kiln
i will be prepared to agree with you later , he said standing up , when you present me with a single institution of contemporary life , the kalmucks ( or kalmyks ) were an asian people and a branch of the mongols
( because some benefactors very much like to show off their charity ; i know this )
the weather that morning was rainy , so there was no possibility of an outing
raskolnikov was laughing so hard that it seemed he could scarcely restrain himself , so they entered porfiry petrovich ’ s apartment with laughter
raskolnikov was an active and bold advocate for sonya against luzhin , in spite of the fact that he carried so much of his own distress and suffering in his soul
suddenly , in her last letter , sonya wrote that he had fallen very ill and was in the convicts ’ ward in the hospital
he realized that this was the best tactic in his situation because then he wouldn ’ t say anything he ’ d regret later ; on the contrary , he ’ d irritate his foe with his silence and perhaps porfiry might even say something he ’ d come to regret later
what do you mean , why ?
you almost convinced him all over again of that hideous nonsense and then , all of a sudden—you stuck out your tongue at him : aha , you said , so there !
but go now and stay with our mother
in the present paper , i propose first of all to follow brown 's and thanet 's lead by examining ottsy i deti in light of the hegelian dialectic and then to speculate on the actual source and significance of the dialectic patterns to be observed in turgenev 's novel
how did i dare part with those twenty kopecks ?
she had approached almost silently and sat down alongside him
then again , the air here 's so fresh !
he goes to the country to see odintsov , with curiosity and without the slightest fear , because he wants to have a closer look at this pretty woman , wants to be with her and to spend a few days pleasantly
what a daring lady !
perhaps the difference between generations has never been as great as it is at the present , and therefore their relationship too appears to be particularly acute
it wo not be long before bazarov undertakes a second round of visits to the kirsanov estate at marino and odintsova 's manor house at nikolskoe , and then returns home in despair , to join his father in his palliative measures , in which pursuit the hero ultimately loses ( sacrifices ? )
squinting , he looked at him very seriously
what do you need them for , katerina ivanovna ?
now let 's go have tea
however , she probably is
when she appeared at their work sites , going to see raskolnikov , or when she happened to meet a group of convicts on their way to work , they all doffed their caps and bowed to her : little mother , sofiya semyonovna , you ’ re our mother , dear and tender little mother !
he didn ’ t have the slightest idea , and he didn ’ t want to think about it
what good 's that logic ?
perhaps you should thank god ; how do you know ?
do you know svidrigaylov ?
yes , covered in blood
you also have the sort of sister who would sell herself into slavery for her brother
and you , nastenka , look in on him more often in my absence , to see if he wants something more to drink or anything else
i ’ m so angry and annoyed that in explaining the system i mentioned to you prematurely these natural necessities !
there was a window on the first floor ; moonlight was shining through the glass mournfully and mysteriously ; here ’ s the second floor
take her , brother , take her
i should have gone into petrovsky park !
now i want to sleep
i myself told you recently that i was leaving , andrey semyonovich , while you were still trying to detain me ; now i ’ ll add simply that you ’ re a fool , sir
which one we are to value more highly remains entirely unclear
so much for your funeral feast !
i offered to assist as best i could with the young girl ’ s education , arranging french and dancing lessons
please—perhaps you ’ re in a hurry—be so kind as to give me a few moments of your time
it 's not what he says , but the way he looks at me
he made no reply
and arkady told him the story of his uncle
this woman 's kingdom participates in turgenev 's allegorical topography as a world submitted to an authority that is absolute even in absence of its central figure : a husband who was old enough to be odintseva 's father
the novel appeared exactly a century and a quarter ago , and it was appropriate that its contemporary readers should have taken as central what was most topical in it : nihilism ( defined in dahl 's dictionary as a monstrous and immoral teaching that rejects everything that can not be palpated ) , together with the revolutionary temperament of bazarov
he speaks , moreover , of the continuity of generations not only for the future but from the past ; in stanza he writes of the oak tree which will outlive his age as it has outlived those of his fathers
it was as if she still didn ’ t understand
you ’ re not amal-ivan , but amaliya lyudvigovna , and since i don ’ t belong to the group of your vile flatterers , like mr lebezya­tnikov , who ’ s now laughing behind the door—the sound of laughter was coming from behind the door , as well as shouts of they ’ re squabbling ! —then i will always call you amaliya lyudvigovna , though i really can ’ t understand why you don ’ t like that name
she was placed on the granite blocks of the stairs
i do not want you to draw the conclusion from that that i am a courageous fellow
bazarov would get up very early and head off two or three miles , not for a stroll—he could not stand strolls without a purpose— but to collect grasses and insects
there is not a single clear trait in him and the only good thing is that he is a man , though a very simple man
at the time , i didn ’ t tell marfa petrovna
pavel petrovich burned with impatience ; at last his wishes were fulfilled
you ’ ll do ’ er in !
of course , there are enthusiasms , inaccuracies , but one must be indulgent : enthusiasms bear witness to their fervor for action and to incorrect external circumstances in which the matter is placed
why did i consciously assume all these torments ?
now it ’ s the kingdom of reason and light , and
if that desire appears as rancor , that rancor only represents the reverse of love
but only a poet would exploit light imagery as bazarov does in his final speech : he says to odincova , be good to my parents , you will not find any like them in your world even if you look by daylight with a candle
that ’ s the degree to which some young women feel a passion for propaganda !
he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart , as if not thinking about his words or weighing them
sonya asked , feeling extremely frightened
and as for socks and the remaining items , i leave that to you ; we still have twenty-five rubles , and don ’ t you worry about paying pashenka the rent for the apartment ; i told her your credit was limitless
he felt so confused and bewildered that when he got there he threw himself on the sofa ; he sat for a quarter of an hour merely resting , trying somehow or other to collect his thoughts
of any sort of faith or conviction , even artistic conviction , among the younger french writers he was encountering in paris
sonya , i have a wicked heart , take note of that : that can explain a great deal
well , now he ’ s come around !
i am not at all surprised , pavel petrovich replied
do you know what i am thinking ?
there you have tendentiousness !
well , some of us who ’ ve just begun to practice medicine come to love our first patients as if they were our own children ; some of them almost fall in love with them
to some of his comrades it seemed that he regarded them , everyone , from on high , as children , as if he ’ d surpassed them in his development , knowledge , and convictions , and regarded their convictions and interests as beneath him
no , you can be honest with me ; don ’ t be shy ; speak as if we were alone !
nikolai 's great love , marya ( née pre-polovenskaya ) , in whose honor the estate at marino is named , was the julia kristeva , women 's time , in the kristeva reader , ed
i feel sorry for papa !
in addition , she knew about his vanity , arrogance , self-esteem , and lack of faith
no one saw him , replied razumikhin with annoyance
a piece of meat 's better than a piece of bread , even from the chemical point of view
bazarov 's voice rang out from the coach
everyone rejoiced , and within five minutes they were all laughing
mikolka ’ s so furious that he can ’ t finish her off with one blow
above all , one must do one 's duty so , you want the horses sent on ?
no , you wait ; i ’ ll pose a question to you
it wo not be easy
he lets it happen to other people
yet actually something of a demonic order does emerge in turgenev 's work , that is , a figure rich in force , though that force is not pure
the building ’ s as crowded as noah ’ s ark , the head clerk observed , overhearing the conversation from where he sat
then it turns out , once more , of course , that you have to keep yourself clean
and he starts to amass what he needs for his campaign
well , if you like , i ’ ll prove to you at once , he roared , that you have white eyelashes only as a result of the fact that ivan the great ’ s bell tower is two hundred and fifty feet tall , and i ’ ll prove it clearly , precisely , progressively , and even with a liberal cast
at first vasily ivanovich was overjoyed by this change , but his joy was short-lived
you can be as indignant as you please with people like bazarov , but you absolutely must acknowledge their sincerity
you ’ re not worth her little finger , all of you , all , all , all of you !
( he was , apparently , in an excellent mood and even a little bit overexcited )
it entails a shift from scenes and formulations essentially intellectual to others that are more ruminative , inwardly speculative , communicating psychological states and feelings rather than ideas
i was lying there at the time
well , and how was i behaving toward you just a little while ago ( that is , as the examining magistrate ) , when i prompted you and offered you all the means for your defense , providing all that psychology : illness , i said , delirium , insults ; melancholy and policemen , and all the rest ?
that ’ s really why i ’ ve come
besides that , you were interested in your sock , very much so !
in , the austrian army , commanded by general mack , surrendered to napoleon
precisely so , ma ’ am ; of course , not without some purpose , taking into account the hastiness of his departure and , in general , the previous circumstances
but it was only when i started to imagine that
but now—it ’ s insolent and careless !
allen calls the latter group realists ( in a narrow and specific sense ; as distinguished from realists in a broader sense )
anna sergeevna gave an involuntary shudder
dunya ’ s eyes shone with fury
let 's go see my sister ; she 's out in the garden ; she will be very glad to see you
and he had agreed with sonya at the time , agreed himself , agreed in his heart , that he could no longer go on living alone with this thing in his soul !
they determined to wait and endure
are they dead to the world or did someone strangle them ?
by the way , just about the same time , his brother became an officer in a guards regiment
that is , not to
he would sooner admit to only the heavy burden of instinct , which he was unable to breach and which he once more lacked the strength to surmount ( due to his weakness and insignificance )
svidrigaylov shouted in horror , raising his hand as if to strike her
we may have plenty of ideas , he said , turning to petr petrovich , and a desire for the good , though it ’ s childlike
who are you , and why did you come here ?
in fact , cyclical time is the only mode that the author credits—
that ’ s it , isn ’ t it ?
take that poor katya—did you see her ?
well , it ’ s not bad as a little theory ; une théorie comme une autre
why , i understand your spiritual state , that is , at that time
a young girl appeared , the one who would been the first to greet the travelers on the porch the night before
i ask you , really !
we are not karl v and do not wish to be buried alive
the characters surrounding bazarov unconsciously feel the living man in him
somewhere there , almost at the end of the prospect , he noticed , recently having passed by , a large wooden hotel , the name of which , as best he recalled , was something like the adrianople
trust me in this matter and believe that i can reach an unbiased conclusion
svidrigaylov sat down on the sofa , about eight paces away from dunya
i have already told you i am a future district doctor
tell me , sir , do you feel sorry or not ?
while there is only a limited amount of evidence to go on , it seems clear to me that marya participates in what kristeva calls cyclical time : she is connected to themes of nature through her garden and to gestation through the birth of her child
she ’ s a fool , he said aloud
when he read this note , his heart started beating violently and painfully
he muttered and rushed into the entrance hall
he told me all about you
to establish her identity , she needed a cause or a path , rather than just a man
he shouted , pushing to the front of the crowd
pulkheriya aleksandrovna exchanged glances with dunechka and razumikhin
in any case , dunya clearly saw that pulkheriya aleksandrovna was not in her right mind
classical , replied arkady in the same tone of voice
that ’ s how rich we are !
at last everyone was seated
dunya went up to the table to take the key
but the sage replied , how in 'ell should i know—versts ai not counted 'ereabouts ,
you don ’ t even believe , she whispered quietly , almost gasping for breath
you said , 'russia will attain perfection when the poorest peasant has a house like that and each one of us should help bring that about
have they fed the children ?
it 's that signor , that nihilist who 's been stuffing his head full of these things
but turgenev hardly even skirts these failings , and he is never mediocre ; his texture is as distinguished as his temperament
there 's absolutely no need for you to insult me
you ’ re talking about that young woman !
but her loosened hair , her fair blond hair , was wet ; a garland of roses was on her head
so that ’ s how it is !
this gentleman was about thirty , stout , plump , hale and hearty , with pink lips , a little mustache , and very foppishly dressed
raskolnikov sat there , as if not paying any attention , in deep thought and with a strange smile on his pale lips
i ordered it now to fortify myself because i plan to go somewhere , and you see me in a peculiar frame of mind
but he knows everything
she sat next to her son as before ( she did not play cards ) , resting her cheek on her little fist as before , and stood up only to arrange for some new delicacy to be served
to be precise , bazarov had not gone home in three years
you ’ ve hardly had anything to eat or drink in the last three days
i especially wish you good health
remember how you used to argue with him all the time ?
i ’ m a neighbor , sir
i love it when they tell lies !
did you ever suspect it ?
is it physics you are studying ?
oh , enough of that !
it ’ s a fever , he replied abruptly
thus even where there is no comic element , no parody , no irony and so forth , where there is no narrator , no posited author or narrating character , speech diversity and language stratification still serve as the basis for style in the novel
it 's terrible for me to have to say this to you ; but it 's even more terrible to it 's forever , evgeny just think what that would be like
all around , of course , laughter resounded
they ’ d think i done it
she asked in a weak voice
to his question , would i seat sofiya semyonovna next to my sister ?
would you like something to eat ?
bazarov said , dragging out his words
svidrigaylov asked suddenly in alarm
i fainted then because it was stuffy and smelled of oil paint , said raskolnikov
i just have a foreboding , dunya
but there were also some people who were not drunk ; they came in from the other rooms and gathered together
agafokleya kuzminishna followed soon afterward : she could not get used to the dull life in the capital—she was consumed by the ennui of retirement
he praises turgenev as a great poet—time can never take away the beauty of his language and the poetry in his work—but finds his vision weak and narrow
in fact , shreds of the fringe he had cut off his trousers were lying there on the floor in the middle of the room , so that the first person who came in would notice them !
raskolnikov began to say
it ’ s separate , on its own , and doesn ’ t connect with any other rooms ; it ’ s three small furnished rooms , and the rent is modest
tell me the whole truth !
i do not doubt we are determined to annihilate each other ; but why not laugh and combine utile with dulci ?
yes , all my capital , he replied firmly , after a slight pause
she jumped up and , trembling , looked at him
but at that very moment he woke up
phew , the devil take him
the real cause of all this newness was the feeling in bazarov inspired by odintsova—a feeling that tormented and enraged him , one that he would have denied immediately with scornful laughter and cynical abuse , had anyone ever remotely suggested the possibility of what was actually taking place
you never said that !
we talked about this many times
let ’ s suppose that he , that is , this man , our special case , sir , this incognito , sir , will lie brilliantly , in the cleverest way ; this might seem to be a triumph , and he could enjoy the fruits of his wit , but , all of a sudden , bang , he falls into a faint in the most interesting and scandalous place
at the end of the novel , she is living in heidelberg , locked into an endless pursuit of some new telos , studying architecture , yet still hobnobbing with students , especially young russian devotees of the natural sciences ( just like bazarov )
i notice that you ’ ve begun listening very attentively
we ’ ll see if there ’ s truth to be had on this earth
it played this role not only because of its idyllic prophecies but because of its reply to the affirmation in fathers and sons of love and continuity between generations
it ’ s not a good idea to remind women about such little things
i ’ d consider myself fortunate if you , pulkheriya aleksandrovna , could convince me of the opposite view and thus set my mind at ease considerably
paris , march ( ) , dear fedor mikhailovich :
arkady nikolaich , vasily ivanych prompted her solemnly in a loud whisper
i am all they have
i ’ d be interested in knowing how you would now resolve one question , as lebezyatnikov says
it is not secenov as a kind of urfigur for bazarov , but rather secenov 's language of facts that is significant for understanding turgenev 's novelistic practice
kind we ourselves possess ?
so , what of it ?
how come he does not ask me why i am leaving , and just as suddenly as he is ?
this is only my third day in town
hello , fenechka , he muttered through his teeth
why did you come then ?
but you are free to
what , is it really starting , is this the punishment beginning ?
how old 's your father ?
amaliya ivanovna , when the glass had hit her amidst sounds of loud laughter from those present , had also been unable to stand being made a scapegoat
do you not yourself realize that he is the most sympathetic of all my characters ?
in honor of your arrival , my dear
he found arkady at the writing table with a book in his hands , his jacket buttoned up to his neck
she brought him some tea and bread
asked pulkheriya aleksandrovna , almost in tears
i could ’ ve reached that conclusion
you say that they ’ ve even invited me ?
so , you have decided to teach me a lesson , have you ?
she ’ s lost her mind !
as a matter of fact , at the same time they very often fail to notice the genuinely new people , § and even despise them as backward and incapable of higher thinking
while in ventnor , in august , we know that turgenev conceived his greatest hero , bazarov
much we need nihilists !
the constantly flustered and anxious-to-please sitnikov 's eyes are small and seemed squeezed in a fixed and uneasy look
pavel petrovich said , glancing around
no , she won ’ t endure it ; such people are unable to endure something like this !
ah , what a nitwit !
she ’ s wearing red calico , a headdress trimmed with beads , and fur slippers ; she ’ s cracking nuts and cackling
and it makes me feel guilty to shut myself away from him
he felt neither pain nor shame he would never even allow the possibility of comparison between his wife and fenechka , but regretted that she would come to look for him
said pulkheriya aleksandrovna , touched
you keep laughing ; allow me to observe that it ’ s not very appropriate
everyone saw : i ’ m just repeating what everyone else says
but how is it that arkady nikolaevich told us just now you do not acknowledge any authorities ?
sitting next to bazarov in the coach , arkady squeezed his hand warmly and for a long time said nothing
i could deny you that pleasure , but—so be it !
you see , sonya , i decided that perhaps it ’ d be more advantageous this way
even though this matter was conducted without your advice , you probably won ’ t bear any grudge either against me or your sister , since you yourself will see , from the facts , that it was impossible to delay or wait for your answer to arrive
the worst service that turgenev rendered bazarov consists in his having punished him with typhus because he did not know how to come to terms with him
a strange idea had emerged in his head , like a baby chick pecking its way out of its egg , and it interested him greatly
personality , my dear sir , that 's the main thing ; human personality must be solid as a rock because everything 's built upon it
did i tie the bandage too tight around your leg ?
but with unnatural strength he managed to lean on his arm
dmitry prokofich will help us prepare for the journey
but who ’ s to say that she hasn ’ t already lost her mind ?
i won ’ t allow you to torment me !
you could have dreamt all this raving in your sleep , and that ’ s all there is to it , sir !
this feeling , an involuntary antipathy toward this tenor of thought , he presented to the reading public in a specimen as ungraceful as possible
because as i stated to you before , i consider myself obligated to provide an explanation
that ’ s what dunya wants to arrange and i agree with her completely
lebezya­tnikov cried passionately , regarding him severely with his shortsighted little eyes
they would console her , humor her ( she herself , perhaps , clearly saw that they were humoring her and merely consoling her ) , but still she talked
and pangs of conscience ?
and yet silence on the first as on the second question has , it seems to me , its reason in realistic basis
i want you to !
it ’ s as if i ’ m looking at you from a thousand miles away
what was to become of fenechka ?
vasily ivanovich 's voice rang out at that very moment , and the old army doctor appeared before the young men , dressed in a homemade linen jacket , wearing a homemade straw hat
dostoevsky called kukshina that progressive louse which turgenev combed out of russian reality
buried beneath the ground has finally come to terms with permanent reality
i am very glad , he began , and grateful you have decided to visit us ; i hope that
when did you find time for that ?
but he recalled their last visit , the chilly reception , his previous awkwardness , and was overcome by timidity
but pavel is dead anyway , and we can say that this novel has two deaths
in general it 's not worth missing people , especially me
the old witch stays at home all year , mopes around , her feet ache , and now , all of a sudden , she picks up and goes out for a stroll !
but to what degree ?
she wasn ’ t in her right mind when she said it ; she was agitated , sick , and the children were crying because they hadn ’ t eaten , and she said it more as an insult than as what she really meant
i was one of the first to learn , and i even came to tell you that arkady ivanovich svidrigaylov , not long after his spouse ’ s funeral , set off at once for petersburg
he regarded raskolnikov out of the corner of his eye , in part with indignation : his apparel was too disgraceful and , in spite of all his wretchedness , his behavior didn ’ t fit his dress ; raskolnikov , with a lack of care , stared at him so directly and for so long that the officer felt offended
at long last , a firm knock on the door roused him
moreover , pushkin 's poetry is an important presence in fathers and sons : as a thematic element , as an emotional vector , as an emblem for the existence of beauty
i have just had a splendid idea
at least , that was the way he understood it
bazarov merely inhaled on his pipe
he silently opened the door of the carriage and unfastened the apron of the coach
showing it to father aleksei , he constantly repeated , just look at those roots !
the light wheels came closer and closer ; now he could even hear horses snorting vasily ivanovich jumped up and rushed to the small window
little lidochka cried out , rushed to polyenka , hugged her , and started trembling all over
arina vlasevna did not go to bed either ; leaving the door to the study slightly open , she kept going in to see how enyusha was breathing and to have a look at vasily ivanovich
what kind of woman can he love ?
are you a student ?
he asked in somewhat of a rude manner
everyone was suddenly quiet
after waiting a little while , he added , why would not you ?
and kept talking about a march across the alps
there 's a little village graveyard in one remote corner of russia
he said , looking at sonya and laughing
it all began with his expressing a desire through her that he wished to make our acquaintance ; he was received properly , had some coffee , and the next day sent a letter in which he very politely stated his proposal and asked for a swift and definitive answer
men will never penetrate deeper than that
now , one more thing : did anyone see nikolai at the time that kokh and pestryakov were heading upstairs ?
in an important essay entitled women 's time julia kristeva describes three concepts of temporality , the first two of which , she argues , are related to female subjectivity
petr petrovich immediately took heart
if a worker found pleasure in spending his free time lying on his back and gazing at the walls and ceiling of his workshop , then every sensible man would say to him : gaze on , dear friend , stare as much as you please , it wo not harm your health but do not you spend your working hours staring or you will make mistakes
i stopped by and your room was wide open ; i looked around , waited a bit , and didn ’ t even tell your servant—then i left
i can give you a ride
so there must also be blood in my pocket , because i shoved the damp purse into it !
we physiologists understand all that
that raskolnikov ’ s a rascal !
he shuddered with delight
at last he tore himself away
yet your search for bazarov—the real one—
continued porfiry petrovich , examining his room
he does not fall in love with her suddenly ; he does not yield to passion , as bazarov does , nor to a fascination with the mysterious and romantic , as pavel petrovich once yielded to his sphinx , the elusive princess r
she roared with laughter
back to the hospital
a guard managed to come between him and his would-be murderer just in time—or else blood would have been shed
he is not a hateful being who repels through his shortcomings ; on the contrary , his gloomy figure is grandiose and attractive
this is hardly surprising , since turgenev is in fact doing what seem to be contradictory things within the work
however , here ’ s what i ’ ll add : you can judge for yourself how base or honest i am !
i ’ m so grateful to you , sir , and these orphans , sir , and my late mother , sonya said hurriedly
do you know , rodion romanych , what the word suffering ’ means for some of these people ?
they do not pay their quitrent
that worthless general will lose his job , you ’ ll see !
he didn ’ t even know that a new life would not be granted to him for nothing , that he still had to pay a great deal for it , to purchase it with some great future deed
you have to have permission to play a barrel organ ; but you ’ re doing this on your own and gathering a crowd of people
are you really such a dissembler ?
anna sergeevna did not like visiting the place ever since she would seen a grass snake there ; but katya came often to sit on a large stone bench under one of the niches
pulkheriya aleksandrovna started to say , giving razumikhin ’ s hands another squeeze , but raskolnikov interrupted her again
ah… he said , indicating her with unease
zat iss how it iss pleeze
the younger lad said enthusiastically
arkady cast a quick glance at his father
where had he gone ?
nevertheless , one must encourage it all—english washstands , that 's real progress !
since chekhov equally stresses both the existence-and-worth of the human potential and the inevitability of its non-realization , he can be sharply and equally distinguished on the diachronic axis from two groups of authors : ( a ) his predecessors ( and many contemporaries ) in literature and drama , who share with him only the high valuation of human potential , and ( b ) his successors ( notably the absurd playwrights and authors ) , who share with him only the sense of its inevitable non-realization
her image , an incomprehensible , almost meaningless , but enchanting image , had penetrated his soul too deeply
sometimes it ’ s even boring
arkady 's response to this comment , as to all that follows , is denial :
with a part in your hair , rings on your fingers—you ’ re a wealthy man !
nature isn ’ t taken into account ; nature ’ s banished ; nature ’ s not allowed !
but can he really be intervening on his brother 's behalf ?
and why were you ringing the doorbell ?
if he ’ d wanted to consider it for a while , then of course he ’ d be astounded at how he was able to speak to them that way just a minute ago , and even impose his own feelings on them
but he still resolved to remain silent and not utter one word until it was time
do you happen to know him ?
wait a bit , we will remake you
two months ago i had the pleasure of reading it in periodical discourses
thanks to the governing senate !
complete silence reigned in the room
he himself had even started to converse with them , and they ’ d replied to him politely
i have been certain of that since our first meeting
he offers you ten thousand , and he himself says that he ’ s not rich
some regard pleasure as a final goal ; others are compelled to acknowledge pleasure as a very important source of the strength necessary for work
it smells so good !
wouldn ’ t you like a drive ?
katerina ivanovna heard sonya out pretentiously and , with the same pretentiousness , inquired about petr petrovich ’ s health
for several long hours he kept imagining in fits that right now , without putting it off , he must go somewhere and throw it all away , get rid of it , at once , as soon as possible !
but i ’ m not a priest
you even blushed ; especially when they invited you to dinner , you blushed deeply
greater novelists are more uneven : they betray our belief with extravagances ; they bore or they fall into bathos ; they combine poetic vision with rubbish
evgeny vasilich , forgive me , but i did not ask you here to discuss textbooks
i won ’ t even mention those concerns , which you can guess
so what of it ?
only there should be a signed receipt , sir
but this proud , suppressed enthusiasm is dangerous in youth !
the magnanimous agitation of his young feelings , his nobility and purity are emphasized by the author with great finesse and are clearly depicted
because everyone has to have somewhere to go
i drink because i genuinely want to suffer !
i did it to hoodwink them
she became distracted , replied in an absentminded manner , and finally suggested they move into the main hall , where they found the princess and katya
what a task you ’ re setting , cried porfiry with an absolutely cheerful , crafty , and completely untroubled look
i have a different aim
do they know i went back to the apartment ?
knowing myself , having had a premonition about myself , how did i dare take an axe and get stained with blood ?
that means is well known—it ’ s flattery
the fact is that turgenev , evidently , looks with no great favor on his hero
don ’ t worry , rodion romanovich
why here ’ s her rodya , her precious rodya , her firstborn !
you ’ re in a government office , too , raskolnikov cried , and not only are you shouting , but you ’ re also smoking a cigarette and being impolite to all of us
perhaps a similar one also occurred between us at our first meeting ; but at that time
it ’ s the fever again !
a schiller , a russian schiller , an absolute schiller !
you don ’ t notice that , in your agitated state , you yourself blurt everything out to me and to others
could that be possible ?
his heart skipped a beat , his feet wouldn ’ t budge , and he felt rooted to the spot
svidrigaylov suddenly burst out laughing
i still hadn ’ t decided whether i would take the money or not , he said , once more as if in deep thought ; then , coming to his senses suddenly , he smiled quickly and briefly
and she can ’ t have changed that much now !
i am beginning to agree with my uncle , said arkady
one can even find integrity , in spite of all the swindlers who ’ ve turned up among us , but there ’ s still no efficacy !
let him die peacefully !
he 's looking well , sir , said the old man and grinned again , but knit his thick brows immediately
some people even reject the idea of children , like any other indication of family life
commendable ; well , sir , continue
and you , you can stop by , too , if you like
one can ’ t just
i ’ m not the one with absurd dreams
the fiery revolutionary agitator bakunin , who had just then escaped from siberia to london , was saying something of this kind : the entire rotten structure , the corrupt old world , must be razed to the ground , before something new can be built upon it ; what this is to be is not for us to say ; we are revolutionaries , our business is to demolish
his life , wasted by his pursuit of a mysterious woman , of course resembles that of so many turgenev heroes , if not of turgenev himself
pavel petrovich sees that bazarov does not allow him to predominate over himself and this arouses in him a feeling of vexation on which he seizes as a diversion amidst the profound boredom of country life
the police , for example ?
he looked at her with an indescribable expression
it is quite noteworthy that he is more russian , so to speak , than all the rest of the characters in the novel
she was very surprised that this time razumikhin was speaking about petr petrovich so cautiously , even with what seemed to be some respect
do you find it amusing ?
there must have been a great many of them ; almost the entire building had come running
it is perhaps the hardest subject of all to handle , as the reaction to the end of war and peace with its assertion of domestic permanence , and , in fathers and sons , the quick taming of arkady kirsanov prove : the world of struggle and aspiration is more interesting to contemplate than that of fixity and acceptance
everyone has to have somewhere to go
as for the flies in these sweet little houses—ugh !
he might have to give himself up to save her from taking some careless step
the protagonist is atypical , being far from already formed
raskolnikov loved these places primarily , just as he did all the nearest lanes , when he would walk the streets aimlessly
their love bursts forth like some sort of lightning , for a moment striking the reader
he tried to flee , but the entire entryway was filled with people , the door to the staircase was open , and on the landing , the staircase , and below—stood a crowd of people , side by side , everyone looking , but everyone quiet , all waiting , all silent !
yes , indeed , sitnikov replied quickly , emitting a shrill laugh
i ’ ll run to the reading room today and ask for that issue !
in her hands she held a basket filled with flowers
everyone 's well , i hope
two minutes later , nastasya returned with some soup and declared that tea would be ready shortly
even two of them , replied raskolnikov
marfa petrovna ’ s kind enough to visit me , he said , curling his mouth into a strange smile
but that 's not the point
gentlemen , we could answer , why should turgenev 's personal sensations concern you ?
this extra cleanliness costs money , do you understand ?
yes , that ’ s it , games !
raskolnikov went to the door , but she grabbed hold of him and , with a desperate glance , looked him in the eye
could it be that he was eavesdropping ?
why involve him in this ?
but enough , otherwise i too will become verbose
as soon as the door closed after her , the sick man tossed off his blanket and jumped out of bed like a madman
he was also trembling all over
ah , you are making fun she will treat us to a bottle of champagne
was run over by a careless cart as he lay sleeping in the middle of the road [ editor ]
i am to blame , she muttered aloud ,
and so , to hell with all of you , because there ’ s some sort of mystery here , some secret ; i don ’ t intend to rack my brains over your secrets
kitty learns this , and rapidly becomes wise in her prosaic love because she has absorbed these lessons from her own wonderful family , much as arkady achieves a wise happiness when he trusts the truths he absorbed from the rhythms of life at marino
do not you want to become a doctor ?
we stopped at the persian king cyrus the great¶ then , once she was older , she read some books of romantic content as well as several others , given to her by mr lebezyatnikov
therefore , porfiry had found out about the apartment only now , just now , and hadn ’ t even known about it before
he 's seen as far too generous by both sides
is it in russian ?
we ’ ll keep that in mind , young lady
bazarov , he adds , is what parents today see emerging in their sons and daughters , sisters in their brothers
she whispered hurriedly , dropping her eyes again
seeing that his attempt to accuse sonya had failed completely , he resorted directly to effrontery
everything , even his crime , even his sentence and exile , now seemed to him , on first impulse , as some sort of external , strange facts that hadn ’ t even happened to him
or is it a clever trick ?
namely , it ’ s my opinion that money must not be given directly to katerina ivanovna : it ’ s dangerous ; the evidence for that is the funeral feast planned for today
no , well , i did , only once , six years ago
raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had just stood up
but not today , please not today !
that ’ s why i wanted you to come with me yesterday , because you ’ re all i have left
there was about an hour left before breakfast ; the dewy morning had already been replaced by the hot day
oh , yes : she ’ s talking and shouting that since everyone ’ s deserted her now , she ’ ll take the children and go out onto the street with a barrel organ ; the children will sing and dance , and she will , too ; they ’ ll collect money and go to the general ’ s window to play every day
yes , sirs , allow me to pass !
matvei ilich received arkady with the generosity—we might even say , playfulness—
a journal , my friend , is full o ’ pictures , colored ones , and they come to the local tailor ’ s every saturday , in the mail , from abroad , and they show how to dress , both for men and the same for women
i have to find that out right away , from the moment i enter , to tell by his face ; o-ther-wise
until the right time comes , i don ’ t want to say anything to anyone ; i ’ m even a little sorry that i told you
what are you doing ?
sitnikov asked whether avdotya nikitishna was at home
in the first case , you ’ re a human being ; but in the second , you ’ re only a parrot !
if you like , we ’ ll go see them—but not now
it ’ s an item
of course , he was unable and didn ’ t even want to worry about his unhealthy condition
in essence , matvei ilich had not progressed much beyond those statesmen of alexander i , who , to prepare themselves for an evening at madame svechina's—living in petersburg at the time—would read energy is the primary quality of a statesman ( french )
bazarov's—appearance , the author treated him critically objectively
i ’ ve already met with them ; i ’ ve been wasting time here for the last two days ; i recognize them , and they seem to know me
perhaps , instead of a voyage , i ’ ll get married ; they ’ re trying to find me a bride
the consequence was that in writing about literature oftener than not
yes , the germans are our teachers in this regard , bazarov replied casually
nor am i used to luxury
bazarov goes home for six weeks to settle down to work
it ’ s all the same ; two days ago
i was tempted by his money , but i swear to you , brother—i never imagined that he was such an unworthy human being
and while katerina ivanovna is a generous woman , she ’ s unjust
it ’ s clear : she wouldn ’ t sell herself on her own , for her own comfort , even to save herself from death , but she would sell herself for someone else !
she merely lifted her free left arm ever so slightly , nowhere near her face , and slowly extended it toward him , as if pushing him away
every man ’ s entitled , i hope , to defend his own person
in reply to pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s anxious and timid question concerning certain suspicions regarding his sanity , he replied with a calm and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated ; that , of course , the patient had a certain idée fixe , something indicating monomania—he , zosimov , was now pursuing this extremely interesting branch of medicine—but it must be recalled that almost up until today the patient had been delirious and
how else could it be ?
joel blair , perhaps not realizing that he was describing a dialectical pattern , has noted that the principle of composition operating in the novel is the grouping and regrouping of characters : our understanding of the novel develops as we observe the initial groups of characters dissolve and perceive the formation of new pairs
no doubt , as in so many other instances , turgenev and herzen had discussed the question of don quixote before—and disagreed
i also know two similar items , a silver cross and a little icon
you ’ ve probably questioned my landlady already
but if you don ’ t find it , then , excuse me , my dear , you ’ ll have to answer for it !
all i said to him along the way was that he resembled romeo , and
this impulse was so strong that he ’ d already stood up to carry it out
that would be vile ; in a word , it ’ s not because i
hey , friend , nature can be rectified and directed ; without that , one would drown in prejudices
on the last occasion he made public avowal of his feelings in the matter , he insisted : ' i have always been and have remained to this day a gradualist , an old-style liberal in the dynastic english sense , a man who expects reform only from above and hostile in principle to all revolutions
in notes from underground ( zapiski iz podpolia ) ( begun as a review of the novel ) , he ended :
in any case , a son has no right to judge his father ,
now , having met you personally , i ’ m even sure of this
the most important matter lay ahead—stealing an axe from the kitchen
moreover , as if on purpose , at that very moment just before him a huge load of hay was entering the gate , completely shielding him while he was walking through the gateway ; just as the cart was passing into the courtyard , he managed to slip in to its right
it was as if something strange passed between them
at times he was overcome with painfully tormenting anxiety , which even grew into panic
but in the end , a great deal began to surprise him , and he , as if unintentionally , began to notice things that he hadn ’ t even suspected before
pyaemia , bazarov repeated sternly and distinctly
the guest looked at him intently and announced imposingly :
my father 's waiting for me ; it 's impossible for me to remain here any longer
i told you , did not i : she 's a remarkable person !
the traditional explanation for the perceived lack of correspondence between turgenev 's formal education in hegelian philosophy and his literary activity is that like many other men of the s , turgenev soon rejected german idealism
such an ideal victory over him is only possible if he is dpne all justice , if he is exalted to his appropriate grandeur
in this truncation we see not only a sign of what might be called turgenev 's novel manqué ( by comparison with the dostoevskian novel which he seemed to be approaching in fathers and sons ) , but also ( though in a less extreme form ) one feature a
well , we will see how he will take care of me
razumikhin bowed in farewell and shone with pleasure
the thought suddenly occurred to him , the estate belongs entirely to her sister !
and so sickly , and
cried sonya in alarm
most likely , that ’ s part of what happened ; it ’ s clear from the letter : he seemed a bit harsh , and naïve mama let her views slip out to dunya , while she , of course , got angry and replied somewhat annoyed
someone who ’ d just come in cried , then burst out laughing
in chapter , when he has acknowledged his passion to himself , this love tortured and possessed him , for he regarded such hjalmar boyeson records turgenev as saying ( originally in the galaxy [ ] : - ) : i was once out for a walk and thinking about death
happy , ordinary families resemble each other , because nothing dramatic happens to them and so they have no story ; but unhappy families all have a story , and each story is different
she knew absolutely no one in the entire neighborhood , and there was no one to turn to
the chapter in question contains a delicately managed series of interchanges , in which nikolai petrovich speaks warmly of his future work in running the estate together with arkady ; arkady switches the subject to the beauty of the day ; nikolai petrovich , agreeing , declaims pushkin ( an indirect lyrical confession ) — only to be interrupted by bazarov 's voice asking for a match ; arkady himself then lights up to show his solidarity with bazarov , thereby excluding his father and banishing ( by polluting ) the fresh spring atmosphere
i have no strength left !
they began to accuse one another , to fight and slaughter one another
however , i ’ m convinced that only your special friendship with my poor deceased husband inspired you to keep your word
at least he wo not be hanging around here any longer , he comforted himself
he blew it out
however , there ’ s no cause for alarm : the mass of humanity hardly ever recognizes this right ; it punishes these men or hangs them ( more or less ) , and does so with absolute justification , fulfilling its conservative function , although in succeeding generations this same mass of humanity places those very same people who were executed on a pedestal and worships them ( more or less )
the nobility , with its reforms and commitment to civilization , and the radicals , with their rejection of reform and tradition , are equally right and equally wrong
vasily ivanovich took out his handkerchief and blew his nose , bending over almost to the ground
that is , the funeral feast , in spite of your mama ’ s kind invitation
he also buys up promissory notes
it couldn ’ t be that he ’ s an egoist , right , dunechka ?
god will protect her , he will !
and what turgenev said of the renewal of interest in pushkin may also be said of the rediscovery of turgenev : under the influence of the old , but not yet obsolete master
all of a sudden , he felt a convulsion and his previous , hateful , almost haughty smile appeared on his lips
in a word , dear rodya , this letter was so nobly and poignantly written that i sobbed while reading it and to this day can ’ t do so without shedding tears
he wasn ’ t thinking about anything and didn ’ t want to think ; but images arose , one after another , disconnected fragments of thoughts flashed by without beginning or ending
bazarov picked up the child , who , to both fenechka 's and dunyasha 's surprise , offered not the least resistance and showed no fear
she played very well , although her rendition was a bit stiff and dry
no , i didn ’ t see them ; in fact , i didn ’ t even notice any open apartment
what are you doing ?
how we prayed that they ’ d publish it—but they didn ’ t !
svidrigaylov went on his own way
i won ’ t go back there ; i was already sick of all that
there was a large pool
under the influence of various vague emotions , an awareness of life passing by , a desire for novelty , she would forced herself to reach a certain point , to look beyond it—
i ’ ll tell you there
there are bookish dreams here , sir , a heart that ’ s irritated by theories ; one sees decisiveness at every step , but decisiveness of a special kind—he did resolve , but as if falling off a mountain or jumping from a bell tower , and he went out to commit the crime as if unwillingly
it wasn ’ t there before
yes , andrey semyonych lebezyatnikov , an office worker in the ministry
porfiry petrovich stood there for several moments , as if lost in thought , but suddenly came back to life and waved the uninvited witnesses away
he has the means and connections ; semyon zakharovich knew him as a child
i maintain that he was inept and inexperienced , and this was probably his first endeavor !
he might even put it on for his wedding
'there is concealed approval lurking here this fellow , bazarov , definitely dominates the others and does not encounter proper resistance , and he concluded that what turgenev had done was politically dangerous
i won ’ t allow it !
she 's gone through fire and water , they used to say about her ; and a well-known local wit would add , and through copper pipes as well
you ’ ll soon see what it is for yourself , and
lord , have mercy on us sinners , he continued his prayers in a low voice
to m n katkov
when he arrived at the kapernaumovs ’ apartment , he felt a sudden weakness and fear
it ’ s all nonsense , said svidrigaylov , wetting a towel and applying it to his head
and this , in its own way , i can tell you , sir , can be a mine of information !
in fact , this is how that conspiracy took place
raskolnikov asked , serious and pale , standing in front of him in anticipation
and these , in turn , point to the psychological and social verities that secure so high place for fathers and sons in modern literature
another time he awoke before dawn lying somewhere on the ground , in the midst of bushes , and he could hardly recall how he had wound up there
he knows how to sing and dance , and , they say , he tells stories so well that people come from afar to listen
and i could have had my reasons , although you won ’ t learn them
he wanted to say something
i wo not invite you to come to marino now , nikolai petrovich once said to him ( he would given that name to the village in honor of his late wife , marya )
he asked , inquiring further
from the ceiling on a long cord hung a cage containing a short-tailed siskin ; it chirped continuously , hopping around , its cage constantly shaking and rocking : hempseeds were being scattered on the floor with a light tapping sound
it could be fired once more
forgive me for bombarding you with letters , but i wanted to forewarn you that as a result of letters i received from annenkov and the remarks of botkin to whom i read my tale here , the revisions of fathers and sons will be more extensive than i had anticipated , and will occupy me approximately two weeks , during which time you will receive a careful list of all omissions and additions
however , he looked very pale
a dispassionate and dried-up person always acts according to logical calculations ; a timid and weak person tries to deceive himself with sophistry and assure himself of the tightness of his desires and actions ; but bazarov has no need for such trickery ; he says to himself straightforwardly : this is stupid , but nevertheless , i will do what i want , and i do not want to torment myself over it
then she surveyed her guests again with pride and dignity and suddenly , with special solicitude , inquired loudly across the table of the deaf old man whether he ’ d like some more roast and had he been served some lisbon wine ?
well , what if he does ?
if someone had come into his room then , he would have jumped up and started shouting
for one whole year i fulfilled my obligation devotedly and devoutly and never touched the bottle—he pointed to the bottle—because i do have feelings
well , that ’ s just what i was afraid of !
no , the russian people is not as you imagine it to be
i tell you : she has a delectable body !
that gentleman , what ’ s his name ?
bazarov was stubbornly and morosely silent
behind it , most likely , stood a bed
listen , why are you still standing next to the doorway ?
but the thing was that as of late , even though he was almost always alone , he could in no way feel that he was alone
but no one shared his merriment ; his taciturn companion even regarded all these outbursts with hostility and distrust
identifying love with romantic love , odintsova , and the newly passionate bazarov , never understand that arkady and katya have grown to love each other
as yurii mann observed twenty-one years ago in an unusually interesting article in novy mir
now it turns out i have been left behind while he 's moved ahead , and we ca not understand each other
pardon me , pardon me , vasily ivanovich objected with a kindly grimace
why , when you are young , you can do everything—come , and go , and fetch , and you do not have to ask anyone what could be better ?
the russian people , he wrote later to another correspondent , need helpers not herders
she asked , looking at him distrustfully across the table
i vouched for you , friend , do you hear ?
give it to me to read in the morning
what if she is ?
she cried through the door , calling to anyone who could hear ; she shook the door with her hands
by the same token , over the century that separates us from herzen , it has become quite legitimate to consider still other rooms as the best ; ie , to disagree not only with herzen 's analysis of the novel , but with the assumptions that underlie it
several ribs on the right side were broken
he found it unpleasant , very unpleasant to mingle with the common folk , but he went precisely where there was the biggest crowd
svidrigaylov alarmed him particularly ; one could even say that he seemed to be obsessed with him
if someone had begun talking to him , he felt , he might spit at them or bite them
but sitnikov stopped there
when i was at school
you have not had lunch yet , have you ?
he imagined with revulsion that it might be porfiry
do you have a book for him to write in ?
what was the most tormenting of all—was that it was more of a feeling than a conscious thought or perception , a spontaneous feeling , the most tormenting of all those feelings experienced by him in his life up to this point
raskolnikov placed his right elbow on the table , rested his chin on the fingers of his right hand , and stared intently at svidrigaylov
bazarov could find nothing to say in reply to this
there were hordes of people and no lack of dancing partners ; the civilians tended to crowd along the walls , but the military men danced enthusiastically , especially one who would spent six weeks in paris , where he would learned various devil-may-care exclamations such as , zut ,
why ’ s there a cloak here ?
and that woman , his landlady , does she consider that a room ?
what he fails to perceive , of course—what the whole movement of scientism failed to perceive—was that the extension of purely intrinsic scientific laws to extrinsic considerations such as ethics or politics— was itself a metaphoric move
nikolai petrovich turned away slightly
his entire theory consists in the direct demand for action
death 's an old story , but new for each person
turgenev was upset and bewildered by the reception of his book
and now , my friend , please let me change your linen , because some illness may still be lingering in that shirt of yours
here , sit down on this chair ; so sit down !
don ’ t forget , you promised
turgenev 's description of odintseva—his narrative of her childhood , her father 's dissipation and her own resolve not to sink , impoverished , into provincial banality— are interesting and important , because they give a sense of this woman who can say to bazarov : you know , vou are the same as i am ( viii , [ p ] )
lowe sees turgenev as one of the literary giants of the nineteenth century seemingly destined for a permanent position in the pantheon of literary greats , yet with each passing year turgenev 's literary stock slips a little lower
he finally asked timidly in a weak voice
the dead turgenev , surrounded by the singing of orthodox priests whom he hated and numerous delegations from groups in whose political solvency he did not believe , carried on unconsciously the cause of his whole life , the fulfilment of his 'hannibal 's oath '
it doesn ’ t matter that i ’ m drunk now and have consumed an entire glass of wine : i ’ m telling the truth
no other tree is as light and translucent against the sky as it is
he asked abruptly , with the feeling that he was throwing himself down from a bell tower
well , brother , never mind
anna sergeevna , bazarov hastened to say , first of all , let me set your mind at ease
hey , peter , do you hear ?
someone observed in a respectable voice
the staircase was dark and narrow , a back entrance , but he knew that already , having studied it , and he liked this whole setting : in such darkness even casting a curious glance wouldn ’ t be dangerous
to top it all , the peasants began quarreling among themselves : brothers demanded the redivision of their property because their wives could not coexist under the same roof ; a fight would suddenly break out , everyone would jump to their feet , as if at a given signal , and rush to the office steps , often in a drunken state , with bruised faces , asking to see the master , demanding justice and reprisals ; an uproar and clamor would ensue , the women 's shrill shrieking mingling with the men 's cursing
well , then , let ’ s suppose he did let it slip , even though he ’ s a rational man ( so perhaps he didn ’ t let it slip at all , but intended to spell it out as early as possible ) ; but dunya , what about dunya ?
where did he sleep last night ?
i ’ ll never forgive you for having deceived me , for hiding the fact that there exists another way of organizing society in the form of a commune
it was she who had just awakened him
he grabbed the bottle in which there was still about a glass left and swallowed it in one large gulp with pleasure , as if he were putting out a fire in his breast
after recognizing the spot , he stopped , looked around , and turned to a young lad in a red shirt , who was standing there yawning near the entrance to a flour shop
the one we heard about just before , who shot himself on the petersburg side ?
quite so , quite so
sometimes an outrageous scene takes shape , yet its setting and its entire course of development are so plausible and possess such subtle , unexpected details artistically corresponding to the total picture , that the dreamer couldn ’ t possibly conceive of them while awake , even if he were an artist like pushkin or turgenev
without even checking my pulse , i can tell you i have a fever
trembling with a feverish chill , he bent over to examine the bed—there was nothing there
have you noticed that she wants everyone to think she ’ s patronizing me and doing me an honor by coming ?
i tell you , i won ’ t have it
gradually a crimson flush covered her cheeks ; but her lips did not form a smile and her dark eyes expressed confusion and some other , still unnamed feeling
isn ’ t it enough that i ’ m ill with a fever , yet i came all the same ?
will you come tomorrow ?
previously , there were some acceptable ones ; they had their—well , there was schiller , also goethe my brother here 's especially fond of them but now all they have is chemists and materialists
i ’ ll show you now that i don ’ t regard myself as highly as you probably think
he asked himself in astonishment
from under this hat , which she was wearing with a boyish tilt to one side , there peeked a thin , pale , frightened little face with a gaping mouth and eyes fixed with a look of horror
they did not talk to each other in anna sergeyevna 's presence ; katya always shrank into herself under her sister 's sharp eyes ; while arkady , as befits a man in love , could pay attention to nothing else [ but odintsova ] when near the object of his passion ; but he was happy only with katya
time passes , children are born to them , and their concern for the future becomes personalized , for it is hard— and abstractly inhuman—to pit one 's own child 's welfare against humanity 's , and these are not always in self-evident accord
razumikhin placed the acknowledgment of debt on the table
if i ’ ve acted otherwise , then i ’ m not harboring any suspicions of you !
who will say something about you ?
quietly , on tiptoe , he went into the living room ; the entire room was brightly lit by moonlight
zosimov stirred slowly and might have replied , had not razumikhin , whom no one had addressed , forestalled him immediately :
afterward , remembering this moment , raskolnikov recalled it as follows
now i am at ease about the destiny of my tale : it has done its work and i have nothing to repent for
but i knew he came to see you , and i know why he came , raskolnikov replied sharply
once he stopped and counted his money : it turned out that he had about thirty kopecks
in that case , rodion romanovich , i myself will be forced to seek a private meeting with her , which would mean upsetting her
these , together with intensity of interest in g—fov , lyubov i nigilizm , rs ( jan ) -
no more than that of a louse , a cockroach—not even that much , because the old woman ’ s harmful
he said suddenly and—came to his senses
kind sirs , pull her out !
well , then , scold me or not , get angry with me or not , but i can ’ t hold back , porfiry petrovich declared again
pulkheriya aleksandrovna was feeling particularly anxious ; everyone was anticipating something extraordinary
then , to his enormous astonishment , he suddenly recognized his landlady ’ s voice
she asked , slowly raising her enigmatic gaze to him
pavel petrovich took his place between katya and fenechka ; the husbands were seated next to their wives
i understand , i do
by the door in the entranceway to the room , in the corner against the wall , i step on a small box
but now , thank god , it seems i can send you some more ; in general , we can even boast of good fortune now about which i hasten to inform you
let 's go in , mother , really , said bazarov and led the weakened old woman into the house
and what do you think , if i told someone , he might have real doubts , the blockhead !
avdotya romanovna , luzhin said , unpleasantly surprised
at the time nobody regarded the incident from this point of view , yet it ’ s the genuinely humane one , it really is , sir
of course , arina and i did not expect this
porfiry petrovich also stood up
there ’ s one expression in the letter , you will have only yourself to blame , that puts it all very pointedly and clearly
sometimes this idea tormented him even in his dreams ; but now , as he made his way to svidrigaylov ’ s , it was the first time the idea had so clearly appeared in his consciousness
you don ’ t believe me ?
the princess loved the color yellow : she was also wearing a cap with bright yellow ribbons
what if i do ?
i thought that i might find zametov here
the staircase creaked under quick footsteps he pushed her away and let his head drop back on the pillow
i walked along the neva several times ; that i recall
perhaps the most suggestive insight ever made into fathers and sons was v e
how much do you know ?
razumikhin was in a particularly excited state as they walked to porfiry ’ s
because , my little friend , as far as i have observed , the only female freethinkers are ugly monsters
how much for this watch , alyona ivanovna ?
that just confirmed what they were all thinking !
he had just now been protesting against luzhin ’ s slander and had just acknowledged that he had seen this girl for the first time , when suddenly she herself showed up in his room
you are just as clever as she is ; and you have just as much character as she does , if not more
and apparently forever—the younger russian generation 's friendly disposition toward me
frequently they became members of the intelligentsia , usually after considerable privation
he , who had insisted more than anyone on luzhin ’ s dismissal , now seemed to be the least interested in what had occurred
his little feet were stretched out in front of him , squeezed tightly , heels together and toes turned outward
i ’ m even prepared to beg his pardon , if i ’ ve been impolite
in her own way she 's a highly moral phenomenon
it ’ s not joy i seek , only sorrow
at the canal , not far from the bridge , and not two houses away from where sonya lived , a crowd of people had gathered
mitka , too , from underneath , grabs me by the hair and starts punchin ’ me , and we ’ re fightin ’ not out of anger , but out of love , playin ’
in general and most of all , he was surprised by the terrible and insuperable abyss that separated him from all these common people
raskolnikov sat down and began searching through them : izler—izler—aztecs—aztecs—izler—bartola—massimo—aztecs—izler
sonya knew that this would pacify and reassure katerina ivanovna , flatter her , and—the main thing—her pride would be satisfied
what terrible suffering and torments some of them had endured , the tramps , for example !
the old dandy , paul kirsanov , protests against this : 'force ?
am i candid or not ?
observed the tavern keeper , with a yawn
then who fastened the hook ?
what a handsome man you have become !
hey , friend , how do you feel ?
so , you knew that old woman ?
nikolai petrovich 's coachman led out the horses
that day was particularly quiet and uneventful
he the spread of nineteenth-century popular culture among the people threatened to replace authentic folk culture
but she replied , even somewhat annoyed , that words are not the same as deeds , and of course that ’ s fair
as before she still hobnobs with students , especially young russians studying physics and chemistry , with whom heidelberg 's filled to the brim , and who , astonishing their naive german professors at first with their sober view of things , subsequently astonish those same professors with their total inactivity and absolute very distinguished ( french )
his father gave up on him and allowed him to enter the civil service
botkin , who is apparently getting better , also made several apt suggestions to me and differs with you in only one thing : he does not like anna sergeyevna much
she consumes other people ’ s lives : just the other day she bit lizaveta ’ s finger out of spite ; they almost had to amputate !
or , perhaps even three months
she was a terribly emaciated woman , thin , rather tall and elegant , with lovely dark brown hair still , and real red blotches on her cheeks
# a classical character of seventeenth-century commedia dell ’ arte that became a stock character in neapolitan puppetry
that i clearly remember
but truth above all
tanyushka , he said , turning to a barefoot girl of thirteen , wearing a bright red cotton dress , timidly peeking in at the door
it ’ s late ; it ’ s time
i am so glad to hear that
still , as bazarov makes clear , his prospects are very meager , and it leads to great bitterness
quoted from the russian in k biografii i s turgeneva , minuvshie gody ( ) : , in richard freeborn , turgenev , the novelist 's novelist ( glasgow : oxford university press , ) , p
it seems to me it 's you who have left me behind
a loud voice suddenly boomed from the doorway
his strength was aroused and now came on suddenly with the first stimulus , with the first irritating sensation , and that waned just as quickly as the sensation faded away
something ’ s not right about it
he felt as if his whole body had endured a beating ; his soul seemed confused and wretched
turning back to raskolnikov , she nodded again at the landlady and enjoyed her little attack
it was just the same yesterday
the new woman was anxious to be respected for her knowledge and not for the size of her bust or the plenitude of her skirts
you just said the word force , avdotya romanovna
cupboard doors , stared relentlessly at his son
she ’ d heard from amaliya ivanovna herself that the mother had been offended by the invitation and had posed a question : how could she possibly seat her own daughter next to that young woman ?
raskolnikov ’ s entire body jerked so violently that porfiry petrovich noticed it too well
least long enough to urge his brother to marry fenechka , a serf
with your heart , will you long for comfort ?
now i have only you , he added
she asks bazarov to open the window—but it seems her real desire is that he open her , that he disrobe her ( both literally and figuratively ) , that he forcefully cast off her chill restraint
lebezyatnikov took a step into the room
next to his grandmother ’ s grave , marked by a stone , was the small grave of his younger brother , who ’ d died at the age of six months , and whom he also hadn ’ t known and couldn ’ t remember ; but he ’ d been told that he ’ d had a younger brother , and every time he visited the cemetery , he crossed himself devoutly and respectfully over the grave , bowing and kissing it
and kokh , before he went to see the old woman , had been sitting downstairs with the silversmith for half an hour and at precisely quarter to eight went upstairs to see her
yes , i myself can see that i ’ m almost well , said raskolnikov , kissing his mother and sister affably , as a result of which pulkheriya aleksandrovna also beamed
as if she were unaware of what she was doing , she jumped up ; wringing her hands , she reached the middle of the room , but quickly returned and sat down next to him once again , her shoulder almost touching his
sofiya semyonovna and i have finally found them
he said very quickly
i have no mother , but my uncle visits me every year and almost every time doesn ’ t recognize me , even my appearance , and he ’ s a clever man
of course , they can sometimes be beaten for their fervor , so as to remind them of their rightful place , but nothing more
just see when that 's come to the surface , he thought
a bon entendeur , salut !
yes , it is , it is indeed , muttered sitnikov , once again emitting a shrill laugh
i reply to your letter immediately—not in order to defend myself , but to thank you , and at the same time to declare that in creating bazarov i was not only not angry with him , but felt an attraction , a sort of disease toward him , so that katkov was at first horrified and saw in him the apotheosis of the contemporary and as a result convinced me to delete not a few traits that would have mellowed him , which i now regret
the other men all turned on him in a fury
yes , i was with her all the while you and katya sergeevna were playing the piano
where will she get raspberry jam for you ?
he walked along the sidewalk like a drunk , without noticing the passersby , and bumping into them ; he came to his senses only at the next street
svidrigaylov sat there , deep in thought
there will be money for vodka !
raskolnikov shook her hand and left
can one reason the way she does in one ’ s right mind ?
it ’ s from yesterday and it ’ s good
to hell with it !
no , sir yes , sir i must go pour the tea
hey , rodion romanych , he added suddenly , everyone needs air , air , air , sir
that wo not make any difference to you , monsieur bazarov ; but it seems that you , monsieur kirsanov , love music ; besides my sister , i also have an old aunt living here with me , and a neighbor of ours sometimes comes over to play cards : that 's our entire society
sonechka hastened to jump up from her chair
where are you going ?
you offered to give me lessons in chemistry
in fact , she did possess some very amusing habits ; but i ’ ll tell you openly that i sincerely regret the numerous sorrows i caused her
that idea was not altogether unpleasant to him
that is why so many attachments turn upon him , far more than on any other character in the novel
there in the arbor
raskolnikov suddenly felt like saying something particularly pleasant to all assembled
he was even preoccupied at the time by some extraneous thoughts , but not for very long
it was stuffy in the room , the candle was burning dimly , the wind was howling outside , and somewhere in the corner a mouse was scratching ; in fact the whole room smelled of mice and some kind of leather
sometimes i say too much speaking right from the heart , so dunya corrects me
does it really matter what people think of you ?
at once he came straight to the point ; he stood up and picked up his cap
and even if you were right , if i ’ d really decided to commit such a vile act , isn ’ t it really heartless of you to talk to me like this ?
seven eight bazarov stopped
the main thing is ilya petrovich !
n-no , mumbled zosimov , yawning again , you may even distract him
they ’ ve carried them off !
zosimov himself will report everything to you an hour from now
i don ’ t know what i wrote to you , rodya
it was the right thing to do because the peasant 's a thief and a terrible drunkard ; but my father never expected i would be apprised of the facts , as they say
since at the higher level unity embraces contradiction , that is , both preserves and abolishes distinctions , hegel often uses the word versöhnung ( reconciliation ) to describe this phenomenon
yes , sir , they are , replied peter
and its progressive ideas about the liberation of women
in a word , we ’ ve cut ourselves off once and for all from the past , and in my opinion , that ’ s already an achievement , sir
what would i be without god ?
he knew , however , that he was unable to see very well ; perhaps there was something he hadn ’ t noticed that might strike someone
the result may not have given rise to any memorable portrayals , but virgin soil was the only major novel of the s to offer a sober and generally balanced appraisal of the populists and their revolutionary aspirations
( there turned out to be three hundred and seventeen silver rubles and three twenty-kopeck pieces ; because they had been under a stone for a long time , some of the largest banknotes at the top of the pile had deteriorated significantly )
dunya said , entreating him
he climbed up to razumikhin ’ s room on the fifth floor
but you ’ re right , sonya , he said softly at last
that ’ s the way it is and always will be
i ca not tell you how much i value his friendship
and now , if you irritate him , he ’ ll slip out again at night , and he might do something to himself
it was nearing six o ’ clock ; he had overslept !
she would loved her sinful , but kindhearted father very dearly , and he would adored her , joked with her in a friendly way as with an equal , and trusted her entirely , consulted her
and this present state , that is , being betrothed , might even be better than being married
she glanced at raskolnikov
the illness resumed its attacks
even his glum mood had passed ; there was no trace of the former energy he ’ d felt when he ’ d left home to end it all
he was crushed , even somehow humiliated
in her youth she would been very attractive , played the clavichord , and spoken a little french ; but over the course of considerable wandering with her husband , whom she would married against her will , she would put on weight and forgotten both her music and her french
now he was much calmer than when he ’ d first arrived , and he felt this
i will take on myself all this bother , that is , the arrangements for the funeral and so forth
raskolnikov asked the doctor to wait a little longer
why , you yourself say that it may be ’ it ’ s only an accident
who are you talking about ?
nowadays we make fun of medicine in general and do not bow down before anyone
we are told that she 's already been paired with a well-educated and decent , but foolish husband
that he could even conceive of such a thing ?
just as eccentric as your father , but in a different way
petr petrovich cast a sidelong glance at raskolnikov
let ’ s go , said zosimov , nodding to razumikhin
i ’ ll send him away immediately and i ’ ll get a passport , two of them
the idea that porfiry considered him an innocent man began to frighten him
better to lose the battle ( and apparently i have lost it ) than to win it through a trick
well , they might think i shaved especially
and , in fact , he looked completely mad
she interrupted him shrilly and angrily , pointing to the little ones
look at him , he ’ s asleep !
he had noticed it each time he ’ d walked past it ; now he picked it up and looked at it
no , i stopped by here—the devil knows why
and precisely in this interval , he ’ d managed to head down the stairs and somehow slip past them
i can ’ t judge the impression it made ; but in any case , it was advantageous for me
no , he ’ s a fool , a fool !
another person wouldn ’ t , but this fellow will come
) , and i ’ ll be in the kitchen : this is your chance to get to know her better !
katya called fifi and opened the door for her
i should ’ ve taken a proper statement from you , conducted a search , why perhaps i even should ’ ve arrested you
he could read this in her eyes , he could understand it in her emotional distress
why is this blockhead laughing ?
they both remained silent for a while
i put down my pen one more bit of advice to young writers and one last request
we made up a whole group , extremely respectable , some eight years ago ; we spent time together ; and , you know , we were people of refined manners , some poets , some capitalists
but where is it , permit me to ask you , and where are these pairs , believers and nonbelievers ?
by the way , we ’ ll mention in passing that petr petrovich , during this last week and a half , willingly accepted ( especially at first ) andrey semyonych ’ s even extremely strange words of praise , that is , he didn ’ t object , for example , and even remained silent , if andrey semyonych ascribed to him a willingness to assist with the future and speedy organization of a new commune somewhere on meshchan­skaya street or , for example , not to interfere with dunechka if , during the first month of their marriage , she were to decide to take a lover , or not to christen his future children , and so on and so forth—all in this same vein
raskolnikov regarded him gloomily and impressively
what are you preparing yourself for ?
even though pulkheriya aleksandrovna wasn ’ t completely convinced , she no longer resisted
razumikhin cried suddenly , as if coming to his senses and now understanding what was being said
odintseva here flirts not only with bazarov , but also with her own sensuality , a passional existence that her conventions so exquisitely cloak
i ’ ll find it somehow
they seem to have returned from the cemetery
he brought him to petersburg as soon as he turned eighteen and enrolled him in the university
it finally reached the point that evdoksiya , flushed from all the wine she would drunk , banging her blunt nails on the keys of an out-of-tune piano , began singing in a hoarse voice , first some gypsy songs , then seymour schiff 's romance
he wore a huge ring on his finger with a valuable stone
this coffin was lined with white silk and bordered with a thick white frill
sonya murmured , staring intently at petr petrovich
where are you going ?
turgenev 's novel ends by an evocation of transformation that draws on the latin lyricist and the traditions of pastoral , a transformation that implies harmony , resolution , and endurance
all at once he carefully stepped over the threshold , closed the door behind himself thoughtfully , walked over to the table , waited a minute—all this time not taking his eyes off raskolnikov—and quietly , without a sound , sat down on a chair next to the sofa
i will consider both of these , but first i consider it not out of place to turn my attention to other , secondary details
oh , lord , let it end soon !
but you have benefited from living among so many people , you know them so well : you have an eagle eye
well , all right , we ’ ll see !
you wanted to see your friend
tragically—during the june days , turgenev apparently witnessed their short-lived triumph and their bloody defeat at first hand ; but his first reaction to the revolutionary events of that summer , as he summarized them in his letter to pauline viardot , took the form of a question : 'what is history ?
are you so firmly convinced that i poisoned marfa petrovna ?
but your father 's a splendid fellow
a retired army doctor , voyla-too ; and now i have become an agronomist
eliot 's observations , reflecting a new orientation in english and american literary theory and criticism , were not followed in the west by intensive critical analyses of turgenev 's language and text
i observed this plainly
he did a good job laying it all out , thought raskolnikov
stop bemoaning your fate , bazarov said , interrupting him again
the farther we go in the novel , the nearer to the end of the drama , the more gloomy and tense does bazarov 's figure become , while the background becomes clearer and clearer
please understand , ma ’ am : if i were not so certain , with my experience , of course , i wouldn ’ t risk accusing you so openly ; for such a direct and open , but false , even erroneous accusation , i would , in a certain sense , be held responsible
normally , the problem of generations is resolved by time : the sons gradually move toward their permanent positions , give over being angry young men , and become husbands and fathers , angry or not
he is young , bold , intelligent , strong , he has thrown off the burden of the past , the melancholy impotence of the 'superfluous men ' beating vainly against the bars of the prison house of russian society
for the first time , he felt a sudden , strange serenity
if you like a woman , he used to say , try to the romantic hero of a literary ballad ( ) by the german writer friedrich von schiller ( - ) , entitled
brother , replied dunya firmly and also drily
one has to be twice as careful with such a lad
you said it well : simply , without embarrassment , without posturing
he was suddenly annoyed with himself for having been so expansive with this gentleman
and to do as you say would not be according to the form ; you don ’ t know what the proper procedure is , my dear
how could he have seen—is it possible ?
i just remembered something , he replied suddenly and started laughing
just before , when i came in and saw that you were lying there with your eyes closed , pretending to sleep—right then i said to myself , he ’ s the one !
he added in annoyance and fell silent , biting his nails and growing thoughtful once more
it happened that kolya and lyonya , absolutely terrified by the crowd on the street and by the antics of their deranged mother , having at last noticed the policeman who wanted to arrest them and take them away , suddenly , as if having agreed in advance , grabbed each other ’ s hand and set off running
they both stood in a corner ; sitnikov joined them there
but what time is it now ?
timofeich had set off to fetch odintsova
what on earth was that surprise ’ ?
on the contrary : what can be concluded from my words is even more injurious to me : it 's not that i have been too shrewd , but that i was not capable enough
can anything compare with such horror ?
sometimes , usually all of a sudden , this bewilderment would change into cold horror ; her face would assume a wild , deathly expression ; she would lock herself up in her bedroom , and her maid , putting her ear to the keyhole , could hear her smothered sobs
everything contributed to it , even the intense july heat , then at its most extreme
this might even be the source of his illness !
i served in your grandfather 's regiment , he said , turning once again to arkady
its lesson is perhaps summed up in that old yiddish curse : may you live in interesting times
one could even say aristocratic !
i did not want to wake my valet
these bookish words sounded strange to him , and once again it was something new : some sort of mysterious meetings with lizaveta , both of them—holy fools
how can we get her away from him ?
it seems to me there ’ s no particular reason for you or avdotya romanovna to be alarmed , of course , if you don ’ t wish to have anything to do with him
but have you tried ?
it ’ s a nasty , hussar-like , pushkinian expression even unthinkable in a future lexicon
this remarkable man embodied in my view that barely nascent still fermenting principle that was later called nihilism
are you ill , or what ?
how is it you ’ re so observant ?
came an answering cry from somewhere
what did i say ?
yes , sir ; he knocked and came in
to go on living merely to exist ?
i was about to have a memorial service said for him , but then i felt ashamed
conviction , that she requires a husband who will continue to provide the security she insists on , weds her to a loveless marriage of convenience and an endlessly tranquil but probably unfulfilling existence
he left the window , locked it , lit the candle , pulled on his jacket and coat , put on his hat , and walked out , carrying his candle , into the corridor to find the ragged fellow , asleep somewhere in a room among all sorts of trash and discarded candle ends , pay him for the room , and leave the hotel
however , one could attend merely to make fun of it
inner rebellion and personal identification were sufficient , and they avoided revolutionary circles out of fear , lack of awareness , or plain distaste
but i am still leaving
but what ’ s this all about ?
a certain percentage , they say , has to go away every year
suddenly , as if recalling , he rushed to the corner where there was a hole in the wallpaper and began to examine it ; he thrust his hand into the hole , felt around , but that wasn ’ t it , either
i merely hoped my advice would serve you and your mama , in light of his new , undoubtedly imminent attempts
she was wearing a light beige dress ; her hair was combed smooth behind her and lent a girlish expression to her clear , fresh face
father and son rejoiced equally in his appearance at this moment ; there are certain touching situations from which one nevertheless wants to escape as quickly as possible
it ’ s not enough they ’ ve slandered me godlessly—now this creature ’ s attacking me !
from time to time he merely muttered something to himself , from his penchant for monologues , which he immediately acknowledged to himself
gain your end ; if that 's impossible—well , never mind , turn your back on her—there 's plenty of fish in the sea
the young girl merely trembled ; as for the boy , on his bare little knees , he raised his little hand slowly , crossed himself , bowed down and touched his forehead to the floor , which , apparently , afforded him particular pleasure
rudin ( ) , explicitly concerned with the russian idealist of the s , is a profound study of the relation between language and reality , as jane costlow has recently demonstrated in the death of rhetoric in rudin
how can that be ?
what has he done in the past beyond studying in medical school ?
bazarov , someone once said , is the first bolshevik ; even though he is not a socialist , there is some truth in this
and yet the impression created by these incidents does not serve to harm bazarov
let ’ s go , repeated zosimov insistently , and then he walked out
according to his observations , the patient ’ s illness , besides the poor material circumstances of the last few months of his life , had several other moral causes : they were , so to speak , the result of complex moral and material influences , anxieties , apprehensions , problems , certain ideas
i ’ ll tell you sometime how i acted
so i asked whether he would ever studied medicine they reply , 'no , he has not ; he does it more out of philanthropy
he looked around in anger
there are different opinions about him as a result of a single cause : the author himself is somewhat constrained about him and does not know what to consider him—a productive force in the future or a stinking abscess of an empty culture , of which one should rid oneself quickly
your room will be ready for you in a little while , he exclaimed triumphantly
this has nothing to do with me
they both emerged onto the street feeling sullen and morose , and for a few steps didn ’ t exchange a word
the form of the novel is its idea
i knew that it was your sister sonya who sent you
asked arkady , rather too contemptuously
raskolnikov lay there pale , his upper lip quivering , breathing heavily
raskolnikov wondered , pausing in the middle of the street at the crossing and looking around , as if expecting the final word to come from someone
what survives at the end of this novel ?
let me give mitya a swing
all the same , i put it on !
the notion of polarities representing complementary aspects of a higher or broader unity underlies all kinds of systems of thought , whether one calls the various aspects of that integral vision two sides of the same coin ; the father , son , and holy ghost ; yin and yang ; or thesis , antithesis , and synthesis
he continued drinking his tea
in the morning bazarov tried to get up ; his head started spinning and his nose began bleeding ; he lay down again
at exactly eight o'clock in the morning everyone assembled for tea ; between tea and breakfast each person did as he wished ; the mistress herself was busy with the steward ( the estate was run on the quitrent system ) , with the butler , and the main housekeeper
i was awake all three times
that idiot would be so pleased if he could hear you !
what do you want here ?
the general sense of merriment was communicated to the servants as well
in a word , the pechorins have the will but not the knowledge , the rudins have the knowledge but not the will , the bazarovs have both the knowledge and the will
i have to talk to you
bazarov emerged from this school of labor and deprivation a strong and stern man ; the course of studies in natural and medical sciences which he pursued developed his innate intelligence and taught him never to accept any idea and conviction whatsoever on faith ; he became a pure empiricist ; experience became for him the sole source of knowledge , his own sensations—the sole and ultimate proof
afterward it became quiet and spacious
he wondered and opened his eyelids ever so slightly to take a look : the stranger stood on the same spot and was still staring at him
i know that you gave her your last kopecks before you ’ d seen anything
young lady , hey , young lady , the policeman began again , after taking the money
you were lying all the time !
however , there ’ s still time for you to reach an agreement
ah , what are you saying , dunya ?
besides , what right do you have to restrain me by force ?
therefore , let ’ s stop here
are you leaving again ?
so , from this point of view , fathers and sons turns out to be both atypical and typical with respect to turgenev 's novelistic poetics
no , they won ’ t accept them , not for anything , because they found the box and the man wanted to kill himself , which couldn ’ t happen , if he hadn ’ t felt that he was guilty !
still accustomed to view turgenev as the representative of literary russia , wrote the twenty-three-year-old german writer paul ernst in , but the russia which turgenev represented is dead ; the new young russia is represented by people like tolstoy and dostoevsky
her mother made her kneel down and placed her nearby
he said , sitting up under the tree and taking in a deep breath
but now she stopped restraining herself ; now it was laughter , palpable laughter ; something impudent and inviting shone forth in her very unchildlike face ; it was corruption , the face of a courtesan , the impudent face of a mercenary french harlot
she magnanimously kept the princess away from them ; the old woman had been reduced to a fit of tears by news of the impending marriage
i will cut the frogs open and look inside to see what 's going on ; since you and i are just like frogs , except that we walk on two legs , i will find out what 's going on inside us as well
readers attuned to the novel 's comedic implications , however , argue that turgenev 's novel exposes the limitations in bazarov 's character and worldview , and elevates nikolai and arkady to the status of heroes of the golden mean
her disappointment was too painful
it was as if fire had flared up in his lifeless eyes ; it was as though he was pleased that he was still able to feel proud
they discussed at length the question whether marriage was a prejudice or a crime ( [ ] )
he killed an old woman , a civil servant ’ s widow , a moneylender with whom he himself had pawned several things ; he also killed her sister , a trader named lizaveta , who came in accidentally when he was killing the pawnbroker
will you try it on ?
the reader is ready to attribute fictitious sympathies or fictitious antipathies to the author , only in order to escape from unpleasant vagueness
all of a sudden someone sat down at his table , opposite him
the mare strains with all her might , but not only can ’ t she gallop , she can barely take a step forward ; she merely scrapes her hooves , grunts , and cowers from the blows of the three whips raining down on her like hail
allow me to pose one more small question ( i ’ m still troubling you , i know ) ; i want to introduce one tiny little idea of mine , merely so as not to forget it
neither saw the other , even a step away , and they almost bumped heads
and everyone will understand
prosaic love thrives in a realm without drama , and therefore usually is , at best , the background to a novel 's great events
the buildings are in bad shape and the workers look like confirmed loafers ; the steward 's either a fool or a thief , i still ca not tell which
meanwhile he himself mumbled and chewed the amber mouthpiece of his pipe ; clutching his neck with his fingers , he twisted his head as if checking to see that it was attached properly and suddenly opened his broad mouth and laughed without ever emitting a sound
he does a little publishing and puts out booklets on the natural sciences—and do they sell !
my dear boy , it 's no disaster
well , after this i ’ m completely convinced that you came here also with my sister in mind , he said frankly to svidrigaylov , without concealing it , in order to irritate him even more
well , what do you want ?
would you like some tea now ?
however , katerina ivanovna ’ s in a complete frenzy
when that time came—
a few carts harnessed with unbridled horses were running swiftly along a narrow country lane
some form of service ?
the young man took it and was so angry that he was just about to leave ; but then he reconsidered , remembering that he had nowhere else to go , and that he ’ d come for a different reason
no , up to this point the thought of sin kept her from the canal , and the thought of them , the children
like the narrative of odintseva bathing and arkady 's glance , turgenev 's description disrobes the woman by alluding to what her clothes cover
he repeated to himself
as soon as he said this , once again a prior , familiar feeling all at once turned his soul to ice : he glanced at her and all of a sudden he seemed to see lizaveta ’ s face in hers
odintsova and bazarov are therefore shocked to learn that arkady and katya plan to marry
her hands were trembling , and her voice failed
it ’ s open till ten o ’ clock
papa , papa , the boy cries to his father
bazarov shuns life ; the author does not present him as a villain for it ; he only show 's us life in all its beauty
even kokh and pestryakov didn ’ t notice him as they were passing by , although their testimony doesn ’ t mean very much now
his student years , about which turgenev does not say a word , probably did not pass without some affair of the heart ; bazarov , as we shall see later on , proves to be an experienced man , but , in all probability , he has had to do with women who were completely uneducated and far from refined and , consequently , incapable of strongly interesting his intellect or stirring his nerves ; when he meets odintsov he sees that it is possible to speak to her as an equal and senses that she possesses the versatile mind and firm character which he is conscious of and likes in himself
paris , april ( ) , i hasten to answer your letter , for which i am very grateful to you , dear sluchevsky
he does not feel the need to look for sympathy and understanding in another person ; when some thought occurs to him , he simply expresses it , paying no attention whether his listeners agree with his opinion , or whether his ideas please them
you eat , drink , and know you are acting in the most proper , judicious manner
surrounded by fresh scents and shade , she used to read , work , or surrender herself to absolute silence , a feeling probably familiar to everyone , the charm of which consists in a scarcely conscious , quiet attentiveness to the broad wave of life constantly flowing in and around us
bazarov has the habit of expressing himself contemptuously : he calls his old coat
but why sit here chatting like this ?
the materialism you preach has been in fashion more than once before and has always turned out to be insubstantial
in a word , it was youth , that is , i want to state that the landlady afforded me a great deal of credit and , in part , i led a life of
even violent historical change , then , in turgenev 's cool assessment of it , had no specific aim , though he recognized that in the last resort , if a man is to achieve anything at all in his life , he must make that ultimate commitment to his ideals which demands of him the fullest sacrifice
you just go and get married as soon as you can ; fix up your nest and have lots and lots of children
cried the young man again
the requiem at the end , with the further moving toward the immortality of the soul is good , but dangerous : you will slip into mysticism that way
but the ultimate irony is that secenov was in fact modelled on bazarov
prizing the values of honor , valor , and civility that he associates with the upper classes of society as organized by earlier generations , he affects the dress , manners , and views of a bygone era
and the old woman handed him back the watch
did you really not know that ?
it can ’ t be like that !
so , you think i went on about the official apartment
the art of making money or curing hemorrhoids !
i ’ d let them down intentionally
he exclaimed triumphantly , after seeing it on raskolnikov ’ s head
it is , replied arkady
raskolnikov walked behind , carefully supporting marmeladov ’ s head and showing them the way
well , then i waited for you ; i looked around and god delivered you—you came on your own !
on the ground lay a man who had just been run over by the horses
i am sure we will be seeing each other again , anna sergeevna said with an unintentional movement
all his attention is concentrated on the general forces of life
his rude clashes with kirsanov and his uncle arise from his individual traits
no , it ’ s better to stay in one ’ s own country : here , at least , you can blame other people for everything and manage to justify yourself
that phrase in anticipation of better times ’ is the best thing you ’ ve said so far ; and the words about your mother ’ weren ’ t bad , either
even then bazarov remained as cold as ice ; he realized that pavel petrovich simply wanted to appear magnanimous
he was dressed in a large , light , fashionable coat and light-colored summer trousers
you don ’ t give a damn !
i didn ’ t know you also rent a room from lodgers
she stared at him intently
all of a sudden , she threw the revolver aside
as if surprised by this sensation and frightened by it , he suddenly raised his head and stared directly at her ; he met her anxious and painfully solicitous glance directed at him ; there was love reflected in it ; his hatred vanished like a shadow
razumikhin started to exclaim , but just at that moment the door opened and in walked a new person , unknown to everyone in the room
leaving nikolai petrovich in his study , he headed along the corridor dividing the front part of the house from the rear , and , when reaching a low door , paused to reflect , then tugged at his mustache , and knocked
there ’ s a complicating factor involved
the rhetoric of bazarov 's convictions—
he at least got up for work , while we , bazarov reflects ( [ ] )
it seems strange : petr petrovich wrote about her in such a way , yet he still introduced her to us , especially to you !
never mind , just so ; go on
the people who surround bazarov are insignificant intellectually and can in no way move him , thus he is either silent or speaks in abrupt aphorisms , or breaks off an argument he has begun because he recognizes its ludicrous uselessness
i left my uncle there to preside
raskolnikov suddenly wondered about this , but didn ’ t ask
but i am compelled to ask you to spare me five minutes of your time no more
raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the corridor
oh , how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself !
she cried in despair
as he said this , he trembled like a leaf
strange to say , he was not very surprised to see porfiry and was almost unafraid
the servants also grew accustomed to him , even though they made fun of him : they felt that he was almost one of them , not a master
terror passed through sonya ’ s heart
i was examining some views of saxony in your album , and you observed that such an activity could not interest me
even dunechka almost believed them , too—imagine that !
what business is it of yours ?
just as he was christened
and , it turns out , i didn ’ t even do that right
strakhov , for example , writes : bazarov 's credo , nihilism , i have adduced as an effort of thought to free itself from old concepts , as a coherent quest for a new path for life and mental activity
you don ’ t even need anyone to carry out the punishment : they ’ ll beat themselves up because they ’ re so well behaved
the landlord ’ s clock just chimed
i would like to talk to you before you leave
i knew beforehand , he said , you are above any prejudice
i ’ ll still pull him by the hair , because he should be drawn in and not pushed away
she ’ ll gallop , all right !
that ’ s the way it has to be , they say
he ’ d seen her yesterday for the first time , but at such a moment , in such circumstances , and in such clothes , that he remembered an entirely different face
in the noonday heat !
i didn ’ t even expect that
that ’ s how raskolnikov tortured and teased himself with these questions , even deriving some enjoyment from it
do you want me to introduce you ?
that background is so clear and sparkling that bazarov 's huge figure stands out clearly but at the same time gloomily against it
and so , in all : eighty kopecks for the cap , two rubles and twenty-five kopecks for the rest of the clothes , for a total of three rubles and five kopecks ; one ruble and fifty kopecks for the boots—because they ’ re very fine boots—for a total of four rubles and fifty-five kopecks , plus five rubles for all the linen—i paid the wholesale price—for a grand total of nine rubles and fifty-five kopecks
he was a portly , gray-haired man with short , pointy legs that looked as if they would been sharpened , and he was very polite and entertaining
the hegelian dialectic employs series of triads to describe evolution of thoughts or ideas as they move from a lower level of perception to a higher one
they really have such fine words : they ’ re so comforting and erudite
does not it make you happy ?
he also recalled that he hadn ’ t objected in any way to the phrase notorious conduct
she may be chaste to a morbid degree , in spite of her broad intelligence , and this will harm her )
for example , if you will allow me , i will tell you an interesting story about the plague in bessarabia
the murderer was definitely someone who pawned something !
i ’ ll be leaving here today or tomorrow , and therefore would like to tell her that
how did this affair proceed ?
the russian formalists , from whom one might have expected important critical studies , generally ignored turgenev
and besides , you yourself also assured her that your mother would pay up
she behaved in such a way so that everyone , without a moment 's hesitation , would express his opinions to her
i am certain that he earnestly regards himself as a worthwhile person because he reads galignani once a month and saves an occasional peasant from corporal punishment
their display of will and energy was more visible ; and their attitude toward mere charity was similar to that of thoreau—that it was better to be good than to do good
i ’ ve heard something about a mr razumikhin
he grabbed his hat and left , this time no longer afraid of meeting anyone on the staircase ; he ’ d forgotten all about that
do you know who comes here ?
but what was it i wanted to do ?
turgenev 's novel makes here its own image of universal conflagration : kukshina 's fires , however , unlike bazarov s dogs , will consume not the transgressor , but culture itself
the new doctor prescribed cooling drinks , meanwhile confirming bazarov 's diagnosis that there was no danger of any kind
i tell you , she was walking ahead of me , swaying , right here along the boulevard
in the last of his works to deal extensively with the experience of first love in an obviously autobiographical sense , he wrote :
she got up at seven o ’ clock , and her samovar was brought from the kitchen through the corridor
on the outside he resembled a wounded man or someone suffering from great physical pain : his brows were knit , his lips compressed , his gaze inflamed
her hind end sinks down completely , but she jerks and tugs , pulls with her last ounce of strength in different directions , trying to get away ; but six whips lash at her from all sides , and once again the shaft is swung and comes crashing down a third time , then a fourth , evenly , with all of the man ’ s might
nevertheless , you shouldn ’ t be afraid or ashamed of making a confession
nikolai petrovich led her up to the window and held her head in his hands
arkady continued to be surprised all that day
and there wasn ’ t any open apartment anywhere
both her lips and her chin suddenly began trembling , but she regained control , refrained from crying , and quickly lowered her eyes to the floor again
what are you doing ?
i love little houses like yours ; they are so old and cozy , and they have a special smell
what are you saying , rodya ?
what if dunechka somehow winds up in that percentage ?
he , a forty-four-year-old man , an agronomist and landowner , with tears welling up in his eyes , senseless tears ; this was a hundred times worse than playing the cello
but to reject poetry , he thought again , not to have a feeling for art , for nature and he cast about him , as if trying to understand how it was possible not to have a feeling for nature
it even seemed to him that in prison they loved , valued , and cherished it even more than when they had been free
that was the only way he acknowledged his crime : only that he had failed to see it through and had turned himself in
there was no reply
that ’ s what ’ s leading you all astray
some three days later bazarov entered his father 's room and asked if he had any strong caustic
perhaps this is the denouement !
miserable dunechka and i were yesterday !
he recently arrived here
why did they beat the landlady ?
a villain , a monster ! —i hear the exclamations of indignant readers on all sides
on the occasion of our quarrels , i remained silent for the most part and didn ’ t get irritated ; this gentlemanization ’ almost always achieved my goal ; it had an impact on her , and she even liked it ; there were incidents when she was even proud of me
this also explains why she cut or hid her pretty hair beneath a cap and covered her eyes with smoked lenses
he cried , suddenly delighted for some reason
that ’ s what i say !
if you only knew how you intrigue me !
the fact that i take upon myself the role of judge is as much a surprise to my brother as it is to you
it ’ s an ordinary social question , raskolnikov observed distractedly
you dare say , let me go !
at the end of the last century all german men were a little like werther , all german women like charlotte ; at the beginning of this century , the university werthers began to turn into robbers , schiller 's , not real ones
in addition , there ’ s the threat that if i attend the meeting , he ’ ll leave immediately
who can understand him ?
lit by the bright daylight , his handsome , emaciated head resting on the white pillow looked like the head of a dead man in effect , he was a dead man
i talk the way i know how besides , that 's despotism on your part
† let ’ s distinguish ( french )
sonya ’ s face suddenly changed terribly : a shudder ran across it
here 's what : to say , for example , 'enlightenment is useful ' is a commonplace ; but to say 'enlightenment is harmful ' is an inverted commonplace
on the contrary , grumbling resounded on all sides
sonya cried , clasping her hands
it ’ s a good deal
why , it 's enough to try the patience of a saint !
even his own awareness , perhaps a bit too self-satisfied , his own awareness of this pleasant change for the better could be forgiven on such an occasion , for petr petrovich was close to being a bridegroom
she lives only a little way from here
but i did think
so why should you follow me ?
the politics of hesitation +
raskolnikov didn ’ t even turn his head
i wanted to dare and so i killed
you want to know ?
not only does nikolai petrovich love her , but in part pavel petrovich falls in love with her as does bazarov himself
they were both pale and thin ; but in their sickly , pale faces already glimmered the dawn of a renewed future , of perfect resurrection to a new life
the door to the farthest rooms or cells , into which amaliya lippevekhsel ’ s apartment had been divided , stood slightly ajar
how it was and
he does not try to attach anyone to himself and does not force himself on them , and yet wherever he appears he arouses the greatest attention and becomes the main object of feelings and thoughts , love and hatred
if not by reason , then with the devil ’ s help , he thought , chuckling strangely
i really didn ’ t come here wishing to trouble you for long ; i wasn ’ t even expecting very much , although this morning your physiognomy impressed me
did you see him ?
fairly well ; they sometimes had tea or ate dinner out there
petr petrovich came in and rather politely , although with redoubled solemnity , exchanged bows with the ladies
a fever had seized him completely
bazarov is no longer a man in his first youth ; he has already acquired a certain reputation , has managed to present his mode of thought ; while arkady is still completely a youth
they want to entrap me with their guile and then , all of a sudden , throw me off guard , he continued muttering to himself as he headed out onto the stairs
it all has to do with that painter , that is , the housepainter
i must be stupid
how do you get along without it ?
a few days ago i looked over and he was reading pushkin , bazarov continued meanwhile
he stopped by on his way home to see his father
he had not been born a romantic , and his fastidiously dry and passionate soul , with its touch of french misanthropy , did not even know how to dream
i am certain you share my opinion
the second time was two days ago , en route , at dawn , at the malaya vishera station ; and the third time was two hours ago , at the apartment where i ’ m staying , in my room
in a week or a month they ’ ll take me away in one of those prison wagons , across this same bridge ; how will i glance at the canal then—will i remember it ?
she is devout , highly emotional , and believes in all sorts of bizarre omens , charms , dreams , and superstitions
he lay down in bed , but did not blow the candle out and , resting his head on his arm , thought long and hard
raskolnikov ’ s voice broke off , as if the words were unwilling to be uttered clearly
but arkady , who was not listening to him anymore , rushed away from the terrace
shouted and affirmed lebezyatnikov
there 's no need it was a momentary vertige help me sit up that 's fine
sonya understood that this gloomy catechism had become his faith and his law
burst forth from sonya in a tormented wail
the matter ends badly , however
yet to his friend the poet fet , a conservative landowner , he wrote that he did not himself know if he loved bazarov or hated him
arkady merely shrugged his shoulders but he too felt slightly embarrassed
where are these conflicts to be found ?
values you , was that what you said ?
papa , he said , let me introduce you to my friend bazarov , about whom i have written so often
what use do you have for me , unless it ’ s for some special purpose ?
yes , he was glad , he was very glad that no one was there , that he was all alone with his mother
arkady looked at his uncle with pity , and nikolai petrovich shrugged his shoulders on the sly
besides , avdotya romanovna can ’ t remain in the hotel alone without you !
on the contrary , a person to whom it happens is more deserving of pity
and it was this image of the physiologist as destroyer of human morality that was superimposed on secenov when , in the year following publication of fathers and sons , he sought to publish his reflexes of the brain in the contemporary and was refused by the censor ( who did clear it for an obscure professional journal called medicinskij vestnik )
singleton , ed , interpretation : theory and practice ( baltimore , ) , pp
is not it eight , fedosya nikolaevna ?
why , this disgrace , obviously , had affected her only mechanically ; not one drop of genuine disgrace had yet penetrated into her heart : he saw this ; she stood before him in reality
oh , what are you saying ?
finally , on his deathbed , bazarov abandons his hauteur and displays traits early associated with arkady—humility and the recognition of beauty
who ’ s supposed to defend us , poor widows and orphans ?
if you absolutely wish to know about that nonsense , i ’ ll tell you about it sometime , but for now
i derided it then , but that was in order to draw you out further
he ’ s very strange and has resolved to do something
you gentlemen , to the contrary , by a german process of thinking ( like the slavophiles ) , abstracting from the scarcely known and comprehensible substance of the people those principles on which you suppose that it bases its life , are wandering about in a fog and—which is more important—are in effect crying off from revolution ( otrekayetes ' ot revolyutsii ) , because the people before whom you bow down are conservatives par excellence
odintsova shrugged her shoulders slightly
i ’ ll sit and wait right here
yes , sir ; i ’ ll tell her , sir ; right away , sir
he began rattling the door violently
sonya spent the whole night in a fever and delirium
let ’ s suppose this thirst for enlightenment is excessive ; a man ’ s educated , and that ’ s sufficient
meanwhile life at marino had not been proceeding too smoothly ; things were going badly for poor nikolai petrovich
wait , i ’ ll pour it for you ; sit down at the table
lyrical that everything he touches turns into a kind of poetry ( which seems to be what mirsky is saying ) ?
i will keep silent
do you mean that i have to denounce myself ?
as if i ’ ve suffered very little up to now !
he opened his eyes and he saw razumikhin , who had opened the door wide and was standing on the threshold trying to decide whether to enter or not
anna sergeevna was a rather strange creature
# a popular french song about the duke of marlborough
she asked after a little while
evgeny , he asked , to the left ?
she ’ s a holy fool !
the woman who receives bazarov is a study in nakedness and enclosure ; as elsewhere , turgenev 's domestic details allude to a room 's inhabitant
the day after we ’ d received her parents ’ blessing , i brought her about fifteen hundred rubles ’ worth of things : a set of diamonds , one of pearls , and a lady ’ s silver dressing case—about so big , with all sorts of items in it , so that even this little madonna ’ s face flushed deeply
it was a winding road ; after about three hundred paces it curved to the right , toward the cemetery
but you remember everything , razumikhin said , interrupting him
matlaw , with the majority of non-soviet critics , sees turgenev as having drawn on the specific details and data of the debate between russian liberals and radicals for the portrayal of a not merely political but universal theme , the eternal conflict of generations
you are better , that 's what i see , that makes me happy , replied vasily ivanovich
from childhood he was distinguished by his good looks ; in addition , he was self-assured , somewhat sarcastic , and amusingly acrimonious—he could not help being liked
during all these days , another thought had kept constantly running through raskolnikov ’ s head and upsetting him terribly , although he ’ d tried to drive it away because he found it so painful !
avdotya romanovna was pale , and her hand trembled in her brother ’ s hand
hey , such depravity these days !
i know you well !
an uproar and commotion ensued ; the children began crying
reflect that confusion : her dark eyes had a look of perplexity
when katya spoke , she smiled very sweetly , both timidly and openly , and glanced up in an amusingly stern way
it ’ s an illness , rodion romanovich , an illness !
now all of these questions flooded into her mind
you know , it seems to me the air does not smell as good anywhere else in the world as it does right here !
the first thing she did was order the carriage to be harnessed !
turgenev 's pastoral resolutions evoke the possibility of an existence that does not violate society 's most fundamental boundaries : the epilogue 's double weddings are comedy 's convention for the restoration of order
why have you come ?
will there really be a bottle of champagne ?
and so , rodion romanych , why should you be surprised if i played a few tricks on you ?
both sets of values , the romantic and the prosaic , have shaped the development of the novel , as both tolstoy and turgenev knew
however , i see that i ’ m drunk ; i almost let the cat out of the bag again
suddenly he heard someone moving in the room where the old woman ’ s body lay
you have come to say good-bye to me ?
odintsova leaned forward in her chair
katya slowly raised her eyes to her sister ( elegantly , even exquisitely dressed , she was standing on the path and scratching fifi 's ears with the tip of her closed parasol ) , and said slowly , i am alone
he fell down before her , kissed her feet , and after embracing , both of them wept
for all the breadth of his vision and characteristic ambiguity of his artistic design ( in which , as the noted critic m gershenson noted , he resembles dostoevsky ) , there was nothing cool or detached about tur-genev 's relation to life or art
tell me , please , where did you find this out , and why are you so interested in it ?
she saith unto him— ’
yes , pavel petrovich continued , as if talking to himself , there 's an unmistakable resemblance
but this latest turn didn ’ t work to petr petrovich ’ s advantage
if you have some business , there ’ s nothing easier than inviting her here
this sensation usually began to torment him more during the evening hours
i know all the ins and outs !
their dialogue is interrupted by a description of the warm , sweet-smelling night that fills the room , of the night freshness that presses against the lowered curtain : the lamp burned dimly in the darkened , fragrant , solitary room ; through the occasionally swaying shades there flowed in the keen freshness of night , whose mysterious whispering was audible ( viii , [ p ] )
but i don ’ t owe anyone any money !
fenechka 's conscience hardly bothered her , but from time to time she was tormented by the real cause of the quarrel ; besides , pavel petrovich would look at her in such a strange way even when her back was turned toward him she still felt him staring at her
late that night , just before morning , he awoke in the bushes on krestovsky island , shivering and in a fever ; he headed for home and got there early in the morning
but mr lebezyatnikov , who ’ s a follower of the latest ideas , was explaining to me just the other day that in our era compassion has even been prohibited by science and that this is already being done in england , where they ’ ve developed political economy
however , i won ’ t argue
we will , we will , razumikhin hastened to say
it seems you ’ ve developed a taste for my approach and want to know how i ’ d behave in this case ?
as soon as the tinny sound of the bell jingled , it suddenly seemed to him that there was some movement inside the room
she is described as a progressive woman , émancipée in the true sense of the word
but the poor boy ’ s now beside himself
the film was never made , which is unfortunate because it might have helped to clear up a certain ambivalence that has grown up around turgenev 's reputation
odintsova was both afraid of him and felt sorry for him
brother , who was leaving to go to moscow on business
wait for me , even out on the street !
surely you must be convinced by now that everything—understand what i say—everything else has long since disappeared without trace
her face grew paler and paler
raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner , fully clothed , even carefully washed and groomed , something he hadn ’ t done for quite some time
having reached the khokhlovsky settlement , arkady waited until fedot , the proprietor of the coaching inn , had harnessed the fresh horses ; then , going up to the coach , he said to bazarov with his previous grin , evgeny , take me with you ; i want to visit your house
in the novel 's last chapter , we learn that in the small parish church two weddings had taken place quietly , and almost without witnesses—arkady and katya 's , and nikolai petrovich and fenichka 's ( [ ] )
but i concluded that it couldn ’ t possibly be the case
katerina ivanovna cried in desperation and threw herself on her husband
in the sands , † he says , near kolomna
he must have had something in mind ; there must have been some intention , but what ?
if i don ’ t come tomorrow , you will hear about it all yourself and then remember these words i ’ m saying to you now
i ’ ll bring you some ; there ’ s some left
you had a good sleep , my friend : it ’ s evening now , almost six o ’ clock
i will stare at his watch chain
could i really have told her then ?
she pressed her lips to his forehead
bazarov cuts his finger while dissecting a corpse and does not have the opportunity to cauterize the cut immediately with a caustic stone or iron
go get some water , friend , as fast as you can ; he will outlive us both
it seems to me that she participates in none of kristeva 's modalities : neither cyclical , monumental , nor linear
what are you doing here ?
i will permit myself to cite a small example
that is precisely what occurred with fathers and sons
the tavern keeper , it seemed , purposely came down from the upper room to hear this amusing fellow , and sat a ways off , yawning lazily but ostentatiously
well , i ’ m so very glad !
she must carry her keys in her right pocket
he asked , still not raising his eyes to her face
the new attitude was vividly reflected in her social behavior
but i won ’ t accept your sacrifice
why am i making such a big fuss ?
she seemed pale in the light of one lamp covered by a perforated paper shade
he was wearing a light coat and a terribly stained black satin vest without a tie , and his entire face seemed smeared with oil as if it were an iron lock
to hell with this new life !
pulkheriya aleksandrovna had never been able to imagine that she , too , would be so glad ; even that morning , a break with luzhin had seemed to be a terrible misfortune
his appearance was expressive—tall , thin , always badly shaven , and he had black hair
what are you so upset about ?
most important is that , despite his imitation of bazarov 's opinions , awe of his powers , and fear of his disapproval , despite , in short , arkadi 's schoolboy crush on bazarov , he never wavers in his defense of his uncle
both have an equal right to exist
go over there , to the head clerk , he said and directed him to the last room
having reached the landlady ’ s kitchen , its door wide open as usual , he carefully peeked in to have a look around beforehand : by any chance was the landlady herself in there during nastasya ’ s absence , and if not , was the door to her room firmly closed so that she couldn ’ t look out when he entered to take the axe ?
he had been called fool , donkey , reptile , judas , police agent
now , wait : there ’ s an apartment here , in this building , from the same landlords
we have to turn up the steam
no , do not bother him ; he 's become a jackdaw
the main thing is , all three of you can live here together , both of you and rodya
it was as if porfiry had guessed his thoughts
his genius for us is the slavic genius
we wanted to rush off in search of petr petrovich , so that at least with his help
could he , could he , flashed through his head , be lying even now ?
first love is like revolution ; the uniformly correct ordering of life is smashed and destroyed in an instant , youth takes to the barricades , its bright banner raised on high , and no matter what awaits it in the future—death or a new life—it sends to all things its ecstatic greeting
they finally lured him into some sort of pleasure garden , where he paid for their drinks and their entrance fees
you ’ ve said many interesting things about my brother ’ s character and
in some places people formed into groups , agreed on something together , and swore not to disband—but immediately they began to do something quite different from what they themselves had just proposed
the revolutionary events of in paris seem to have brought the two of them together and their relationship , particularly a decade later at the time of the emancipation of the serfs , seems to have been a determining factor in making turgenev arevolutionize ' the hero of his first novel
katerina ivanovna ’ s lost her mind , he blurted out suddenly to sonya , turning away from raskolnikov
and this man ’ s also a fine fellow !
we may be able to get her away from him , sir , replied the police officer thoughtfully
finally , the governing senate heard the case , and the unfortunate man was acquitted and provided with care
he also encountered luxurious carriages and men and women on horseback ; he followed them attentively with his eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from sight
that passion is destructive is both a psychological and political truth for turgenev : violation of the taboo—for both actaeon and bazarov— leads to their being literally consumed by the animal world
sonya made no reply ; she wept
she suddenly said aloud , stopped , and tossed back her curls she looked at herself in the mirror ; her head thrown back , a mysterious smile on her half-closed , half-open lips , and at that moment her eyes seemed to tell her something she found embarrassing
they both stared at each other with rapt attention
a right to crime ?
cried dunya in annoyance
they ’ re sitting properly , all in a row
you ’ re proving to her that all this shyness is nonsense ?
arina vlasevna paid no attention to arkady , failing to regale him with her hospitality
pursuit of mystery and the mystical , of drama and desire
other people here in the house ?
let me go , you drunken devil !
yes , indeed , he arrived here recently ; he ’ d lost his wife a while ago ; he was a dissolute man and he suddenly shot himself , and in such a scandalous manner , you can ’ t even imagine
( ) pavel petrovich sat down at the table
karlsruhe , january ( february ) , [ original in german ]
and as for the fact that he committed murder , he can still perform many good deeds , so that all that will be wiped away ; calm yourself
they told him and then asked what he should be fed
where have you got to ?
you ’ re all wrong , my dear !
she was simply seized by a cold , enervating terror ; the thought that she would not have felt like that if she would really loved him momentarily flashed through her mind
you slept for over six hours
shouldn ’ t i slip into some gateway and wait there in an unfamiliar staircase ?
ah , sonya , is that why i came to see you now ?
sonya wanted to say something , but she kept silent
he retired , in spite of entreaties by friends and pleas by superiors , and set out in search of the princess ; he spent four years in foreign parts , first pursuing her , then deliberately losing sight of her ; he was ashamed of himself , indignant at his own weakness but nothing helped
i ’ m glad that at least you can still blush !
yet that is not the fault of materialism but of those neuvazhay-korytos who understand it in a brutish way
dunechka , you ’ re also irascible
raskolnikov regarded everything with profound amazement and with slow-witted irrational terror
that explains why i did not meet him last winter
where could the old woman go ?
she seemed not to be afraid of svidrigaylov , but looked at him with dull wonder from her large black eyes ; from time to time she burst into sobs , like a child who has been crying for a long while but has already stopped and even been consoled , but not quite , and then suddenly bursts into sobs again
there is no irritation in the tone of his description ; he has simply grown tired of moving on ; the development of his own world view has come to an end , but his capacity to observe the movement of another person 's thought process , to understand and reproduce all its windings , has remained in all its fullness and freshness
two months later , dunechka married razumikhin
so , you ’ re reading newspapers ?
he didn ’ t have any other clothes ; but even if he had , perhaps he wouldn ’ t have put them on
i went out for some reason
we ’ re working for the emancipation of women , while you have only one thing on your mind
something suddenly happened to him , as though some thought had struck him
in what then , arkady nikolaich ?
who are you talking about ?
in life 's furrows by providence 's secret will generations are the fleeting harvest they rise , ripen and fall ; others come in their wake
they say that in sevastopol , right after the battle of the alma , § clever people were terrified that at any moment the enemy would attack with all its might and would soon capture the town ; but when they saw that the enemy preferred to stage a regular siege and was digging the first row of trenches , they say that these same clever people rejoiced and felt reassured , sir : if they were going to mount a regular siege , then the affair would drag on for at least two months !
the couple lived very happily and peacefully : they were hardly ever apart , read together , played pieces for four hands at the piano , sang duets ; she planted flowers and looked after the poultry ; every so often he went off hunting and busied himself with estate management , while arkady kept on growing—also happily and peacefully
you ought to put some sugar in your teacup , nastasya nikiforovna
needed or not—it 's not for us to decide
naturally , in a future society , there ’ ll be no need for such funds ; but her role will have a different meaning , organized harmoniously and rationally
thought nikolai petrovich , and just as his favorite lines of poetry were about to come to his lips , he remembered arkady and his stoff und kraft—and remained silent ; but he continued sitting there , giving way to melancholy and the comforting play of solitary reflection
all of a sudden he felt that it would be terribly unpleasant to pass that bench where he had sat and thought after the girl ’ s departure , and that it would also be terribly painful to encounter that policeman with the mustache to whom he had given his twenty kopecks at the time : to hell with him !
an hour and a half ago i finally finished my novel i do not know whether it will be successful
bazarov is the first strong character , the first whole character , to appear in russian literature from the sphere of so called educated society
the most embarrassing thing is that i did it very stupidly
pavel petrovich said at last
the reader involuntarily begins to think— books exist for distraction not for breaking one 's head ; and what would it have cost the author to say how i should think about a particular figure—what he himself thinks of him !
( could it be from luzhin ? )
he was amazed and even struck by her sudden enthusiasm
that 's a fair judgment
on what basis can you act ?
she blew her nose and , leaning her head first to the right , then to the left , carefully wiped one eye after the other
it was an old book , worn , bound in leather
the horses are young , easily startled ; they shied and he screamed—then it got worse
raskolnikov went up to katerina ivanovna
before he reached it , on the road , in front of a small shop , there stood a young , black-haired organ grinder playing a very sentimental song
stoff und kraft is written in a popular style
polnoe sobranie so-chineni ) , vol
but don ’ t start talking about love—she ’ s incredibly shy –show her that you can ’ t possibly leave her—well , that ’ s all there is to it
and you would not trade him for anyone else ?
government , the establishment , the die-hards , meaning in terms of his fiction the pavel kirsanovs , the ratmirovs , the sipyagins , could be said to be given a fair measure of verisimilitude and integrity as characterizations , just as the younger generation received perceptive , appreciative and critically just appraisals in such representative heroes as litvinov and nezhdanov or in such heroines as yelena and marianna
he soon realized what it was all about and even found this episode immediately to his liking
in a recent article on ottsy i deti , james woodward neatly sums up the two contrasting views of the novel that typify turgenev scholarship
to help your mother ?
without that , there wouldn ’ t be even one great man
you aristocrats can never get any further than noble submission or noble indignation , and all that 's nonsense
that ’ s why i have disturbed you , sofiya semyonovna , with my summons here
no , i ca not smoke , he added , tossing the cigar onto the dusty road
won ’ t twenty years of uninterrupted oppression finish him off ?
you ’ re a suspicious fellow !
it also has two funereal closings
he repeated persistently to himself
well , why am i going out now ?
do you know how i regard you ?
value us as comrades and fellow workers in life , she seemed to be saying to men ; as your equals with whom you can speak simply and plainly
you yourself can see that i didn ’ t come to chase you and catch you like a hare
he said , turning suddenly to razumikhin with a cunning smile
the people believe that when they hear thunder , it 's the prophet elijah riding across the sky in his chariot
what do you advise me to do ?
no , my dear rodion romanych , mikolka ’ s not involved in this affair at all !
you know , i always felt sorry , from the very beginning , that fate hadn ’ t allowed your sister to be born in the second or third century of our era , somewhere as the daughter of a ruling prince or some governor or proconsul in asia minor
like his purely artistic types , so his grave covered with innumerable wreaths were stepping stones by which , implacably and irresistibly , the russian revolution marched towards its goal
that ’ s when marfa petrovna happened to show up , bargained with him , and ransomed me for thirty thousand silver rubles
what do you think ?
a thought entered my head : why should not i express it ?
this question was debated among us , and i told her about it immediately
the main thing , sonya , was that i didn ’ t need the money when i killed ; it wasn ’ t the money , so much as it was something else
i know that i won ’ t ; but say only a few words : are you going far away ?
it ’ s because of your bad luck yesterday that you ’ re so mean and you ’ re pestering me , lebezyatnikov burst out at last ; generally speaking , in spite of all his independence and his protests , he was somehow afraid to oppose petr petrovich ; in general , he treated him with deference , as he had in previous years
she cried in a rage
i do not want to believe that you gentlemen really know the russian people and represent their needs and aspirations !
i know you don ’ t believe it—but don ’ t philosophize too cleverly ; give yourself up to life directly , without deliberating ; don ’ t worry—it ’ ll carry you over to the other shore and stand you on your feet
it 's summer now i will go over there right away and arrange things myself ; meanwhile , timofeich , you bring their things
we have only to climb this little hill and then the house will be visible
matvei ilich kolyazin , finding himself a member of the temporary opposition , graciously paid him a visit on his way to take the waters in bohemia ; meanwhile , the locals , with whom he has very little to do , practically grovel before him
that means you already had some reason for coming to that conclusion
well , what do you want , you fool ?
most likely he 's not thinking anything at all
a lesson is needed , ma ’ am
bah , a five-kopeck piece is still left in my pocket
you know , brother , since your party yesterday , my head ’ s
he still does as much good as he can and continues to make something of an impression : it 's not for nothing he was once a social lion
farewell listen you know , i did not kiss you then blow on the dying lamp and let it go out
clearly connected with these conditions is the intrusion of the raznochintsy into literature , until or so the exclusive purview of the gentry , who were all too eager to avoid the imputation of professionalism
i can ’ t endure it , i can ’ t !
besides sonya , raskolnikov and lebezyatnikov , the civil servant , and the policeman who had dispersed the crowd , others entered the room ; several people had accompanied them to the doorway
meanwhile , he began attending university lectures , again in order to complete his course
i ’ ve only managed to get dressed now
he took a step forward , and a shot rang out
( hmm , and i thought i ’ d have more to say )
it seems that i ’ ll have to see him again more than once , he said to dunya
i have broken off with them completely
under the window there really was some kind of garden , a pleasure garden , it seemed ; most likely during the daytime musicians sang there and tea was served on the little tables
good lord , what sort of truth is it ?
their affairs have begun to improve
there , on a broken chair , in a twisted copper candlestick , stood a candle
i think there was
your conscience is clear , is not it ?
kristeva maintains that this last type of temporality has traditionally been associated with masculine subjectivity and is alien to other attempts to conceptualize time from the perspective of motherhood and reproduction
yes , i can see you ’ re excited
at last several of them ( especially the psychologists ) even allowed for the possibility that perhaps he had not looked into the purse and , therefore , hadn ’ t known what was in it and , not knowing , had placed it under the stone ; but from this they concluded that the crime itself must have occurred during a period of temporary derangement of his mind , so to speak , accompanied by a morbid monomania of murder and robbery , without further aims or calculations of advantage
i even had some money a few days ago and could have bought myself a cap !
arkady related some petersburg news , but felt a certain awkwardness that usually overtakes a young man who 's just ceased being a child and who 's returned to the place where others are used to seeing and regarding him as such
we ’ ll see what tomorrow brings , but today he seems not bad at all : a significant change from yesterday
after many tearful scenes , something like an oral contract was concluded between us : first , i would never leave marfa petrovna and would always be her husband ; second , i would never absent myself without her permission ; third , i would never take a permanent lover ; fourth , in exchange , marfa petrovna would allow me to cast an eye at the servant girls from time to time , but not without her secret knowledge ; fifth , god help me if i were to fall in love with a woman of our own social class ; sixth , if by chance , god forbid , i were to conceive some sort of major , serious passion , i should disclose it to her
raskolnikov paused once again
we sense acutely the various distances between the author and various aspects of his language , which smack of the social universes and belief systems of others
you ’ re marrying luzhin on my account
believe me , all the clever women in the world are not worth your little elbow
arkady glanced at her and lowered his head in agreement
the estate belongs to my mother , not him ; if i remember correctly , they have fifteen serfs
she asked , turning cold in horror and regarding him wildly
but here the stumbling block , anna sergeyevna odintsov , is also met
and why are you blushing again ?
at long last odintsova entered
it is a selfconscious and highly sophisticated variant of the somatic sympathetic fallacy : instead of merely the landscape of nature reflecting inner psychological states ( spring/young love ) , the whole body becomes such a metaphor ( a lesson that will not be lost on tolstoj )
fearing that the old woman would get frightened that they would be all alone , and doubting that his appearance would reassure her , he grabbed the door and tugged it toward him so she wouldn ’ t feel the urge to pull it closed again
after all , he knows i won ’ t pay it back
raskolnikov left in an absolute confusion that kept growing more and more intense
but what had occurred that was so special that it had transformed him so ?
dunya understood it , grabbed the key , rushed to the door , unlocked it swiftly , and dashed out of the room
and so very insistent , with such obstinacy , especially insistent—could this possibly be so , could it ?
p barsukov , zhizri i trudy m p pogodina ( st petersburg , - ) , , p
you ’ re a vile , evil man !
but her face assumed a cordial expression when she heard arkady 's surname
it was ruled a suicide
in the second place , it was because he promptly and respectfully apologized to her that in spite of his strong desire , he had been unable to attend the funeral
i simply don ’ t understand it
he said decisively ; he moved away from the bridge and headed in the direction of the police station
asked another peasant , middle-aged and sullen , from a distance , standing on the threshold of his hut , who would overheard the conversation with bazarov
you may have already heard much about marfa petrovna that was amusing and absurd
was continually bursting into hearty resounding laughter , in which no one else took part , as befits a high official
he paused stubbornly on this thought
true , i thought you might tell me something new
ah , so that ’ s where you ’ ve got to !
svidrigaylov knew this girl ; there was no icon and no lit candle near the coffin , and no prayers could be heard
no one knew his name
the liberation of the serfs , february , , thus took place on march
he hurried to svidrigaylov ’ s
the answer was yes , because you have the sort of mother who , with her pension of one hundred and twenty-five rubles , even if she herself didn ’ t have anything to eat , would still send it to her rodenka
that stone , that stone , you remember , the stone under which all those items are hidden ?
she shifted restlessly from foot to foot and kept curtsying incessantly , biding her time impatiently until she could at last get a word in edgewise
the door flung open—and a happy , fresh , ruddy nikolai petrovich appeared
he couldn ’ t recall the face of the speaker , and even now he didn ’ t recognize him , but he did recall that he had turned toward him and had even made some reply at the time
if god wills it , we ’ ll see each other many times , sir !
i ’ m not mocking you ; i was simply fed up with talking like that
i ’ m in complete agreement with her , rodya , and share all her plans and hopes , seeing their complete likelihood
if i die , he thought , they will find out ; but i wo not die
who knows , perhaps we really are seeing each other for the last time , he added unexpectedly
this was not mere wounded amour propre
the late odintsov did not care for innovations , but he tolerated a certain play of ennobled taste ; consequently , in his garden , between the greenhouse and the pond , he built himself a structure resembling a greek portico made of russian bricks
she could still see him
sonya was still hesitating
i do not think that the great strength of your talent lies in tendenzschriften
they will be smart enough to be born at a better time than you and me
no , my friend , it is clever
i shall do as you wish , he added coolly
he saw how the tradesman walked about fifty paces , then turned around and looked at him , remaining motionless on the same spot
you don ’ t understand me , katerina ivanovna cried indignantly , waving her arm
both pieces of news brought pulkheriya aleksandrovna ’ s already disordered mind almost to a state of ecstasy
you ’ ve strayed from god , and god has struck you and given you over to the devil !
one need but glance at him in the russian church , when , leaning against the wall on one side , he sinks into thought , and remains long without stirring , bitterly compressing his lips , then suddenly recollects himself , and begins almost imperceptibly to cross himself
was this necessary or not ?
the most terrible thing of all was to have to meet this man once again : he hated him beyond all measure , without limit , and he was even afraid that this hatred would cause him to betray himself
he , too , began to laugh , forcing himself somewhat ; but when porfiry , seeing that he was also laughing , collapsed into such peals of laughter that he almost turned bright red , raskolnikov ’ s repulsion suddenly overtook his caution : he stopped laughing , frowned , and for a long time stared maliciously at porfiry without taking his eyes off him , all during the time of his long and , as it were , intentionally prolonged fit of laughter
phew , you ’ re such a strange fellow !
not those silly females , but women 's rights , which i have sworn to defend with my last drop of blood
to his good fortune , once again he managed to get through the gates successfully
once stated , a percentage , there ’ s nothing more to worry about
no , that ’ s not right , not right
go ahead , take a seat , porfiry petrovich , do sit down , raskolnikov said , seating his guest with such an apparently satisfied and amicable look that even he would have been surprised if he could have seen himself
well , sir , now let ’ s get to the boots—what do you think ?
that is , next to the bathhouse , vasily ivanovich added hurriedly
zametov , from the corner where he was sitting , suddenly snorted
what are you hinting at ?
at this moment raskolnikov burst into nervous laughter , right in his face
allow me to ask , will you leave on your travels soon ?
i have a mother and a sister in a certain province
he said in a very strange whisper
he was a dashing speculator and an inveterate gambler who lost everything and died early , leaving his two daughters to cope as best they could
is it really possible ?
he set off down the corridor
the entire scene was lit by only one candle stub
but avdotya romanovna herself took the first step—believe it or not !
raskolnikov seemed to take offense
amy sincere thanks , uttered karmazinov , obviously touched and pressing the other 's hands
his eyes were shining
if bazarov 's father stands above him , pointing , as a dog does in pursuit of prey , then bazarov is the prey , and the dogs have come to devour him
a pretty farce we have been through !
they will expand their nervous systems to the breaking point then , all equilibrium will be destroyed
he willingly agrees to visit odintsov with arkady and explains his pleasure to himself and to arkady by his hope of beginning a pleasant intrigue
and your wife 's a witch , the other retorted
amaliya ivanovna stood there , looking the most foolish of all , her mouth open wide and without a thought in her head
this is a strange conversation for us to have , is not it ?
without doubt , she ’ d have been one of those who suffered martyrdom , and , of course , she would ’ ve smiled when they singed her breast with red-hot pincers
the first peasant replied , and his voice no longer had any trace of that patriarchal singsong quality ; on the contrary , it contained a note of offhand severity
obviously it just slipped out in the heat of conversation , so that afterward he even tried to correct himself and soften it
but i prefer to keep silent on that score
she stayed at the ball later than everyone else ; at three o'clock in the morning she was still dancing a polka-mazurka in the parisian style with sitnikov
his dark face was a little flushed from the champagne
and is nature nonsense ?
i knew that two and a half years ago and have been thinking about it since then , precisely about this , that dunya can tolerate many things
cried sonya weakly , standing there as if rooted to the spot
if there was any danger to you , or anything of the sort , then of course
would you like some vodka , sir ?
as far as mikolka ’ s concerned , would you care to know what sort of fellow he is , in the sense that i understand him ?
his mother was frightened by his gaze
seems they are coming , sir , announced the servant , darting in from the gate
bazarov said after a short pause
now it 's time for tea : your mother 's calling us
in my opinion , this drunken quartermaster is much smarter than she is ; at least it ’ s apparent that the profligate drank away the last of his brains , but they ’ re all so prim and proper
their father returned home to his division and his spouse , and only upon occasion would he send his sons large quarto sheets of gray paper covered with a sweeping clerkly scrawl
lying facedown on a straw litter , the unfortunate man was dying ; dark spots already covered his body and he would long since lost consciousness
cried someone from the entryway
it 's merely an excuse
raskolnikov had begun getting up
marmeladov ’ s entire chest was mangled , crushed , and mutilated
in the final analysis , the monism that turgenev projects in ottsy i deti rests on man 's mortality
you heard ’ im , she ’ ll gallop !
in style and in tone a sharp shift may be observed , and no one better exemplifies this change in real life than belinsky or in literature than bazarov
but once again , it ’ s somehow strange to assume that if he had evil intentions concerning you , he ’ d go about it in such a foolish way
we ’ ll talk about children later , but for now , we ’ ll deal with a cuckold ’ s horns !
you do not understand but you must explain it to yourself somehow
even his recent test ( that is , his visit with the intention of definitively scoping out the place ) had been no more than an attempt at a test , far from the real thing , merely : let me go , he says , and attempt it ; why just dream about it ?
yes , a hat that ’ s too noticeable
his mood is such that he inevitably would come to grips with that action at the first convenient possibility
a long-unfamiliar feeling poured like a wave into his soul and instantly softened it
no , no ; never and nowhere !
he stood up from the chair and grabbed his cap
' a decent chemist ' , he tells his shaken host , 'is twenty times more use than any poet
then i will tell you ; i want one of those roses
what purpose does fenichka serve , and what conclusions can be drawn from her ?
this was a gentleman , no longer young , but standoffish , portly , and with a cautious , grumpy face , who began by pausing in the doorway and glancing around as though offended and with undisguised astonishment , as if asking , with the look in his eyes , where on earth have i come ?
no , i ’ m not delirious , raskolnikov said , standing up from the sofa
but it was too painful and unbearable to think about and ponder all of this !
svidrigaylov pounced on the tea to warm himself up ; he drank a glass , but as a result of his loss of appetite , he couldn ’ t eat even one bite of the veal
his aristocratic nature was disturbed by bazarov 's free-and-easy manner
he 's much sought after by our tourists
i am sure about that
why should i hang around here in her presence after he 's gone ?
i mean completely hopelessly , knowing in advance that nothing will come of it
he replied to several points extremely coherently ; obviously he ’ d received the necessary information and had prepared himself skillfully ; but he simply doesn ’ t know anything about certain other matters , and he waded in too deep ; he knows nothing , and he himself doesn ’ t even suspect that he doesn ’ t know !
porfiry paused opposite him , waited a bit , and then suddenly started laughing himself
an icy fear seized his soul , tormented him , and immobilized him
it all began with the views of the socialists
with two or three chemistry students who ca not distinguish oxygen from nitrogen , but who are filled with self-importance and a penchant for negation , and with the great elisevich , too , sitnikov , who 's also preparing himself for greatness , wanders around petersburg and , according to his own assurances , is carrying on bazarov 's work
a few days later there was a ball at the governor 's house
bazarov arrived at the grove , sat down in the shade at the edge , and only then explained to peter what was expected of him
she had the unfortunate trait of telling all our family secrets and complaining continuously to absolutely everyone about me ; how could she possibly miss the opportunity to talk about such a new and splendid friend ?
i am not disturbing you , am i ?
but turgenev had the pretension and daring to create a novel that had all possible tendencies
there were some thoughts or fragments of thoughts , some images , disordered and unconnected—faces of people he had seen way back in his childhood or encountered somewhere only once and couldn ’ t really even remember ; the bell tower of the voznesensky church ; the billiard table in a tavern with some officer standing next to it ; the smell of cigars in a basement tobacco shop ; a beer hall ; a back staircase , completely dark , splattered with dirty dishwater and strewn with eggshells ; and the sound of sunday church bells floating in from somewhere
hmmm you have just uttered an inverted commonplace
a man as busy as you , to whom time is so valuable , to occupy himself with the painstaking , nerve-irritating work of revision [ of the translation of fathers and sons into german ] !
in my opinion , avdotya romanovna is sacrificing herself in an extremely generous and improvident manner for
during the first year of his administration , he managed to quarrel not only with the marshal of the nobility , a retired captain of the horse guards who ran a stud farm and entertained frequently , but also with his own subordinates
i ’ ll still fight a while longer
in the process , he also remembered the tuchkov bridge , the little neva , and he felt cold again , as he had before when he was standing above the water
how very generous we are !
the bailiff grew lazy and even began gaining weight , as every russian does when he comes upon a bed of roses
give me your hand , give it to me
even if you tormented her , she ’ d never do anything unjust
in this way a man can sometimes feel inclined to throw himself out a window or jump from a bell tower ; the emotion can be very seductive
kolya and lyonya , still not understanding what had happened , but sensing something very terrible , took hold of one another by the shoulders and , staring at each other , all of a sudden , together , at the same instant , opened their mouths and began howling
he ’ s no match for avdotya romanovna
but at first all this was too painful
the most miserable dauber the pianist who taps on the keys in a restaurant they are more useful than you are , because they represent civilization and not brute mongol force
upon learning that the master was summoning her , fenechka grew very frightened , but followed her mother
they say he gave her a terrible beating !
i fulfill my duty as a citizen and a human being ; allow me to inquire , who is he ?
raskolnikov replied rudely and angrily , suddenly changing his tone
i ’ ll pawn the watch for you tomorrow and bring you the money ; the rest will all be arranged later
when she tells him she is sure they will meet again ( as of course they do , at bazarov 's deathbed ) , he answers : in this world , anything may happen !
vasily ivanovich could hardly speak
they have sonya , and i need the money myself
isn ’ t it true , sir ?
therefore , you ’ re demonstrating how little i mean to you
on the other hand , the fact that he had such an assistant made him ecstatic and filled him with pride
devil take it , this case is too much for my poor brain !
he also said something about sonya , promised to stop by to see raskolnikov shortly , and reminded him that he wished to confer with him , that he very much wanted to talk to him , that he had certain matters
with her young , dark , pleasant face , and her sweet , timid manner , she is a breath of fresh air , a fugitive from the natural world
i declare that all of you , to the last one , are blabberers and braggarts !
place—where people move about , clash , fight , and slay one another—it is lived where these tiny , tiny , infinitesimally small changes occur
but sit down , old boy , take a seat , for christ ’ s sake !
hey , anna sergeevna , let 's speak the truth
you must be more careful , razumikhin observed gloomily
i ’ m his friend ; consequently , i ’ m your friend , too
then let some blood
no , mama , no dunya , you can ’ t deceive me !
is she your sister ?
in other words , bazarov ( in yurii mann 's phrase ) had to die in order to remain bazarov
for some reason he knows about my letter to you and suspects something
were confused ( god only knows whether i loved him or hated him ! )
how does that follow ?
muttered nastasya and went out to fulfill the request
cried a familiar voice all of a sudden
in conclusion , i will say that in marrying mr luzhin , avdotya romanovna will be accepting the same money , only from a different source
he speaks of turgenev 's exquisite feeling for balance which is less and less prized in modern opinion , of his grace of beauty and his harmonious union of form and subject
do they live there , behind that door ?
they contained no statement of her own hopes , no guesses about the future , no descriptions of her own feelings
are you afraid to go to the police ?
yes , sir , i haven ’ t heard you out , sir , muttered sonya
arkady , after consulting bazarov , gently draws a volume of pushkin out of his father 's hands , and slips into them buchner 's kraft und stoff , the latest popular exposition of materialism
true , he hadn ’ t counted on having any items ; he ’ d thought there would be only cash , and therefore he hadn ’ t prepared a hiding place
i am proposing here that the effect of love on bazarov was not some sort of general demoralization coming from a recognition that his nature does not correspond with his ideology , but a specific effect , the one i have called pushkin 's malady : an obsession with the knowledge of his own mortality
what has the greatest influence on him now ?
i wanted to keep him there ; wait , mikolai , i say , won ’ t you drink up ?
these people can be honorable or dishonorable , civic stalwarts or inveterate swindlers , depending on circumstances and their personal
cried razumikhin , jumping up and waving his arm
that ’ s how it was
perhaps i ’ m a braggart
flying fish can survive in the air only for a short while ; soon they have got to flop down into the water
i sat her on my knees yesterday , and it must have been very unceremoniously—she flared up and little tears formed in her eyes , but she didn ’ t want to show me how excited she was
there was a great deal of noise and shouting
one must be fair , evgeny
they sat there and whispered until around two o ’ clock in the morning
razumikhin suddenly turned to ask zosimov
sonya quietly took two crosses out of a drawer , one cypress and the other copper ; she crossed herself , made the sign of the cross over him , and hung the cypress cross on his chest
just think , how many foreign and useless words !
he 's become perfectly numb from stupidity and self-importance and now pronounces every e as u—but he also married and received a considerable dowry with his bride , the daughter of the town vegetable-gardener , who turned down offers from two fine suitors because neither of them owned a watch , whereas peter owned not only a watch but also a pair of patent leather boots
just wait and see how she will comfort you !
however , he drove away any future thoughts more apprehensively and feared his own imagination
what sort of expenses ?
in a quarter of an hour , they were all engaged in the most animated conversation
she wrung her hands in despair
she began , stammering from joy
i have gone through a great deal , a very great deal in my time
the hell with evidence !
a i herzen to turgenev
not only do his father and mother remember him and pray for him with infinite and inexpressible tenderness ; in other characters too the memory of bazarov is accompanied by love ; in a moment of happiness katya and arkady drink to bazarov 's memory
this passage is arresting not merely because turgenev uses delirium in a manner similar to that in on the eve ( both positive heroes , insarov and bazarov , succumb to a language that will not cohere to their much-vaunted realms , the political and the scientific )
he added with complete conviction , almost in a whisper
she does not appreciate me !
one chain was simply wrapped up in newspaper
his heart was pounding dreadfully
but toward the end , he suddenly felt very distressed again ; it was as if pangs of conscience suddenly began to torment him : here i sit , listening to songs , as if this is what i should be doing !
the old-style , physical method
there ’ s that policeman again !
if they crush us , so be it , said bazarov
she saw something novel in him , something she would never encountered before , and was curious
polechka , stay here with the children ; i ’ ll come back
he was convinced that svidrigaylov was the most shallow and worthless villain in the world
i ’ ll get to him !
are not you in love with her ?
if you ’ re convinced , then you should
he 's asleep , she replied , barely audible
he was afraid of being followed , afraid that in half an hour , perhaps even a quarter of an hour , an order would be issued to have him followed ; therefore , no matter what happened , he had to hide all traces before then
well , zametov isn ’ t here ; you missed him
delighted to make your acquaintance , said vasily ivanovich
i ’ ve found out where these mothers live and in what circumstances
go to sleep , my dear ; god grant you good health
did you really come here just to torment me ?
fenechka inquired , sticking her head in the door : she would decided not to enter the living room as long as she heard voices arguing there
he set about rifling through everything inside
it says campany ’ ; well , i should remember that a , that letter a , and look at it in one month ’ s time , at that very same a : how will i see it then ?
but this very chance , this smattering of education , and all her previous life could have destroyed her at her very first step on this abominable path
you condemn my course , but whoever said it was accidental , that it was not occasioned by that same national spirit in whose name you protest ?
but all of these torments had rendered him so weak that he could scarcely move
so help me god , rodion romanych , it ’ ll be better for you !
will you do that ?
fenechka brought him a cup of tea and , after placing it on the little table , was just about to leave
with youthful enthusiasm and deep faith in the all-conquering power of science and reason he spoke not only of what had already been achieved , also of what was yet to be done [ he produced a large number of students and ] we may confidently assert that secenov is the initiator of the russian school of physiologists
if you wish , you can have bazarov marry odintsov ; i wo not protest !
everything was thrown about and in disarray , especially the children ’ s clothing
later , after you ’ d left , when he began replying to various points in an extremely coherent way , i myself was surprised , and didn ’ t believe him then , not in the least
but she immediately felt ashamed and quickly ran up the stairs
i called in to see about my tea
katerina ivanovna started shouting
last winter—well , are you listening ?
why , you just came now to console your mother , that i can see
the dirty water parted and swallowed its victim instantly , but in a minute the drowning woman surfaced and was carried along gently , her skirt puffed up above the water like a pillow
what do you mean ?
what are you afraid of ?
( de rougement , perhaps because he remembers the french tradition most , seems to forget this )
she looked at herself in the mirror , admired them , but she had no dresses , none at all , no pretty things for so many years !
all of a sudden , an officer entered , raucously strutting and swaggering in an extremely sprightly way , threw his cockaded cap on the table , and sat down in an armchair
no , it ’ s not nonsense !
he 's come to town to inspect the province
look at that screech owl !
do you really know who killed her ?
svidrigaylov smiled with proud candor
are things really so bad ?
burst forth from anna sergeevna 's lips
i haven ’ t asked you yet whether everything went blank or not
however , you had your own reasons for that
you were not to blame ?
well , get out , get out , let me give you a hug
what kind of ghosts ?
he thought elatedly , standing up and regarding the corner foolishly , looking at the hole where the wallpaper now bulged even more than before
weary , bored people are replaced by people yearning for action , life rejects them both as unfit and incomplete
he made a concerted effort to understand what all this meant
everyone thinks that he ’ s doing it out of servility , but it ’ s simply because he ’ s ashamed of the bird ’ s nest he has on his head : he ’ s easily ashamed !
what can i tell you ?
that ’ s still not everything , petr petrovich said , stopping her , smiling at her simplicity and her unfamiliarity with proper decorum
or sidor , for whom i am to be ready to jump out of my skin , and who wo not even thank me for it and what do i need his thanks for ?
in addition , i have extremely important work pertaining to legal matters in the senate
so how do you know about it ?
you ’ ve heard about it ?
well , how can i give it up ?
it sounds a bit like a french novel , somewhat unlikely
all three of the little poles were terribly angry and were shouting constantly : pan jest łajdak !
what does this mean ?
well , it does not matter
finally , i told her she could not understand me ; i said we belonged to two different generations
i see that you fancy her , too , don ’ t you ?
now she has to keep herself clean
why are you asking these questions ?
where the feminists may have seen complete liberation as a vague apparition , the nihilists saw it as an urgent and realizable task
baden-baden , december , ( january , )
i need you ; that ’ s why i came to see you
the boy runs along the horse ’ s side , rushes ahead , and sees how they ’ re beating her across the eyes , right across her eyes !
he started for home ; but when he reached petrovsky island , he paused in complete exhaustion , turned off the road , walked over to some bushes , dropped down on the grass , and immediately fell sound asleep
he ran into the bedroom at once
it ’ s certainly true that you ’ re a brave young woman
nevertheless , a change had occurred in both young men since the first days of their stay at nikolskoe
she ’ ll be jealous of avdotya romanovna on account of me , if you want to know , and on account of you , too
oh , hell , that ’ s all i needed , he muttered , grinding his teeth
as for the hero , he is represented as being brutally candid : that is good , very good ; he believes in telling the whole truth , however upsetting to the poor , gentle kirsanovs , father and son , with no respect for persons or circumstances : most admirable ; he attacks art , riches , luxurious living , yes , but in the name of what ?
he threw himself onto the sofa , put his hands behind his head , and sat there motionless , staring at the ceiling almost in despair
novels as if he were not a story-teller but a biographer
hey , alyona ivanovna , you old witch !
and i ask you directly , look around at everyone—are there really that many good men left ?
a strange scene occurred between us last time , rodion romanych
asked petr petrovich , who hadn ’ t caught what was said , but he received no reply
the little girl ’ s face was pale and exhausted ; she was numb from the cold
can ’ t i have a look at him after these last three years ?
he loved lidochka best of all of us , she continued very seriously and without a smile , now speaking just like a grown-up
a gospel lay under his pillow
svidrigaylov hadn ’ t been in petersburg a week , but everything around him was already on a patriarchal footing
i can ’ t stay ; it ’ s time ; i must go
but where would she wear them ?
when did you arrive ?
you seize hold of the most comical aspects
what has happened here , though , is that the grass snake is no longer outside the manor—in a garden portico—
unlike herzen , he was the first to give fictional lineaments to the revolutionary type in russian literature
she cried suddenly , looking at him sternly and angrily
and it was true that the longer pulkheriya aleksandrovna was silent , the more timid she really became
he looked around with a restless , suspicious glance , observing closely : was there a prison guard anywhere near him , or a mysterious gaze from someone designated to keep an eye on him so he wouldn ’ t leave ?
they ’ re drunk , misbehaving , those fools : let ’ s go
cruelly abused by svidrigaylov
so you come from that same house ?
as you well know , i ’ d borrowed those fifteen rubles i sent you four months ago from our local merchant afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin , on the promise of my pension
can i really be capable of doing that ?
how is it he 's moved ahead ?
you know : a member of the gentry who served two years in the cavalry , then wandered around here in petersburg , married marfa petrovna , and lived in the country
as for the fact that there are some irregularities in his character , some old habits , even some disagreement in their views ( which can ’ t be avoided even in the happiest of marriages ) , on that count dunechka told me that she ’ s relying on herself and there ’ s no reason to be concerned , that she can tolerate a great deal on the condition that their future relations will be fair and honest
i won ’ t detain you
he simply wants to rest and travel
two kinds of love+
i don ’ t agree with him ; i understand completely how outraged you are at everything and how this indignation might leave its traces on you forever
it gives me the chills , fenechka complained once to dunyasha ; the latter sighed in reply and thought about another unfeeling man
svidrigaylov was , however , not so drunk at all ; it had affected his head just for a moment , but the effect was passing with every minute
her eyes were shining as if she had a fever , but her glance was sharp and steady , and her consumptive and agitated face made a morbid impression in the last light of the flickering candle end quivering on her face
thank heavens , it was only a dream !
how could you be afraid when you yourself felt you were not guilty ?
she ’ ll borrow some money from somewhere and go back to her town with me , and she ’ ll open a boarding school for noble young women ; she ’ ll take me on as a supervisor and we ’ ll start a splendid new life ; she kisses me , hugs me , comforts me , and believes all this !
but now i ’ m counting only on anatomy , so help me god !
that would seem to be the end
victor , you are a naughty boy
in one corner , in the rear wall—or , that is , the partition—there was a closed door : farther on , behind the partition , must have therefore been some other rooms
whoever she may be—simply a provincial lioness or 'an emancipated woman '
look , see how amazed i am !
peter glanced in the direction his master was pointing
bazarov leaves the room and with this their relationship comes to an end
have you ever seen such a fool ?
if they would at least lie , each in his own way , but
having decided for some reason that amaliya ivanovna was responsible for those who didn ’ t appear , she suddenly began to address her with excessive rudeness , which amaliya ivanovna noticed immediately , becoming extremely piqued
i took the purse from her neck , a leather one
anguish was perceptible on luzhin ’ s face
arkady is shocked by such talk ; but it is the voice of the new , hard-boiled , unashamed materialism
yet despite his earnest efforts garnett 's criticism was as flawed as that of his opponents
however , there are so many nihilists around these days ; it ’ s easy to understand why that ’ s so ; what times we live in , i ask you
katerina ivanovna entrusted everything to her and left her alone , while she herself set off for the cemetery
no one in sight , no one to interfere shall we begin ?
he could have had you put in jail if lebezyatnikov and i hadn ’ t happened to be there !
at least he could have been furious at his own stupidity , just as before he had been angry at the hideous and stupid actions that landed him in prison
do the germans tell you what it 's all about ?
and the wise men and the learned men will exclaim , lord !
that they think i ’ m mad ?
that ’ s how i understand this affair !
i ’ m very weak ; give me your arm
suddenly he shuddered , perhaps saved from another fainting spell by one riotous , hideous sight
it would be more accurate , benjamin writes , to say that a man who dies at will be remembered at every moment of his life as a man who will die at , and he concludes : the nature of a character in a novel can not be presented any better than this statement , which says that the ameaning ' of his life is revealed only in his death
it is to this novel that
he would ask himself , and his heart would ache
did zametov tell you all this ?
he bluntly accused raskolnikov of intentionally insulting petr petrovich , hardly using his illness as an excuse
that ’ s a sin , madam , a sin , the priest remarked , shaking his head
by nature she had a humorous , cheerful , and peace-loving character , but as a result of continual misfortunes and failures , she had begun furiously to desire and demand that everyone live in peace and joy and that they dare not live otherwise , that the least dissonance in life , the smallest failure , would drive her immediately into a frenzy , and in one moment , after the brightest aspirations and fantasies , she would begin to curse fate , tearing and smashing anything that came to hand and banging her head against the wall
nor did she know what to say to him : he was too young for her
bending down to the bench , she began sorting through her roses
that was not it ; he had mistaken one feeling for another
on the bottom of these sheets appeared the words piotr kirsanoff , major-general ,
you ought to be afraid of me , cher ami† in any case , what nonsense that is
now i am no longer a duelist , but a doctor
razumikhin frowned and regarded him uneasily
anna sergeevna requests that you come see her in half an hour , the butler informed them
is he a match for you ?
he repeated , sitting back down on the sofa
for many young women of the 's , embarrassed by the restrictions , real or imaginary , which russian society imposed upon them , and impatient with the pace of feminism , the philosophic posture and the social attitudes of the people who were called nihilists had an enormous attraction
what are you doing ?
anna sergeevna crossed the room quickly and sat down on an armchair next to the sofa where bazarov was lying
the next day sonya didn ’ t appear , nor did she the day after ; he realized that he was waiting anxiously for her
it resembles a dream
however , you did very well
the doctor just said that he was much better , that he ’ s completely well !
they increase the number of people incapable of practical action , consequently , this practical action itself or , more precisely , the forms which it usually takes at present , slowly but surely are lowered in the opinion of society
let ’ s go over there
she ran to semyon zakharych ’ s superior , but he wasn ’ t home ; he was having dinner with another general
evgeny vasilich , she said with a touch of unintended tenderness in her voice
so is my mother , too
the question of why he ’ d just set out for razumikhin ’ s agitated him more than he himself even realized ; he searched anxiously for some sinister meaning for himself in this seemingly most ordinary action
so much abuse and invective , so many curses have been heaped on my head that was consigned to all the spirits of hell ( vidocq , judas bought for money , fool , ass , adder , spittoon—that was the least that i was called ) that it would be a satisfaction for me to show that other nations see the matter in a different light
hey , it ’ s a pity !
in the middle of the room stood lizaveta , holding a large bundle ; she was staring in a stupor at her murdered sister , looking white as a sheet , as if lacking the strength to scream
this lasted for only a moment
but that won ’ t happen
i said that as a mean trick
her mind was both inquisitive and indifferent at the same time : her doubts never subsided into oblivion or expanded to anxiety
arkady threw himself on the neck of his former mentor and friend , and tears literally gushed from his eyes
well , let ’ s go visit my fiancée
don ’ t you dare
so that ’ s how it is !
previously , in recent times , we acknowledged that our civil servants take bribes , that we lack roads , commerce , true justice
if not , you ’ ll get even worse
the two clerks quarreled with some other clerks and almost came to blows
after having changed completely into his new clothes , he looked at the money left on the table , thought for a bit , and then put it into his pocket
she cried as if in a frenzy , without hearing his last remark ; she burst into sobs as if hysterical
but just at that moment someone grabbed him forcefully from behind : a policeman now stood between them
at last , hesitating and glancing constantly at dunya , she declared that now one circumstance concerned her greatly
i do not feel like it , so i am not eating
arkady to his room and wished him the same kind of refreshing repose i enjoyed when i was your tender age
it seems you said something about today ?
we will understand the importance of this novel 's ending , and of the pastoral for turgenev , only if we accept the essential identity of his sexual and social insights
but then it passed ; your friend arkady arrived and once again i returned to my old routine , resumed my usual role
don ’ t worry , that ’ s fine , said porfiry petrovich , as if hurrying to go somewhere , and only after saying this did he take the paper and glance at it
arkady unexpectedly realized that he wanted to see katya as much as he did anna sergeevna herself
anna patiently endured all her aunt 's whims , gradually assumed responsibility for her sister 's education , and , it seemed , had already reconciled herself to the idea of wasting away in the remote countryside
you might have gotten yourself into trouble ; besides , dunya wouldn ’ t allow it
arkady asks whether , in that case , honesty is only a sensation
you ’ re still lying , he said slowly and weakly , his lips distorted into a sickly smile
you don ’ t have any evidence , and the man i saw yesterday doesn ’ t really exist !
in spite of their inborn inclination to obey , by a certain playfulness of nature , not denied even to a cow , an extremely large number of them like to imagine themselves advanced people , destroyers , and they aspire to utter a new word
who ’ s that person who emerged from under the earth ?
but what should he do , what sort of work ?
good lord , beat me !
one gentleman here just told me she 's quite a woman— ooh là là ; then again , that gentleman seems to be a bit of a fool
bazarov pulled his cap down over his forehead
good lord , pavel petrovich , why are you tormenting me ?
would you like some tea ?
raskolnikov fell silent and turned to his tea
in the nineteenth century the julian calendar was days behind the gregorian , and in the twentieth it was days behind
it ’ s right here , only three houses away , he pleaded , kozel ’ s house , a german , a wealthy man
but have them bring my suitcase up , if you would , and this coat of mine , he added , taking off his loose-fitting garment
you ’ re a fine fellow , but in addition to all your bad qualities , you ’ re a lecher , that i know , and one of the filthiest
and now that he ’ s confessed , you start to pick him to pieces again : you ’ re lying , you tell him , you ’ re not the murderer !
seeing him come running out of the bedroom , she began trembling like a leaf , a gentle trembling , and shudders ran across her entire face ; she raised one arm , was about to open her mouth , but still didn ’ t cry out ; she began slowly backing away from him into the corner , eyes fixed on him , but still not screaming , as if she didn ’ t have enough breath to scream
forces , unknown even to her ; they toyed with her as they wished ; her limited intellect could not withstand their whims
yes , ma ’ am , he had his hair pulled , ma ’ am , more than once , ma ’ am , roared the quartermaster again and poured another glass of vodka down his gullet
people like her never endure it
i wanted to end it all there , but
i will also rescue her from the muck and mire , because she ’ s a fine girl , isn ’ t she ?
so it 's better to be young ?
soon i ’ ll bring zosimov
asked dunya , sternly and imposingly
kozel ’ s house was only about thirty steps away
nihilists , arkady replied clearly
yes , odintsova repeated with some apprehension that she did not quite comprehend
it 's so absurd , but i am talking like a country landowner
they detained dushkin and searched his place , mitrei ’ s , too ; they scoured the men in kolomna as well—suddenly , two days ago , they bring in mikolai himself : he ’ d been detained near the gate of an inn
' i do not share anyone 's ideas : i have my own , and when i meet a man who can hold his own beside me , then i will change my opinion of myself , his deliberately offensive manners , his sponging on and abuse of kukshin and sitnikov , his trifling with fenichka and his jejune declaration to odintsov
he was waiting for sonya ; he saw that they were saying their good-byes and that she was heading straight home
he cried suddenly and impatiently ; abandoning his lookout ; he , too , headed down , hastening , his boots pounding on the stairs
you leave your house with your head held high
of course , it ’ s odd !
besides , i want to have a little chat with you
that ’ s just what dunya did
lebezyatnikov would have gone on , but sonya , who had been listening to him , hardly daring to breathe , suddenly grabbed her cloak and hat and ran out of the room , dressing as she went
( and perhaps the digestive process too ?
arrest me , search me , but be so good as to act in accordance with the proper forms ; don ’ t play with me , sir !
bazarov , who would shrugged his shoulders contemptuously , who thought he knew how to talk to peasants ( so he would boasted in that argument with pavel petrovich ) , that same self-confident bazarov did not even suspect that in their eyes he was still something of a laughingstock
not only did he fail to notice this , he drew them even closer to him
would you believe that marfa petrovna went so far as even to be angry at me at first because of my constant silence about your sister , that i was so indifferent to her incessant and adoring tributes to avdotya romanovna ?
you see , he ’ s come to !
dunya lowered the revolver and looked at svidrigaylov not exactly in fear , but in some sort of wild bewilderment
he was run over on the street !
how is it amusing , sir ?
i would have gone in last night to cover him with kisses , as i did just now
she loved and ancient name of the russian state
then he yawned and , in so doing , opened his mouth unusually wide and kept it that way for an unusually long time
you know that yourself
ah , what a generous gentleman !
i sincerely regret that i ’ ve conversed so little with you , but you won ’ t get away from me
i say to tease her : marfa petrovna , i want to get married
† jean-jacques rousseau ’ s confessions ( – ) was one of the most famous autobiographies
did he mean to praise or denigrate him ?
tell him , if you would , that it 's of no use
our friends were met in the hall by two tall footmen in livery ; one ran off to fetch the butler immediately
he had a manly soldier ’ s face , with a gray mustache , sideburns , and an intelligent expression
please after this quadrille
i ’ ll try to reassure my mother and sister so they won ’ t be frightened
rodion romanych , i have a few words i wish to say to you , said svidrigaylov , approaching
he said suddenly and headed for the door
they were hanging new paper on the walls , white with lilac flowers , instead of the previous yellow , worn-out , faded wallpaper
she was a tall , awkward , timid , humble unmarried woman , almost feebleminded , thirty-five years old , living as a complete slave in her sister ’ s house , working for her day and night , trembling in her presence , even enduring beatings from her
and i hate so many , bazarov replies :
i confided to her heart much of what later turned out so monstrously
oh , how near , how young , fresh , pure
do you realize , dunya , that sonechka ’ s fate is no worse than yours would be with mr luzhin ?
because even our folk songs warn about unequal matches
# a parody of an idea expressed in chernyshevsky ’ s novel
i used to spend winters in moscow but now my lawful spouse , monsieur kukshin , resides there
what a splendid day it is !
yes , but one thing does not prevent the other
he , too , has had nothing from me except insults and worries
of course , in that case , many benefactors of humanity , those who didn ’ t inherit their power but who seized it for themselves , should have been punished when they took their very first steps
the children are crying
i was here about a month ago , the young man hastened to mumble with a slight bow , recalling that he should be more courteous
he covered himself with it ; sleep and delirium overcame him at once
katkov , in an unsigned review in his own journal ( in which the novel had appeared ) , went a good deal further
do you remember mikolka ?
pavel petrovich had not gotten undressed ; he would only exchanged his patent leather shoes for some red chinese slippers without heels
just as turgenev 's narrator never resolves the quarrel between nihilism and the novel , so he never decisively chooses between the prosaic and the aesthetic ideals
a large group of women had collected near the door ; some were sitting on the steps , others were gathered on the sidewalk , and still others were standing and chatting
petr petrovich regarded him for several seconds , his pale face distorted by malice , then turned and walked out ; of course , rarely had anyone carried away such vicious hatred in his heart as this man felt toward raskolnikov
why had he gone to seek her tears ?
she drew her handkerchief from her pocket , untied the knot , pulled out a ten-ruble note , and extended her hand to luzhin
my dear sir , luzhin cried maliciously and irritably , flushed and flustered , my dear sir
i must warn you , i love to argue
and , of course , you ’ re right , sir
what ’ s to be done , ma ’ am ; our national roads are extremely long
the kirsanovs and their wives are limited , but limitlessly happy and fruitful ; bazarov is dramatic , intense , and barren
her room , which is described through pavel 's eyes , contains jars of
nikolai petrovich would notice the delicate profile of her fair face in the parish church , sitting somewhere off on one side
the caretaker was also a bit perplexed , but not too ; he thought a little longer , turned around , and went back into his room
we do not need such references beyond the text of this novel , though , to recognize that pavel petrovich resembles its author
there is practically no need to explain why bazarov turned out and had to turn out a theoretician
raskolnikov must have appeared a bit strange to the policeman : he was in tatters , yet was giving away his own money !
i delighted this lady when i provided money for the upkeep of all three of katerina ivanovna ’ s fledglings , in addition to contributing more money for the institutions ; then i told her sofiya semyonovna ’ s history in great detail , without concealing a thing
and arina vlasevna , glory be to god
no crowd of servants came pouring onto the porch to meet the masters ; only one twelve-year-old girl appeared , and after her a young fellow emerged from the house who resembled peter ; dressed in gray livery with white buttons bearing a coat of arms , he was pavel petrovich kirsanov 's servant
sonya sat down again , once more glanced hurriedly , timidly , uncomfortably at the two women , and suddenly lowered her eyes
or , in the end , immerse herself in depravity , stupefying her mind and hardening her heart
asked luzhin , staring at her intently
listen , raskolnikov hastened to say
i mentioned this tavern to you myself , and it ’ s no miracle that you came here directly ; i myself explained the way here , said where it was , and named the time when i could be found here
but his face expressed surprise
bending down and peering at her once more , he saw clearly that her skull was broken and even dislodged slightly to one side
katerina ivanovna rushed to the window ; there , on a broken chair in the corner , stood a large clay washbasin with water , readied for washing the children ’ s and her husband ’ s clothes that night
now i hope , arina vlasevna , having satisfied your maternal heart , you will begin to worry about satisfying the appetites of your dear guests because , as you know , even nightingales ca not live on fairy tales alone
why does she say such things ?
meanwhile , perhaps the clock was chiming six o ’ clock
so what was the name of that book ?
a reviewing of the notion of tradition may serve the same end ; it is precisely with this point that the title of my paper is connected
they were chatting about something or other
he began reading , more and more in english ; in general he arranged his entire life on the english model , rarely saw his neighbors , and came out only for the elections , where , for the most part , he remained silent , only occasionally teasing and frightening landowners of the old school with his liberal witticisms ; nor did he associate with representatives of the younger generation
he knows very well that the majority of his readers will say of bazarov that he is badly brought up and that it would be impossible to have him in a respectable drawing room ; they will go no further or deeper ; but speaking with such people , a talented artist and honorable man must be extremely careful out of respect for himself and the idea which he is upholding or refuting
get in , bazarov replied through his teeth
raskolnikov raised himself and sat up on the sofa
if i were concerned only for my own advantage , i wouldn ’ t have spoken so openly ; i ’ m not such a fool after all
mejerchol would 's interpretation of the novel refuses to take bazarov 's nihilism seriously : bazarov a nihilist ?
at that moment , the door opened quietly and a young woman entered the room , glancing around timidly
a man who is profoundly imbued with certain convictions , who is their complete embodiment , must without fail also turn out natural and therefore close to his native traditions and at the same time a strong man
raskolnikov made no reply and held the paper in his hands without opening it
russian critics set the stage for the downgrading of turgenev in the s and s
he does not want to admit to himself that he can be angered by a provincial aristocrat , yet his passionate nature outs , frequently he
he was not himself yesterday , razumikhin said pensively
i wo not understand a thing
true , razumikhin was standing guard ; but he didn ’ t know anything
but a warm stream of life courses beneath all these external forms
it was strange : perhaps no one would believe it , but he seemed to care only slightly , absentmindedly about his present , impending fate
to a a fet
get auss of zis apartment !
hello , alyona ivanovna , he began as casually as possible , but his voice didn ’ t obey , broke off , and began trembling
well , what will happen now ?
in her delirium , words escaped her from which one could conclude that she suspected a great deal more about her son ’ s terrible fate than they had supposed
bazarov took his place in the coach
they include a review of vronchenko 's translation of faust ( ) , an article about ostrovsky 's play bednaia nevesta ( ) , the classic essay
my mother sent me that money through a certain merchant ; i received it when i was ill , the same day i gave it away
and who might that be ?
then he left his room , this time even leaving the door wide open
here ’ s nastasya with the tea
you don ’ t understand a thing !
his legs suddenly grew heavy , and he began to feel a strong urge to sleep
we ’ ll , we ’ ll protect her !
bazarov 's plebeian manners rouse the indignation of the outdated dandy ; his self-confidence and unceremoniousness irritate pavel petrovich as a lack of respect for his elegant person
a fine duchess she is , arkady retorted
he asked suddenly , also with anger
i do not share anyone 's opinion : i have my own
and now , my friend , would you like something to eat ?
you have caught a cold
my brother says we are right , he thought ,
i want to receive you as a guest
and you know me too little , dearest sofiya semyonovna , if you thought i ’ d disturb you personally to summon a person such as you for such an unimportant reason concerning me alone
in general , in these last days he himself seemed to be trying to escape a clear and complete understanding of his predicament : he found especially oppressive certain urgent facts demanding immediate clarification ; he would have been so glad to be free of them and escape certain worries , although to do so would have threatened him with total and inevitable ruin
that ’ s not what i ’ m afraid of
you could not have said that seriously
the fire flashing in her eyes as she raised the gun seemed to set him on fire , and his heart contracted in pain
and you , aren ’ t you ashamed ?
and what were they all now , all the torments of the past !
of course , pavel petrovich is not as truly sophisticated as he thinks he is , and he lacks the narrator 's real insight into people
perhaps , he says , in the depths of his soul bazarov acknowledges much of what he repudiates aloud and perhaps it is precisely what he thus acknowledges which secretly saves him from moral degradation and moral worthlessness
because of her strangeness
it ’ s better for me to know !
he found his commanding poetic in the life of nature : a quiet and slow animation , a leisureliness and restraint of feelings and forces , an equilibrium of health in every individual creature—that is nature 's very foundation , its unalterable law , that is what maintains it and keeps it going
he ’ s mistrustful , a skeptic , a cynic
arkady thought ; it was then and only for a moment that the broad expanse of bazarov 's conceit was revealed to him
his clothes were warm and adapted to his way of life
she spoke and criticized calmly and seriously
clear off , that ’ s what !
if he put his hand into his side pocket , he could grasp the handle to make sure it didn ’ t swing ; and since the coat was very loose , a genuine sack , the fact that he was keeping hold of it with the hand in his pocket wouldn ’ t be noticed from outside
do you happen to know his excellency , ivan afanasevich ?
but we do not recognize ourselves at all in the kirsanovs ; just as we do not recognize ourselves in the manilovs and sobakeviches , although the manilovs and sobakeviches existed right up to the time of our youth and exist today
he wept and embraced her knees
meanwhile the mazurka was coming to an end
asked bazarov , as if lost in thought
that ’ s all fair , zosimov hastened to insert
i would , raskolnikov replied
i ’ m an unhappy fool ; i ’ m unworthy of you , i ’ m drunk , and i ’ m ashamed
i ’ d like to have a word with her , sir , with that person , sir
raskolnikov cried in great excitement
i will pray for you for the rest of my life , the little girl said passionately and suddenly began laughing again
sonya began trembling in fright
i ca not acknowledge you as russian
you ought to go swimming more often , nikolai petrovich said to her
he cried , turning to pulkheriya aleksandrovna , who was mortified , and ran out of the room
he ’ s been summoning people who pawned various items with her ; i also had some pledges there , some trifles : my sister ’ s ring , which she gave me as a keepsake when i came here , and my father ’ s silver watch
so today , just before vespers , they ’ ll take it to the cemetery and it ’ ll be in the chapel until tomorrow
meanwhile her young son mitya is growing apace , and can be seen running around the house , talking nonstop
he stood up , looked around in astonishment , as if wondering why he had come here , and set off for tuchkov bridge
calm down , my dear , said dunya , caressing her mother
he stood up and bowed down a second time
it was very foolish
but this neither undermined nor encouraged petr petrovich ’ s views
no , she pinched my cheek : you ’ re such a sweetie !
katerina ivanovna would very much like it this way
but as soon as he put it on , he tore it off in disgust and horror
his thoughts were scattered
he is a man of theory , and theory created him , created him imperceptibly , without events , without anything that one might have related , created him with a single intellectual turnabout
zametov looked at him in fright and turned pale as a ghost
but now all they have to say is , 'everything on earth 's nonsense !
she suddenly began to fix her gaze on petr petrovich ’ s golden lorgnette , which he held in his left hand , and on a large , massive , very beautiful ring with a yellow stone on the middle finger of that hand—but suddenly she averted her eyes from that , too , and not knowing where to look , wound up staring once again directly into petr petrovich ’ s eyes
at last everything became still ; there wasn ’ t a soul
then he quietly unlocked the door , walked out of the room , descended the staircase , and peeked into the open door of the kitchen : nastasya was standing with her back to him , stooping to fan the fire in the landlady ’ s samovar
at least , something of the sort occurred
pisarev 's adversaries were frightened by his imprudence ; they repudiated turgenev 's bazarov as a caricature and even more vehemently rejected his transfigured double ; they were displeased that pisarev had made a fool of himself , but this does not mean that he had misunderstood bazarov
here ’ s what : i have no lessons
it ’ s definitely been decided that dunya and i will leave for petersburg , i don ’ t know exactly when , but , in any case , very , very soon , perhaps even in a week
at last he picked up his cap and quietly left the room
he said it as if to himself , but uttered it aloud and for some time looked at his sister , as if he was puzzled
 by strast noe , greshnoe ,
i am drunk , but not from alcohol
it did not mean anything then and it
they all wept as they parted
why are you frightened like a little child ?
your letter evoked in my heart a mixed feeling of pity , gratefulness , and adoration !
during the morning service
add to this irascibility from hunger , from cramped quarters , from ragged clothes , from the clear consciousness of the beauty of his social position , together with that of his sister and his mother
his illness then , all his strange actions , even before , when he was still at the university , when he was so morose and gloomy
and if so , then might you yourself have decided—well , in view of some unfortunate worldly circumstances and constraints , or for the advancement of all mankind in some way—to step over those obstacles ?
ah , what are you saying , why say that ?
why did you leave me out ?
all this time , for some reason , he maintained his silence with sonya
suddenly , approaching the door , they heard voices inside the room
on this , see also pg
with potatoes and rice ?
what rapturous youths call an ideal does not exist for bazarov ; he calls all this
you ’ re all trying to look like generals ’ daughters , yet you have snub noses !
never , never before had she felt anything like this
but i ’ m certain he ’ ll say the same thing tomorrow
they ’ re drunk , acting up ; it ’ s none of our business
i will most likely be seeing him , replied bazarov ; every sort of explanation and
we have become acquainted , father !
be careful , for heaven 's sake
she is right , observed arkady , but as for my father
when time came for preserves , arkady , who did not care for sweets , thought it his duty to sample four different kinds , all freshly made , all the more so since bazarov flatly refused and promptly lit up a cigar
but i ’ ll find out !
and just who the hell are you ?
he 's given me some very useful advice especially especially concerning relations with women
i was enough of a swine and sufficiently honest to declare openly that i couldn ’ t be completely faithful to her
his feeling of disgust , especially , grew with every passing moment
yes , indeed , it was so : her lips were parting into a smile ; the ends of her lips were quivering , as if still restrained
kokh was a fool and went downstairs
this occurred at the beginning of , at the same time nikolai petrovich , having lost his wife , was setting off for petersburg
you still don ’ t know , you don ’ t know , what sort of girl she is , what a heart she has !
together in the carriage , are renewing their acquaintance with affectionate sympathy when bazarov , from the other coach , interrupts to give arkadi a cigar
katerina ivanovna was in her old dress , her green shawl , and her tattered straw hat with its brim bent awkwardly to one side ; she really was in a genuine frenzy
or , it ’ s simpler and more understandable to say
why did i come ?
wherever i go , no matter what happens to me—you must remain their divine caretaker
the less pisarev kept to the mold in which the from alexander herzen , sobranie sochineniy , vol
let that worthless general see
she never took her eyes off her son and sighed constantly ; she desperately wanted to know how long he was going to stay , but was afraid to ask
but with some strange , almost animal cunning , it suddenly occurred to him to hide his strength for the time being , to conceal himself , if necessary , to pretend that he didn ’ t understand everything completely
suddenly his expression changed and , turning to arkady , he said as if with some embarrassment ,
‡ allow me , young man , can you
are you going to defend those silly females ?
one thin three-year-old fir tree and three bushes stood in this garden
and that wretched general just sat there and ate his grouse
before this trip that i may undertake , i wish to conclude my business with mr luzhin
one of the boys asked
this man was very angry
what can you do with kopecks ?
he thought a bit , stuffed the gun in his pocket , took his hat , and left
he ’ s a practical , busy man , just about to leave for petersburg , so he values every minute
you didn ’ t hear the truth ; it ’ s just gossip !
should i turn around now and go right to the police superintendent ’ s apartment ?
he talks sense , but it ’ s as if
go look for your thief !
svidrigaylov stood at the window for another few minutes ; at last he turned slowly , looked around , and quietly passed his palm over his forehead
that 's all splendid , anna sergeevna , but you must forgive me in general i am not accustomed to such frank pronouncements and there 's such a distance separating you and me
he couldn ’ t even remain standing in the same place for a minute , couldn ’ t focus his attention even on one object ; his thoughts kept jumping ahead , one over the other ; his speech was rambling ; his hands trembled slightly
i can hardly figure out how i wrote him
baden-baden , december , { january , )
in addition , he had in view and at times felt terribly agitated about his forthcoming meeting with sonya : he felt obligated to tell her who ’ d killed lizaveta ; he foresaw terrible suffering for himself , which he tried to push away
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave
fenechka jumped up from the table where she would been sitting with her child and , handing him to the girl , who carried him right out of the room , hurriedly adjusted her kerchief
he muttered in confusion
references to time begin and end fathers and sons ; the nature of time is a subject of discussion within the narrative ; the central protagonists define their identities in connection with different temporal phases ; recurrent changes of tense provide reminders of temporal relativity
there ’ s no need to take him to the hospital when there ’ s probably a doctor in his building !
the former , becoming carried away by sentimental feelings , will reproach bazarov for callousness ; the latter , becoming carried away by their attachment to the bazarov type , will reproach turgenev for injustice to his hero and for a desire to show him in a disadvantageous light
or should his failure and roughness on the contrary teach the bazarovs not to fall into the errors and extremes of the real bazarov ?
fenechka turned red to her ears and the roots of her hair
it was a somewhat strange face that seemed to resemble a mask : white , ruddy , with rosy , scarlet lips , a light blond beard , and a head of rather thick blond hair
in the opposite case , i will be forced to take very serious measures , and then
more noble , more magnanimous ’ —that ’ s all nonsense , foolishness , old prejudicial words that i reject !
then right to the hospital : that ’ s always how it is with those girls who live with their virtuous mothers and who fool around on the sly ; well , and then to the hospital again
arkady turns out to be a competent estate manager : he has learned something from bazarov 's gospel of utility and practicality
well , here we are
opposite alyona ivanovna ’ s
i can ’ t stand it , and i won ’ t !
i don ’ t know your aims , but you keep lying
they lifted her up again
it worked out according to your theory !
just think , these are the flowers : the real fruit lies ahead !
interpretations of any genuinely artistic text—for , as frank kermode has written recently , any such text may be considered as a system of signifiers which always shows a surplus after meeting any particular restricted reading
that is , from all of it , not just one thing ; yesterday zametov
he began laughing and glanced at her
but you were really quite correct , sir , porfiry resumed again , cheerfully , regarding raskolnikov with unusual sincerity ( as a result of which raskolnikov even shuddered and promptly prepared himself ) , really correct , sir , when you were so witty at the expense of our legal forms , ha-ha !
i am rodion romanych raskolnikov , a former student
the old woman stood before him silently , regarding him inquisitively
avdotya romanovna rang the bell , and a filthy urchin appeared ; he was told to bring tea , which was finally served , but it was so dirty and crude that the ladies were ashamed
was it worth even the slightest concern in its turn , even the least bit of attention ?
well , sir , it ’ s too long a story
mama , i ’ m also inviting him
he was able to understand everything in that one look
perhaps there would still be a struggle with him , too
no , some sort of struggle would be better than this !
you do not know your own mother , evgeny
you don ’ t have any money ?
it ’ s a long story , avdotya romanovna
good-bye , squeezed her hand so hard she almost cried , and left the room
five minutes later they opened their eyes and regarded each other in silence
a romantic would say , ' i feel our paths are beginning to diverge ' ; while i merely say , we are fed up with each other
i brought you some tea
yes , answered gieroglifov , for reason does not negate feeling ; but the nihilist must recognize love 's relationship to nature
you see , rodya , i blurted out something to you yesterday when i was intoxicated , as we were going home
i ’ m absolutely prepared to sympathize , if , so to speak , it was poverty that incited sofiya semyonovna
just look at what happens to them , to our brilliant young people !
but she was becoming more and more agitated and anxious ; she also foresaw that the feast would not end serenely ; with apprehension she observed katerina ivanovna ’ s growing irritation
odintsova repeated and sighed
you can count hundreds of similar things
he was intentionally speaking in a loud voice to conceal his growing excitement ; but dunya hadn ’ t managed to observe this peculiar excitement ; she was too irritated by his remark about her childish fear and how terrible she thought he was
at last he stood up , took his cap , thought for a bit , and headed for the door
why are his cheeks so red ?
he had not expected this , and arkady even blushed from delight
but once again the caretaker wasn ’ t there , and he managed to return it to its previous place under the bench ; he even covered it with a log as before
he muttered weakly , sitting down on his bed once more
on the contrary , your wife will merely prove to you that she respects you , considering you incapable of opposing her happiness , and so advanced in your thinking that you won ’ t take revenge on her for her new husband
well , that ’ s praiseworthy ; it ’ s better for you
he stood up and quickly walked away , as if frightened by the words that had just escaped his lips
he still felt it was beyond his power to resolve this question
what a rude , vile , mean idea on my part !
‡ both nikolai dobrolyubov ( – ) and vissarion belinksy ( – ) were important radical critics in the mid-nineteenth century
how could it be ?
cried razumikhin , suddenly seizing him by the shoulder
i planted each and every tree myself
if you have the power , take it
he took it with great interest
perhaps those who were the involuntary cause of his death will agree to compensate you , at least for the loss of income
i realized very well from the first that this was not good , and—what do you think ? —i was even ready not to look at her
there was no one on the staircase !
well , let ’ s say we reason like this ( help me out here !
i have fallen beneath the wheel
you think he ’ ll be able to hold out ?
as the young men take their leave , odintsov invites them to visit her in the country
it was only today that i was able to imagine how you must have suffered here yesterday in anticipation of my return
raskolnikov sat there , watching without moving , and couldn ’ t tear himself away ; his thoughts wandered into daydreams , into contemplation ; he wasn ’ t thinking about anything , but some longing troubled and tormented him
as a matter of fact , a policeman was making his way through the crowd
i didn ’ t tell her that you love her , because she knows that herself
phew , such stupid thoughts occur to me
this time , razumikhin stood up to let him pass
they were forging banknotes
the young people in marino regretted their departure ; dunyasha even shed a few tears but the old folks breathed a sigh of relief
he went out ; he was staggering
they were about to meet ; only one floor separated them—then , all of sudden , deliverance !
tell me : did you kill them ?
raskolnikov didn ’ t recognize her at first
your question is a broad one
that ’ s a rather accurate observation , he replied
then , in deep thought , he stood up , approached his mother , kissed her , returned to his seat , and sat down
in the first place , you ’ re three times smarter than he is ; in the second place , if you ’ re not mad , why should you give a damn about what sort of crazy ideas he has ; and in the third place , that hunk of meat is a surgeon by specialty , and now he ’ s meddling in mental diseases
en vrai chevalier français , and constantly broke into a strong , sonorous , solitary laugh , appropriate for a dignitary
i did hear that , sir
i was looking for it at the time !
she walked in and went straight up to katerina ivanovna and silently put thirty silver rubles down on the table in front of her
he said , bustling about the room like a man who imagines himself delighted and wishes to show that he is
zametov had been seated on a chair in the corner
you know , i ’ m not married , not sophisticated , and not well known ; in addition , i ’ m all washed up , finished , sir , gone to seed and
and after that , dunechka and i will happily travel in a third-class railway car
you have the right , sir
he threw himself at bazarov
can ’ t you save up ?
everyone gradually fell somehow silent at his appearance
he merely looked at me
please don ’ t consider it too familiar
he sat down on his sofa in exhaustion , and right away an unbearable chill took hold of him again
as a result of our sensations
the first time she came ( you know , i was tired : the funeral service , the hymns , then the litany , and the meal—at last i remained alone in my study ; i lit up a cigar and was lost in thought ) , she entered in through the door
a euphemism for brothels
and the fact that he didn ’ t stand firm and he ’ s confessed makes me believe him all the more
i have to cauterize a cut
all the better ; you told me you sent for a doctor you did that to comfort yourself now comfort me : send someone to fetch
when asked why she wanted to go to heidelberg , her answer was the hilarious how can you ask !
i really don ’ t know why i felt attracted to her ; perhaps it was because she was always sickly
and right away he couldn ’ t stand it , spat in disgust , and ran away , furious with himself
i see , my friend , he said a minute later , that i ’ ve made a fool of myself once again
he knew her habits in part
his head was beginning to spin again
he didn ’ t want to think
still , you do agree it would be unpleasant to arouse any suspicion of murder ?
nastasyushka , don ’ t be embarrassed , help me ; that ’ s right !
a long time ago
answer : of course , some people may have gone by , but we didn ’ t notice who
my thoughts are getting all mixed up
how dare he put you in such rooms ?
mr razumikhin had to be deflected : two ’ s company , but three ’ s a crowd
arkady made no reply and turned away , while katya looked in her basket for a few more crumbs and began tossing them to the sparrows ; but the swing of her hand was too strong , and the birds flew away before they could peck at the food
and you ’ ll need it
all right , i ’ ll come , said lizaveta ivanovna , still pondering , and slowly started on her way
raskolnikov turned to leave
and he was about to leave
let us note , by the way , one peculiarity regarding all his definitive decisions already reached in this affair
i conveyed them as i myself understood them
she 's lovely , simply lovely , squeaked sitnikov
isn ’ t it really terrible !
do not betray him for anyone in the world , do not listen to anyone else !
you still don ’ t know him !
the language used by characters in the novel , how they speak , is verbally and semantically autonomous ; each character 's speech possesses its own belief system , since each is the speech of another in another 's language ; thus it may also refract authorial intentions and consequently may to a certain degree constitute a second language for the author
he ’ s wounded , but he ’ s not been killed , rest assured
if you wish , she said and looked at arkady , not exactly as a superior , but as married sisters regard their much younger brothers
then he would say , well , eight take away ten , what 's left ?
slight convulsions passed suddenly across his entire face
he stood over her
this man always had his own intentions and schemes
i really should have served in the military , sir
but , uncle , it 's not because of byronism that i
( he pointed at the dandy )
but enough of this
society—she turns to give him one last glance , he bows slightly—but turgenev modifies this ritual by telling us something else : what arkady is really perceiving in that moment
she still didn ’ t know anything about it , neither why , nor how , nor what for
do you feel sorry for me now , sir , or not ?
he leaned over with his candle and noticed that it was a child—a little girl aged five , no more , in a soaking-wet dress , damp as a dishrag , shivering and crying
principally , though , it was the youth of the heroine that lent poignancy to the characterization
matvei went off with the bay , he cries from the cart , and as for this ol ’ mare here , lads , she ’ s only breakin ’ my heart : i don ’ t give a damn if it kills ’ er ; she ain ’ t worth her salt
suddenly he felt terribly , inexpressibly carefree
dunyasha , a very stern young woman inside the house , but a real giggler outside , merely snorted in reply
the visitor did not seem surprised at all by this exclamation
it seemed to him that he was shoved by some caretaker with a book in his hand , as he was climbing the stairs up to the office ; that a dog burst out barking somewhere on a lower floor and that some woman hurled a rolling pin at it and shouted something
no , not much , svidrigaylov replied calmly
well , just as you ’ ve decided , added pulkheriya aleksandrovna , that ’ s how it will be
avdotya romanovna even extended her own hand to him , and he left extremely satisfied with his visit , all the more so with himself
look at me , fenechka [ it was the first time he called her that
he had kissed her foot and said
and the nerves , sir , the nerves , you ’ ve forgotten all about them , sir !
hey , i ’ ve slipped up !
dunya greeted her brother
he gasped for breath
the socialist leader lavrov reports that he bitterly complained to him of the injustice of the radicals ' change of attitude towards him
everything lies in a man ’ s hands , and still he lets it slip by , solely out of cowardice
i ’ ll speak with pashenka myself and tell her what ’ s needed
since i got an advance on the whole thing , for the first and the second parts , it would come to three rubles for your share
[ fenechka used formal address
sonya thought in her turn
he could not answer his own question satisfactorily , and his heart filled with bitterness
but bazarov soon stopped locking himself in : the fever to work had deserted him and been replaced by dreary boredom and vague restlessness
i myself feel better
of course it was a coincidence , but he couldn ’ t shake off the extremely extraordinary impression , and now it seemed that someone was trying to nudge him in that direction : the student suddenly began telling his comrade various details about this alyona ivanovna
dunechka replied abruptly and scornfully
you said that because you assume i have no feeling for art whatsoever—yes , in fact i lack such feeling ; but these views could have interested me from a geological point of view , for example , the formation of mountains
they demand it , so you go
bazarov continued sitting there without moving
he seems half mad !
who would that be , may i ask ?
the following method , among many others , is rather popular , quite a favorite , as the english would say : the high official suddenly ceases to understand even the simplest words , feigning total deafness
it ’ s a good thing we left now , pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to add , interrupting her
but for what reason did porfiry try to dupe him like that ?
then why the devil are you taking us to see her ?
a moment of silence passed
her imagination even exceeded the boundaries of what 's considered permissible according to the laws of conventional morality ; but even then her blood flowed as quietly as ever in her charmingly graceful and tranquil body
in fact , turgenev tells us that the two new mistresses ( fenechka and katya ) spend considerable time together
remnants of your satirical inclination showing through [ remnants !
would one take offense at such an expression like luzhin ’ s , if he—indicating razumikhin—had written it , or zosimov , or one of us ?
in his day turgenev was regarded as a leader of opinion on social problems
raskolnikov took the paper and cast a fleeting glance at his article
before you stands a mortal who 's long since come to his senses and hopes that others have also forgotten his indiscretions
is it all a mirage , or do they know ?
'et toc , et toc , et tin-tin-tin !
) ; i decided to offer her all my money ( i could raise around thirty thousand rubles at that time ) if she ’ d run away with me , even here to petersburg
but he would ’ ve told you immediately that the workmen couldn ’ t have been there two days before ; consequently , you were there precisely on the day of the murder , after seven o ’ clock
i assure you , it doesn ’ t take much
my mother would ’ ve sent money for the required fees , and i could ’ ve earned enough for boots , clothes , and bread—most likely !
i intend to fulfill honestly all that he expects of me ; consequently , i ’ m not deceiving him
katerina ivanovna was terribly glad to see him , in the first place because he was the only educated guest out of all those present and , as is well known , he was preparing to occupy a professor ’ s chair at the local university two years hence
a man 's first duty is to develop his own powers , to be strong and rational , to create a society in which other rational men can breathe and live and learn
from this it follows that neither the author 's own interpretation nor his announced intentions are necessarily to be taken as authoritative— a point we find made by turgenev himself in connection with fathers and sons
not exactly dishonorable , nevertheless , there they were !
the child began laughing again , stared at the trunk , and suddenly grabbed hold of his mother 's nose and mouth with his whole hand
behind the bar stood a lad about fourteen years old , and there was another , younger boy who served food if anyone ordered something
the concluding words [ the flowers ] tell us , too , of eternal reconciliation and of life without end do not at all tend toward mysticism , as herzen claimed and turgenev denied , but affirm that the passionate , sinning , and rebellious heart
well , what if he says only two days , she thought , and her heart almost stopped
it bad actuality [ editor ]
what does he want ?
he rushed at her with the axe ; her lips became so desperately distorted , just like those of little children when they begin to feel frightened of someone , staring at the thing that frightens them , getting ready to cry
but then why do you abuse others , even those very denouncers ?
pierre sapozhnikov do you know him ?
the light soon faded , but the torment remained , and zosimov , observing and studying his patient with all the youthful fervor of a doctor just beginning his practice , was surprised to notice instead of joy at the arrival of his family , some painful hidden resolve to endure unavoidable torment for another hour or two
but he didn ’ t trust even one of his words , although he felt some strange inclination to believe him
i know that a local artist took a liking to him : he started visiting mikolka , and then this incident occurred !
they despised him and mocked him ; those whose crimes were far worse than his made fun of his crime
he motioned weakly to razumikhin to end his nonstop stream of incoherent and passionate words of consolation addressed to his mother and sister , took them both by the hand , and for a few moments stared in silence , first at one , then at the other
nikodim fomich addressed ilya petrovich politely and amicably
razumikhin said , interrupting her thoughts , having guessed them as he took his enormous strides along the sidewalk so that both women could hardly keep up , which , by the way , he didn ’ t even notice
on the contrary , i am sure you and i are far more in the right than these young fellows , although perhaps we express ourselves in rather archaic language , viell i , and lack that arrogant self-assurance the haughtiness of these young people nowadays !
from the large room came the sound of songs , the music of a clarinet , a violin , and the beat of a turkish drum
she ’ s well known , he said
i do , raskolnikov continued , with a look that seemed to show that he was not talking about street singers at all
another woman muttered in a low voice
so i go runnin ’ after him , yellin ’ my head off
what are you doing here ?
he felt that he was becoming confused , almost frightened , so frightened that if she kept staring at him like that without saying anything for another minute or so , he ’ d run away from her
if i ’ d known this , i ’ d have sent a guard to bring him here !
he ’ s some kind of rogue
i tell you , he ’ s been meddling in mental illness
katerina ivanovna shouted to him ; he heard her cry and fell silent
norton critical edition page numbers appear in brackets
wait a minute , you madman , wait !
he takes far too many risks , father aleksei intoned , as if with sympathy , and stroked his fine beard
odintseva withdraws from an encounter she obscurely desires , but fears ; it is a retreat turgenev clearly endorses—a retreat that may in fact stand as emblematic of his own narrative distance from bazarov , an alien hero who he became intimate with , but expelled
the mention of mortality leads to the third level of attempted reconciliation , the metaphysical
such a completely comprehensible moment of consciousness , considered ideal by bazarov and ideal by nihilism too , has a completely legitimate place in the general process of human consciousness , —and therefore though i laugh wholeheartedly at the facts , that is , at one foolish representative or another of so-called nihilism , i do not permit myself to laugh at the general stream , at the general spirit christened with that name—whether successfully or not —and am still less capable of denying the organic-historical necessity of that eructation of materialism in new forms
how then , how could you give away your last kopecks , but you killed to rob her !
you look and listen , but it ’ s as if you don ’ t understand
no , thank you very much , there 's no reason
yes , that meant a way out had been found !
they have a small estate
svidrigaylov , someone replied from the next room in a hoarse and indifferent voice
pavel petrovich soon recovered , but had to stay in bed for almost a week
same for ringing doorbells
arkady quieted down and bazarov told him about his duel with pavel petrovich
i ’ m not a monster , sir
what can you promise them in return to have such a right ?
in any case , you wo not be bored for long
he was apparently unconscious , very badly dressed , but in what had once been respectable clothes ; he was covered in blood
they heard slippers shuffling , and vasily ivanovich appeared once again
she ’ s a strong young woman , sensible , patient , and generous , although she has an impassioned heart , as i ’ ve come to know well
in war and peace , it appears in countless forms
but i myself was foolish and impatient and spoiled the whole affair
he looked down : in his right hand he held the torn scraps of lining , the sock , and the tatters of his torn-out pocket
i must speak now , but i don ’ t know how to begin
then , quickly and almost out loud , she whispered to raskolnikov that it really would be strange if a respected and solid man like petr petrovich would find himself in such unusual company , in spite of all his devotion to her family and his former friendship with her papa
in the corner he could see clearly outlined the place where the icon case had stood
he described to the last detail the whole process of the murder : he explained the mystery of the pledge ( the piece of wood with the metal strip ) , which had turned up in the dead woman ’ s hands ; he narrated in detail how he took the dead woman ’ s keys ; he described these keys , described the chest and its contents ; he even enumerated several of the objects contained within it ; he explained the riddle of lizaveta ’ s murder ; he described how kokh had arrived and knocked at the door , followed by the student , and conveyed everything said between them ; then how he , the murderer , ran down the stairs afterward , heard the shrieks of mikolka and mitka ; how he hid in the empty apartment , then arrived back home ; and , in conclusion , he showed them the stone in the courtyard on voznesensky prospect , under the gates , where they found the pawnbroker ’ s things and her purse
sometimes he even felt good
but even at that moment he had a distant premonition that all his assurance of better times was also morbid
in my letter i enlarged on your qualities and actions solely in fulfillment of your mother ’ s and sister ’ s request to describe to them the condition in which i found you and what sort of impression you made on me
they were hostile or unresponsive
the former student razumikhin unearthed from somewhere information , which he presented as evidence , that the criminal raskolnikov , during his time at the university , was , with his last resources , helping a poor and consumptive fellow student and that he ’ d continued to support him for almost half a year
no , sir , she herself believed the whole thing ; she was consoling herself using her own imagination , so help me god !
but if it wasn ’ t you , who could it have been ?
of course , said arkady
he feels at home here , yet he ’ s here for the first time
but in short and coherent terms , raskolnikov clearly and accurately explained his business and was satisfied that he had even managed to take a good look at porfiry
cough , cough , cough , cough !
i know that you went to rent an apartment , toward nighttime , when it was growing dark ; you began ringing the bell , asking about the blood , and got the workmen and the caretakers all upset
at the start of their happiness , at certain moments , they were both ready to regard those seven years as seven days
to kozel ’ s house , in the courtyard
your excellency , i said , protect these orphans , because you knew , i said , the late semyon zakharych so well , and since the meanest of scoundrels slandered his own daughter the day he died
he raised himself up with effort
so you won ’ t desert me , sonya ?
the now-familiar thesis , first elaborated by chernyshevsky ( in his sketches of the gogol period in russian literature ) , that literature played a special role in nineteenth-century russia by comparison with its role in the other countries of europe turned quickly , in the minds of the intelligentsia , into a conviction that literature was important to the extent that it contained ideas of a sort that could not be discussed in print in any other form
as a matter of fact , it 's my brother , mine—even if he 's not a genius—how could it be possible ?
in short , is the novel written for the young generation or against it ?
because suffering , rodion romanych , is a great thing ; pay no attention to the fact that i ’ ve grown fat , there ’ s no need ; on the other hand , don ’ t laugh at this , but i know that suffering contains an idea
they have seven children
you ’ re lying , you clown , you damned punchinello ! # he cried , and rushed at porfiry , who retreated toward the door but didn ’ t flinch in the least
when raskolnikov looked at it without saying a word and then turned toward the wall , even razumikhin was a little annoyed
note , rodya , this is the second time someone ’ s come from that office , only the last time it wasn ’ t this man , but another one ; he and i had a little talk
amaliya ivanovna , feeling that she had accomplished her task extremely well , even greeted those returning with a certain pride ; she had changed her clothes and was wearing a black dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons
go on in , if you ’ re here !
moscow , you know , burned down from a candle that cost only one copeck ,
the court will not be as blind
and she said it amicably
she didn ’ t hear a thing
the children also embraced sonya from all sides with their little arms , while polechka—who didn ’ t quite understand what it was all about—seemed to be drowning in tears , shaking with sobs , burying her pretty little face , now swollen from her crying , into sonya ’ s shoulder
she loved to eat , but maintained strict fasts ; she slept ten hours out of every twenty-four and did not go to bed at all if vasily ivanovich had a headache ; she would never read a single book , except for alexis , or the cottage in the forest , and she wrote only one—at most two—letters a year ; but she certainly knew how to run a household , dry produce , and make preserves , even though she never touched anything with her own hands and in general preferred to remain seated in one place
as soon as i turned up here , i immediately learned about all your affairs ; i know it all , my friend , everything ; nastasya witnessed it all
bazarov , on his side , counted ten paces from the barrier and stopped
he wants to catch his breath , cries out , and wakes up
he was a boy of about seven and was walking along with his father outside town late one holiday afternoon
i came to show you my little bogatyr ; he missed seeing his uncle
in addition , a vauxhall had been built , in reality a tavern , but there one could also order tea ; moreover , there were several green tables and chairs
when bazarov becomes ill , when he rots alive and inexorably undergoes the cruel battle with illness , life around him becomes more tense and clear in proportion to his becoming gloomier
how could porfiry believe , even for a moment , that mikolka was guilty , after what had taken place between them then , after that scene , face-to-face , before mikolka arrived ?
let ’ s at least go out onto the landing
today i deserted my family , he said , my mother and my sister
he lay his head down on his meager , worn-out pillow , and he thought ; he thought for a long time
but she woke up anyway
a few days ago she tried to hang herself , but they cut her down
to help by repaying a debt to my late friend
a thick-legged table , piled high with papers black from dust , looking as if they would been smoked , occupied all the space between the two windows ; on the walls hung turkish guns , whips and sabers , two maps , some anatomical drawings , a portrait of hufeland , a monogram made of hair in a black frame , and a mounted diploma ; a leather sofa , worn and torn in places , stood between two enormous cupboards of karelian birchwood ; the shelves were crowded with books , boxes , stuffed birds , jars , and vials in disarray ; in one corner stood some broken electric gadget
now that all the danger ’ s passed , i ’ m saying this directly to you !
look at me , say one word i love i love you please believe me !
could he really be a thief ?
contrary to his normal behavior , he spoke a great deal and made an obvious effort to interest his interlocutor , which also surprised arkady
throughout this time , razumikhin had the air of someone firmly resolved
god , god won ’ t allow such a terrible thing !
avdotya romanovna , what ’ s the matter ?
impudent people in skullcaps were stretching their heads forward , laughing and smoking cigarettes or pipes
the weather was magnificent ; true , there was a distant threat of cholera , but the inhabitants of the province had managed to accustom themselves to its visitations
they love you very much !
arkady ivanovich told her directly that he was obliged to leave petersburg for an extremely important reason , and therefore he had brought her fifteen thousand silver rubles , in bills of various denominations , asking her to accept them from him in the form of a gift , since he had long been planning to give her this trifling sum before their wedding
i caused you a great deal of suffering , rodion romanych
catching his breath and pressing his hand against his pounding heart , feeling and adjusting the axe again , he began climbing the stairs cautiously and quietly , constantly listening for any sounds
made it worse , he replied with an offhand laugh
i certainly didn ’ t expect it from you , petr petrovich , all the more so given your understanding of things—oh !
the older papers and tea were brought
never mind the hair pulling , but it might even be useful to sweep out some of those fools
your drunken husband a horse trumpled
if we take the novel 's comedic structure out of context , we conclude that life is triumphant , rewarding , and meaningful
of course , he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-disparagement , of course , it ’ s impossible to paint over or smooth out all these mean tricks
i am not surprised ,
no , that ’ s not right either : i ’ m making a statement , and you take it down , that ’ s what !
but now she suddenly turned on him almost in a rage
is this all right , is this the right thing to do ?
both mother and sister regarded razumikhin with tender emotion and gratitude , as if he had been sent by providence
katerina sergeevna gave birth to a son , kolya , while mitya 's already running around and talking spiritedly
as i walked past , i was even quite astonished : such preparations are under way—wines !
some sort of sharp , continuous knocking sound could be heard in the courtyard ; something somewhere was being hammered , some sort of nail
he doesn ’ t like it
did you know lizaveta , the market woman ?
i understand ( however , don ’ t trouble yourself : you don ’ t have to say much , if you don ’ t want to ) , i understand what sort of current questions you ’ re thinking about : moral issues , right ?
nikolai petrovich looked at his son in embarrassment
an unusual , feverish , bewildering burst of activity suddenly overtook him , replacing his sleep and stupor
in two or three years—she ’ ll be a cripple , and all in all she ’ ll get to live only to eighteen or nineteen
in other words , they ’ re home , just not opening the door
she walked away from him , but after proceeding some fifty paces , she turned around to glance at him once more
the squabbles arising from this situation finally grew to such proportions that the ministry in petersburg found it necessary to dispatch a trusted personage to investigate the entire matter on the spot
he didn ’ t think about anything
both brothers watched him in silence , while arkady glanced stealthily first at his father , then at his uncle
not everyone will tell you that , and , in fact , i wo not tell you so another time
the educated valet was scared to death ; bazarov calmed him with the assurance that all he had to do was stand at a distance and watch
ah , what scoundrels , scoundrels !
razumikhin was silent for a minute
once—it was morning—pavel petrovich was feeling better and had been moved from his bed to the sofa ; after inquiring about his health , nikolai petrovich set off for the barn
well , now there ’ s a painter involved in it
turgenev himself will never be a bazarov , but he has pondered this type and gained an understanding of it so true that not one of our young realists has yet achieved it
if you wish to fulfill my request , do so quickly , so that i could add a translation of the most important parts of the review to my literary reminiscences , which are to appear soon
that is , if you are a god , i must be a dolt ?
it ’ s a formality ; it ’ s not the main thing
and in that i probably did not succeed ; but i only want to fend off the reproach that i was exasperated with him
i don ’ t know what to wish you in return , replied raskolnikov , already heading down the stairs , but suddenly turning again to porfiry
you know the saying , 'the grass is always greener , replied bazarov
are you really that weak in natural history or have you forgotten that the jackdaw 's the most respectable family bird ?
while they were knocking and talking , the idea occurred to him several times of ending it all and calling out to them from his side of the door
but i think there 's no need to hurry
yes , i understand you , and i hear you , sir !
raskolnikov stopped near a large group of women
enough of that , evgeny vasilich
don ’ t worry about her ; i ’ ll calm her down ; but don ’ t torment her—come just once ; remember , she ’ s your mother !
you are so modest but i would like to find out something about you , your family , your father—for whom you are forsaking us
i ’ ll talk to her
in that case , we will
remember that our entire future depends on whether you can clear all this up and be reconciled as quickly as possible , or not
we write in some hazy , distant spot for everyone and for posterity and hence for no one
so the days passed
with him , he said in a broken voice , indicating razumikhin
question : when you were working with mitrei , did you see anyone on the staircase , at such and such an hour ?
his face had turned red
but we ’ ll talk about it later
why , you despise all of us
don ’ t you see that ?
go on , brother , pull !
in his role as the general 's son , nikolai petrovich—not only was he undistinguished by bravery , but he would even earned a reputation as something of a coward—was required , just like his brother , pavel , to enter military service ; but he managed to break his leg the very day he received news of his commission , and , after spending two months in bed , retained a slight limp for the rest of his life
they brought her to sonya ’ s room almost dead and laid her on the bed
this occurred at ten o ’ clock in the morning
he cried to the mother and sister
why , you , of course , aren ’ t a nihilist , are you ?
you forgot , you remembered , you forgot ’ —what ’ s all that about ?
did he personally have anything to fear or not ?
odintseva 's response to bazarov 's embrace is similar to arkady 's repulsion of his friend 's masculine intimacies : she claims misunderstanding
and it ’ s in the last month i ’ ve learned to prattle , lying for days and nights in my corner , thinking about
i don ’ t judge you , nor dare i , for having deserted us ; forgive me for having reproached you previously
raskolnikov asked himself in astonishment , lifting his head and staring intently at porfiry
he cried in despair a moment later , regarding her with endless suffering
you know the saying , 'the russian peasant would devour god himself
and as a matter of fact , at that moment some noise could be heard in the other room , right behind the door
you sleep on a feather bed ( a doctor , even !
now we ’ ll match strengths !
but all of a sudden he stopped like someone rooted to the ground
he began to untie the bundle , which apparently interested him greatly
i now see that you ’ re also an intelligent man
in our educated russian society there are no sacred traditions , avdotya romanovna : someone may compile them from books for himself
give it to me !
most likely , you yourself , mademoiselle , won ’ t refuse to confirm and declare that i asked you to come , through andrey semyonych , solely in order to talk about the orphaned and desperate situation of your relative katerina ivanovna ( whose funeral dinner i was unable to attend ) , and about how it might be useful to organize something like a subscription , a lottery , or something similar , for her benefit
characteristic of an enlightened higher official
i must have caught a cold
fathers and sons was translated into german several times
a while ago i chose you to tell ; back when your father spoke about you and when lizaveta was alive , i thought of this
his first essay to depict such a woman is his unfinished play , the temptation of saint anthony ( ) , which is an explicit imitation of merimée 's la femme est un diable
and you , could you bear it ?
raskolnikov fixed his eyes on him , as if seizing on and weighing every word
these were arkady 's thoughts and while he pondered , spring was making itself felt
he turned to everyone present
what can i do with it now ?
how to render the tight little work of art that turgenev has made of the dog , narrated by an ex-hussar , with his colloquialisms , his pungent sayings , his terseness and his droll turns ?
what ’ s the matter with you ?
at that moment you arrived ( at my request ) ; all the while you were extremely agitated , so that three times in the middle of our conversation you even stood up and prepared to leave for some reason , even though the conversation had not yet ended
two weeks later arina sa-vishna ( that was the new housekeeper 's name ) arrived at marino together with her daughter and settled in the lodge
they ’ re talking such nonsense
such a character zone is the field of action for a character 's voice , encroaching in one way or another upon the author 's voice
it only meant that the moment had come
we have heard it , we have heard it by the way , why are not you wearing it ?
i have a grandmother who was eighty-five—what a martyr she was !
what affair with anna sergeevna ?
sonya looked at him wildly and began trembling
how old is he ?
we will see how you will fare in a void , a vacuum ; and now , brother , nikolai petrovich , please ring for the servants because it 's time for me to drink my cocoa
the retired quartermaster cried suddenly , draining his twelfth glass of vodka
for a moment a storm flares up in his father 's soul
last year he assured us for some reason that he was going to become a monk : for two months he insisted on it !
what about the earrings ?
that means you still believe in life ; thank god , rodya , thank god !
he 's always silent—it would be better if he would berate us ; he 's growing thin and his color is poor
he was not mistaken in his recollections : this out-of-the-way hotel was so conspicuous that it was impossible to miss even in the darkness
oh , if i were alone and no one loved me , and if i myself never loved anyone ?
the evidence was unmistakable !
we sense those values above all in the voice that tells the story , with its cultivated taste and its refined sensibility
raskolnikov went as far as sadovaya and then turned the corner
i ’ m not particularly interested in anyone ’ s opinion , svidrigaylov replied matter-of-factly , even with a hint of arrogance
i ’ ll find out , no matter what !
raskolnikov sat and listened without moving , without turning , his elbows on the table , looking to one side
she 's so fresh , unspoiled , timid , taciturn , anything you like
what has happened here ?
no , what ’ s so annoying is that they ’ re lying and believe their own lies
my illness seems to have passed
in the first place , i am not kind at all ; in the second , i have lost all importance for you , and you tell me i am a kind person that 's just like placing a wreath of flowers on a corpse 's head
that voice was about to begin again but stopped short
not in vain did schiller say
but as soon as the chick starts to approach , you run like hell !
batyuto , who has also devoted considerable attention to the examination of turgenev 's use of philosophy , sees even less evidence of hegelianism in turgenev 's oeuvre than does chizhevsky
but he judged himself severely , and his embittered conscience could find no particularly terrible guilt in his past , aside from his simple blunder , which could have happened to anyone
a tearful woman ’ s voice called out from nearby
you ’ ll see that you can get along with me
such are the wonders of love
tell me , please , what do you have in common or does he have—zosimov nodded at raskolnikov—with this zametov ?
what can i say ?
i managed to understand a little bit of what you were saying then
on the contrary : you wouldn ’ t have seen anything , even if you really had seen it !
the shout rings out : pull !
happiness—real , prosaic happiness—is never brilliant
over life to almost pathological extremes ( order is needed in everything , she repeats )
and reproach her for the favors you ’ d bestowed on her ?
after mikolka , on that same day , came the scene at sonya ’ s ; he had conducted it and concluded it not at all , not in the least as he had imagined it all before
seeking the happiness of your hand in marriage , at the same time i can not assume any obligations incompatible with
she ’ s quite a phenomenon !
the tradition of all dead generations weighs down the brain of the living
he decided to take the ring ; after locating the old woman , right from the first glance , without knowing anything in particular about her , he conceived an insurmountable loathing for her ; he received two small notes from her and on his way home dropped by a shabby little tavern
wait a moment , i want to smell it with you , bazarov said
please arrange for the horses
will you take it or not ?
the unwelcome guest was already standing at the door , too
there 's so much strength in you , youth in full bloom , ability , talent !
shortly after , when arkadi comments on odintsova 's beauty , bazarov agrees : a splendid body !
it was still very early ; the morning chill had not yet passed
my friends , never justify yourself no matter how you may be slandered ; do not try to clear up misunderstandings , do not try either to say the final word or to listen to it
it was all conducted in accord with absolute order and complete accuracy ; the medical investigation determined that it was apoplexy resulting from bathing too soon after consuming a heavy meal , including almost a full bottle of wine ; they couldn ’ t come to any other conclusion
i would , zametov replied firmly and seriously ; he began speaking and staring a bit too intensely
what are you doing to our mother ?
i have accurate information
very much , replied dunya
she did not appear until dinner and kept pacing her room , arms behind her back , stopping from time to time in front of the window or the mirror , slowly wiping her handkerchief over her neck where she still seemed to feel a burning spot
there , behind a partition , two of the landlord ’ s servants were attending to two large samovars next to bottles , plates , and dishes with pies and snacks brought up from the landlord ’ s kitchen
it was clear to raskolnikov that this man was someone whose mind was firmly set on something and who was also very crafty
do not talk like that , she began , as if you have experienced it all
he 's happy , too , the old dog , i can tell
razumikhin frequently paused along the way , impelled by the heat of the conversation , confused and agitated solely by the fact that it was the first time they had spoken plainly about that
you weren ’ t yourself , sir
can this really be the continuation of my dream ?
nikolai petrovich turned around quickly and , advancing toward a tall man in a long , loose garment with tassels who had just climbed out of the coach , warmly shook his bare , ruddy hand , which had not been immediately extended
( she had the habit , like many of our provincial and moscow ladies , of calling men by their surname from the moment she met them )
the old man didn ’ t reply and for a long time was unable to understand what he was being asked , even though his neighbors began shaking him to amuse themselves
well , go on then , little housewife , get busy , do not disgrace us ; meanwhile , gentlemen , i invite you to follow me
first he would prove to my sister and my mother that he was almost right in his suspicions ; that he had been justified in getting angry at me for having placed my sister on a level with sofiya semyonovna ; that by attacking me , he was therefore defending and preserving the honor of my sister and his fiancée
it wound up in periodical discourses
a burden had been lifted from his shoulders
will that really and truly occur ?
if we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life , wrote george eliot , it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel 's heart beat , and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence
we understood everything from the moment he walked in ; he ’ s not a man of our circle
before he used to avoid me
don ’ t be in such a hurry to talk about mitka
odintseva 's flirtation with the forbidden will be repeated dramatically in her encounter with bazarov ; the narrator 's own ambiguous position—between decorum and erotic curiosity—is played out in an earlier dialogue between arkady and bazarov , when they first meet odintseva
and you sit here , he said to razumikhin , placing him in the corner zosimov had occupied
yes , who are you ?
she adhered to it very strictly and forced others to submit as well
well , who was that ?
the price was one ruble and fifty kopecks
well , how can i be a victim ?
raspberry jam , my dear , she can get in a shop
i don ’ t believe you !
praskovya pavlovna wants to complain to the police about you , she said
people dealt too severely with that madman
she ’ s somewhat talkative and loves to go on about family matters , especially complaining about her husband to each and every person , which is not a good thing ; so she spread the whole story in a very short time , not only in town , but throughout the district
repeated svidrigaylov , still without moving or turning around
i warn you—i ’ m proud of these trousers !
at that , amaliya ivanovna was even more offended and objected , saying that her vater from berlin vas a very , very important mann , and alvayz valked mit ze hends in ze pockets
all of a sudden raskolnikov felt paralyzed , as if he were asleep , dreaming that he was being chased ; they were getting closer , wanting to kill him , while he was rooted to the spot and unable even to move his arms
like katya , fenechka brings the natural world into the kirsanovs ' manor house
i am , if you please , vrazumikhin , not razumikhin , as they all call me , but vrazumikhin , a student , the son of a gentleman , and this fellow is my friend
this would be a good place to hide the stuff and get away , he thought suddenly
haven ’ t you heard it in church ?
that ’ s the first thing
besides , i confess , your question is extremely complicated for me , and i find it difficult to answer
didn ’ t i just now experience real life ?
the thing is—i once posed this question to myself : what would happen , for example , if napoleon were in my place , and if , to begin his career , there was no toulon , no egypt , and no crossing mont blanc ; † instead of all these beautiful and monumental things , there was merely some ridiculous old woman , a civil servant ’ s widow , who , moreover , must be killed so he could steal money from her trunk ( for his career , do you understand ?
good for mikolka , that he ’ s confessed
i mean , how did we create it , tell me please !
what do you suppose that fellow 's thinking about us now ?
his sharp voice , his persuasive tone , and his stern face produced an extraordinary effect on everyone
i ’ ve learned all this psychology in my legal practice , sir
forsaking society of that sort is just like splashing yourself with cold water on a hot day
he took her hand at once and lifted himself up
you ’ re known to be like gunpowder : you can ’ t tolerate any insults
he cried , gathering all the powers of his reason to discern the point of porfiry ’ s game
there is an apocalyptic tendency in the crisis of culture
upon entering the building , he downed a shot of vodka and ate a little pie with some sort of filling
but i ca not turn back now !
i became ill partly as a result
in a word , there were hundreds of questions before him
i went to ask her for some money to buy a drink so i could get rid of my hangover !
who , tell me , who out of all the people accused of crimes , even if they ’ re absolute muzhiks , ‡ who doesn ’ t know , for example , that at first they begin to lull you with irrelevant questions ( in your own fortuitous expression ) and then all of a sudden hit you over the head , with an axe , sir , ha-ha-ha , over your head , in your fortuitous phrase , ha-ha !
i will leave you now ; you must get some rest
the door to the apartment was wide open , there were people inside , and voices could be heard : he hadn ’ t expected that at all
i ’ ve been having dinner here like this for the last three days , my friend rodya , he muttered , as best he could with his mouth filled with beef , and it ’ s all thanks to your nice landlady , pashenka , who does me the honor of feeding me
excuse me , muttered the gentleman , frightened by both raskolnikov ’ s question and his strange look , and crossed to the other side of the street
i am made in the image of a beast , but my wife , katerina ivanovna , is an educated person , born the daughter of a field officer
my mother also says that it resembles a coffin
the street and the crowd frightened her terribly
well , perhaps , perhaps—i do not want to argue
then , you watch out !
at first pavel petrovich uttered disconnected words ; then he suddenly opened his eyes and , seeing his brother next to his bed , bending over him solicitously , he asked , nikolai , do not you think fenechka has something in common with nellie ?
sometimes he got into brawls , and he was reputed to be a very strong man
let him , she says , let him see how the well-born children of their father who was a civil servant now go begging in the streets !
you say she 's cold
he whispered , once again glancing warily at dunya
a haughty grin appeared on his lips
they were both drawing up plans for the future ; they were both counting firmly on settling in siberia after five years
lifetime , and to their considerable dismay , had managed to fall in love with the daughter of a certain prepolovensky , a low-ranking civil servant and the previous owner of their apartment
moreover , the character speech almost always influences authorial speech ( and sometimes powerfully so ) , sprinkling it with another 's words ( that is , the speech of a character perceived as the concealed speech of another ) and in this way introducing into it stratification and speech diversity
i wanted to say that i really do not understand why you have settled down in the country
he shouted , probably astonished that such a ragged fellow hadn ’ t considered effacing himself when confronted with his scorching gaze
is this my delirium continuing or is this real ?
yesterday someone said to me that a man needs air , air , air !
but on every page he writes , 'to battle , to battle !
do you have a cross ?
eventually , those characters who seemed most unalike are aligned ; their similarities become more important than their initial differences
all right , muttered raskolnikov
enyusha 's breaking my heart , he complained to his wife in secret
lida , she said , addressing her younger daughter , you ’ ll go to sleep tonight without your shirt ; somehow
for the honor of russia !
raskolnikov interrupted , momentarily starting to remember
forgive me for speaking so crudely
except that i will always be here for you , as you will for me
i wouldn ’ t have allowed that conversation yesterday
the day was once again clear and warm
the difference in the two brothers ' situations was too great
† a collection of articles translated from french and german and published in petersburg in
your mother , it seems , has entirely forgotten that i decided to accept you , so to speak , after the gossip in town concerning your reputation had spread throughout the entire district
you overlook one of a million details—and there ’ s evidence the size of an egyptian pyramid !
he asked suddenly , turning to him
where could i stash the sock , the fringe , the lining ?
he felt that his mouth was dry , his heart was pounding , and foam was forming on his lips
don ’ t get so upset
both his mother and his sister were terribly frightened ; razumikhin , too
it ’ s no good , he muttered to himself
from the outset arkadi is glad to be hugged and kissed by his father and hugs and kisses him in return , calling him daddy ( papasha ) ; even bazarov 's presence is only faintly inhibiting
mr razumikhin ’ s not the one , sir ; he ’ s an outsider ; he came running to me completely pale
he had his own aims
the workmen looked at him in confusion
that ’ s just katerina ivanovna telling tales because she didn ’ t understand a thing
he felt like sitting or lying down somewhere in the street
he was dressed in an old , completely worn-out tailcoat , missing most of its buttons
it ’ s indecent here with this crowd
sonya ’ s room seemed to resemble a barn ; it had an irregular quadrilateral shape that suggested something deformed
in this letter she reproached him in the most impassioned way and with total indignation for his dishonorable treatment of marfa petrovna
and , indeed , there were conservatives who congratulated turgenev for exposing the horrors of the new , destructive nihilism , and thereby rendering a public service for which all men of decent feeling must be grateful
cried razumikhin , apparently overjoyed that he ’ d received an answer
that poor ol ’ horse must be twenty if she ’ s a day , lads !
and why in secret ?
however , if so , then let it be so
he ’ ll create some sort of scandal in the french manner in a disreputable establishment over a glass of champagne or sparkling wine—that ’ s who your zametov is !
and commands the involuntary respect of every reader
i am not like that
sonya , perhaps i don ’ t want to go to prison yet , he said
timofeich muttered ( recalling the strict orders he would received from his master before departure )
it ’ s not that it ’ s very illiterate , and it ’ s not that it ’ s very literary ; it ’ s just businesslike
i thought i would find him here and propose he take a walk with me
nikodim fomich asked him rather harshly
the expression of his eyes , somewhat strangely , didn ’ t match his whole figure , which had something womanish about it , and lent it something far more serious than one might expect at first sight
