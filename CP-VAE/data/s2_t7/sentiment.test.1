faith , none but humfrey hower , that called your grace to breakfast once , forth of my company .
i prithee , hear me speak .
hear me a word , for i shall never speak to thee again .
though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse abides in me .
i say amen to her .
i must talk a word with you .
i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter .
you have a daughter called elizabeth , virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
and must she die for this ?
so she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter , i will confess she was not edward ’ s daughter .
she is a royal princess .
to save her life , i ’ ll say she is not so .
and only in that safety died her brothers .
no , to their lives ill friends were contrary .
my babes were destined to a fairer death if grace had blessed thee with a fairer life .
whose hand soever launched their tender hearts , thy head , all indirectly , gave direction .
what good is covered with the face of heaven , to be discovered , that can do me good ?
the advancement of your children , gentle lady .
up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads .
unto the dignity and height of fortune , the high imperial type of this earth ’ s glory .
and thou unfit for any place but hell .
yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest !
so will it , madam till i lie with you .
be brief , lest that the process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
then know that from my soul i love thy daughter .
my daughter ’ s mother thinks it with her soul .
that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul .
be not so hasty to confound my meaning .
even he that makes her queen .
how think you of it ?
how canst thou woo her ?
madam , with all my heart .
you mock me , madam .
this is not the way to win your daughter .
say that i did all this for love of her .
look what is done can not be now amended .
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , which after-hours give leisure to repent .
a grandam ’ s name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother .
your children were vexation to your youth , but mine shall be a comfort to your age .
i can not make you what amends i would ; therefore accept such kindness as i can .
what , we have many goodly days to see !
go then , my mother ; to thy daughter go .
what were i best to say ?
her father ’ s brother would be her lord ?
or shall i say her uncle ?
or he that slew her brothers and her uncles ?
infer fair england ’ s peace by this alliance .
which she shall purchase with still-lasting war .
say she shall be a high and mighty queen .
to vail the title , as her mother doth .
say i will love her everlastingly .
but how long shall that title “ ever ” last ?
sweetly in force unto her fair life ’ s end .
but how long fairly shall her sweet life last ?
as long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
as long as hell and richard likes of it .
say i , her sovereign , am her subject low .
but she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
be eloquent in my behalf to her .
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told .
then plainly to her tell my loving tale .
plain and not honest is too harsh a style .
your reasons are too shallow and too quick .
harp not on that string , madam ; that is past .
harp on it still shall i till heart-strings break .
now by my george , my garter , and my crown— profaned , dishonored , and the third usurped .
i swear— by nothing , for this is no oath .
then , by myself— thyself is self-misused .
now , by the world— 'tis full of thy foul wrongs .
my father ’ s death— thy life hath it dishonored .
what canst thou swear by now ?
swear not by time to come , for that thou hast misused ere used , by times ill-used o'erpast .
as i intend to prosper and repent , so thrive i in my dangerous affairs of hostile arms !
in her consists my happiness and thine .
urge the necessity and state of times , and be not peevish found in great designs .
shall i be tempted of the devil thus ?
ay , if the devil tempt you to do good .
ay , if your self ’ s remembrance wrong yourself .
yet thou didst kill my children .
shall i go win my daughter to thy will ?
and be a happy mother by the deed .
write to me very shortly , and you shall understand from me her mind .
to our shores throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends , unarmed and unresolved to beat them back .
some light-foot friend post to the duke of norfolk— ratcliffe , thyself , or catesby .
catesby , fly to the duke .
i will , my lord , with all convenient haste .
o true , good catesby .
bid him levy straight the greatest strength and power that he can make and meet me suddenly at salisbury .
what , may it please you , shall i do at salisbury ?
why , what wouldst thou do there before i go ?
your highness told me i should post before .
stanley , what news with you ?
what need ’ st thou run so many mile about when thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way ?
once more , what news ?
richmond is on the seas .
there let him sink , and be the seas on him !
white-livered runagate , what doth he there ?
well , as you guess ?
it is my day , my life .
black night o'ershade thy day , and death thy life .
curse not thyself , fair creature ; thou art both .
i would i were , to be revenged on thee .
his better doth not breathe upon the earth .
is the king dead , the empire unpossessed ?
what heir of york is there alive but we ?
and who is england ’ s king but great york ’ s heir ?
then tell me , what makes he upon the seas ?
where is thy power , then , to beat him back ?
where be thy tenants and thy followers ?
are they not now upon the western shore , safe-conducting the rebels from their ships ?
what do they in the north when they should serve their sovereign in the west ?
they have not been commanded , mighty king .
most mighty sovereign , you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful .
i never was nor never will be false .
go then and muster men , but leave behind your son george stanley .
my lord , the army of great buckingham— out on you , owls !
nothing but songs of death .
but this good comfort bring i to your highness : the breton navy is dispersed by tempest .
while we reason here , a royal battle might be won and lost .
someone take order buckingham be brought to salisbury .
the rest march on with me .
but , tell me , where is princely richmond now ?
at pembroke , or at ha'rfordwest in wales .
will not king richard let me speak with him ?
no , my good lord .
why , then all souls ' day is my body ’ s doomsday .
this is the day wherein i wished to fall by the false faith of him who most i trusted .
this , this all souls ' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs .
thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points in their masters ' bosoms .
wrong hath but wrong , and blame the due of blame .
i doubt not but his friends will turn to us .
he hath no friends but who are friends for fear .
which in his dearest need will fly from him .
then , in god ’ s name , march .
true hope is swift , and flies with swallow ’ s wings .
kings it makes gods , and meaner creatures kings .
my heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
my lord of norfolk— here , most gracious liege .
norfolk , we must have knocks , ha , must we not ?
we must both give and take , my loving lord .
up with my tent ! —here will i lie tonight .
well , all ’ s one for that .
six or seven thousand is their utmost power .
why , our battalia trebles that account .
besides , the king ’ s name is a tower of strength which they upon the adverse party want .
upon my life , my lord , i ’ ll undertake it .
he lives that loves thee better than he could .
why , that was he .
the selfsame name , but one of better nature .
why dost thou spit at me ?
would it were mortal poison for thy sake .
never came poison from so sweet a place .
never hung poison on a fouler toad .
thou dost infect mine eyes .
thine eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine .
would they were basilisks to strike thee dead .
good night , good captain blunt .
come , gentlemen , let us consult upon tomorrow ’ s business into my tent .
the dew is raw and cold .
what is “ t o ” clock ?
it ’ s suppertime , my lord .
it ’ s nine o'clock .
i will not sup tonight .
give me some ink and paper .
what , is my beaver easier than it was ?
and all my armor laid into my tent ?
good norfolk , hie thee to thy charge .
i go , my lord .
stir with the lark tomorrow , gentle norfolk .
i warrant you , my lord .
sawst thou the melancholy lord northumberland ?
so , i am satisfied .
is ink and paper ready ?
it is , my lord .
ratcliffe , about the mid of night come to my tent and help to arm me .
leave me , i say .
fortune and victory sit on thy helm !
all comfort that the dark night can afford be to thy person , noble father-in-law .
tell me , how fares our loving mother ?
i , by attorney , bless thee from thy mother , who prays continually for richmond ’ s good .
god give us leisure for these rites of love !
be valiant , and speed well .
once more , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
o thou , whose captain i account myself , look on my forces with a gracious eye .
make us thy ministers of chastisement , that we may praise thee in the victory !
to thee i do commend my watchful soul , ere i let fall the windows of mine eyes .
sleeping and waking , o , defend me still !
think upon vaughan , and with guilty fear let fall thy lance .
edward ’ s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .
thy adversary ’ s wife doth pray for thee .
the last was i that felt thy tyranny .
o , in the battle think on buckingham , and die in terror of thy guiltiness .
dream on , dream on , of bloody deeds and death .
but cheer thy heart , and be thou not dismayed .
have mercy , jesu ! —soft , i did but dream .
o coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me !
there ’ s none else by .
richard loves richard ; that is , i and i .
is there a murderer here ?
alack , i love myself .
for any good that i myself have done unto myself ?
alas , i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself .
fool , of thyself speak well .
fool , do not flatter .
zounds , who is there ?
ratcliffe , my lord , ’ tis i .
the early village cock hath twice done salutation to the morn .
your friends are up and buckle on their armor .
o ratcliffe , i have dreamed a fearful dream !
what think ’ st thou , will our friends prove all true ?
no doubt , my lord .
tis not yet near day .
cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here .
how have you slept , my lord ?
methought their souls whose bodies richard murdered came to my tent and cried on victory .
i promise you , my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream .
how far into the morning is it , lords ?
upon the stroke of four .
why , then ’ tis time to arm and give direction .
god and our good cause fight upon our side .
the prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls , like high-reared bulwarks , stand before our faces .
richard except , those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow .
for what is he they follow ?
if you do sweat to put a tyrant down , you sleep in peace , the tyrant being slain .
if you do fight in safeguard of your wives , your wives shall welcome home the conquerors .
then , in the name of god and all these rights , advance your standards .
i never sued to friend , nor enemy ; my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word .
what said northumberland as touching richmond ?
that he was never trainèd up in arms .
and what said surrey then ?
not i , my lord .
the sun will not be seen today .
the sky doth frown and lour upon our army .
i would these dewy tears were from the ground .
arm , arm , my lord .
the foe vaunts in the field .
come , bustle , bustle .
john duke of norfolk , thomas earl of surrey , shall have the leading of this foot and horse .
this , and saint george to boot—what think ’ st thou , norfolk ?
a good direction , warlike sovereign .
this found i on my tent this morning .
amaze the welkin with your broken staves—
will he bring his power ?
my lord , he doth deny to come .
off with his son george ’ s head !
my lord , the enemy is past the marsh .
after the battle let george stanley die .
victory sits on our helms .
rescue , my lord of norfolk , rescue , rescue !
the king enacts more wonders than a man , daring an opposite to every danger .
rescue , fair lord , or else the day is lost !
a horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse !
i ’ ll help you to a horse .
god and your arms be praised , victorious friends !
great god of heaven , say amen to all !
but tell me , is young george stanley living ?
john duke of norfolk , walter , lord ferrers , sir robert brakenbury , and sir william brandon .
and then , as we have ta'en the sacrament , we will unite the white rose and the red .
smile heaven upon this fair conjunction , that long have frowned upon their enmity .
what traitor hears me and says not “ amen ? ” england hath long been mad and scarred herself .
now civil wounds are stopped , peace lives again .
that she may long live here , god say amen .
take up the sword again , or take up me .
though i wish thy death , i will not be the executioner .
that was in thy rage .
to both their deaths shalt thou be accessory .
i would i knew thy heart .
tis figured in my tongue .
i fear me both are false .
then never man was man true .
well , well , put up your sword .
say then my peace is made .
that shall you know hereafter .
but shall i live in hope ?
all men i hope live so .
vouchsafe to wear this ring .
wear both of them , for both of them are thine .
for divers unknown reasons , i beseech you , grant me this boon .
sirs , take up the corse .
towards chertsey , noble lord ?
was ever woman in this humor wooed ?
was ever woman in this humor won ?
i ’ ll have her , but i will not keep her long .
and yet to win her , all the world to nothing !
on me , whose all not equals edward ’ s moiety ?
on me , that halts and am misshapen thus ?
my dukedom to a beggarly denier , i do mistake my person all this while !
upon my life , she finds , although i can not , myself to be a marv'lous proper man .
since i am crept in favor with myself , i will maintain it with some little cost .
but first i ’ ll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love .
there ’ s no doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustomed health .
if he were dead , what would betide on me ?
is it concluded that he shall be protector ?
it is determined , not concluded yet ; but so it must be if the king miscarry .
god make your majesty joyful , as you have been .
saw you the king today , my lord of derby ?
but now the duke of buckingham and i are come from visiting his majesty .
what likelihood of his amendment , lords ?
did you confer with him ?
would all were well—but that will never be .
they do me wrong , and i will not endure it !
who is it that complains unto the king that i , forsooth , am stern and love them not ?
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace ?
to thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace .
when have i injured thee ?
or any of your faction ?
a plague upon you all !
brother of gloucester , you mistake the matter .
the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch .
come , come , we know your meaning , brother gloucester .
you envy my advancement , and my friends ' .
god grant we never may have need of you .
meantime god grants that we have need of you .
because my name is george .
alack , my lord , that fault is none of yours .
he should , for that , commit your godfathers .
o , belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be new christened in the tower .
but what ’ s the matter , clarence ?
i wis , your grandam had a worser match .
my lord of gloucester , i have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs .
by heaven , i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts that oft i have endured .
small joy have i in being england ’ s queen .
so should we you , if you should be our king .
i had rather be a peddler .
hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out in sharing that which you have pilled from me !
which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
foul , wrinkled witch , what mak ’ st thou in my sight ?
but repetition of what thou hast marred .
that will i make before i let thee go .
wert thou not banishèd on pain of death ?
the sorrow that i have by right is yours , and all the pleasures you usurp are mine .
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , outlive thy glory , like my wretched self .
have done thy charm , thou hateful , withered hag .
stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me .
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul .
why , so i did , but looked for no reply .
o , let me make the period to my curse !
tis done by me , and ends in “ margaret. ” thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
the day will come that thou shalt wish for me to help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad .
false-boding woman , end thy frantic curse , lest to thy harm thou move our patience .
foul shame upon you , you have all moved mine .
were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
o , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty !
learn it , learn it , marquess .
it touches you , my lord , as much as me .
and turns the sun to shade .
urge neither charity nor shame to me .
uncharitably with me have you dealt , and shamefully my hopes by you are butchered .
my charity is outrage , life my shame , and in that shame still live my sorrows ' rage .
have done , have done .
thy garments are not spotted with our blood , nor thou within the compass of my curse .
nor no one here , for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air .
what doth she say , my lord of buckingham ?
nothing that i respect , my gracious lord .
my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .
i muse why she ’ s at liberty .
i can not blame her .
i never did her any , to my knowledge .
yet you have all the vantage of her wrong .
god pardon them that are the cause thereof .
so do i ever for had i cursed now , i had cursed myself .
yea , richard , when i know , for i protest as yet i do not .
and for my name of george begins with it follows in his thought that i am he .
why , this it is when men are ruled by women .
tis not the king that sends you to the tower .
my lady grey his wife , clarence , ’ tis she that tempers him to this extremity .
we wait upon your grace .
i do the wrong , and first begin to brawl .
are you now going to dispatch this thing ?
i have it here about me .
tut , tut , my lord , we will not stand to prate .
talkers are no good doers .
be assured we go to use our hands and not our tongues .
your eyes drop millstones , when fools ' eyes drop tears .
go , go , dispatch .
we will , my noble lord .
why looks your grace so heavily today ?
what was your dream , my lord ?
i pray you tell me .
had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep ?
no marvel , lord , though it affrighted you .
i am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it .
my soul is heavy , and i fain would sleep .
i will , my lord .
god give your grace good rest .
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , makes the night morning , and the noontide night .
princes have but their titles for their glories , an outward honor for an inward toil ,
what wouldst thou , fellow ?
and how cam ’ st thou hither ?
i would speak with clarence , and i came hither on my legs .
tis better , sir , to be brief than tedious.—let him see our commission , and talk no more .
i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands .
there lies the duke asleep , and there the keys .
tis a point of wisdom .
what , shall i stab him as he sleeps ?
he ’ ll say ’ twas done cowardly , when he wakes .
why , he shall never wake until the great judgment day .
why , then he ’ ll say we stabbed him sleeping .
the urging of that word “ judgment ” hath bred a kind of remorse in me .
what , art thou afraid ?
i thought thou hadst been resolute .
so i am—to let him live .
i ’ ll back to the duke of gloucester and tell him so .
nay , i prithee stay a little .
i hope this passionate humor of mine will change .
it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty .
how dost thou feel thyself now ?
faith , some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me .
remember our reward when the deed ’ s done .
i had forgot the reward .
where ’ s thy conscience now ?
o , in the duke of gloucester ’ s purse .
so when he opens his purse to give us our reward , thy conscience flies out .
there ’ s few or none will entertain it .
what if it come to thee again ?
i ’ ll not meddle with it .
tis a blushing , shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man ’ s bosom .
he can not prevail with me .
spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation .
come , shall we fall to work ?
o excellent device— and make a sop of him .
no , we ’ ll reason with him .
where art thou , keeper ?
give me a cup of wine .
you shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .
in god ’ s name , what art thou ?
a man , as you are .
but not , as i am , royal .
nor you , as we are , loyal .
thy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble .
my voice is now the king ’ s , my looks mine own .
your eyes do menace me .
to , to , to— to murder me ?
wherein , my friends , have i offended you ?
offended us you have not , but the king .
i shall be reconciled to him again .
are you drawn forth among a world of men to slay the innocent ?
where is the evidence that doth accuse me ?
what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge ?
or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence ' death before i be convict by course of law ?
to threaten me with death is most unlawful .
what we will do , we do upon command .
an please your worship , brakenbury , you may partake of anything we say .
we speak no treason , man .
how say you , sir ?
can you deny all this ?
with this , my lord , myself have naught to do .
i do beseech your grace to pardon me , and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke .
and he that hath commanded is our king .
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too .
whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend .
for whose sake did i that ill deed ?
for edward , for my brother , for his sake .
if god will be avengèd for this deed , o , know you yet he doth it publicly !
my brother ’ s love , the devil , and my rage .
i am his brother , and i love him well .
your brother gloucester hates you .
o , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear .
go you to him from me .
ay , so we will .
bid gloucester think of this , and he will weep .
ay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep .
right , as snow in harvest .
come , you deceive yourself .
tis he that sends us to destroy you here .
make peace with god , for you must die , my lord .
relent , and save your souls .
ay , you would beg , were you in my distress .
look behind you , my lord .
take that , and that .
what mean ’ st thou , that thou help ’ st me not ?
by heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been .
i would he knew that i had saved his brother .
go , coward as thou art .
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
then plainly know my heart ’ s dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet .
holy saint francis , what a change is here !
is rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , so soon forsaken ?
young men ’ s love then lies not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , thou and these woes were all for rosaline .
pronounce this sentence then : women may fall when there ’ s no strength in men .
thou chid ’ st me oft for loving rosaline .
for doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
and badest me bury love .
not in a grave , to lay one in , another out to have .
i pray thee , chide not .
the other did not so .
oh , she knew well thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .
oh , let us hence .
i stand on sudden haste .
they stumble that run fast .
where the devil should this romeo be ?
came he not home tonight ?
not to his father ’ s .
i spoke with his man .
tybalt , the kinsman to old capulet , hath sent a letter to his father ’ s house .
a challenge , on my life .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
nay , he will answer the letter ’ s master , how he dares , being dared .
and is he a man to encounter tybalt ?
why , what is tybalt ?
without his roe , like a dried herring .
o flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in .
good morrow to you both .
what counterfeit did i give you ?
the slip , sir , the slip .
nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
i serve as good a man as you .
you know not what you do .
what , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
come between us , good benvolio .
switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or i ’ ll cry a match .
was i with you there for the goose ?
thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
nay , good goose , bite not .
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting .
it is a most sharp sauce .
and is it not well served into a sweet goose ?
why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
oh , thou art deceived .
here ’ s goodly gear .
two , two—a shirt and a smock .
god ye good morrow , gentlemen .
god ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .
what a man are you ?
one , gentlewoman , that god hath made , himself to mar .
by my troth , it is well said .
for himself to mar , ” quoth he ?
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo ?
i am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
yea , is the worst well ?
very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
she will indite him to some supper .
romeo , will you come to your father ’ s ?
we ’ ll to dinner , thither .
and if i can not , i ’ ll find those that shall .
i am none of his flirt-gills .
i am none of his skains-mates .
i saw no man use you at his pleasure .
if i had , my weapon should quickly have been out , i warrant you .
now , afore god , i am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
i protest unto thee— good heart , and i ' faith , i will tell her as much .
lord , lord , she will be a joyful woman .
what wilt thou tell her , nurse ?
thou dost not mark me .
and there she shall at friar lawrence ' cell be shrived and married .
and stay , good nurse .
be trusty , and i ’ ll quit thy pains .
commend me to thy mistress .
now god in heaven bless thee !
what sayst thou , my dear nurse ?
did you ne'er hear say , “ two may keep counsel , putting one away ” ?
warrant thee , my man ’ s as true as steel .
well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady.—lord , lord !
i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man .
doth not ay , nurse , what of that ?
both with an ah , mocker , that ’ s the dog ’ s name .
commend me to thy lady .
ay , a thousand times.—peter !
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse .
perchance she can not meet him .
that ’ s not so .
oh , she is lame !
had she affections and warm youthful blood , she would be as swift in motion as a ball .
my words would bandy her to my sweet love , and his to me .
o god , she comes.—o honey nurse , what news ?
hast thou met with him ?
peter , stay at the gate .
now , good sweet nurse— o lord , why look ’ st thou sad ?
though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .
fie , how my bones ache !
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news .
can you not stay awhile ?
do you not see that i am out of breath ?
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
is thy news good , or bad ?
say either , and i ’ ll stay the circumstance .
is ’ t good or bad ?
well , you have made a simple choice .
you know not how to choose a man .
go thy ways , wench .
what , have you dined at home ?
but all this did i know before .
what says he of our marriage ?
my back a ' t ' other side .
ah , my back , my back !
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well .
sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
why , she is within .
your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'where is your mother ?
o god ’ s lady dear , are you so hot ?
marry , come up , i trow .
is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
henceforward do your messages yourself .
here ’ s such a coil .
come , what says romeo ?
have you got leave to go to shrift today ?
then hie you hence to friar lawrence ’ s cell .
there stays a husband to make you a wife .
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .
they ’ ll be in scarlet straight at any news .
i ’ ll to dinner .
hie you to the cell .
i do but keep the peace .
put up thy sword , or manage it to part these men with me .
what , drawn , and talk of peace ?
i hate the word , as i hate hell , all montagues , and thee .
have at thee , coward !
clubs , bills , and partisans !
my sword , i say !
old montague is come , and flourishes his blade in spite of me .
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
oh , so light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
good even to my ghostly confessor .
romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
as much to him , else is his thanks too much .
conceit , more rich in matter than in words , brags of his substance , not of ornament .
come , come with me , and we will make short work .
i pray thee , good mercutio , let ’ s retire .
am i like such a fellow ?
what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter ?
with another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !
by my head , here comes the capulets .
by my heel , i care not .
make it a word and a blow .
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
could you not take some occasion without giving ?
mercutio , thou consort ’ st with romeo .
what , dost thou make us minstrels ?
an thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
we talk here in the public haunt of men .
either withdraw unto some private place , and reason coldly of your grievances , or else depart .
here all eyes gaze on us .
men ’ s eyes were made to look and let them gaze .
i will not budge for no man ’ s pleasure , i .
well , peace be with you , sir .
but i ’ ll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .
i see thou know ’ st me not .
boy , this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me .
and so , good capulet—which name i tender as dearly as my own—be satisfied .
o calm dishonourable , vile submission !
what wouldst thou have with me ?
will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?
make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
gentle mercutio , put thy rapier up .
a plague o ' both your houses !
is he gone and hath nothing ?
what , art thou hurt ?
marry , ’ tis enough .
where is my page ? —go , villain , fetch a surgeon .
the hurt can not be much .
ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
i am peppered , i warrant , for this world .
a plague o ' both your houses !
zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !
a braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
why the devil came you between us ?
i was hurt under your arm .
i thought all for the best .
help me into some house , benvolio , or i shall faint .
a plague o ' both your houses !
they have made worms ' meat of me .
i have it , and soundly too .
o romeo , romeo , brave mercutio is dead !
here comes the furious tybalt back again .
alive in triumph—and mercutio slain !
either thou or i , or both , must go with him .
thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here shalt with him hence .
romeo , away , be gone !
the citizens are up , and tybalt slain .
the prince will doom thee death if thou art taken .
hence , be gone , away !
which way ran he that killed mercutio ?
tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
were you by when it began ?
where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
o noble prince , i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .
there lies the man , slain by young romeo , that slew thy kinsman , brave mercutio .
o my brother ’ s child !
benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?
romeo , he cries aloud , “ hold , friends !
and , as he fell , did romeo turn and fly .
this is the truth , or let benvolio die .
some twenty of them fought in this black strife , and all those twenty could but kill one life .
i beg for justice , which thou , prince , must give .
romeo slew him ; he slew mercutio .
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
his fault concludes but what the law should end , the life of tybalt .
i have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses .
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , therefore use none .
bear hence this body and attend our will .
mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch ?
ay , ay , the cords .
ay me , what news ?
why dost thou wring thy hands ?
we are undone , lady , we are undone !
can heaven be so envious ?
romeo can , though heaven can not .
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
this torture should be roared in dismal hell .
say thou but “ ay , ” and that bare vowel than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .
to prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .
vile earth , to earth resign .
o tybalt , tybalt , the best friend i had !
that ever i should live to see thee dead .
is romeo slaughtered , and is tybalt dead ?
my dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?
tybalt is gone , and romeo banishèd .
o god , did romeo ’ s hand shed tybalt ’ s blood ?
it did , it did .
alas the day , it did .
o serpent heart hid with a flowering face !
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !
was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound ?
blistered be thy tongue for such a wish !
he was not born to shame .
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , for ’ tis a throne where honor may be crowned .
sole monarch of the universal earth , oh , what a beast was i to chide at him !
will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?
but wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
that villain cousin would have killed my husband .
tybalt is dead , and romeo banishèd . ”
that “ banishèd , ” that one word “ banishèd ” hath slain ten thousand tybalts .
tybalt ’ s death was woe enough , if it had ended there .
no words can that woe sound .
where is my father and my mother , nurse ?
weeping and wailing over tybalt ’ s corse .
will you go to them ?
i will bring you thither .
wash they his wounds with tears ?
mine shall be spent when theirs are dry , for romeo ’ s banishment .
take up those cords.—poor ropes , you are beguiled , both you and i , for romeo is exiled .
he made you for a highway to my bed , but i , a maid , die maiden-widowèd .
and death , not romeo , take my maidenhead !
i ’ ll find romeo to comfort you .
i wot well where he is .
hark ye , your romeo will be here at night .
i ’ ll to him .
he is hid at lawrence ' cell .
come forth , thou fearful man .
too familiar is my dear son with such sour company .
i bring thee tidings of the prince ’ s doom .
what less than doomsday is the prince ’ s doom ?
do not say “ banishment. ” hence from verona art thou banishèd .
be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
there is no world without verona walls but purgatory , torture , hell itself .
hence “ banishèd ” is banished from the world , and world ’ s exile is death .
tis torture and not mercy .
more validity , more honorable state , more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo .
flies may do this , but i from this must fly .
they are free men , but i am banishèd .
and sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
o friar , the damnèd use that word in hell .
thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
here were the servants of your adversary , and yours , close fighting ere i did approach .
i drew to part them .
oh , where is romeo ?
right glad i am he was not at this fray .
towards him i made , but he was 'ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood .
oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
oh , then i see that madmen have no ears .
how should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
good romeo , hide thyself .
not i , unless the breath of heartsick groans , mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .
what ’ s your will ?
o holy friar , o , tell me , holy friar , where is my lady ’ s lord ?
oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , just in her case .
o woeful sympathy , piteous predicament !
even so lies she , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
stand , an you be a man .
for juliet ’ s sake , for her sake , rise and stand .
why should you fall into so deep an o ?
ah sir , ah sir .
death ’ s the end of all .
how is it with her ?
and what says my concealed lady to our canceled love ?
tell me , that i may sack the hateful mansion .
thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast .
by my holy order , i thought thy disposition better tempered .
why rail ’ st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?
what , rouse thee , man !
thy juliet is alive , for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead— there art thou happy .
tybalt would kill thee , but thou slew ’ st tybalt—there art thou happy .
the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile—there art thou happy .
a pack of blessings light upon thy back , happiness courts thee in her best array ,
but , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , thou pout ’ st upon thy fortune and thy love .
go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .
ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .
o lord , i could have stayed here all the night to hear good counsel .
oh , what learning is !
do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
how well my comfort is revived by this !
look you , she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly , and so did i .
well , we were born to die .
these times of woe afford no time to woo .
commend me to your daughter .
i will , and know her mind early tomorrow .
tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
sir paris , i will make a desperate tender of my child ’ s love .
do you like this haste ?
we ’ ll keep no great ado , a friend or two .
therefore we ’ ll have some half a dozen friends , and there an end .
but what say you to thursday ?
my lord , i would that thursday were tomorrow .
o ' thursday be it , then.— go you to juliet ere you go to bed .
it is not yet near day .
it was the nightingale , and not the lark , that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .
look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .
night ’ s candles are burnt out , and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
yon light is not daylight , i know it , i .
thou need ’ st not to be gone .
let me be put to death .
i am content , so thou wilt have it so .
i have more care to stay than will to go .
come , death , and welcome !
it is , it is .
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
some say the lark makes sweet division .
this doth not so , for she divideth us .
more light and light it grows .
more light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
then , window , let day in and let life out .
one kiss , and i ’ ll descend .
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
i neither know it nor can learn of him .
have you importuned him by any means ?
art thou gone so , love , lord ?
oh , by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo .
i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
oh , think ’ st thou we shall ever meet again ?
o god , i have an ill-divining soul .
methinks i see thee now , thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
either my eyesight fails , or thou look ’ st pale .
and trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
dry sorrow drinks our blood .
all men call thee fickle .
who is ’ t that calls ?
is it my lady mother ?
what unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?
why , how now , juliet ?
madam , i am not well .
evermore weeping for your cousin ’ s death ?
what , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
an if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .
some grief shows much of love , but much of grief shows still some want of wit .
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
so shall you feel the loss , but not the friend which you weep for .
feeling so the loss , can not choose but ever weep the friend .
that same villain , romeo .
that is because the traitor murderer lives .
ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
would none but i might venge my cousin ’ s death !
and then , i hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughtered him !
find thou the means , and i ’ ll find such a man .
but now i ’ ll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
and joy comes well in such a needy time .
what are they , beseech your ladyship ?
well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .
madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
i pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , i will not marry yet .
tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
what , still in tears , evermore showering ?
have you delivered to her our decree ?
i would the fool were married to her grave !
how , will she none ?
not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
how , how , how , how ?
out , you green sickness , carrion !
what , are you mad ?
good father , i beseech you on my knees , hear me with patience but to speak a word .
out on her , hilding !
god in heaven bless her !
you are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
and why , my lady wisdom ?
smatter with your gossips , go .
oh , god ' i ' good e'en .
peace , you mumbling fool !
utter your gravity o'er a gossip ’ s bowl , for here we need it not .
lay hand on heart , advise .
an you be mine , i ’ ll give you to my friend .
trust to ’ t , bethink you .
i ’ ll not be forsworn .
delay this marriage for a month , a week .
or , if you do not , make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies .
talk not to me , for i ’ ll not speak a word .
do as thou wilt , for i have done with thee .
o god ! —o nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
my husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
hast thou not a word of joy ?
oh , he ’ s a lovely gentleman .
romeo ’ s a dishclout to him .
speakest thou from thy heart ?
well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much .
marry , i will , and this is wisely done .
i ’ ll to the friar to know his remedy .
if all else fail , myself have power to die .
the time is very short .
you say you do not know the lady ’ s mind .
now do you know the reason of this haste .
look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
happily met , my lady and my wife .
that may be , sir , when i may be a wife .
is the day so young ?
was that my father that went hence so fast ?
not having that which , having , makes them short .
where shall we dine ? —o me !
that “ may be ” must be , love , on thursday next .
what must be shall be .
that ’ s a certain text .
come you to make confession to this father ?
to answer that , i should confess to you .
do not deny to him that you love me .
i will confess to you that i love him .
so will ye , i am sure , that you love me .
poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
my leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now.— my lord , we must entreat the time alone .
god shield i should disturb devotion ! — juliet , on thursday early will i rouse ye .
o juliet , i already know thy grief .
i hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , on thursday next be married to this county .
tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .
let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .
no warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .
give me , give me !
love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
you shall have none ill , sir , for i ’ ll try if they can lick their fingers .
how canst thou try them so ?
therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .
we shall be much unfurnished for this time .
see where she comes from shrift with merry look .
go tell him of this .
i ’ ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .
why , i am glad on ’ t .
our whole city is much bound to him .
no , not till thursday .
we ’ ll to church tomorrow .
tush , i will stir about , and all things shall be well , i warrant thee , wife .
go thou to juliet , help to deck up her .
i ’ ll not to bed tonight .
i ’ ll play the housewife for this once .
ay , those attires are best .
what , are you busy , ho ?
for , i am sure , you have your hands full all in this so sudden business .
farewell ! —god knows when we shall meet again .
my dismal scene i needs must act alone .
what if this mixture do not work at all ?
shall i be married then tomorrow morning ?
stay , tybalt , stay !
romeo , romeo , romeo !
no , coz , i rather weep .
good heart , at what ?
why , such is love ’ s transgression .
a madness most discreet , a choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
and if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
tut , i have lost myself .
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
what , shall i groan and tell thee ?
but sadly , tell me who .
hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , nurse .
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
come , stir , stir , stir !
the second cock hath crowed .
the curfew bell hath rung .
spare not for the cost .
go , you cot-quean , go .
get you to bed , faith .
you ’ ll be sick tomorrow for this night ’ s watching .
i have watched ere now all night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .
a jealous hood , a jealous hood !
now , fellow , what is there ?
make haste , make haste , sirrah .
mass , and well said .
a merry whoreson , ha !
thou shalt be loggerhead.—good faith , ’ tis day .
what , nurse , i say !
go and trim her up .
i ’ ll go and chat with paris .
hie , make haste , make haste .
the bridegroom he is come already .
make haste , i say .
juliet ! —fast , i warrant her , she.— why , lamb !
