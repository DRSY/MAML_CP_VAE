i have half a mind to hit you before you speak again .
madam , he ’ s well .
that ’ s well spoken .
and he ’ s friendly with caesar .
you are an honest man .
caesar and he are better friends than ever .
i ’ m going to make you a rich man .
you say he ’ s friendly with caesar , healthy , and free .
i didn ’ t say free , madam .
no , i didn ’ t say that .
he ’ s bound to octavia .
for the favor of sleeping in her bed .
i ’ m sick , charmian .
he ’ s married to octavia , madam .
may you die of the worst disease !
good madam , be patient .
what did you say to me ?
get out , you horrible bastard , or i ’ ll gouge out your eyes .
i ’ ll scalp you .
the blows i gave you already will make up for your upsetting me .
he ’ s married , madam .
rogue , you ’ ve lived too long !
no way , then , i ’ ll run .
what ’ s the matter with you , madam ?
i haven ’ t done anything to you .
good madam , restrain yourself .
the man hasn ’ t done anything wrong .
even innocents can not always escape disaster .
may egypt drown in the nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes .
even though i ’ m mad , i won ’ t bite him .
he ’ s afraid to come in .
i won ’ t hurt him .
it may be honest , but it ’ s never wise to bring bad news .
you can give good news in many ways , but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it .
i ’ ve only done my duty .
may the gods destroy you !
do you maintain the same story ?
do you want me to lie , madam ?
even if you were as handsome as i beg your highness ’ pardon .
please don ’ t be offended that i don ’ t want to offend you any more .
it ’ s not fair to punish me for something you make me do .
he ’ s married to octavia .
it ’ s too bad that antony ’ s fault should make you look like a jerk .
the merchandise you bring from rome is too expensive for me .
let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you .
be patient , your highness .
when i have praised antony , i ’ ve disparaged caesar .
i ’ m being repaid for that now .
help me out of here .
oh , iras , charmian !
it doesn ’ t matter .
don ’ t let him leave out the color of her hair .
bring me his answers quickly .
even though half of him is like a
i don ’ t make fortunes ; i only see them .
then see a good one for me .
no , he means you ’ ll use makeup when you ’ re old .
may my wrinkles forbid that !
don ’ t joke about his predictions .
you will love more than you are loved .
why did cassius conspire against caesar ?
pompey , you can not frighten us with your navy .
we ’ ll meet you at sea .
yes , on land you do outnumber me .
even more since you annexed my father ’ s house and lands .
but since , to get back to the matter at hand , what do you think of our proposal ?
that ’ s the point .
don ’ t let us talk you into anything , but consider carefully the value of our offers .
you have offered me the lands of sicily and sardinia .
in return , i must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to rome .
if i agree to this , we may leave unharmed , with our shields undented .
that ’ s our offer .
you should know that when i came here i was prepared to accept your offer .
let me shake your hand .
i didn ’ t think i would see you here .
the east is very seductive .
it ’ s good we had this meeting .
i hope it works out for the best , lepidus .
so we are in agreement .
that ’ s the next thing on the agenda .
we ’ ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways .
i ’ ll give the first one , pompey .
whether your banquet is first or last , your egyptian cooking will make it the best .
i heard that julius caesar got fat from all the feasting there .
you ’ ve heard a lot .
i mean well , sir .
i ’ m sure you do .
i ’ ve heard a lot more .
i heard that apollodorus carried— what did he carry , please ?
how are you , soldier ?
let me shake your hand .
i ’ ve never been your enemy .
i ’ ve seen you fight and envied your skill .
enjoy your frankness ; it suits you .
i invite you all aboard my ship .
after you , my lords ?
show us the way , sir .
i think it was at sea .
that it was , sir .
you ’ ve done well at sea .
and you ’ ve done well on land .
i ’ ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what i ’ ve accomplished on land can not be denied .
neither can my accomplishments at sea .
as you were on land .
that ’ s the one part of my service on land i do deny .
but let ’ s shake hands , menas .
if our eyes were policemen , they might capture two thieves at once while we ’ re embracing .
men ’ s faces are truthful , whatever their hands do .
but no beautiful woman has an honest face .
that ’ s no lie .
we came here to fight against you .
for my part , i ’ m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match .
today pompey laughs away his fortune .
if that ’ s true , he won ’ t get it back by crying .
that ’ s the truth , sir .
we didn ’ t expect mark antony to be here .
is he married to cleopatra ?
caesar ’ s sister is named octavia .
that ’ s true , sir .
she was previously caius marcellus ’ wife .
but she is now mark antony ’ s wife .
then caesar and he will always be united .
if i were to make a prediction regarding this union , i wouldn ’ t say that .
i think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love .
but you ’ ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them .
octavia has a pious , chaste , meek disposition .
doesn ’ t everyone want a wife like that ?
not someone who doesn ’ t share that disposition , meaning mark antony .
he ’ ll go back to his egyptian dish .
antony will go where his passion is .
he only married out of political necessity .
then that ’ s the way it may turn out .
come on , sir , will you come aboard ?
i want to drink your health .
i ’ ll join you , sir .
we did a lot of drinking in egypt .
here ’ s where they ’ ll end up , on the floor .
some of them are leaning already .
lepidus is red in the face .
they made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor .
they know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty .
the higher the nile flows , the better the harvest .
the harvest comes shortly after that .
do you have unusual snakes there ?
the egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the nile mud , just like the crocodile .
i don ’ t feel so well , but i won ’ t stop .
not until you pass out .
i ’ m afraid you ’ ll keep going until then .
i ’ ve heard that the pyramids build by the ptolemies are splendid .
without doubt i ’ ve heard that .
what does a crocodile look like ?
sir , it ’ s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width .
it is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs .
it ’ s a strange snake .
and its tears are wet .
i ’ ve always had great respect for your destiny .
you ’ ve served me faithfully .
what else can i say ?
would you like to be king of the entire world ?
now i ’ ve said it twice .
be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune .
tell me that i ’ ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them .
then my children will probably be illegitimate .
tell me , please : how many boys and girls will i have ?
you seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
we ’ ll all want our fortune told .
my fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed .
no , pompey , i haven ’ t had anything to drink .
the three who share the known world are aboard your boat .
everything that belongs to them is yours .
oh , you should have done it without telling me !
for you to do it would be good service .
regret that your mouth betrayed your actions .
but now i must condemn it .
give it up and go drink .
this toast is for lepidus !
here ’ s to you , menas .
i accept with thanks , enobarbus .
there goes a strong fellow , menas .
why do you say that ?
he carries a third of the world .
can ’ t you see that ?
then a third of the world is drunk .
this hasn ’ t reached the level of an egyptian feast yet .
it ’ s getting there .
clink your cups together in a toast !
here ’ s to caesar .
i could do without another toast .
but i would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one .
let ’ s have one , good soldier .
come , let ’ s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
how can you top that ?
let ’ s shake on it .
come , this way to the rowboat .
be careful not to fall in .
menas , i ’ m not going back on shore .
no , come to my cabin .
there ’ s my hat !
come on , noble captain .
now i ’ ve paid you back , parthia , and gotten revenge for marcus crassus ’ death .
a man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain ’ s rival .
i could do more to help antony , but to do so would insult him .
a soldier is just a tool , like his sword , unless he has your qualities , ventidius .
are you going to write antony about this ?
where ’ s antony now ?
they finished their business with pompey , and pompey has left .
octavia weeps at the thought of leaving rome .
caesar is in a sober mood .
he ’ s a stylish man .
and how he loves caesar !
yes , but how he adores mark antony !
then what ’ s antony ?
a god of a god ?
are you talking about caesar ?
he ’ s without equal !
he certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments .
he loves caesar best , but he also loves antony .
they are his dung , and he their beetle .
so , there ’ s the signal to ride .
good luck , worthy soldier , and good-bye .
you can ’ t go any further with us , sir .
don ’ t insult me with your distrust .
i mean what i say .
you won ’ t find any cause for anxiety , even if you look for one .
we ’ ll leave you here .
good-bye , my dearest sister , good-bye .
i hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease .
her eyes are like april : full of showers .
what is it , octavia ?
i ’ ll tell you privately .
see , now i have you .
and thus i let you go and give you to the gods .
like the oh stop it , you lusty bed-hopper .
you can ’ t see the future .
your fortunes are the same .
i ’ ve said what i have to say .
isn ’ t my fortune just a little better than hers ?
not in my husband ’ s nose .
may heaven save us from indecent thoughts !
therefore , dear isis , do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
he ’ s afraid to come in .
oh , come on.—come here , sir .
i ’ ll have herod ’ s head chopped off !
i saw her face as she walked with her brother and mark antony .
is she as tall as i am ?
she is not , madam .
did you hear her speak ?
is her voice pitched high or low ?
madam , i heard her speak .
she has a low-pitched voice .
that ’ s not in her favor .
he can ’ t like her very long .
oh , isis , that ’ s impossible .
you ’ re right , charmian .
she has a body , not a life .
if not , then i have no powers of observation .
there aren ’ t three people in all of egypt who could do better .
she doesn ’ t have anything going for her so far .
do you hear that , charmian ?
and i think she ’ s at least thirty .
do you remember her face ?
was it long or round ?
round enough to be unattractive .
usually that means a person is foolish .
what color is her hair ?
brown , madam , and she wouldn ’ t want her forehead to be any lower .
you mustn ’ t hold my earlier outburst against me .
i ’ ll hire you again to go back to rome .
my letters are ready to go .
he ’ s an admirable man .
i ’ m very sorry i was so hard on him .
not a bit , madam .
everything may still be all right .
i assure you it is , madam .
no lady could be more miserable than i if you two disagree .
gentle octavia , support the one that supports you .
in the meantime , i ’ ll raise an army that will surpass his .
may the god of power make me , the weakest of the weak , your mediator .
when you find out who started this disagreement , turn your anger upon them .
order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions .
how goes it , friend eros ?
some startling news has just arrived , sir .
caesar and lepidus declared war against pompey .
that ’ s old news .
so the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him .
another thing , domitius : antony wants to see you now .
i should have waited to tell you my news .
come with me , sir .
in alexandria he condemned rome , and that ’ s not all .
he did this in public ?
he gave syria , cilicia , and phoenicia to ptolemy .
let ’ s send this news to rome .
the roman people are fed up with his arrogance already .
the people have heard it already , and they ’ ve been told of his accusations .
he accuses me of withholding his share of sextus pompeius ’ possessions , which we seized in sicily .
then he says i didn ’ t return some ships he loaned me .
sir , these accusations should be answered .
it has been done already , and the messenger is on his way .
i answered that lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position .
he ’ ll never agree to that .
then we won ’ t agree to his demands .
greetings , caesar , my lord !
oh , to think you ’ ve been rejected !
you ’ ve never thought of me like that , and you have no reason to .
then why did you travel so quietly ?
you didn ’ t arrive like caesar ’ s sister .
the dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven .
i would have met you by sea and again by land .
mark antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him .
which he quickly allowed , given that you ’ re an obstacle to his lust .
have you seen my lord ?
wasn ’ t he here ?
he was in a good mood , and then suddenly he started thinking of rome .
here , at your service .
your wife , fulvia , mustered her army first .
don ’ t say that , my lord .
where do you think he is now ?
he ’ s in athens , my lord .
no , he ’ s not .
i ’ m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other .
you ’ re welcome here .
you will always be welcome to me .
every heart in rome loves and pities you .
you are welcome here , sister .
i beg you to continue to be patient .
but why , why , why ?
you opposed my taking part in the war .
isn ’ t this war against me ?
why shouldn ’ t i be there in person ?
may the tongues of our critics rot !
don ’ t argue against it .
i won ’ t stay behind .
no , i ’ ve had my say .
no one admires speed more than the lazy .
why do you want to do that , my lord ?
because he ’ s daring us to do it .
so you ’ ve dared him to single combat .
yes , and you dared caesar to fight the battle at pharsalia , where he fought against pompey .
but caesar ignores offers that don ’ t give him an advantage , and so should you .
yours are slow and awkward .
refusing to fight him at sea won ’ t disgrace you .
i ’ ll fight at sea .
even if we fail at that , we can still fight him on land .
what ’ s your business ?
the news is true , my lord .
what ’ s the news , brave soldier ?
oh , don ’ t fight by sea , noble emperor !
don ’ t trust rotten planks .
don ’ t you trust my sword and these wounds ?
let the egyptians and phoenicians go swimming .
we are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe .
well , well , let ’ s go .
by hercules , i think i ’ m right .
our leader is being led .
on land you keep the legions and cavalry together , don ’ t you ?
caesar ’ s speed defies belief .
who ’ s his lieutenant , do you know ?
a man named taurus , they say .
i know the man well .
the emperor is calling for canidius .
the present time is like a woman in labor , each minute giving birth to some piece of news .
don ’ t attack by land .
don ’ t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea .
our fate depends on this chance .
assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill , in sight of caesar ’ s navy .
i can ’ t watch any more .
the egyptian flagship , the gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them !
what ’ s wrong with you ?
we have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness .
we have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces .
the sight made me so sick i couldn ’ t watch any more .
well , give me the worst news .
the bearer of bad news is often blamed for it .
only if the hearer is a fool or a coward .
as far as i ’ m concerned , what ’ s past is done .
call cleopatra what the romans call her .
i never saw such a shameful act .
the battle on the sea is almost lost .
if our general had been his old self , we would have won .
oh , with his sordid desertion , he sets the example for our own .
are you considering desertion , as well ?
then everything must really be finished .
i ’ ll yield my legions and cavalry to caesar .
i ’ m completely lost .
i have a ship full of treasure .
escape and make peace with caesar .
i ’ ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run .
i ’ ve decided on a plan that doesn ’ t require your assistance .
oh , i followed something i ’ m ashamed to look at now !
i ’ ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you .
please , don ’ t be sad , and don ’ t tell me how reluctant you are .
take your cues from my own despair .
abandon the person that has abandoned himself .
go to the harbor immediately !
i ’ ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure .
just give me a moment , please—only a moment .
i ’ ve relinquished my authority , so please—i ’ ll see you all before long .
oh , damn , damn , damn !
madam , oh , good empress !
the queen is here , my lord .
go to him , madam , speak to him .
he ’ s not himself because he feels so ashamed .
well , then , help me .
most noble sir , stand up .
she ’ s weak and will die unless you comfort her .
i ’ ve destroyed my reputation , a most shameful error .
sir , here ’ s the queen .
oh , where have you led me , egypt ?
oh , my lord , my lord , forgive my panic !
i didn ’ t think you would follow me .
now i will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man .
don ’ t shed even one tear .
one of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost .
let the envoy from antony come in .
humble as i am , i represent antony .
until recently , i was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean .
say what you ’ re here for .
that ’ s all he asks for himself .
cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority .
as for antony , i ’ m not interested in his requests .
then i ’ ll listen to her .
give my answer to them both .
may good luck follow you !
take him safely through the lines .
observe how antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions .
what are we going to do , enobarbus ?
think about our situation , then die .
who is to blame for this : antony or i ?
only antony was at fault .
why should he have followed you ?
please , let ’ s not talk about it .
the queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up ?
that ’ s what he says .
your head , my lord ?
a messenger has arrived from caesar .
with no more ceremony than that ?
see , ladies , how they scorn me now .
i ’ ll be at your service .
he ’ s waiting outside .
what ’ s your message ?
your wife , fulvia , is dead .
it is for your ears only .
there are only friends here .
so they are possibly antony ’ s friends .
sir , he should have as many as caesar has .
if caesar chose , antony would jump at the chance to be his friend .
as for us , you know we are antony ’ s , and he is caesar ’ s .
just remember that he is caesar .
he knows that you didn ’ t embrace antony because you loved him , but because you feared him .
he is like a god and knows the truth .
my honor wasn ’ t given ; it was only dominated .
shall i tell caesar what you request from him ?
he almost begs for the opportunity to help you .
it would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you .
what ’ s your name ?
most kind messenger , tell great caesar that through his deputy i kiss his conquering hand .
tell him i am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him .
who are you , slave ?
take away this lout and whip him .
by the moon and stars !
whip him , fellows , until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy !
caesar ’ s knave will bring him a message for us .
my good lord— you ’ ve always been a liar .
oh , has it come to this ?
you were a cold crumb on dead julius caesar ’ s plate when i met you .
why are you doing this ?
did he beg my pardon ?
he did ask for mercy .
you , my earthly moon , are now eclipsed , and that alone foretells my ruin .
in order to flatter caesar , would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants ?
don ’ t you know me still ?
has your heart cooled toward me ?
as it dissolves , so shall my life .
i will fight him there .
our land forces have bravely stood firm .
our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail , as formidable as the sea itself .
where have you been , my bravery ?
do you hear what i say , lady ?
my sword and i will earn our place in history .
that ’ s my brave lord !
i ’ ll fight brutally .
but now i ’ ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me .
come , let ’ s have one more extravagant night .
invite all my sad captains .
let ’ s drink through midnight .
it ’ s my birthday .
we ’ ll win yet .
now he ’ ll work himself up to a fury .
when courage consumes reason , it destroys its only weapon .
i ’ ll look for some way to leave his service .
don ’ t give him time to catch his breath .
anger does not protect the angry well .
tell our top commanders that i want tomorrow ’ s battle to be the last we fight .
our army has recently acquired many of mark antony ’ s former soldiers—enough to capture him .
see that it is done , and prepare a feast for the soldiers .
we have enough supplies for it , and they ’ ve earned it .
what would you like , sir ?
i have to leave right away .
that will kill our lovers .
we know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them .
if we leave , it will feel like nothing less than death to them .
if it ’ s that important , then let the women die .
if cleopatra hears even a breath of this , she ’ ll die immediately .
i ’ ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before , and for far less reason .
i think there must be something invigorating about death , since she dies with such enthusiasm .
she ’ s more cunning than anyone can imagine .
her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods .
he won ’ t fight with me , domitius ?
why won ’ t he ?
tomorrow , soldier , i ’ ll fight by sea and land .
when i strike , i ’ ll cry , “ all or nothing ! ” well put .
call out my household servants .
tonight let ’ s have plenty to eat .
you have all served me well , and kings are your peers .
well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
ha , ha , ha !
may the evil one take me if i meant it like that !
those tears will bring blessings to you .
you interpret my words in a melancholy sense , my hearty friends .
have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city ?
it was probably just a rumor .
well sir , good night .
and if our navy wins tomorrow , no doubt our army will do their part .
it ’ s an outstanding army and highly motivated .
what ’ s that sound ?
there ’ s music coming out of thin air .
it ’ s a lucky sign , isn ’ t it ?
hello there , good sirs .
isn ’ t it strange ?
do you hear that , men ?
it ’ s very strange .
come on , good fellow , help me into that armor you ’ re carrying .
if luck deserts us today , it ’ s because we defy it .
no , i ’ ll help too .
what ’ s this part for ?
ah , leave it alone .
really , i ’ ll help .
it must go like this .
we ’ ve got it now.—do you see this , my good fellow ?
go and put on your own armor .
in a minute , sir .
didn ’ t i buckle this well ?
you look like a person who knows the business of war .
when we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully .
that was a fine fanfare , boys .
like a young man who wants to amount to something , this morning begins early .
whatever happens to me , this is a soldier ’ s kiss .
i ’ ll leave you without revealing any emotion , like a man of steel .
he goes forth to war bravely .
may the gods bless antony today !
i wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land .
you don ’ t know ?
someone who was always near you .
sir , he ’ s with caesar .
sir , he left his belongings and treasure .
eros , send his treasure to him .
don ’ t keep anything back , i insist .
write to him from me—i ’ ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes .
say that i hope he never has cause to look for a new master .
oh , my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors .
then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .
if fulvia were the last woman on earth , there would be a reason to grieve .
but in this way , grief and comfort appear together .
i must go and continue the business fulvia started .
enough of this frivolous talk .
give our officers notice of our intentions .
i ’ ll tell the queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave .
the empire may be in danger if he ’ s not restrained before he reaches his full potential .
there are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats .
agrippa , go start the battle .
we want antony taken alive .
make sure everyone knows that .
an era of universal peace is about to start .
that way antony will feel like he ’ s fighting his own men .
caesar hanged him for this service .
canidius and the others that left antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust .
enobarbus , antony has sent you all your treasure , with generous gifts besides .
the messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent .
don ’ t joke about this , enobarbus .
i ’ m telling you the truth .
you ’ d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return .
i ’ d do it myself , but i can ’ t leave my post .
your emperor is still a king among gods .
i am the worst person alive , and i know it the best .
my heart feels like it ’ s about to explode .
i , fight against you , antony ?
no , i ’ ll go find some ditch to die in .
the foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life .
we ’ ve advanced too far .
caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected .
oh , my brave emperor , this is what i call a fight !
if we ’ d fought like this before , we ’ d have driven them home with bandaged heads .
you ’ re bleeding a lot .
we ’ ll chase ’ em into their latrines .
i still have room for six more wounds .
they ’ re retreating , sir , and our superiority indicates a clear victory .
let ’ s slash their backs and grab ’ em like we do rabbits , from behind .
it ’ s fair game to mark a coward .
i ’ ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage .
i ’ ll limp after you .
we ’ ve driven him all the way back to his camp .
one of you run to the queen with the news .
before sunrise tomorrow , we ’ ll kill anyone who escaped today .
you are all lord of lords !
have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world ?
my songbird , we have beaten them to their beds .
what do you think , girl !
today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind .
he deserves it , even if it were covered with jewels like holy
if we aren ’ t relieved in an hour , we have to return to our barracks .
oh , listen to me , night— who is this ?
be my witness , oh you blessed moon .
let ’ s speak to him .
let ’ s listen to him .
but he ’ s sleeping .
no one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep .
let ’ s go to him .
wake up , sir , wake up .
do you hear us , sir ?
the hand of death has taken him .
let ’ s carry him to the barracks .
he ’ s an important person .
they ’ ve switched their operation to the sea today .
we didn ’ t please them on land .
we ’ re ready for both , my lord .
i wish they ’ d fight in fire or in the air .
but here ’ s the plan : our army will stay with us on the hills by the city .
let ’ s take up the best positions we can in the valleys .
they still haven ’ t joined the battle .
i ’ ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there .
i ’ ll let you know right away how it ’ s going .
swallows have built nests in cleopatra ’ s sails .
this treacherous egyptian has betrayed me .
tell the army to flee .
oh , sun , i will never see another one of your sunrises .
luck and antony separate here and now .
here we ’ ll shake hands good-bye .
is it all come to this ?
i ’ ve been stripped of everything , betrayed .
oh , that devious egyptian spirit !
why is my lord enraged against his love ?
let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds !
follow his chariot , like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender .
then let octavia dig up your face with her nails .
she ’ ll die for it.—eros , ho !
lock yourself in and send him word that you ’ re dead .
when a great person departs , it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body .
say the last word i spoke was “ antony , ” and please word it pathetically .
go , mardian , and let me know how he reacts to my death .
eros , can you still see me ?
you ’ ve seen these illusions .
that ’ s true , my lord .
eros , my young friend , your captain is now just like that cloud .
no , don ’ t cry , kind eros .
oh , your contemptible lady !
get out , insolent eunuch !
she has betrayed me and shall die .
a person can only pay with their life once , and she has paid in full .
what you wanted is yours .
antony ” was divided between her heart and lips .
she gave up her life with your name still within her .
is she dead , then ?
remove your armor , eros .
oh , chest , obey me !
heart , for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined .
faster , eros , faster .
i won ’ t be a soldier anymore .
battered armor , be off .
you were worn with honor .
i will catch up with you , cleopatra , and weep for your forgiveness .
since the light of my life has gone out , i ’ ll stop here .
now any effort ruins what it attempts .
yes , even power gets in its own way .
what can i do for my lord ?
since cleopatra died , i have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace .
you won ’ t be striking me down , but defeating caesar .
can i do what all the parthian arrows , though shot by enemies , could not ?
draw your trustworthy sword , which you have used in such service to your country .
oh , sir , pardon me !
when i freed you from slavery , didn ’ t you swear to do this when i asked you ?
do it immediately , or all your previous services to me were accidental , without purpose .
take out your sword and come on .
then turn your noble face away from me , that face that the whole world adores .
i haven ’ t seen him recently .
what should i do that i ’ m not doing ?
always give him his way .
don ’ t push him too far .
i wish you ’ d be patient .
we come to hate that which controls us .
i am sick and sullen .
i ’ m sorry to have to say this— help me away from here , dear charmian !
i have drawn my sword .
you ’ ve said it , friend , and farewell to you .
should i do it now ?
well , then , there !
with this i avoid the grief of antony ’ s death .
my queen and eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books .
i learned to do this from you .
i ’ m not dead ?
what ’ s the trouble ?
i ’ ve botched the job , friends .
oh , finish what i ’ ve begun .
our guiding light is out .
and time itself is ended .
whoever ’ s a real friend should strike me dead .
your death and destiny advise your followers to escape .
there , diomedes , there .
why don ’ t you answer me , man ?
is that you , diomedes ?
draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me .
most powerful lord , my mistress cleopatra sent me to you .
when did she send you ?
just now , my lord .
she had a premonition of what has actually happened .
afraid that your anger would not subside , she sent you word she was dead .
too late , good diomedes .
call my guard , please .
carry me , good friends , to where cleopatra is .
it ’ s the last command i shall ever give you .
it ’ s a very sad day .
no , my friends , don ’ t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well .
if we welcome our punishment , we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly .
oh , charmian , i will never leave this tomb !
be calm , dear lady .
no , i won ’ t .
strange and terrible events are all welcome , but i despise comforts .
the size of my sorrow must be as great as its source .
what ’ s the news !
he is close to death , but not dead yet .
oh , antony , antony , antony !
help , charmian , help , iras , help !
it was not caesar ’ s bravery that conquered antony but antony ’ s that has triumphed over himself .
that ’ s the way it should be—only antony should conquer antony .
no , our general ’ s infatuation is out of control .
his eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops .
if what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
it would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
i want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
i have news from rome , my good lord .
i am dying , cleopatra , dying .
i will never be exhibited as lucky caesar ’ s prize .
help us , good friends .
oh , quick , before i ’ m gone .
my lord is so heavy !
die where you have lived , in my arms .
if my lips had the power to give life , i would wear them out like this .
i am dying , cleopatra , dying .
give me some wine and let me say a few words .
i ’ ll trust my determination and my hands , but none of caesar ’ s men .
now i feel my soul leaving .
i can ’ t speak any more .
most noble man , will you die ?
don ’ t you care about me ?
shall i stay in this dreary world , which is no better than a pigsty without you ?
oh , the glory of war has faded .
young boys and girls are equal to men .
there is nothing distinctive , nothing remarkable left in the world .
our queen is dead too .
oh , madam , madam , madam !
quiet , quiet , iras .
now all is for nothing .
how are you , my ladies ?
how are you , charmian ?
good noble ladies , be brave .
come on , you can go .
the container of that great soul is now cold .
ah , ladies , ladies !
we have no friends but determination and the quickest death .
what are you doing with a sword ?
who do you think you are coming in here armed ?
i served mark antony , who was the commander most worthy of my services .
while he was alive , i lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies .
if not , you can kill me .
caesar , i ’ m telling you that antony is dead .
when such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap .
this isn ’ t the death of one man .
it ’ s the death of half the world .
now , my dearest queen— please , stand farther away from me .
what ’ s the matter ?
i can see in your eyes there ’ s been some good news .
what , does your wife say you can come home ?
i wish she ’ d never let you come .
don ’ t let her say i kept you .
i have no power over you .
the gods know— oh , never has a queen been so betrayed as i have been .
i knew from the first it would be this way .
it was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart .
when you begged to stay , that was the time for words .
you didn ’ t want to go then !
you saw eternity in my lips and eyes , and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows .
i pulled it from his wound .
look—his noble blood is still on it .
listen , sad friends , though the gods may rebuke me , this news would make kings cry .
his faults were equally matched by his virtues .
but gods , you give us faults so we ’ ll be human .
either i had to ruin you , or you would have ruined me .
let me tell you , friends—
i ’ ll tell you at a better time .
this man looks like his business is urgent .
let ’ s hear what he has to say .
tell her to put her mind at rest .
may the gods bless you .
tell her we mean her no disrespect .
go , and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind .
gallus , you go with him .
i remember he ’ s already occupied .
he ’ ll be done in time .
come and see the proof .
it ’ s pathetic to be caesar .
he can ’ t be fortune ; he ’ s only fortune ’ s errand boy .
caesar greets the queen of egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him .
what ’ s your name ?
but i don ’ t worry about being deceived because i don ’ t need to trust .
you ’ re in the charge of an honorable man .
don ’ t be afraid .
please tell him i have surrendered to his fortune .
i ’ m learning every hour how to be subservient .
i ’ ll tell him all of this , dear lady .
stop , brave lady , stop !
we have not betrayed you .
what , am i being denied death , as well ?
don ’ t insult my master ’ s generosity by killing yourself .
your death would prevent that .
where are you , death ?
come , and you can have a queen .
oh , control yourself , lady !
let caesar do whatever he wants .
shall i let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of rome ?
i ’ d rather die in a ditch in egypt , and make it my gentle grave .
i ’ d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids !
you ’ ll see that caesar is giving you no reason to do so .
proculeius , caesar has heard about what you ’ ve done here and has sent for you .
i ’ ll take the queen into my custody .
so be it , dolabella .
have you heard of me , most noble empress ?
i don ’ t remember .
you must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams .
isn ’ t that your habit ?
i don ’ t know what you mean , madam .
i dreamed about an emperor called antony .
oh , i wish i could sleep again , so i could have another dream like that !
when he raised his arm in command , the world trembled .
there was no end to his generosity .
kings and noblemen served him .
kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change .
the gods can hear you lying !
antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings .
listen to me , madam .
you are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable .
i hope i never achieve success if i don ’ t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now .
do you know what caesar intends to do with me ?
i ’ m reluctant to tell you what i wish you knew .
you need not kneel to me .
the gods have ordained it to be like this , sir .
don ’ t think i blame you .
i ’ ll leave you now .
you may do whatever you want in the world .
it ’ s yours , and you may hang us , your trophies of war , anywhere you like .
here , my good lord .
what do you mean , lady ?
i wish i were as big and strong as you .
listen to me , queen .
there is an emergency i must take care of , but my whole heart will remain here with you .
my italy is full of civil war .
sextus pompeius is sailing toward the port of rome .
but my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that fulvia is dead .
is it possible fulvia is dead ?
she ’ s dead , my queen .
you shall advise me in everything having to do with cleopatra .
not even trivial things were left out .
what did i keep for myself ?
enough to buy everything you have declared .
no , don ’ t be ashamed , cleopatra .
look around you , caesar .
oh , just see what happens after the pageantry is over !
seleucus ’ ingratitude makes me wild .
i ’ ll give you a good reason to cringe , i promise you .
i ’ ll scratch out your eyes , even if they could fly .
oh , that was unbelievably low !
cleopatra , our conquest won ’ t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed .
it ’ s all still yours .
do whatever you like with it .
i have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend .
my master and my lord !
it ’ s time to end it , good lady .
where ’ s the queen ?
make the best use of this information you can .
i have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise .
dolabella , i will always be in debt to you .
i must go attend caesar .
now , iras , what do you think ?
you will be exhibited in rome along with me , like egyptian puppets .
crude slaves with greasy aprons , rulers , and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see .
no , it ’ s certain , iras .
insolent oh , the good gods !
no , that ’ s the truth .
i ’ ll never see it .
i know my nails are stronger than my eyes ; i ’ ll scratch them out .
why , that ’ s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions .
women , dress me like a queen .
go get my best clothes .
what ’ s that noise ?
there ’ s a farmer here who won ’ t leave without seeing your highness .
he has brought you figs .
what a poor instrument , that can do such a noble deed !
there ’ s nothing of the weak woman left in me .
now from head to foot i ’ m as firm as marble .
now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me .
do you have in there the pretty snake of the nile that kills without pain ?
i certainly do have him , but i wouldn ’ t advise you to touch him .
people who die of it seldom or never recover .
do you remember anyone who died of it ?
many people , men and women alike .
indeed , she gives a very good testimony of the snake ’ s power .
but this is a sure thing : the snake ’ s an odd snake .
i hope you are pleased with the snake .
you must know that the snake will act according to his nature .
there isn ’ t any kindness in the snake .
well , you can go now .
i long to be immortal .
quickly , quickly , good iras , quickly .
i think i hear antony call me .
i see him revive himself to praise my noble act .
now let my courage prove my title as wife .
so , are you done ?
come then , kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips .
iras , i won ’ t see you again for a long time .
do i have the asp ’ s poison on my lips ?
if you leave like that , you tell the world that it ’ s not worthy of a good-bye .
clouds , dissolve into rain , so that i could say the gods themselves are weeping !
separate me from life with your sharp teeth .
poor poisonous fool , be angry and bite .
don ’ t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep ?
why should i stay— in this vile world ?
now , death , you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession .
the sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again .
i ’ ll straighten it , then play— where ’ s the queen ?
don ’ t wake her .
caesar has sent— too slow a messenger .
there ’ s dolabella , who was sent from caesar .
what kind of work is this , charmian ?
it is well done , and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings .
what ’ s going on in here ?
they ’ re all dead .
caesar , you thought this would happen .
you ’ re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop .
stop arguing and listen to my plans .
whether i go ahead with them or not is completely up to you .
i swear by the sun that when i leave here , it will be as your faithful servant .
cut my corset laces , charmian , so i can breathe .
control yourself , my precious queen , and concede that my love is true .
that ’ s what fulvia told me .
i beg you , turn away and cry for her .
then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit .
oh , sir , you are too good at predicting the future .
what you were afraid of has happened .
i don ’ t see any blood .
who was with them last ?
a simple country farmer who brought her figs .
they were poisoned , then .
oh , caesar , this charmian lived until a moment ago .
i found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress .
she stood trembling , then suddenly dropped dead .
here on her breast there ’ s a little bloody mark .
there ’ s a similar mark on her arm .
pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb .
she shall be buried next to her antony .
no other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous .
our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for rome .
you ’ ll make me angry .
i know you can do better than that , but it ’ ll do for now .
i swear by my sword— swear by your shield , too !
i ’ ll leave you , lady .
polite sir , let me say one thing .
sir , you and i must part company—no , that ’ s not it .
it ’ s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart , but bear with me .
even the traits that become me most kill me when you don ’ t approve of them .
your honor is the reason you are leaving .
may the gods be with you .
may your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed .
you ’ re too forgiving .
here ’ s more news .
pompey has a strong navy .
i should have known it .
it ’ s been this way ever since the first government was organized .
antony , it ’ s time to stop your wild hedonism .
you drank horses ’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse .
it ’ s too bad .
let ’ s hope his sense of shame will send him back to rome quickly .
it ’ s time that we brought our armies into the field .
pompey is making the most of our absence .
i ’ ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime .
so i can sleep away the time while my antony is gone .
you think about him too much .
i hope not , madam .
what can i do for your highness ?
i don ’ t want to hear you sing .
i ’ m not interested in anything a eunuch can do .
well , not in deed , madam , since i can ’ t do anything unchaste .
is he standing or sitting ?
or is he on his horse ?
oh , how fortunate that horse is to have antony on him .
i ’ m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
are you thinking about me ?
no , listen to it , antony .
perhaps what , my love ?
you can ’ t stay here any longer .
call in the messengers and we ’ ll find out .
queen of egypt , greetings !
you are nothing like mark antony !
but since you come from him , you ’ re saturated with his healing spirit .
how does it go with my magnificent mark antony ?
my ear must pull it out .
was he sad or happy ?
he wasn ’ t sad , because he knows that his disposition affects others .
he was somewhere in the middle , between them . . .
whether you are sad or merry , the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
yes , madam , twenty different messengers .
why did you send so many ?
whoever is born on a day i forget to send a message to antony will die a beggar .
bring ink and paper , charmian .
welcome , my good alexas .
charmian , did i ever love caesar as much as this ?
oh , that splendid caesar !
may you choke on any other sentiments like that !
say , “ that splendid antony. ” the courageous caesar !
pardon me , but i ’ m just repeating what you yourself have said .
that was when i was young and inexperienced and didn ’ t know what passion was .
in that case , the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .
i ’ ll do well .
the people are on my side , and i ’ m in charge of the sea .
my forces are growing , and everything i know tells me it ’ s all coming together .
mark antony is at dinner in egypt and won ’ t be going outside to make war .
caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money .
caesar and lepidus are organizing their military operation .
they have a massive army .
where did you hear this ?
it ’ s not true .
i know they ’ re in rome together , hoping for antony to return .
lecherous cleopatra , may all the charms of love soften those withered lips !
join your witchcraft with your beauty , and let antony ’ s lust combine with both .
keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery .
this news is absolutely true : mark antony is expected to arrive in rome at any hour now .
in the time since he left egypt , he could have traveled an even longer distance .
his military ability is double that of the other two .
i don ’ t expect caesar and antony will have a very friendly reunion .
menas , i don ’ t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones .
it will be as the gods see fit .
in any case , our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible .
let ’ s go , menas .
i will advise him to speak as he usually does .
by jupiter , if i were antony , i wouldn ’ t shave my beard today .
this is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
but major issues must come before minor ones .
not if the minor ones come up first .
here comes the noble antony .
if we were in front of our armies , about to fight , i would do this .
caesar , what did my stay in egypt have to do with you ?
no more than my staying here in rome might mean to you in egypt .
how do you mean , “ conspired ” ?
you can judge for yourself what i mean .
your wife and brother led troops against me , claiming to be fighting in your name .
they said they were acting for you .
my brother didn ’ t use my name to justify his rebellion .
he rejected my authority as much as yours .
i ’ ve already sent the proof in my letters .
if you want to pick a fight , you ’ ll have to find a more substantial excuse .
you defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you ’ re just making up feeble excuses .
not true , not true .
you know i would never approve a war against my own cause .
as for my wife , if only you had such a wife .
it ’ s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that .
but you can ’ t blame me for her offenses .
i sent you a letter while you were carousing in alexandria .
i was not myself , as a result of the wine .
the next day i explained all this to him , which was as good as begging his pardon .
let ’ s not fight over this fellow .
tonight we ’ ll wander through the streets and observe the people .
you will never be able to say the same about me .
what part of the agreement did i break ?
you agreed to send me troops and weapons when i needed them .
i overlooked your request , but i did not deny it .
or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with pompey is finished .
you can argue as much as you like when there ’ s nothing else to do .
you are only a soldier .
don ’ t speak any further .
may i speak , caesar .
what is it , agrippa ?
you have a beautiful half-sister , octavia .
great mark antony is a widower now .
you ’ d better not make that suggestion , agrippa .
if cleopatra heard you , you would be well punished for your audacity .
it ’ s true i ’ m not married , caesar .
let me hear what agrippa has to say .
since she would love both of you , you two would be joined in that love .
what do you say , caesar ?
he has both my power and my influence over octavia .
i wouldn ’ t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea .
here ’ s my hand .
i give you a sister whom i love more than a brother ever loved any sister .
she will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts .
i ’ m happy to say “ amen ” to that !
i didn ’ t think i would ever fight pompey .
there isn ’ t much time .
either we go after pompey or he ’ ll come after us .
near how large is his land army ?
but his navy rules the sea .
that ’ s what i hear .
come with us , lepidus .
noble antony , even illness couldn ’ t keep me away .
we can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably .
and i see you survived your time in egypt .
we heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people !
there were many even more memorable feasts .
she ’ s a remarkable lady , if the rumors are to be believed .
i ’ ll tell you .
the oars were made of silver , and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music .
when she landed at the port , antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper .
she replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead .
now antony has to leave her completely .
age won ’ t wither her , and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring .
even her worst faults are charming , and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut .
good enobarbus , consider yourself my guest as long as you ’ re here .
and i will spend our time apart on my knees , praying for you .
tell me why , if you can .
but you had better get back to egypt again .
tell me who shall have the better luck , caesar or me ?
so you ’ d better not stay with him , antony .
your guardian angel is noble , courageous , significant , and unmatched when caesar ’ s not around .
but when you are with him , your angel is weakened and easily frightened .
that ’ s why there must be space between you .
don ’ t speak of this again .
to none but you , only to you .
with his natural luck , he will beat you even against the odds .
your light dulls when he is near .
tell ventidius i want to speak with him .
you must go to parthia .
come with me and i ’ ll get it for you .
don ’ t spend any more time here .
go tell your generals to hurry their preparations .
sir , we ’ ll follow as soon as mark antony kisses octavia good-bye .
you ’ re taking a shorter route .
my plans take me a roundabout way .
you ’ ll get there two days before me .
music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers .
let ’ s play billiards .
play with me , charmian .
i ’ ll do my best , madam .
i don ’ t want to play now .
give me my fishing rod .
we ’ ll go to the river .
with my music playing in the background , i ’ ll lure fish .
cram your good news into my ears .
madam , madam— antony ’ s dead !
if you say that , you bastard , you ’ ll kill your queen .
kings have trembled to kiss this hand .
let me say first , madam , that he is well .
well then , here ’ s more money for you .
but you know , sirrah , we customarily say that the dead are well .
good madam , let me speak .
all right , i will .
but you don ’ t look as if you bring good news .
i am the duke who loved your father .
give me your hand , and explain your situation to me .
you haven ’ t seen him since ?
sir , sir , that can ’ t be true .
but do this : find your brother , wherever he is .
bring him here dead or alive within the next year , or get out off my land .
do this immediately , and send him packing .
hang there on this tree , you lines of poetry , and bear witness to my love .
and you , and how are you liking the shepherd ’ s life , master touchstone ?
are you any kind of philosopher yourself , shepherd ?
you ’ re a natural-born philosopher !
were you ever at court , shepherd ?
you are in a perilous state , shepherd .
not at all , touchstone .
you told me that you don ’ t salute at the court but kiss hands .
now , if courtiers were shepherds , that kind of courtesy would be unclean .
what , don ’ t courtiers ' hands sweat ?
and isn ’ t a sheep ’ s grease as wholesome as a man ’ s sweat ?
that ’ s a poor example .
besides , our hands are hard and calloused .
then your lips will feel them more quickly .
you are about as much of a thinker as worm ’ s meat is a nice steak .
fix your example , shepherd .
your wit is too courtly for me .
i ’ ll rest now .
can you tell me whether rosalind , duke senior ’ s daughter , has also been banished ?
where will the old duke live ?
you ’ re going to rest while you ’ re still damned ?
god help you , foolish man .
pray god does some surgery on you : you need to be fixed .
here comes young mr. ganymede , my new mistress ’ s brother .
there is no jewel like rosalind .
her worth is carried on the wind and it blows throughout the world , carrying the name of rosalind .
all the most beautiful paintings are black when compared to rosalind .
don ’ t think of any beauty but the beauty of rosalind .
i could rhyme like that for eight years in a row , excepting meal times and sleeping hours .
that awful , plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market .
oh , stop , fool .
let me try : if there ’ s a buck who needs a doe tell him rosalind will do .
a cat in heat will look for a mate , and rosalind certainly will too .
winter garments need to be filled with something , and so does skinny rosalind .
after you harvest , you have to sheaf and bind so throw ripe rosalind on the harvest cart .
the sweetest nut has the sourest rind and rosalind is that kind of nut .
the man who finds the sweetest rose will be pricked by it , and by rosalind .
this is exactly the false way that verses gallop along .
quiet , you stupid fool .
i found them on a tree .
well , the tree bears rotten fruit .
heaven commanded nature to fill her one body with all the graces that women contain .
heaven wanted rosalind to have these gifts and me to live and die as her slave .
were you listening to these verses ?
oh yes , i heard them all , and more , too .
and he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck .
it ’ s difficult to bring two friends together , but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes .
no , who are you talking about ?
no , i ’ m begging you now , tell me who it is .
oh , this is wonderful , wonderful—just wonderful wonderful !
every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to south seas .
i ’ m begging you , tell me who it is quickly , and speak fast .
i ’ m begging you , take the cork out of your mouth so i can drink the news .
so you want to put a man in your belly .
i mean , what sort of man is he ?
is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
no , he has only a little beard .
well , eventually god will send him some more hair , if he thanks him .
it ’ s orlando , who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant .
damn you for mocking me .
really , cousin , it ’ s him .
what did he do when you saw him ?
did he ask about me ?
how did he say good-bye ?
and when will you see him again ?
answer me in a word .
does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling ?
but taste my story , and relish it by paying attention .
i found orlando under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
that tree could be called god ’ s tree , since it drops such wonderful fruit .
let me talk , good lady .
he lay there , stretched out like a wounded knight .
though that must have been a pitiful sight , the ground looked beautiful .
cry , “ whoa ! ” to your tongue , please .
it ’ s leaping about like a frisky horse .
he was dressed like a hunter .
oh , that ’ s ominous !
he has come to kill my heart .
i ’ d like to sing my song solo .
you ’ re making me go off-key .
don ’ t you know that i ’ m a woman ?
whatever i think , i have to say .
isn ’ t that him heading this way ?
thanks for your company but , really , i would have preferred being alone .
let ’ s meet as little as we can .
i also hope that we can be better strangers .
please don ’ t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks .
please don ’ t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly .
your love ’ s name is rosalind ?
yes , that ’ s it .
i don ’ t like her name .
just as tall as my heart .
you ’ re sure full of smooth answers .
your worst fault is being in love .
well , it ’ s a fault i wouldn ’ t trade for your best virtue .
i ’ m tired of you .
there i ’ ll see only myself .
which is either a fool or a nothing .
i ’ m not going to waste any more time with you .
goodbye , good mr. love .
i ’ m glad to see you go .
adieu , good mr. depression .
you should ask me what time of day it is , instead .
there ’ s no clock here in the forest .
indeed i do , sir , and i ’ ve come to let you in on a certain problem .
i ’ d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger .
wouldn ’ t that have been just as appropriate ?
no , not at all , sir .
time travels at different speeds for different people .
okay , who does it trot for ?
who does time amble for ?
time ambles for both men .
who does it gallop for ?
who does it stand still for ?
for lawyers on vacation , because they sleep their holidays away , with no sense of how time moves .
where do you live , pretty young man ?
just like the rabbit , who lives where she is born .
your speech is more refined than i would expect in such a remote place as this .
many people have told me so .
thank god i ’ m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex .
what were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of ?
there were no primary ones .
please , tell me some of them .
no , i won ’ t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick .
well , i ’ m the man you ’ re speaking of .
please , tell me your cure .
but you don ’ t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about .
what did he say the symptoms were ?
but you ’ re no such man .
you ’ re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else .
young boy , i wish i could make you believe that i ’ m in love .
i swear to you by rosalind ’ s own pretty hand that i am that unfortunate man .
are you really as in love as your poems declare ?
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much i love her .
but i promise it can be cured with some guidance .
have you ever cured anyone this way before ?
yes , one , and this is how i did it .
i don ’ t want to be cured , boy .
by my faith in love , i will , then .
tell me where you live .
wholeheartedly , good young man .
no , you have to call me rosalind.—sister , you ’ re coming ?
come on , sweet audrey .
i ’ ll get your goats , audrey .
do my simple features please you ?
your features , god help us !
really , audrey , i wish you were more poetical .
i don ’ t know what “ poetical ” means .
is it “ chaste in word and action ” ?
does it mean being truthful ?
not really , for the truest poetry is often the most artificial .
but you still wish the gods had made me poetical ?
i do , in fact .
what , you don ’ t want me to be chaste ?
not really , unless you were ugly .
well , i ’ m not beautiful , so i hope that i can at least be chaste .
i ’ m not a slut—i keep myself clean—but i thank god i am ugly .
well , praise the lord you ’ re ugly .
well , god bless this marriage !
well , that ’ s what the wife brings to the marriage .
well , there they are .
the nobleman ’ s are as huge as the underfed villager ’ s .
is the single man lucky , then ?
will you marry us here , under this tree , or should we follow you to your chapel ?
is there anyone to give the bride away ?
i don ’ t want to take another man ’ s second-hand goods .
no , someone has to give her away or the marriage isn ’ t legal .
how are you , sir ?
we ’ re glad to see you .
god bless you for being here .
i ’ m very glad to see you .
this is just a trifling matter here , sir .
no , no , put your hat back on .
do you want to get married , fool ?
then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage .
come with me and let me advise you .
we have to be married properly .
none of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession .
don ’ t talk to me .
i ’ m going to cry .
go ahead if you want , but remember that crying doesn ’ t suit a man .
but don ’ t i have good reason to cry ?
as good a reason as any .
so go ahead and cry .
his kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest .
i ’ m very glad i came to see you .
if he shows up tomorrow , i ’ ll give him what ’ s coming to him .
if he can manage to walk after our fight , i ’ ll never wrestle for money again .
but not for long ; charles will take care of everything .
but you heard him swear up and down that he was .
he ’ s staying in the forest with your father now .
i met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him .
he laughed at that and let me go .
he ’ s like a cowardly
who ’ s coming here ?
yes , what about him ?
sweet phoebe , do not scorn me .
go ahead and say you don ’ t love me , but not so bitterly .
faint , fall down—if you don ’ t , then you ’ re lying about my eyes being murderers .
come on , show me the wound that my eyes have caused .
but my eyes , which i ’ ve darted at you , haven ’ t even left a mark .
now i am sure that eyes can ’ t hurt a person .
well , until that time , don ’ t come near me .
but mistress , know yourself .
get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man .
ask this man ’ s forgiveness , love him , and accept his offer .
so take her , shepherd , and god bless you .
besides , i don ’ t like you .
and don ’ t be proud .
sweet phoebe , have pity on me .
well , i ’ m sorry for you , gentle silvius .
then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured .
isn ’ t that enough ?
well , that ’ s just greedy .
but don ’ t expect any more than that .
do you know the boy who was just speaking to me ?
not very well , but i ’ ve met him several times .
don ’ t think i ’ m in love with him just because i ’ m asking about him .
but what do i care about words ?
and yet , words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to .
he ’ s awfully proud , but his pride suits him .
he ’ ll grow up to be a proper man .
he ’ s not very tall , but he ’ s tall enough for his age .
his legs aren ’ t great , but they ’ re alright .
what right did he have to scold me like that ?
i ’ m surprised i didn ’ t bite back .
but no matter—i ’ ll get back at him soon enough .
i ’ ll write him a taunting letter , and you can deliver it .
will you do that for me , silvius ?
with all my heart , phoebe .
i ’ ll be bitter toward him , and curt .
come with me , silvius .
please , pretty young man , i ’ d like to get to know you better .
they say you are a melancholy fellow .
i like it better than laughing .
people who are either too serious or too silly are awful .
well , i think it ’ s good to be serious and keep quiet .
in that case it ’ s good to be a post .
you ’ re a traveler .
well then , you have good reason to be sad .
i ’ m afraid you ’ ve sold your own land to see other men ’ s .
to have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
and your experience makes you sad .
good day and happiness to you , darling rosalind .
my beautiful rosalind , i ’ m only an hour late .
please , rosalind , my sweet cousin—be happy .
dear celia—i already look much happier than i feel , but you want me to look even happier ?
i swear i will , and if i ever break my promise let me turn into a monster .
so please , my sweet rose , my dear rose , be happy .
let me see—what do you think about falling in love ?
you ’ d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour ?
forgive me , darling rosalind .
no , if you ’ re ever late like this again , i ’ ll refuse to see you .
i ’ d rather be wooed by a snail .
besides , he brings his fate with him .
why , his cuckold ’ s horns , of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives .
a virtuous woman won ’ t give her husband horns , and my rosalind is definitely virtuous .
and i am your rosalind .
come on , woo me , woo me .
i ’ m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want .
what would you say to me now if i really were your precious little rosalind ?
i ’ d kiss you before i spoke .
what if she won ’ t kiss me ?
who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves ?
aren ’ t i your rosalind ?
i like to pretend you are , because then it ’ s almost like actually talking to her .
no , you won ’ t die yourself , but only by proxy .
then love me , rosalind .
okay , i will—on fridays and saturdays , and the rest .
and will you have me ?
sure , and twenty others just like you .
well , aren ’ t you a good man ?
right now ; as fast as she can say the vows .
now tell me how long you intend to keep her .
and when you want to go to sleep , i ’ ll be up laughing like a hyena .
but will my rosalind do this , too ?
the wiser the woman , the wilder .
if you close the doors on a woman ’ s wit , it ’ ll fly out the window .
if you shut the windows , it will pour out the keyhole .
if you stop up the keyhole , it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke .
you ’ ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue .
rosalind , i have to leave you for two hours .
i must join the duke for lunch .
i ’ ll be back here with you by two o'clock .
oh , go , leave me .
i knew you ’ d turn out this way .
my friends told me as much , and i knew it , too .
so , take me , death !
you ’ ll be back at two o'clock ?
so beware of my contempt , and keep your promise .
i ’ ll keep my promise just as if you really were rosalind .
well , time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal .
you have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours .
i ’ m telling you , aliena , i can ’ t stand being apart from orlando .
i ’ m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns .
and i ’ m going to sleep .
which one of you killed the deer ?
it doesn ’ t matter if it ’ s in tune so long as it ’ s loud enough .
what do you say now ?
isn ’ t it past two o'clock ?
and i see a lot of orlando here .
look who ’ s coming .
no , i swear , i don ’ t even know what ’ s in it .
well , then , what should we do for fun instead ?
come on , you ’ re a fool , and driven to extreme measures by love .
the point is that she didn ’ t write this letter .
these are a man ’ s words , and his handwriting .
i ’ m telling you , it ’ s hers .
why , she challenges me like a muslim would challenge a christian .
do you want to hear what she says ?
she ’ s phoebe-ing me .
listen to what the tyrant says .
why do you pity him ?
follow them straight to the cottage .
since you asked , i suppose it ’ s not bragging to say that we are .
it ’ s about who i am , and how , why , and where this handkerchief was stained .
he discovered that the man was his older brother .
he turned away twice and almost left him there .
was it you that he rescued ?
was it you that was always plotting to kill him ?
but what about the bloody handkerchief ?
i ’ ll get there .
after a brief time—as he is a strong , brave man—
many people faint when they see blood .
there ’ s more to it than that.—ganymede !
look , he ’ s recovering .
i want to go home .
we ’ ll take you there .
please , will you take his arm ?
you ’ re a man ?
you don ’ t have a man ’ s courage .
it ’ s true , i confess .
oh , sir , someone would think i was a good fake .
please tell your brother what a convincing show i put on .
your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint .
fake , i ’ m telling you .
well , then , be brave and pretend to be a man .
that ’ s what i ’ m doing .
but honestly , i should have been a woman .
come on , you keep getting paler .
i ’ ll do that , because i have to tell my brother how you forgave him , rosalind .
i ’ ll think of something .
but please , tell him how well i faked a faint .
will you come with us ?
we ’ ll get married at some point , audrey .
really , the priest was good enough , no matter what that old guy said .
no , he was wicked and vile .
but audrey , there ’ s a boy in the forest who claims you ’ re his girl .
here comes the man himself .
it warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin .
how old are you , friend ?
yes , it ’ s william , sir .
were you born here in the forest ?
yes sir , thank god .
thank god ” —that ’ s a good answer .
so-so ” is good , very good , an excellent answer .
and then again , it ’ s not so good , but only so-so .
yes sir , i ’ m fairly witty .
well , that ’ s a fine answer .
then learn this from me : if you have something , you have it .
why , the he that will marry this woman .
i ’ ll poison you , or beat you with a club , or stab you with a sword .
i ’ ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness .
i will , in other words , kill you in three hundred and fifty ways .
therefore , tremble with fear and leave .
do what he says , william .
our master and mistress are looking for you .
hurry up , audrey , hurry.—i ’ m coming , i ’ m coming .
mistress , you have to go see your father .
did they make you the messenger ?
and how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that ?
yes , please ; unleash your wisdom .
watch me : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
by our beards ( if we had them ) , you are a knave .
and i swear by my wickedness ( if i had any ) that i am a knave .
is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her ?
you can be married tomorrow if you want .
i ’ ll invite the duke and all of his followers .
go get aliena ready—because , look , here comes my rosalind .
and hello to you , fair sister .
oh , darling orlando , it ’ s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling .
actually , it ’ s my arm .
i thought your heart had been wounded by a lion ’ s claws .
they ’ re in the heat of passion ; they simply have to be together .
you couldn ’ t beat the two of them apart .
they ’ ll be married tomorrow , and i ’ ll invite the duke to the ceremony .
but , oh , it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man ’ s eyes .
well then , can ’ t i act as rosalind for you tomorrow ?
i can ’ t live by pretending anymore .
i won ’ t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat .
you should know that i think you ’ re a smart man .
believe me , then , that i have special powers .
i swear on my life , which i take pretty seriously , even if i am a magician .
look , here comes someone who loves me , along with someone who loves her .
i don ’ t care .
a faithful shepherd worships you .
silvius , tell this youth what it means to be in love .
it means being full of sighs and tears , like i am for phoebe .
and like i am for ganymede .
and like i am for rosalind .
and like i am for no woman .
it means being faithful and ready to serve , just like i am for phoebe .
and like i am for ganymede .
and like i am for rosalind .
and like i am for no woman .
it means being filled with fantasy ; with passion and wishes ; with adoration , loyalty , and devotion .
and i for no woman .
since you know all this is true , why do you blame me for loving you ?
and why do you blame me for loving you ?
and why do you blame me for loving you ?
who are you talking to ?
i ’ m saying it to the girl who isn ’ t here and doesn ’ t hear me .
all right , stop this .
you sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon .
as long as i ’ m alive , i ’ ll be here .
tomorrow is the happy day , audrey .
we ’ ll be married tomorrow .
i hope it doesn ’ t make me unchaste that i really want to be a married woman .
here come two of duke senior ’ s pages .
good afternoon , good gentleman .
it really is good to see you .
come , sit , sit , and sing me a song .
should we just get down to it ?
orlando , do you really believe that this boy can do everything he ’ s promised ?
yes , even if i had whole kingdoms to give along with her .
i will , even if i were king of all kingdoms .
yes , even if i die an hour later .
but if you decide not to marry me , you ’ ll marry this faithful shepherd instead ?
that ’ s the deal .
even if marrying her meant i died .
i ’ ve promised to make everything right .
silvius , keep your promise to marry phoebe if she refuses me .
i ’ ll leave now , to set all these things right .
this shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter .
my lord , when i first saw him i thought he was your daughter ’ s brother .
my lord , welcome this man .
this is the jester i have met so many times in the forest .
he swears he used to be a courtier .
if anyone doubts this , let him put me on trial .
i have bankrupted three tailors .
i have quarreled four times , and almost got in a fight .
and how was that one settled ?
well , we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause .
what do you mean , the seventh cause ?
i like him very well .
tell me , who is this knight ?
a man old frederick , your father , loves .
if he has my father ’ s love , then that ’ s enough honor for me .
no more talk about my father ; you ’ ll be whipped for slander one of these days .
honestly , you ’ re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were with his mouth full of news .
which he ’ ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .
then we ’ ll be stuffed with news .
well that ’ s good .
if we ’ re hello , monsieur le beau .
what ’ s the news ?
fair princess , you ’ ve missed some good sport .
god bless you , sir .
this poor virgin isn ’ t much to look at , sir , but she ’ s mine .
really , he ’ s very witty , and full of wise sayings .
but back to that argument you mentioned .
what ’ s the “ seventh cause ” ?
i didn ’ t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard .
he sent me word that , whether i liked it or not , he liked it fine .
he ’ s as smart as they come , but just a jester .
he uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit .
there is laughter in heaven when earthly affairs are put right and people unite .
good duke , come receive your daughter .
hymen brought her from heaven yes , brought her here .
if my eyes don ’ t deceive me , you are my daughter .
if my eyes don ’ t deceive me , you are my rosalind .
if my eyes aren ’ t deceiving me , goodbye , love .
my niece , you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter .
let me have your attention for a moment .
i ’ m sir rowland ’ s middle son , and i bring you news .
i swear on my life that i ’ m speaking the truth .
do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk ?
i will go find him .
there is much to be learned from these converts .
stay , jaques , stay here for a bit .
no , this fun is not for me .
we ’ ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight .
if it ’ s true that you don ’ t need
i don ’ t understand—how should i answer that ?
however your wit and luck allow .
tell us about this wrestling .
well , we ’ ve missed the beginning ; it ’ s dead and buried .
there comes an old man with his three sons— it sounds like the beginning of an old folktale .
three proper young men , all good looking and with great presence—
charles did the same to the second brother , and the third .
but tell me , monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing ?
why , the one i just told you about .
me too , i swear .
doesn ’ t anyone else want to see this , and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs ?
shall we go watch this wrestling , cousin ?
yes , i see them coming .
let ’ s stay and watch .
since the youth won ’ t be reasoned with , he ’ ll have to suffer for his stubbornness .
that ’ s him , madam .
alas , he is too young .
what ’ s up , daughter and niece ?
have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling ?
yes , my lord , if you give us permission .
call him over here , good monsieur le beau .
i remember , adam , that ’ s here comes my master , your brother .
go hide , adam , and you ’ ll hear how he abuses me .
mister challenger , the princess wants to speak to you .
i ’ ll wait on them with all respect and duty .
young man , have you challenged charles the wrestler ?
he is the general challenger .
i have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth .
young gentleman , you are too bold for your age .
you have seen the cruel proof of this man ’ s strength .
we beg you , for your own sake , to respect your safety and give up .
in this world , i ’ m only taking up space .
i wish i could give you the little strength that i have .
mine too , to join hers .
i hope to god i ’ m wrong about your chances .
i hope you get what you desire !
you get only one round .
oh , what an excellent young man !
no more , no more .
how are you doing , charles ?
he can ’ t speak , my lord .
what is your name , young man ?
orlando , my lord , the youngest son of sir rowland de boys .
i wish you were someone else ’ s son .
the whole world thought your father was an honorable man , but he was always my enemy .
i wish you had told me you had a different father .
if i were my father , cousin , would i do this ?
gentle cousin , let ’ s go thank him and encourage him .
good luck , fair gentleman .
he ’ s calling us back .
my will you come on , cousin ?
what is this passion that ties up my tongue ?
i can ’ t speak to her , even though she asked me to .
either charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .
good sir , as a friend , i advise you to leave this place .
later , in a better world than this , i ’ d love to get to know you .
i ’ m indebted to you .
out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother !
but , oh , heavenly rosalind !
what ’ s going on , rosalind ?
i don ’ t even have one to throw at a dog .
no , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs .
throw some of your words at me .
is all of this about your father ?
no , some of it is about my child ’ s father .
if we walk on the well-worn paths , they won ’ t get caught in our petticoats .
i ’ d try it , if i could cry “ hem ” and have him .
come on , take control of your feelings .
but they ’ re siding with a better wrestler than myself .
oh , that ’ s a good wish !
does that necessarily mean you should love his son ?
by that kind of logic , i should hate orlando , since my father hates his father .
but i don ’ t hate orlando .
no , please don ’ t hate him—for my sake .
why shouldn ’ t i ?
doesn ’ t he deserve it ?
let me love him because he deserves it , and you can love him because i do .
look , here comes the duke .
madam , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court .
please , your grace , tell me what crime i have committed .
all traitors protest like this .
i don ’ t trust you .
you are your father ’ s daughter .
i was his daughter when your highness took my father ’ s dukedom .
i was his daughter when you banished him .
my father wasn ’ t a traitor .
dear master , listen to me .
yes , celia , we kept her here for your sake .
i was too young at the time to appreciate her value , but now i know her .
if she ’ s a traitor , why then , so am i .
you ’ re a fool .
you will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she ’ s out of the picture .
the sentence i ’ ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable .
then lay that sentence on me too , my lord .
i can not live without her .
you are a fool.—you , niece , prepare to leave .
on my honor and by my word , if you outstay the ten days , you will die .
oh , my poor rosalind , where will you go ?
do you want to exchange fathers ?
i ’ ll give you mine .
i insist , don ’ t be more distressed than i am .
i have more reason to be distressed .
i ’ ve never been taught how to make anything .
well , then , what are you messing up ?
i ’ m helping indeed , sir , find something better to do and get lost for a while .
should i tend your pigs and eat husks with them ?
when did i do you know where you are , sir ?
yes , sir , very well—i ’ m here in your orchard .
do you know whom you ’ re talking to ?
yes , better than you know me .
i know you ’ re my oldest brother , and deserve more respect .
no you haven ’ t , cousin .
don ’ t you realize the duke has also banished me , his daughter ?
no , he hasn ’ t .
oh , he hasn ’ t ?
should we part , sweet girl ?
but where will we go ?
to the forest of arden , to find your father .
but what danger we ’ ll put ourselves in , two young , innocent women traveling so far !
fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money .
i ’ ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt .
wouldn ’ t it be better—since i ’ m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man ?
what should i call you when you ’ re a man ?
i ’ ll take no lesser name than that of something that refers to my current state .
instead of celia , call me aliena .
wouldn ’ t he be a comfort to us in our travels ?
let ’ s go gather our jewels and money .
now , we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment .
aren ’ t these woods less perilous than the court , with all its jealousies and intrigues ?
come , shall we hunt some deer for dinner ?
indeed , my lord , the gloomy jaques grieves over these deaths .
big , round tears ran piteously down the animal ’ s innocent nose .
and did you leave him like this ?
we did , my lord , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer .
i ’ ll bring you to him right away .
can it be possible that no one saw them leave ?
some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen .
i can ’ t find anyone who saw her leave .
her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed , and early this morning the bed was empty .
my lord , that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing .
send a message to his brother .
bring that swinger orlando here .
if he ’ s not around , bring his brother oliver to me .
i ’ ll make oliver find him .
what are you doing here ?
why are you so strong and good ?
why do people love you ?
and why are you noble , strong , and brave ?
why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke ’ s favorite champion ?
your praise has beaten you home .
don ’ t you know , master , that some men ’ s best qualities do them in ?
oh , what a world this is , when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him !
why , what ’ s the matter ?
in this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you .
and if he fails at that , he will find other ways to kill you .
i overheard him and his plans .
this is no place for you ; this home is now a slaughterhouse .
hate it , fear it , do not come inside .
then where would you have me go , adam ?
it doesn ’ t matter where , so long as it ’ s not here .
what , would you have me beg for my food ?
this is all that ’ s left for me to do , but i won ’ t do it .
but don ’ t do that .
let me be your servant .
therefore , my old age is like a blustery winter : cold , but kindly .
let me go with you .
i ’ ll do everything a younger man could do for you .
go on , master , and i will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath .
many men seek their fortune at seventeen ; at eighty , it ’ s a bit late .
but fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well , without owing my master anything .
oh lord , my spirits are tired !
i wouldn ’ t care about my spirits , if my legs weren ’ t tired .
i can ’ t go any further .
i ’ d rather bear with you than well , this is the forest of arden .
yes , now i ’ m in arden , and that makes me the bigger fool .
yes , be content , good touchstone .
look who ’ s coming : a young man and an old man , having a serious talk .
what , you dare put your hands on me , villain ?
i ’ m no villain .
you ’ ve only insulted yourself .
for the sake of your father ’ s memory , make peace .
let me go , i say .
i won ’ t until i ’ m ready .
you will listen to me .
my father instructed you in his will to give me a good education .
my father ’ s spirit is growing in me , and i won ’ t take this any longer .
and what are you going to do after you ’ ve spent your money ?
well , sir , go inside .
i ’ m not going to be bothered by you for long .
you ’ ll get some of what you want .
now please leave me alone .
what you ’ re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually .
oh , corin , i wish you could understand how much i love her !
i ’ m sure i can guess .
oh , a thousand of them , all of which i ’ ve forgotten .
oh , then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me .
o phoebe , phoebe , phoebe !
but everything that lives is mortal , including the foolishness of love .
you speak more wisely than you know .
and like mine , but i ’ m getting a little tired of it .
please , one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him .
he ’ s not your relative .
but i ’ m a hired hand : i don ’ t profit from the flocks i tend .
who wants to buy the flock and the pasture ?
that young man who was just here .
and we will raise your wages .
the thing is definitely going to be sold .
more , more , please , more .
it ’ s only going to make you sad , monsieur jaques .
i ’ m glad about that .
more , please , more .
i can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs .
more , please , more .
i know i won ’ t please you .
come on , another stanza—is that what you call 'em , “ stanzas ” ?
nah , i don ’ t care what their
well then , if i ’ ve ever thanked a man , i ’ ll thank you now .
but two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together .
the duke will drink under this tree.—he ’ s been looking for you all day , you know .
and i ’ ve been avoiding him all day .
he ’ s too argumentative for me .
come , warble for me .
i wrote a verse to this tune , though it ’ s not very imaginative .
dear master , i can ’ t go any farther .
oh , i ’ m dying of hunger .
i ’ ll lie down here and measure out my grave .
hey , what ’ s this , adam ?
live a little , be comforted a little , cheer up a little .
you ’ re not as close to death as you think you are .
but if you die before i return , you ’ ll have made a mockery of my efforts .
you look happier already , and i ’ ll be back quickly .
but you ’ re lying out in the cold .
cheer up , good adam .
my lord , he just left here .
he was happy here , listening to a song .
tell him i want to speak with him .
he saved me the trouble : here he comes .
well , what ’ s going on , mister ?
what kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company ?
what , you look amused .
this way , we can see how the world moves .
only an hour ago it was nine , and in another hour it will be eleven .
motley is the only thing to wear .
god bless my old master .
he would never have spoken to me like this .
is that how it ’ s going to be ?
are you starting to challenge me ?
did you call for me , your worship ?
wasn ’ t charles , the duke ’ s wrestler , here to speak with me ?
yes , sir , he ’ s here at the door right now and asks to see you .
i have a good plan .
like the wind , i must have the freedom to blast anyone i please , as fools do .
and whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest .
why , sir , must he ?
well , it ’ s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church .
dress me up in motley .
i know what you ’ d do .
what would i do besides good ?
who can say i mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her ?
and when some lowlife protests that stop , and eat no more .
but i haven ’ t eaten anything yet .
and you won ’ t until the needy eat .
what kind of fighting cock is this ?
are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?
you were right the first time .
but stop , i say .
if you won ’ t listen to reason , i ’ ll have to die .
gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does .
i ’ m dying for food , so let me have some .
sit down and eat , and welcome to our table .
do you really speak like such a gentleman ?
i thought everything out here was wild , which is why i acted so stern and commanding .
there is a poor old man who , purely out of love , has limped after me for miles .
thank you , and god bless you for your hospitality .
you see , we ’ re not alone in our unhappiness .
the whole world is a stage , and all the men and women merely actors .
in the first act he is an infant , whimpering and puking in his nurse ’ s arms .
set the honorable old man down and let him eat .
i thank you very much on his behalf .

your logic is so foolish .
take it to your master and bring him home immediately .
every person i meet greets me like an old friend , and every one of them knows my name .
just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements .
these are tricks of the imagination , and this place is filled with magicians .
here ’ s the money you wanted , master .
who ’ s this adam you speak of ?
not the adam from the garden of eden , but the adam from the jailhouse .
i don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about .
are any ships leaving tonight ?
please , somebody , get us out of here !
good to see you , master antipholus .
i see you ’ ve met with the jeweler .
is that chain you ’ re wearing the one you promised to give to me ?
get away from me , satan !
don ’ t try to tempt me !
master , is this satan ’ s mistress ?
she ’ s the devil .
but fire also gives off light , and fire will burn you .
you and your servant are very funny , sir .
will you come with me ?
can we finish our lunch ?
master , if you eat with her , bring really long silverware .
some now listen , either give me my ring or give me the necklace .
i hope you ’ re not trying to cheat me .
come , dromio , let ’ s go .
mistress , you know about that .
antipholus has gone insane , no question about it .
now he won ’ t give me either .
his wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he ’ s having .
it ’ s my best option : i can ’ t afford to lose forty ducats .
i ’ ve spent five years in the remotest parts of greece and roaming all over asia .
however , i ’ ll do what i can for you .
i will allow you one day to look for help in ephesus .
don ’ t worry , man , i won ’ t try to escape .
i tell you , this will make her angry when she hears about it .
here ’ s my servant .
i think he ’ s got the money .
do you have what i told you to get ?
but where ’ s the money ?
why , sir , i spent it on this rope .
i can get you five hundred ropes for that price .
why did i just send you home ?
and here i am , with that piece .
and i ’ ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with .
good sir , calm down .
no , you should tell him to hold his hands !
i wish i were senseless , sir , so that i wouldn ’ t feel your punches !
the only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass .
i am an ass , indeed : you can tell by my long ears .
i figure that once he ’ s crippled me , i ’ ll beg by showing off my beatings .
my wife ’ s coming .
mistress , think about your end—beware of your death !
ephesus now what do you think ?
your husband ’ s mad , isn ’ t he ?
he ’ s trembling in his fit !
i demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven .
shut up , you doddering old wizard !
i ’ m not possessed !
oh , i wish you weren ’ t , you poor , frightened soul .
listen , hussy—is this man one of your customers ?
you there , rogue , what do you have to say about that ?
i swear , sir , you did not eat at home .
my doors were locked and i was shut out , right ?
by god , your doors were locked and you were shut out .
and she screamed at me , right ?
no lie—she screamed at you .
and her cook yelled , mocked , and teased me , right ?
and i departed in a rage , right ?
i gave it to dromio , who rushed in for it .
you gave money to me ?
didn ’ t you go to her for a purse full of ducats ?
he did , and i gave it to him .
and i saw her do it .
i was sent for a rope !
mistress , both the man and his master are possessed .
i can tell by how pale and deathlike they look .
we must tie them up and leave them in some dark room .
my sweet husband , i did not lock you out .
and my sweet master , i received no gold .
but i agree , sir , that we were locked out .
keep him away from me !
the devil in him is strong !
jailer , i ’ m your prisoner .
are you going to let them break me out of jail ?
gentlemen , let go of him .
he ’ s my prisoner and you can ’ t have him .
tie up the servant , for he is mad as well .
he ’ s my prisoner .
if i let him go , i ’ ll have to pay his bail fees myself .
i ’ ll pay you .
take me to the man my husband is in debt to .
master , i ’ m all tied up for you .
the poor souls—how strangely they talk !
for a necklace your husband had him make .
he said he was going to buy me a necklace , but i never saw it .
i need to hear the truth about all this .
god have mercy on us !
and they ’ ve got their swords unsheathed !
let ’ s call for help and get them tied up again !
let ’ s get out of here !
they ’ ll kill us !
it looks like these witches are scared of swords .
the one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you .
i wish we were safely on board our ship already .
look , let ’ s stay here tonight .
you see how kind everyone is to us , how they just hand us gold .
i think this country is so kind that if it weren ’ t for
i wouldn ’ t stay here tonight for the entire town .
go and get our stuff onto the ship .
what ’ s this man ’ s reputation like here in the city ?
i ’ d trust him with everything i own .
and that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn ’ t have !
good sir , stay close to me .
so , tell people that you ’ re from epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated .
here ’ s the money you asked me to hold .
it ’ ll be lunchtime within an hour .
many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
listen , will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn ?
i got it from you—i never said i didn ’ t .
yes , you did , sir .
who heard me do that ?
my own ears heard it , and you know it .
it ’ s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men .
you ’ re a villain to say this about me .
i do dare , and i say that you are the villain .
run , master , run .
for god ’ s sake , find a house to duck into .
this looks like an abbey .
go in , or we ’ re done for .
why have you come here in such a mob ?
to get my poor , mad husband out from inside there .
let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover .
how long has he been possessed like this ?
this week he was sad , moody , and depressed and very different from his usual self .
but it wasn ’ t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence .
that ’ s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander .
which of these bad things happened to him ?
you should have reprimanded him for that .
fine , but you weren ’ t harsh enough .
you scolded him in private ?
fine , but not enough .
he couldn ’ t eat without me talking about it .
all i ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was .
and that ’ s why he went crazy .
a jealous woman ’ s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog .
you seasoned his food with screams .
fever , as we know , is a kind of madness .
ruining his meals , his enjoyment , and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad .
what i ’ m saying is , your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity .
gentlemen , go in there and grab him .
then have your servants bring him out .
healing is part and parcel of my religious vows ; it is a charitable duty my order performs .
therefore , depart , and leave him here with me .
you ’ re not going to take him .
go lodge a complaint about this with the duke .
it ’ s almost five o'clock .
we will watch the execution .
kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey .
duke , the abbess has wronged me and i seek justice .
she ’ s a virtuous and holy lady .
she can ’ t possibly have done you any wrong .
your master and his servant are here .
mistress , i swear on my life that it ’ s true .
it was just moments ago .
oh , my , it ’ s my husband .
look , he can become invisible .
just now we put him in the abbey over here , and now he ’ s over there .
in exchange for the blood i shed for you then , i ask you for justice now .
the things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination .
today , great duke , she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores .
no , my good lord .
i ate with him and my sister .
damn my soul if these accusations are true !
my lord , i know what i ’ m saying .
he hadn ’ t arrived by the time we finished eating , so i went out looking for him .
i met him in the street—he was there with that man .
on the way , we came across my wife , her sister , and their gang of vile associates .
he pretended to be some kind of sorcerer , and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse .
they left me and my servant there , tied together .
he did , my lord .
i never saw the necklace , so help me heaven !
why , what a complicated case this is !
right now , my pressing business calls me away .
i will go lose myself , wandering up and down throughout the city .
sir , i leave you to your own contentment .
he leaves me to my own contentment , but that ’ s the one thing i can not find .
in order to find a mother and a brother , i too have lost myself , unhappily .
how is it that you ’ ve come back so soon ?
too late is more like it .
ate at home , but the jeweler says he didn ’ t .
sir , he ate with this woman at the porcupine .
he did , and he snatched my ring right off my finger .
that ’ s true , my lord : i did get this ring from her .
did you see him enter this abbey ?
as clearly as i see you , my lord .
i think you ’ re all either bewildered or stark raving mad .
mighty duke , please allow me to say something .
i think i see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life .
i was bound to him an hour ago , sir , but thankfully he chewed through our ropes .
now i ’ m dromio and no longer attached to him .
i ’ m sure you both remember me .
you ’ re not one of pinch ’ s patients , are you , sir ?
why are you looking at me so strangely ?
i never saw you before in my life .
oh , grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me .
but tell me this : don ’ t you know my voice ?
don ’ t you , dromio ?
no sir , trust me , i do not .
you don ’ t know my voice ?
all these aging faculties tell me—and i can not be wrong—that you are my son , antipholus .
i never saw my father in my life .
you know that we parted only seven years ago , in syracuse .
your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things .
mighty duke , look here and see a man who ’ s been treated most terribly !
either my eyes deceive me , or i see two husbands .
i , sir , am dromio .
command this man to leave .
i , sir , am dromio .
pray , let me stay .
oh , my old master ! —who tied him up ?
oh , if you are the same egeon , speak now , and speak to that same emilia !
if i ’ m not dreaming , you are emilia .
antipholus , aren ’ t you originally from corinth ?
wait , don ’ t stand next to each other .
i can ’ t tell who ’ s who .
i came from corinth , your highness .
and i came with him .
your renowned uncle , duke menaphon , the famous soldier , brought me here .
which of you two ate lunch with me today ?
i did , kind lady .
and you ’ re my husband , right ?
that ’ s the necklace i gave you , sir .
i think it is , sir .
i don ’ t deny it .
and you , sir , had me arrested over that necklace .
i think i did , sir .
i don ’ t deny it .
no , he didn ’ t get any by me .
i got this purse full of money from you , and my dromio brought it to me .
i want to use this money to set my father free .
that ’ s not necessary .
i ’ m going to let him live .
sir , i must get that diamond ring back from you .
there , take it , and thanks for taking such good care of me .
after such a long period of grief , we will have such a celebration !
with all my heart , i ’ ll join you .
dromio , what stuff of mine did you put on a ship ?
the stuff you had at the centaur , sir .
i ’ m your master , dromio .
i guess now she ’ s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife .
i think you ’ re my mirror , not my brother .
do you want to go in and join the party ?
you ’ re older than me .
that ’ s a good point .
how can we tell which of us is the oldest ?
we ’ ll draw straws .
answer me this , please : where ’ s the money i gave you ?
oh , the sixpence you gave me last wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress ?
the saddle maker has it , sir—i didn ’ t keep it .
i ’ m not in a joking mood .
tell me right now and stop fooling : where ’ s the money ?
we ’ re strangers here .
please , sir ; crack jokes over lunch .
that ’ s enough , dromio , please .
this isn ’ t a good moment for jokes—save them till a happier time .
where ’ s the gold i gave you ?
you didn ’ t give me any gold .
tell me what you ’ ve done with the money i entrusted to you .
my mistress and her sister are waiting for you .
your mistress ’ s marks ?
what mistress do you have ?
what , are you going to mock me to my face when i told you not to ?
there , take that , you scoundrel !
stop , for god ’ s sake !
well , if you don ’ t , then i ’ m out of here .
i swear , somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money .
neither my husband nor the slave has returned , even though i sent the slave off running .
surely , luciana , it ’ s already two o'clock .
maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch .
sister , let ’ s eat and stop worrying .
if this is so , be patient , sister .
why should men be more free than women ?
because their business lies outside the home .
why , too much freedom leads to woe .
therefore , you should obey their wishes .
it ’ s this servantlike mentality that ’ s keeping you unmarried .
no , that ’ s not it—it ’ s because of what happens in the marriage bed .
but if you were married , you ’ d wield some influence .
before i learn how to love , i ’ ll learn how to follow orders .
what if your husband strays elsewhere ?
i ’ d endure it until he came home again .
now that ’ s patience !
no wonder she ’ s waiting to get married .
but if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights , this foolish patience will abandon you .
well , i ’ ll get married one day , just to see .
tell me , is your tardy master close at hand ?
do you know his plans ?
but please , tell me : is he coming home ?
it seems he has taken great care to please his wife .
why , mistress , my master is as angry as a bull with horns .
i don ’ t mean he ’ s
my mistress , ” i said .
go back again , slave , and bring him home .
go back again , to be beaten home again ?
for god ’ s sake , send somebody else .
go back , slave , or i ’ ll knock you one across the head .
get out of here , you blathering peasant !
you kick me out , he kicks me back .
you have impatience all over your face .
has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks ?
have i lost my wit ?
one smile from him would repair my decayed beauty .
i am nothing but a poor , used fool .
drive it out of you .
i know his eyes are worshiping some other woman , or why wouldn ’ t he be here ?
sister , you know he promised to give me a necklace .
i would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me .
even the best jewel can be tarnished .
and no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior .
how many infatuated people go mad with jealousy !
give me the death sentence and end all my troubles .
therefore , by law , you are condemned to die .
i haven ’ t spoken to him since i sent him away from the marketplace earlier .
are you over your ridiculous mood ?
you never heard of the centaur ?
you weren ’ t given any gold ?
your mistress sent for me to come to dinner ?
the phoenix is my house ?
were you mad when you spoke to me so madly ?
when did i say all that ?
i haven ’ t seen you since you sent me to the centaur with the gold you gave me .
and i hope you realized i wasn ’ t very happy about it .
i ’ m glad to see you in such a merry mood .
but what ’ s the joke ?
please , master , tell me .
what , are you mocking me to my face ?
take that , and that !
stop , sir , for god ’ s sake !
now this joke has turned serious .
why are you doing this ?
you call it my “ don ’ t you know ?
should i tell you why ?
because you gave me something for nothing .
next time i ’ ll give you nothing for something .
well , then it will be dry .
if it is , i suggest you don ’ t eat it .
because it will make you angry , and that will get me another beating .
well , learn to make jokes at the appropriate time .
there ’ s a time for all things .
before you got so angry , i never would have thought that .
let ’ s hear it .
why is time so cheap about giving out hair ?
but a lot of men have more hair than intelligence .
so then , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded .
and good ones , too .
not good ones , please .
no , not sure ones when we ’ re talking about something unsure .
you were supposed to be proving that there isn ’ t time for everything .
how is it , my husband—oh , how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself ?
ah , don ’ t tear yourself away from me !
i don ’ t know you .
why are you treating my sister like this ?
she sent dromio to bring you home for lunch .
did you talk with this woman ?
what kind of scheme do you have going together ?
i never saw her till now .
you said those exact things to me back in the marketplace .
i never talked with her in my life .
what , was i married to her in a dream ?
or am i asleep now and imagining all this ?
what is making our eyes and ears act so strangely ?
until i know for sure , i ’ ll humor her .
dromio , tell the servants to prepare for lunch .
oh , i wish i had my rosary !
i ’ ll cross myself .
this must be some kind of fairyland .
oh , spite of spites !
why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order i gave you ?
dromio , you drone , you snail , you slug , you idiot !
i ’ ve been transformed somehow , haven ’ t i , master ?
no , master , i ’ ve been changed in both mind and body .
come , husband , let ’ s go to lunch .
am i on earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
master , should i watch the door ?
yes , and don ’ t let anyone come in , or else i ’ ll break your head .
well , syracusian , tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to ephesus .
and yet i would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad .
in the same hour , and in the same inn , a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys .
too quickly , we boarded a ship .
signior angelo , please excuse us .
say what you want , but i know what i know .
i think you ’ re an ass .
signior balthasar , you look upset .
your delicacies aren ’ t worth as much to me as your welcome is .
good food ’ s not a big deal—everyone can afford that .
and everyone can say “ welcome , ” which is just a word .
a little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast .
sure , to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest .
but look , even if my dishes are poor , eat them with my best wishes .
you may come across better food , but not a warmer welcome .
maud , bridget , marian , ciceley , gillian , ginn !
my master is standing out in the street !
who ’ s in there ?
hey , open the door !
so i can eat lunch .
i haven ’ t eaten today .
who do you think you are , keeping me out of my own house ?
you ’ ve stolen both my job and my name !
oh , lord , this makes me laugh !
i ’ ll come at you with the old proverb : “ should i make myself at home ? ”
listen up , you slave .
are you going to let us in ?
come , help me bang on the door , master .
we answered them , blow for blow .
you good-for-nothing , let me in .
master , knock hard upon the door .
if i break the door down , slave , you ’ ll be sorry for this .
is that you , wife ?
you could have come sooner .
if she punishes you , master , she ’ s sure to punish me .
we argued about which was best , and now we won ’ t get either one .
and if your clothes were as thin as mine , you ’ d really feel the air .
the food inside is warm , but you ’ re out here freezing .
it would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this .
go get me something i can use to break down the door .
i ’ ve had enough of this “ off with you ! ” come on , let me in !
well , i ’ m going to break in .
go get me a crow .
master , do you really mean that ?
don ’ t do this !
all this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you .
you ’ re right—i ’ ll go quietly .
and even though i ’ m in a distasteful mood , i ’ ll work on being happy .
i know a terrific wench .
we ’ ll eat at her place .
i swear to her that i haven ’ t , but it doesn ’ t change anything .
i ’ ll meet you there in an hour .
this little prank of hers is going to cost me .
is the building of your love already in ruins ?
what foolish thief brags about his crimes ?
we follow in your orbit , and you have the power to move us .
so , my sweet brother-in-law , go inside .
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine .
teach me how i should think and speak .
are you trying to remake me ?
go ahead , i ’ ll yield to your power .
but if i am myself , then i know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife .
i don ’ t owe her any duty—it ’ s you that i submit to .
are you insane , talking like this ?
your eyes are playing tricks on you .
that ’ s because you are near me , and you ’ re as dazzling as the sun .
why are you calling me “ love ” ?
your sister ’ s sister .
that ’ s my sister .
my sister is all those things , or else she should be .
call yourself your own sister , because i want you .
oh , wait , sir .
i ’ ll go get my sister and see what she thinks .
what ’ s going on , dromio ?
where are you running so fast ?
it carried us toward corinth–or so we thought .
but before they reached us–let me say no more !
you are dromio , you are my servant , and you are yourself .
what woman ’ s servant ?
what do you mean , beside yourself ?
how does she claim to own you ?
i don ’ t mean that she wants me because what ’ s she like ?
even if she lives till the end of the world , she ’ d keep burning an additional week .
what ’ s her skin like ?
it ’ s dark , like my shoe .
some water will fix that .
no , it ’ s permanent .
what ’ s her name ?
she ’ s round , like a globe .
what part of her body is ireland ?
honestly , i didn ’ t see it , but i felt it in her hot breath .
where ’ s america and the west indies ?
oh , sir , on her nose , which is covered with pimples , sores , and red welts .
if a ship ’ s leaving , come to the marketplace .
that means it ’ s high time for me to go .
that woman who claims i am her husband—i loathe her in my soul .
i ’ d better stop up my ears against this siren ’ s song .
i know that , sir .
look , here ’ s the necklace .
what do you want me to do with this ?
whatever you want—i made it for you .
i didn ’ t order it .
you did—not just once or twice , but twenty times .
you ’ re a funny man , sir .
i don ’ t know what to think about this .
i ’ ll go wait for dromio at the marketplace .
if any ships are sailing , i ’ ll get right on one .
antipholus owes me the exact amount that i owe you .
at five o'clock he ’ s going to pay me for it .
please , come to his house with me .
the total due is about three ducats more than i owe this gentleman .
please , pay him immediately .
i don ’ t have the cash right now .
besides , i have some business to take care of in town .
so you ’ ll bring the necklace to her yourself ?
all right , sir , i will .
do you have it with you ?
listen , please , give me the necklace .
you ’ re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the porcupine like you promised .
i should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it , but you started fighting with me first .
it ’ s getting late .
please , sir , hurry up .
antipholus , you hear how the man pleads with me .
give it to my wife , and get your money .
you know i gave it to you just now .
send the necklace to her , or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me .
damn it , this isn ’ t funny .
where ’ s the necklace ?
what should i pay you ?
the money you owe me for the necklace .
i owe you nothing until i receive the necklace .
you know that i gave it to you a half hour ago .
you wrong me even more , sir , by denying it .
consider how poorly this reflects on me .
pay for something i never got ?
go ahead , you fool .
arrest me if you dare .
i would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly .
you ’ re under arrest , sir .
i ’ ll obey you until i can make bail .
sir , the laws of ephesus will be on my side , and you ’ ll be embarrassed .
no , keep going , old man ; don ’ t stop like that .
for we may take pity on you , even if we can ’ t pardon you .
had the gods taken pity on us , i wouldn ’ t be here calling them merciless .
you annoying idiot , what epidamnum ship is waiting for me ?
a ship you sent me to find , to book passage out of here .
yeah , right—you sent me to get whipped .
you sent me to the port to find a ship .
go to adriana , you scoundrel , and quickly .
have her send it to me .
tell her that i ’ ve been arrested and the money will be my bail .
where that “ sweetheart ” said i was her husband !
she ’ s too much for me to handle .
but i must go there , against my will : servants must fulfill their masters ' wishes .
oh , luciana , did he tempt you like that ?
first , he said you had no right to him .
he meant he did nothing right for me—which is true , unfortunately .
then he swore he was a stranger here .
and that ’ s true—he then i pleaded for you .
and what did he say ?
that he felt for me the love that i begged him to feel for you .
how did he try to persuade you to love him ?
have some patience , please .
then why be jealous of a person like that ?
when an evil thing has been lost , no one cries .
my heart adores him , even though my tongue curses him .
how did you lose your breath ?
where ’ s your master , dromio ?
no , he ’ s in a place worse than hell .
a backbiting friend , one who grabs people , who patrols the streets and passageways .
speak , man , what ’ s the matter ?
tell me , who had him arrested ?
how could he be in debt without me knowing it ?
don ’ t you hear it ring ?
no , no , the bell .
it ’ s time for me to go .
it was two o'clock when i left him , and now it ’ s one .
i ’ ve never heard of that .
no , not me , sir .
in that case i wish you were as good a man as a fish seller .
only one man in ten thousand is good in this world .
that ’ s definitely true , my lord .
i do indeed , my lord .
then by all means never let her walk in public .
procreation is a good thing , but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out , friend .
and what is the subject ?
i mean , what do the words say ?
oh , just lies , sir .
well , that ’ s certainly out of this world , all right .
you ’ re looking for lord hamlet .
he ’ s right over there .
ah , my good old friends !
how are you , guildenstern ?
boys , how are you both doing ?
happy that we ’ re not too happy , lucky in being not too lucky .
but you ’ re not down and out , either , are you ?
so you ’ re around lady luck ’ s waist ?
yes , we ’ re the privates in her army .
anyway , what ’ s up ?
but you ’ re wrong .
let me ask you a particular question .
what crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison ?
denmark ’ s a prison .
then i guess the whole world is one .
yes , quite a large one , with many cells and dungeons , denmark being one of the worst .
we don ’ t think so , my lord .
and to me , denmark is a prison .
that must be because you ’ re so ambitious .
it ’ s too small for your large mind .
dreams are a sign of ambition , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream .
but a dream itself is just a shadow .
or was it just your whim , on your own initiative ?
what should we say , my lord ?
i know the king and queen sent for you .
why would they do that , my lord ?
that ’ s what i want you to tell me .
my lord , we were sent for .
is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day ?
who can explain this to me ?
or at least i can describe the rumors .
so why did you laugh when i said that men don ’ t interest me ?
the one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome .
the tragic actors from the city , the ones you used to enjoy so much .
what are they doing on the road ?
they made more money and got more attention in the city .
but things have changed there , and it ’ s easier for them on the road now .
are they as popular as they used to be when i lived in the city ?
do they attract big audiences ?
no , not like before .
no , they ’ re busy and as excellent as ever .
what , you mean kid actors ?
who takes care of them ?
will they stop working when their voices mature ?
there ’ s been a whole debate on the topic .
oh , there ’ s been a lot of quarreling .
and the boys are winning so far ?
actually , it ’ s not so unusual when you think about it .
there ’ s something downright unnatural about it , if a philosopher stopped to think about it .
gentlemen , welcome to elsinore .
don ’ t be shy—shake hands with me .
you are very welcome here .
but still , my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea .
in what sense , my lord ?
i ’ m only crazy sometimes .
at other times , i know what ’ s what .
gentlemen , i hope you are well .
listen , guildenstern , and you too , rosencrantz—listen as close as you can !
yes , the second time around , since , as they say , old people become children again .
my lord , i have news for you .
my lord , i have news for you .
when roscius was an actor in ancient rome — the actors have arrived , my lord .
i swear— —each actor arrived on his ass .
well , aren ’ t i right , jephthah , old man ?
what is logical , then , my lord ?
welcome , welcome to all of you .
which speech , my lord ?
i loved one speech in particular .
this speech is going on too long .
we ’ ll have the barber trim it later , along with your beard .
the muffled queen ” is good .
look how flushed the actor is , with tears in his eyes .
my lord , i will give them all they deserve .
good heavens , man , give them more than that !
treat them with honor and dignity .
the less they deserve , the more your generosity is worth .
we ’ ll watch a whole play tomorrow .
then we ’ ll see that tomorrow night .
follow that gentleman now , and be careful not to make fun of him .
my good friends , i ’ ll see you tomorrow .
now i ’ m alone .
oh , what a mean low-life i am !
the ghost is definitely something to worry about .
i ’ ll meet it if it ’ s the last thing i do .
if you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
call me the worst liar ?
remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
what an ass i am .
murder has no tongue , but miraculously it still finds a way to speak .
if he becomes pale , i know what to do .
i need better evidence than the ghost to work with .
the play ’ s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .
did he treat you well when you saw him ?
yes , in a very gentlemanly way .
he didn ’ t ask questions , but answered ours at length .
madam , some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here .
it ’ s true , and he asked me to beg you both to attend .
it makes me very happy to hear he ’ s so interested .
gentlemen , please try to sharpen his interest even more , and let this play do him some good .
we will , my lord .
yes , i ’ ll go .
i hope so too , madam .
ophelia , come here.— i hear him coming .
quick , let ’ s hide , my lord .
to die , to sleep—to sleep , maybe to dream .
that ’ s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long .
but hello , my lord , how have you been doing lately ?
very well , thank you .
well , well , well .
ha ha , are you good ?
my lord , what are you talking about ?
but could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?
this used to be a great puzzle , but now i ’ ve solved it .
i used to love you .
you certainly made me believe you did , my lord .
i didn ’ t love you .
then i guess i was misled .
why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven ?
every one of us is a criminal .
don ’ t believe any of us .
where ’ s your father ?
he ’ s at home , my lord .
lock him in , so he can play the fool in his own home only .
oh , dear god , please help him !
get yourself to a convent , at once .
dear god , please make him normal again !
i ’ ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too .
god gives you one face , but you paint another on top of it .
come on , i won ’ t stand for it anymore .
it ’ s driven me crazy .
i hereby declare we will have no more marriage .
whoever is already married ( except one person i know ) will stay married—all but one person .
everyone else will have to stay single .
get yourself to a convent , fast .
his feelings don ’ t move in that direction .
what do you think of this plan ?
but i still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—hello , ophelia .
you don ’ t have to tell us what lord hamlet said .
i ’ ll hide and listen in .
that ’ s how we ’ ll do it , then .
keep it from leaving , marcellus .
should i strike it with my spear ?
yes , if it doesn ’ t stand still .
it ’ s over here .
it was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
perform the speech just as i taught you , musically and smoothly .
i would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .
but don ’ t be too tame , either—let your good sense guide you .
i hope we ’ ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company , sir .
oh , correct it completely .
yes , he will , and the queen as well .
tell the actors to hurry .
will you two help them get ready ?
well , hello there , horatio !
here i am at your service , my dear lord .
horatio , you ’ re the best man i ’ ve ever known .
oh , sir— don ’ t think i ’ m flattering you .
why would anyone flatter a poor person ?
no , keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well .
i can ’ t talk now .
so how ’ s my nephew hamlet doing ?
i eat the air , like chameleons do .
i ’ m positively stuffed with air , i eat so much of it .
i have no idea what you ’ re talking about , hamlet .
you ’ re not answering my question .
indeed i did , my lord .
what role did you play ?
i was killed in the capitol .
they ’ re ready whenever you are .
no thanks , my good mother .
there ’ s a nicer piece of work right here .
my lady , should i lie in your lap ?
i mean , with my head in your lap ?
did you think i was talking about sex ?
what is , my lord ?
you ’ re in a good mood tonight , my lord .
oh god—who is , by the way , the best comic of them all .
what can you do but be happy ?
look how cheerful my mother is , only two hours after my father died .
no , my lord , it ’ s been four months .
i ’ ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit .
this means we ’ re having some mischievous fun .
this pantomime was probably a summary of the play .
this guy will tell us everything .
actors can ’ t keep a secret .
they ’ ll tell all .
will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?
sure , or anything else you show him .
i ’ m watching the play .
was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring ?
it was a bit short , my lord .
yes , as short as a woman ’ s love .
madam , how are you liking this play ?
the lady ’ s overdoing it , i think .
oh , but she ’ ll keep her word .
is there anything offensive in it ?
what ’ s the play called ?
yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed .
we ’ re all waiting for the revenge !
the original story was written in the finest italian .
you ’ ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of gonzago ’ s wife .
the king is getting up .
what—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank ?
my lord , how are you feeling ?
get me out of here !
lights , lights , get us some lights !
no , a whole share for me .
yes , i did , my lord .
when the actors were talking about poison ?
i watched him very closely .
hey , let ’ s have some music here !
my lord , could i have a word with you ?
you can have a whole story , not just a word .
sir , the king— yes , what about him ?
he ’ s in his chambers now , and he ’ s extremely upset .
i ’ ll be good , sir .
the queen your mother is upset , and sent me to see you .
it ’ s lovely to see you .
no , my lord , your polite words are not to the point .
if you could please stop fooling around , i ’ ll tell you what your mother wants .
if not , i ’ ll leave you alone and that ’ ll be the end of my business .
sir , i can ’ t .
can ’ t what , my lord ?
okay , to the point .
oh , what a wonderful son , i can impress my mother !
but what ’ s the upshot of her admiration ?
she wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
i ’ d obey even if she were my mother ten times over .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
my lord , you used to like me .
and still do , i swear by my hands .
my lord , what ’ s wrong with you ?
sir , i have no future ahead of me .
i don ’ t really understand what you mean .
will you play this recorder ?
i can ’ t , my lord .
i ’ m serious , i can ’ t .
i ’ m begging you .
i have no idea how .
oh , it ’ s as easy as lying .
but i can ’ t play a melody .
i don ’ t know how .
my god , do you think i ’ m easier to manipulate than a pipe ?
you can push my buttons , but you can ’ t play me for a fool .
hello and god bless you , sir .
my lord , the queen wants to speak with you right away .
do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel ?
by god , it does look like a camel .
to me it looks like a weasel .
it does have a back like a weasel ’ s .
yes , very much like a whale .
i ’ ll go see my mother soon .
i ’ ll tell her .
i could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight .
and so , my words and thoughts will be at odds .
i ’ m sending you to england on diplomatic business , and hamlet will go with you .
as king , i can not risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour .
we ’ ll take care of it .
whenever a king sighs , everyone groans .
prepare yourself , please , for this trip .
we ’ ll put a leash on this danger that ’ s now running wild .
my lord , hamlet ’ s going to his mother ’ s room .
i ’ ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say .
i bet she ’ ll chew him out .
i ’ ll stop by before you go to bed , and tell you what i ’ ve heard .
thanks , my dear lord .
can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime ?
what is there left to do ?
but it can ’ t help either !
my heart ’ s as black as death .
c ’ mon , make an effort .
i could do it easily now .
he ’ s praying now .
and now i ’ ll do it .
he ’ ll come right away .
i ’ ll be right here , silent .
have you forgotten who i am ?
what are you going to do ?
you won ’ t kill me , will you ?
what is it , laertes ?
what would you like , laertes ?
please , let me go .
i have to go to england , don ’ t you know that ?
oh , this is terrible !
his wildness is a threat to all of us—to you , to me , to everyone .
i ’ ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes , and dust to dust .
besides , you ’ re a sponge !
you think i ’ m a sponge , my lord ?
i ’ m glad about that .
a thing of no importance .
how dangerous to have this madman on the loose !
but a terminal disease requires extreme treatment , or nothing at all .
what do you mean by that ?
so get ready to leave .
don ’ t waste any time .
i ’ ll tell him , my lord .
is he attacking the heartland of poland or some frontier ?
in the end i grudgingly consented .
i hereby grant your request , and hope you have a good time .
so why does it seem so particular to you ?
so then the poles won ’ t be willing to defend it .
i have the motivation , the willpower , the ability , and the means to do it .
i won ’ t speak to her .
in fact , she ’ s crazed .
may god be at your table .
good night , ladies , good night , sweet ladies , good night , good night .
where ’ s this so-called king ?
let him go , gertrude .
where ’ s my father ?
don ’ t mess with me .
only my free will—nothing else .
do you want to know who they are , then ?
what ’ s that noise ?
it ’ s not manly .
and you ’ re right to do so .
please , come with me .
who are the people who want to speak with me ?
they say they have letters for you .
may he bless you , too .
he will , sir , if he wants to .
i have a lot to tell you about them .
i didn ’ t see them .
laertes , i want you to hear what they say .
do you recognize the handwriting ?
naked , ” he says .
that ’ ll be fine .
what quality is that , my lord ?
yes , that ’ s the one .
he ’ s his homeland ’ s jewel .
that ’ s the right answer—it shows your love .
but wait , what ’ s that sound ?
let ’ s follow him , gertrude .
let ’ s follow him .
here ’ s the water , right ?
is that how the law sees it ?
the coroner ’ s inquest law .
do you want to know the truth ?
well there , now you ’ ve said it .
they keep up adam ’ s profession .
what , aren ’ t you a christian ?
i ’ ll ask you another question .
if you can ’ t answer it— go ahead !
ah , i ’ ve got it !
now go and get me some booze .
could that be a lawyer ’ s skull ?
no more than that , my lord .
yes , my lord , and calfskin too .
it ’ s mine , sir .
for no man , sir .
how literal this guy is !
you don ’ t know that ?
he ’ ll recover his sanity there .
what do you mean , “ in a strange way ” ?
how long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot ?
a leathermaker will last nine years .
i really don ’ t know .
are you sad about that ?
horatio , tell me something .
oh god , do i have to remember that ?
that ’ s not good , and no good can come of it either .
nice to see you again , horatio—that is your name , right ?
that ’ s me , sir .
i ’ ll change that name for you .
what ’ s that , my lord ?
do you think alexander the great looked like this when he was buried ?
and smelled like that , too ?
just as bad , my lord .
how low we can fall , horatio .
if you thought that you ’ d be thinking too much .
no , not at all .
oh , to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall !
but quiet , be quiet a minute .
here comes the king , the queen , and the noblemen of court .
let ’ s stay and watch a while .
what other rites are you going to give her ?
she deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body .
isn ’ t there any other rite you can perform ?
lay her in the ground , and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh !
sweet flowers for a sweet girl .
hold off burying her until i ’ ve caught her in my arms once more .
that ’ s no way to pray .
oh , my son , what issue is that ?
forty thousand brothers , if you added all their love together , couldn ’ t match mine .
what are you going to do for her ?
oh , he ’ s crazy , laertes !
for the love of god , be patient with him .
damn it , show me what you ’ re going to do for her .
i ’ ll do all that .
and if you rattle on about mountains , then let them throw millions of acres over us .
he ’ ll be like this for a little while .
then he ’ ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch .
but it doesn ’ t matter .
please , horatio , go with him .
no , who are long live the king !
yes , it ’ s me .
you ’ ve come right on time .
the clock ’ s just striking twelve .
go home to bed , francisco .
thanks for letting me go .
it ’ s bitterly cold out , and i ’ m depressed .
has it been a quiet night ?
i haven ’ t even heard a mouse squeak .
i think i hear them .
that ’ s enough about that .
now i ’ ll tell you the other story about my journey .
do you remember the circumstances ?
how could i forget , my lord !
there was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn ’ t let me sleep .
it was worse than being a captive in chains .
yes , please tell me .
do you want to know what i wrote ?
the next day we had our fight at sea , and you know what happened after that .
so rosencrantz and guildenstern are in for it .
man , they were asking for it .
i don ’ t feel guilty about them at all .
they got what they deserved .
it ’ s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents .
what a king claudius is !
isn ’ t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience ?
and wouldn ’ t i be damned if i let this monster live to do more harm ?
he ’ ll find out soon what happened in england .
but i have the meantime .
i ’ ll be nice to him .
it was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury .
hang on a minute—who are you ?
welcome back to denmark , my lord .
thank you kindly , sir .
my lord , if you have a free moment , i have a message from his majesty .
no thank you , my lord .
it ’ s very hot .
it is rather cold , indeed , my lord .
and yet i feel it ’ s very hot and humid , which is bad for my complexion .
yes indeed it is , sir .
very humid , i can ’ t tell you how humid it is .
i felt like skipping school , sir .
i know you ’ d never skip school .
what are you doing here in elsinore ?
i ’ ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave .
sir , we came to see your father ’ s funeral .
please , don ’ t make fun of me .
i think you came to see my mother ’ s wedding instead .
well , sir , it ’ s true it came soon after .
the leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet .
my father—i think i see my father .
in my imagination , horatio .
he was an admirable king .
he was a great human being .
he was perfect in everything .
i ’ ll never see the likes of him again .
you speak absolutely correctly , sir .
and what ’ s the point , sir ?
why are we talking about him like this ?
i know you know something— thanks for the compliment , i ’ m happy you know that .
but in fact it doesn ’ t say much .
i ’ m sorry , you were saying ?
i know you know something about how excellent laertes is—
i can ’ t admit that , since you ’ d have to compare his excellence to mine .
excellent in fencing , i mean , sir .
the rapier and the dagger .
those are only two of his weapons .
three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed , and they match the fencing accessories .
what do you mean by “ carriages ” ?
the carriages , sir , are the hangers—where the swords hang .
carriage ” makes it sound like it ’ s pulling around a cannon .
i prefer to call it a “ hanger. ” but anyway .
why has all this been put on the table ?
but what if my answer ’ s no ?
it ’ s my exercise time .
my services are at your command .
it ’ s a good thing he ’ s here to recommend himself .
he used to praise his mother ’ s nipple before he sucked it .
the king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away , or wait awhile .
i ’ ll do whatever the king wants .
if he ’ s ready now , so am i .
otherwise , i ’ ll do it anytime , as long as i ’ m able .
the king and queen are coming down with everyone else .
the queen wants you to chat with laertes—politely—before you begin your match .
she ’ s full of good advice .
you ’ re going to lose this bet , my lord .
i don ’ t think so .
i ’ ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to france .
with the handicap they ’ ve given me , i think i ’ ll win .
but i have a sinking feeling anyway .
i ’ ll say you ’ re not feeling well .
you ’ ll do no such thing .
i thumb my nose at superstitions .
what ’ s important is to be prepared .
since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind , then what does it mean to leave early ?
come shake hands with laertes , hamlet .
yes , hand me one too .
i ’ m going to make you look sharp , laertes .
you ’ re making fun of me .
no , i swear i ’ m not .
yes , my lord , quite well .
you ’ ve bet on the weaker fencer .
i ’ ve seen both of you fence .
but since laertes is better , we ’ ve given him a handicap .
put the goblets of wine on that table .
come on , my lord .
no , it wasn ’ t .
it was obviously a hit .
well , let ’ s go on .
give me a goblet.—hamlet , this pearl ’ s yours .
here ’ s to your health .
you got me , i admit it .
he ’ s flabby and out of breath.—here , hamlet , take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead .
the queen drinks to your good luck and happiness , hamlet .
gertrude , don ’ t drink that .
i ’ ll drink it if i like .
i ’ d better not drink now .
i ’ ll drink later .
come on , let me wipe your face .
get ready for the third hit , laertes .
you ’ re just playing around .
come on , give me your best shot .
i sense you ’ re treating me like a child .
they ’ re overdoing it .
no , come on , one more time .
take care of the queen !
both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel , my lord ?
how do you feel , laertes ?
like a mouse caught in my own trap , osric .
how ’ s the queen ?
she fainted at the sight of them bleeding .
the drink , the drink !
i ’ ve been poisoned .
we ’ ve been betrayed !
find out who did it !
i ’ m the one , hamlet .
hamlet , you ’ re dead .
no medicine in the world can cure you .
you don ’ t have more than half an hour to live .
the treacherous weapon is right in your hand , sharp and dipped in poison .
the foul plan backfired on me .
here i lie and will never get up again .
your mother ’ s been poisoned .
i can ’ t speak anymore .
the king , the king ’ s to blame .
then get to work , poison !
sir , i think i saw him last night .
the king my father ? !
just listen carefully while i tell you the amazing thing i saw , with these gentlemen as witnesses .
for god ’ s sake , let me hear it .
but where did this happen ?
protect me , my friends .
i ’ ve only been hurt , not killed .
here , you goddamn incest-breeding danish murderer , drink this .
is your little pearl in there ?
he got what he deserved .
he mixed that poison himself .
please forgive me as i forgive you , hamlet .
god will free you from blame .
i ’ m more like an ancient roman than a corrupt modern dane .
some of this liquor ’ s still left in the goblet .
please , give me that goblet , if you love me .
i ’ ll get it from you , i swear .
what are these warlike noises ?
young fortinbras , returning in triumph from poland , is firing his guns to greet the english ambassadors .
oh , i ’ m dying , horatio !
this strong poison ’ s overpowering me .
i will not live to hear the news from england .
but i bet fortinbras will win the election to the danish crown .
he ’ s got my vote as i die .
oh , oh , oh , oh .
what do i see here ?
what would you like to see ?
this is a horrible sight .
who will thank us now ?
as for me , i welcome my good luck with sadness .
let four captains carry hamlet like a soldier onto the stage .
military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities .
on the platform where we stand guard , sir .
didn ’ t you talk to it ?
i did , sir , but it didn ’ t answer me .
that ’ s very strange .
i swear to god it ’ s true , sir .
we thought you ought to know about it .
yes , i should know , but it disturbs me .
are you on duty again tonight ?
it was armed , you say ?
yes , from top to bottom , sir .
so you couldn ’ t see his face , then ?
oh , yes , we could , sir .
he had his helmet visor up .
was he pale or flushed and red-faced ?
did he stare at you ?
i wish i ’ d been there .
did it stay a long time ?
about as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred .
no , longer than that .
not the time i saw it .
his beard was gray , right ?
it was just like in real life , dark brown with silver whiskers in it .
i ’ ll stand guard with you tonight .
maybe it ’ ll come again .
i ask you , if you ’ ve kept this a secret , keep doing so .
whatever happens tonight , don ’ t talk about it .
i ’ ll return the favor .
i ’ ll see you on the guards ' platform between eleven and twelve tonight .
we ’ ll do our duty to you , sir .
give me your love instead , as i give you mine .
my father ’ s ghost—armed !
i suspect some foul play .
i wish the night were here already !
until then , i have to remain calm .
bad deeds will be revealed , no matter how people try to hide them .
my belongings are on the ship already .
do you doubt i ’ ll write ?
it won ’ t last .
no more than a minute ?
just keep your love under control , and don ’ t let yourself become a target of his lust .
baby blooms are most susceptible to disease .
fear will keep you safe .
young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others .
i ’ ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart .
don ’ t worry , i won ’ t .
i ’ ve been here too long .
you ’ re still here ?
shame on you—get on board !
the wind is filling your ship ’ s sail , and they ’ re waiting for you .
here , i give you my blessing again .
and just try to remember a few rules of life .
be friendly to people but don ’ t overdo it .
listen to many people , but talk to few .
hear everyone ’ s opinion , but reserve your judgment .
it ’ s locked away in my memory , and you ’ ve got the key .
what did he tell you , ophelia ?
what ’ s going on between you two ?
he ’ s offered me a lot of affection lately .
affection ! ” that ’ s nothing !
you ’ re talking like some innocent girl who doesn ’ t understand the ways of the world .
do you believe his “ offers , ” as you call them ?
i don ’ t know what to believe , father .
then i ’ ll tell you .
believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “ offers ” are something real .
and he ’ s made the holiest vows to me , to back up what he says .
these vows are just traps for stupid birds .
i know when a man is on fire , he ’ ll swear anything .
remember that hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .
i ’ ll do as you say , father .
and servants of the danish king .
good night to you both .
who ’ s taken over the watch for you ?
barnardo ’ s taken my place .
so , tell us , did you see that thing again tonight ?
i haven ’ t seen anything .
yes , it ’ s definitely nippy .
a little before twelve , i think .
no , it ’ s just after twelve ; i heard the clock strike .
i didn ’ t hear it .
so it ’ s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear .
what does that mean , sir ?
other countries criticize us for our loud partying .
they call us drunks and insult our noble titles .
and our drunkenness does detract from our achievements , as great as they are , and lessens our reputations .
a tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations .
look , sir—here it comes !
oh angels , protect us !
where we quietly buried you , has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again .
it wants you to go off with it , as if it wants to tell you something alone .
look how politely it ’ s pointing you to a place that ’ s farther away .
but don ’ t go .
don ’ t do it , sir .
why , what ’ s the danger ?
look , it ’ s waving me over again .
i ’ ll follow it .
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane .
it ’ s still waving to me .
you ’ re not going , sir .
you ’ re not going anywhere .
let me go , gentlemen .
i swear , if anyone holds me back , i ’ ll make a ghost of him !
his imagination is making him crazy .
let ’ s follow them .
it ’ s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone .
no , let ’ s follow him .
where are you taking me ?
the hour has almost come when i have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .
i ’ m ready to hear you .
you must be ready for revenge , too , when you hear me out .
if i weren ’ t forbidden to tell you the secrets of
make your eyes jump out of their sockets , and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills .
but mortals like you aren ’ t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife .
if you ever loved your poor dear father— oh god !
take revenge for his horrible murder , that crime against nature .
murder ’ s always horrible , but this one was especially horrible , weird , and unnatural .
you ’ d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of i knew it !
oh , hamlet , how far she fell !
so let me be brief here .
oh , it ’ s horrible , horrible , so horrible !
if you are human , don ’ t stand for it .
don ’ t let the danish king ’ s bed be a nest of incest .
leave her to god and her own guilt .
the glowworm ’ s light is beginning to fade , so morning is near .
good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
ah , all you up in heaven !
shall i include hell as well ?
keep beating , my heart , and muscles , don ’ t grow old yet—keep me standing .
yes , you poor ghost , as long as i have any power of memory in this distracted head .
oh , you evil woman !
oh , you villain , villain , you damned , smiling villain !
at least it ’ s possible in denmark .
he said , “ remember me. ” i swore i would .
lord hamlet.— please let him be all right !
i ’ m all right .
so how did it go , sir ?
oh , please , tell us , sir .
i swear i won ’ t , sir .
i won ’ t either , sir .
but you promise you can keep a secret ?
well , let ’ s sit down and listen to barnardo tell us .
it ’ s come again .
looking just like the dead king .
it wants us to speak to it .
ask it something , horatio .
by god , i order you to speak .
any villain in denmark is going to be , well , a villain .
you don ’ t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that , sir .
yes , you ’ re absolutely right .
you ’ re talking in such a crazy way , sir .
ah , but there is , horatio , there ’ s a lot of offense .
but regarding what happened between us , don ’ t ask—i can ’ t tell you .
and now , my friends , my courageous and educated friends , do me one small favor .
what is it , sir ?
don ’ t ever tell anyone what you ’ ve seen tonight .
we won ’ t , sir .
no , you have to swear it .
i swear to god i won ’ t .
me too , i won ’ t , i swear to god .
but we already swore , sir .
yes , but swear by my sword this time .
you swear never to mention what you ’ ve seen .
come over here , gentlemen , and put your hands on my sword again .
swear by my sword you ’ ll never mention what you ’ ve heard .
you said it right , old mole .
let ’ s move again , my friends .
my god , this is unbelievably strange .
then give it a nice welcome , as you would give to any stranger .
there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio , than you ’ ve even dreamed of .
swear you won ’ t .
let ’ s go back to court together , but
give him this money and these letters , reynaldo .
that ’ s what i thought too , sir .
do you get what i ’ m saying , reynaldo ?
yes , very well , sir .
you should say , “ i sort of know him , but not well .
isn ’ t he the one who ’ s always , ” and so on .
that ’ s right , or drinking , swearing , fist-fighting , visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing .
but that would ruin his reputation !
oh no , not if you say it right .
but , sir— why should you do this , you want to know ?
i ’ d like to know .
and then he ’ ll … he ’ ll … wait , what was i about to say ?
good god , i was about to say something .
you get my point , don ’ t you ?
yes , i do , sir .
and i hope he ’ s studying his music like he ’ s supposed to .
from what , in god ’ s name ?
is he crazy with love for you ?
he stayed like that a long time .
i ’ ll go tell the king about this .
love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct , as much as any strong emotion .
i ’ m so sorry .
that ’ s what made him crazy .
i regret not observing him more closely before i told you to do that .
i thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation .
come on , let ’ s go see the king .
welcome , dear rosencrantz and guildenstern .
but we ’ ll obey .
thanks , rosencrantz and worthy guildenstern .
thanks , guildenstern and worthy rosencrantz .
i beg you to pay a visit right away to my son , who ’ s changed too much .
servants , take these gentlemen to see hamlet .
i hope to god we can make him happy and do him some good !
the ambassadors are back from norway , sir .
once again you bring good news .
i assure your majesty i ’ m only doing my duty both to my god and my good king .
it looks like you ’ ve offended it .
look , it ’ s going away .
i order you , speak !
what ’ s going on , horatio ?
you ’ re pale and trembling .
you agree now that we ’ re not imagining this , don ’ t you ?
what do you think about it ?
doesn ’ t it look like the king ?
yes , as much as you look like yourself .
the king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of norway .
i want very much to find out .
all right , but first let the ambassadors speak .
then you can hear my news , as dessert .
then be so kind as to show them in .
gertrude , he says he ’ s found out the reason for your son ’ s insanity .
welcome , my good friends .
tell me , voltemand , what ’ s the news from the king of norway ?
fortinbras swore never to threaten denmark again .
meanwhile , thank you for your efforts .
tonight we ’ ll have dinner .
well , that turned out well in the end .
but that ’ s another story .
madam , please be patient .
i ’ ll read it to you .
oh , ophelia , i ’ m bad at poetry .
hamlet. ” dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter , and more like it .
and how did she react to all this ?
sir , what is your opinion of me ?
i know you are loyal and honorable .
i would like to prove to you that i am .
no , i had to do something .
it may be , it certainly may be .
not that i know of .
what can we do to find out if it ’ s true ?
well , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .
when he ’ s there next time , i ’ ll send my daughter to see him .
please go away , both of you .
i ’ ll speak to him now .
oh , please let me .
how are you , hamlet ?
do you know who i am ?
it ’ s a disgrace to us all .
it ’ s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal .
who talks of my nation ?
i do not know that you are as good a man as myself .
so , by christ , i ’ ll cut off your head .
now , now , both of you gentlemen !
yes , and that ’ s a serious failing .
the town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation .
what has the governor of the town decided ?
this is the final discussion i will grant .
what power can rein in promiscuous evil once it ’ s gotten rolling ?
will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town ?
today our hopes are at an end .
therefore , great king , we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy .
come , uncle exeter , enter harfleur .
stay there and fortify it well against the french .
tonight in harfleur we will be your guest ; tomorrow we ’ ll march on .
that ’ s enough for one lesson .
he ’ s certainly crossed the river somme .
and if he advances unopposed , my lord , let us abandon france .
let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation .
and shall our lively blood , quickened by wine , be so frosty ?
where is montjoy , the herald ?
send him on his way quickly .
tell him to greet the king of england with our sharp defiance .
prince dauphin , you ’ ll stay with me in rouen .
no , please , i beg your majesty .
be patient , because you ’ re staying with me .
is the duke of exeter safe ?
he is called ensign pistol .
i don ’ t know him .
captain , i have a favor to beg of you .
you ’ re on very good terms with the duke of exeter .
yes , god be praised , i have managed to earn his favor .
she provides an excellent moral .
i ’ m glad to hear it .
then die and be damned !
why , that man is a total fraud and rascal .
what he just said to me—it ’ s alright .
but you must learn to recognize such liars , or you will be greatly taken advantage of .
if i find an opportunity , i will give him a piece of my mind .
tell me , fluellen : did you just come from the bridge ?
the duke of exeter has held the bridge very gallantly .
the french have retreated , see , and there were great acts of courage .
i can tell your majesty , the duke is a brave man .
what men have you lost , fluellen ?
the enemy ’ s losses have been very great , pretty substantial .
you know from my clothing who i am .
well then , i know who you are .
what do you have to tell me ?
my master ’ s decision .
strategy makes a better soldier than haste .
now the time is right for us to speak , and we do so with imperial authority .
what kept you from telling him this ?
the french ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king .
and , in fact , i think they ’ re meeting together right now .
you do your job well .
but god forgive me for bragging .
anyway , go tell your master i am here .
i ’ ll deliver the message .
i hope they don ’ t attack us now .
we ’ re in god ’ s hands , brother , not in theirs .
i have the best armor in the world .
i wish it were day !
you have wonderful armor , but give my horse his due .
it is the best horse in europe .
will it never be morning ?
my lord of orléans , and my lord high constable , are you talking about horses and armor ?
you are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world .
what a long night this is !
i will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs .
he leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs .
the earth sings when he touches it .
the lowest part of his hoof is more musical than pan ’ s pipe .
he ’ s the color of nutmeg .
he is an animal worthy of perseus .
he is indeed worthy of the name “ horse , ” and you can call all the rest beasts .
indeed , my lord , he is a perfectly wonderful horse .
he is the prince of horses .
his neigh is like a monarch ’ s command .
it ’ s a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea .
then the writer imitated the one i composed to my steed , for my horse is my mistress .
your mistress is a good mount .
so , perhaps , did yours .
mine wasn ’ t wearing a bridle .
you ’ re a good judge of horsemanship .
take a tip from me , then .
i ’ d rather have my horse than a mistress .
i ’ d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse .
i ’ ll tell you this , constable , my mistress has his own hair .
i could make the same boast even if i had a pig as my mistress .
at least i don ’ t have a horse for my mistress—or a saying so beside the point .
my lord constable , are those stars or suns i saw on the armor in your tent tonight ?
i hope some will fall off tomorrow .
and yet i ’ ll still have plenty .
i only wish i could load him up with all the praise he deserves !
oh , will it never be day ?
i ’ ll go put my armor on .
the dauphin really wants it to be morning .
he wants to eat the english .
swear by her foot , so she can stamp out the oath .
he ’ s definitely the most active gentleman of france .
performing is activity , and he is always doing that .
he never did harm that i heard of .
and he ’ s not going to do any tomorrow .
that part of his reputation will stand .
i know him to be valiant .
i was told that by one who knows him better than you .
why , he told me so himself , and he said he didn ’ t care who knew it .
he doesn ’ t have to care .
his virtue is not hidden .
his courage is hidden , and when it is revealed , it will shrink .
ill will never prompted anything well said .
i ’ ve outshot you , and not for the first time .
my lord high constable , the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
he doesn ’ t long for the dawn as we do .
if the english had any sense , they would run away .
if there were anything inside their heads , they could never wear such heavy helmets .
that island of england breeds very valiant creatures .
their hounds are unequaled in courage .
foolish dogs , blindly running straight toward a russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
yes , but these english are seriously short of beef .
then tomorrow we ’ ll find that they feel only like eating , not like fighting .
it ’ s time to put our armor on .
it ’ s two o'clock now .
but let me see , by ten we shall each have captured a hundred englishmen .
now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe .
he bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
where is my gracious lord of canterbury ?
he ’ s not here .
send for him , dear uncle .
shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
may god and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
thank you , i ’ m sure .
them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
gloucester , it ’ s true that we are in great danger .
but our courage should only be the greater for that .
good morning , brother bedford .
good morning , old sir thomas erpingham !
lend me your cloak , sir thomas .
we shall , my liege .
shall i accompany your grace ?
no , my good knight .
go with my brothers to my english peers .
i need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don ’ t want any company .
the lord in heaven bless you , noble harry !
or are you low , vulgar , and of the common people ?
i am a gentleman of a company .
do you carry a pike ?
i ’ m as good a gentleman as the emperor .
then you ’ re a better man than the king .
i kiss his dirty shoe , and from the bottom of my heart i love the lovely boy .
that ’ s a cornish name .
are you with a cornish company ?
no , i am a welshman .
yes , and his relative , too .
the name suits your fierceness .
it never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct , traditional principles and rules of war .
but the enemy is loud .
you can hear them all night long .
i will lower my voice .
though he seems a little old-fashioned , there is much care and courage in this welshman .
brother john bates , isn ’ t that dawn breaking over there ?
what captain do you serve ?
a veteran commander and a very kind gentleman .
tell me , what does he think of our situation ?
we ’ re men beached on the sand , hoping to be washed out by the next tide .
he hasn ’ t told this to the king , has he ?
the violet smells to him the same as it does to me .
i ’ ll tell you truly what i think about the king in my heart .
i don ’ t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is .
that ’ s more than we know .
if his cause is wrong , our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it .
i think few die well who die in battle .
even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home , they can not escape god .
then if he dies , his death serves him .
it ’ s clear , every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death .
the king is not responsible for it .
i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
if i live to see it , i ’ ll never trust his word again .
yeah , right , go get him .
you may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather .
your scolding is somewhat overblown .
i ’ d be angry with you if the occasion allowed .
let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
how will i recognize you in the future ?
give me some trinket of yours , and i will wear it in my hat .
then , if you dare to acknowledge it , i ’ ll take up my quarrel with you .
i ’ ll also wear this in my cap .
if i ever see it , i will challenge you .
you may as well undertake to be hanged .
i ’ ll do it even if i find you in the company of the king himself .
i charge you , in the name of god , be careful what you say .
with this in mind , speak , my lord .
what a painful condition responsibility is .
what infinite peace do king ’ s give up that private men enjoy ?
what do kings have that private men do not , besides the pomp of their position ?
and what is this useless ceremony of kings ?
what kind of god is ceremony , which suffers more than its worshippers do ?
what income , what profit does it bring in ?
oh , ceremony , only show me your value !
you ’ re less happy , being feared , than they are in fearing you .
what do you get to drink , instead of sweet obedience , but poisonous flattery ?
try being sick , great greatness , and see if ceremony can cure you !
do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles ?
will it be chased away by bowing and scraping ?
you can command a beggar to bow on bended knee , but can you take possession of his health ?
no , vain illusion , so intricately bound up with a king ’ s rest .
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace .
my lord , your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp .
good old knight , gather them all together at my tent .
i ’ ll meet you there .
consider it done , my lord .
oh god of battles , bolster my soldiers ' courage .
don ’ t let them know fear .
rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage .
and i ’ ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for richard ’ s soul .
my brother gloucester ’ s voice ?
i ’ ll go with you .
the day , my friends , and everything await me .
the sun glints off our armor .
is it time , my lord constable ?
listen to our horses neighing , longing to be working .
what , you want them to weep our horses ' blood ?
then how will we see their own natural tears ?
the english are in the field , french lords .
to our horses , you gallant princes .
what ’ s there to say ?
our advance will so dazzle the enemy that england will cower in fear and surrender .
what are you waiting for , lords of france ?
those island-bred skeletons , terrified for their bones , are an offensive sight on the morning field .
the horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks , torches in their hands .
meanwhile , their they ’ ve said their prayers , and now they wait for death .
shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them ?
i ’ ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that .
come , let ’ s be off !
the sun is up and we ’ re wasting the day !
the king rode out alone to view their troops .
they have fully sixty thousand fighting men .
that ’ s five to one .
besides , they ’ re fresh .
may god ’ s arm strike on our side !
god be with all of you , princes .
i ’ ll go and join my men .
farewell , good salisbury ; and may good luck go with you .
but then i do you wrong to say as much , since you are the very embodiment of bravery .
he is as full of courage as of kindness , princely in both .
no , my dear cousin .
in god ’ s name , i beg you not to wish for one more man .
but if it is a sin to be selfish about honor , i am the most guilty soul alive .
oh , do not wish one more !
he will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home .
we would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us .
we ’ re ready if our minds are ready .
let any man perish who isn ’ t ready now !
you don ’ t wish we had more help from england anymore , cousin ?
god be with you all .
for assuredly , you are so near the abyss that you ’ re bound to be swallowed up .
who sent you this time ?
be good enough to take back the same answer i gave before .
tell them to capture me , then sell my bones .
the man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him .
let me speak proudly : tell the constable we ’ re only workaday soldiers .
if they do this , as they will , god willing , my ransom will soon be raised .
don ’ t come again to ask for my ransom , good messenger .
i swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine .
i shall , king harry .
you ’ ll never hear from the herald again .
i ’ m afraid you ’ ll come to me again for ransom .
my lord , most humbly on bended knee i beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard .
take it , brave york .
now , soldiers , advance .
is that a lot of he says his name is master fer .
he begs you to spare his life .
tell him my fury will abate , and i ’ ll take the crowns .
as i get to leech him , i will show some mercy .
i never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart .
i have to stay with the servants , who are with our camp ’ s luggage .
regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets , mocking us .
our men have all broken ranks .
let ’ s fall on our swords .
are these the wretches that we threw dice for ?
is this the king we offered to ransom ?
shame , eternal shame , and nothing but shame !
maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us .
let ’ s go offer up our lives
i ’ m going back into battle .
let life be short so that shame won ’ t last too long .
the french are still fighting .
the duke of york sends your majesty his respects .
is he still alive , good uncle ?
three times in an hour i saw him down , and three times up again and fighting .
he was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs .
by his side lies the noble earl of suffolk , york ’ s comrade and equal in brave wounds .
he cried out , “ wait for me , dear cousin .
my soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven .
wait for mine , sweet soul .
the french have reinforced their scattered men .
then every soldier must kill his prisoners .
can i justifiably and in good conscience make this claim ?
go to the tomb of your great-grandfather , from whom your own title to the crown derives .
awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again .
to kill the boys with the luggage !
it ’ s expressly against the rules of combat .
it ’ s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up .
oh , he ’ s a gallant king !
yes , he was born at monmouth , captain gower .
and is “ pig ” not the same as “ great , ” may i ask ?
i think alexander the great was born in macedon .
his father was philip of macedon , as i remember .
i think that macedon is indeed where alexander was born .
there is a river in macedon , and there is likewise a river in monmouth .
i ’ m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons .
that ’ s the one .
i tell you , there are good men born at monmouth .
i was not angry since i came to france until this instant .
take a trumpet , herald .
ride out to the horsemen on that hill .
if they seek battle with us , have them come down or else clear the field .
the sight of them is offensive .
go and tell them this .
here comes the herald of the french , my liege .
he looks humbler than he used to .
don ’ t you know that i have offered these bones of mine for ransom ?
are you coming again for ransom ?
god , not our strength , be praised !
what is the name of the castle that stands over there ?
then we ’ ll call this the battle of agincourt , fought on the day of crispin crispianus .
your majesty is quite right .
i do believe your majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on saint davy ’ s day .
i wear it with pride , for i am welsh you know , good countryman .
thanks , my good countryman .
i will confess it to all the world .
god keep me so.—heralds , go with him .
bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides .
soldier , you must come to the king .
soldier , why are you wearing that glove in your cap ?
then keep your vow , fellow , when you meet the man .
so i will , my liege .
whom do you serve under ?
under captain gower , my liege .
gower is a good captain , and is well versed and well read in the wars .
have him come to me here , soldier .
i will , my liege .
here , fluellen , stick this in your cap .
your grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects .
do you know captain gower ?
he is my dear friend , your majesty .
go find him , please , and bring him to my tent .
i ’ ll fetch him .
my lord of warwick and my brother gloucester , follow fluellen at a close distance .
the glove which i have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear .
according to an agreement , i should wear it myself .
follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them .
you come with me , uncle of exeter .
i ’ m sure it is to knight you , captain .
sir , do you recognize this glove ?
i know the glove is a glove .
well , i recognize this one good god !
as absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world—or even france or england !
do you think i ’ d break my oath ?
stand aside , captain gower .
i ’ ll reward treason with blows , i promise you .
i ’ m not a traitor .
arrest him : he ’ s a friend of the duke of alençon ’ s .
my liege , this was my glove .
it was i , in fact , whom you promised to strike .
their bodies may remain here in england , but their hearts are encamped on the fields of france already .
what we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from scotland—always an unreliable neighbor .
how can you square things with me ?
you abused me to my face .
your majesty didn ’ t present yourself as the king .
you represented yourself as just a common man .
therefore , i beg your highness , pardon me .
i ’ ll have none of your money .
it ’ s meant in good will .
i tell you , you can use it to get your shoes fixed .
come , why be so hesitant ?
your shoes are in pretty bad shape .
it ’ s a good shilling , i promise you .
now , herald , have the dead been counted ?
here is the count of the slaughtered french .
what prisoners of rank have been taken , uncle ?
this paper tells me of ten thousand frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield .
among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles .
among the ten thousand the french have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries .
of brave earls , grandpré and roussi , fauconberg and foix , beaumont and marle , vaudemont and lestrale .
where is the number of our english dead ?
take credit , god , for it is no one ’ s doing but yours .
yes , captain , but with this acknowledgement—that god fought for us .
yes , i truly think he did great good .
we ’ ll perform all the holy rites .
let ’ s have him land and solemnly proceed to london .
now in the factory of thought , create the image of all london pouring forth into the streets .
skip over all the particularities between then and harry ’ s return to france .
saint davy ’ s day has passed .
there are reasons and causes why and how in everything .
and here he comes , puffing himself up like a turkey .
the smell of leek turns my stomach .
not for cadwallader and all his goats .
here ’ s a goat for you .
dissolute lowlife , you shall die .
that ’ s very true , mangy rascal , when it pleases god .
meanwhile , i ’ d be gratified if you ’ d live and eat your food .
come , here ’ s some sauce to go with it .
you ’ ve stunned him .
it ’ s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin .
yes , absolutely , no question or ambiguity about it .
by this leek , i swear i ’ ll make you pay for this .
would you like some more sauce to go with it ?
there isn ’ t enough leek left for you to swear on .
can ’ t you see i ’ m eating ?
i sincerely hope it does you good , mangy rascal .
no , don ’ t throw any of it away .
the skin is good for your cracked head .
when you see leeks in the future , i hope you keep mocking them .
yes , leeks are good .
wait , here ’ s a penny to heal your head .
if i owe you anything , i ’ ll pay you in clubbings .
you ’ ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me .
god be with you and keep you , and may he heal your head .
there ’ ll be hell to pay for this .
go on , get out of here .
you ’ re a lying , cowardly wretch .
i ’ ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once .
has fortune turned on me , like the whore she is ?
i ’ ve had news that my nell died of the pox in a hospice .
i grow old , and all dignity has been thrashed out of me .
well , i ’ ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing .
i ’ ll steal away to england , and i ’ ll steal some more when i get there .
i ’ ll bandage up these wounds and swear i got them in the french wars .
it would follow from this that the cat should stay home .
while the armed hand fights in foreign lands , the wise head defends itself at home .
we rejoice to see you , most worthy brother of england .
you are welcome here , as are all of you english princes .
we hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship .
we ’ re here to say “ amen ” to that .
all you english princes , i salute you .
great kings of france and england , i owe you both equal service and loyalty .
her grapes , which make the wine that cheers our hearts , die unpruned on the vines .
her once-trimmed hedges , like prisoners with wild , untended hair , put forth unruly twigs .
her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds , while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting .
children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country .
the king has heard them , but as yet has made no answer .
well , the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer .
i ’ ve only given the articles a cursory glance .
fair sister , will you go with the princes or stay here with me ?
gracious brother , i will go with them .
in that case , leave our cousin katherine here with us .
she is our principal demand—one of the first points of the treaty .
she is welcome to stay .
your majesty shall mock at me .
i can not speak your england .
do you like me , kate ?
i said so , dear katherine , and i ’ m not ashamed to repeat it .
kate , my wooing is fit for your understanding : i am glad your english isn ’ t better .
so give me your answer , and we ’ ll shake on it .
i speak to you as a plain soldier .
if you can love me for this , take me .
if not , to tell you i will die is true , but not for love , by god .
and yet i do love you .
so take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness .
if you would have such a man , take me .
so what do you say to my suit ?
speak , my fair one , and speak fairly , i beg you .
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france ?
no , it is not possible you should love the enemy of france , kate .
i will have it all mine .
i don ’ t understand all dat .
can any of your neighbors tell , kate ?
i ’ ll ask them .
but mock me gently , dear kate , because i love you terribly .
what do you say , my fair i do not know dat .
no , of course you don ’ t .
now there can only be the promise .
i tell you truly , in true english : i love you , kate .
curse my father ’ s ambition !
but i promise you , kate : the older i grow the better i ’ ll look .
therefore tell me , fairest katherine , will you have me ?
come on , tell me in broken music—for your voice is music and your english broken .
come , katherine queen of all , reveal your heart to me in broken english .
den it shall also content me .
with that i kiss your hand and call you my queen .
then i will kiss your lips , kate .
what does she say , madam interpreter ?
dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of france—i can not tell vat is to kiss .
oh , kate , prudish customs bow before great kings .
therefore , willingly and yielding .
my royal kinsman , are you teaching our princess english ?
i wanted to teach her how perfectly i love her , kinsman , and that ’ s good english .
she picks it up quick , doesn ’ t she ?
forgive my boldness if i take you up on your words about making magic .
it ’ s a lot to ask of a maiden .
they ’ re forgiven , then , if they don ’ t see what they ’ re doing .
then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes , my lord .
so you ’ re telling me to give it time and wait for summer .
and even then , in order for me to catch the fly your cousin , she must be blind ?
like love , my lord , before it learns to love .
shall kate be my wife ?
i am satisfied , as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her .
we have consented to all reasonable terms .
is that true , my lords of england ?
now , welcome , kate.—and let everyone bear witness that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen .
may god , who is the best matchmaker , join your hearts and realms in one .
god say , “ amen ” !
henry the sixth , crowned king of france and england while still in his infancy , succeeded him .
with those plays in mind , we hope you ’ ll receive this one kindly .
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin .
will your majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we ’ ve been asked to convey ?
let your thoughts make up for our imperfections .
divide each man into a thousand , and there you will have an imaginary army .
therefore tell me the dauphin ’ s mind frankly and without constraint .
you can ’ t party your way into dukedoms there .
and in return for this gift , he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms .
this is the dauphin ’ s message .
what ’ s the treasure , uncle ?
tennis balls , my liege .
i ’ m happy the dauphin has such a good sense of humor .
thank you for his present and your trouble .
and i understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days .
men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they ’ re away from home .
and tell the dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .
that was a humorous message .
i hope to make the sender blush for it .
now , lords , don ’ t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition .
therefore , let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
now all the young men of england are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet .
shifts , friends , to southampton .
but we won ’ t shift the scene to southampton until henry reappears .
good to see you , corporal nym .
good day , lieutenant bardolph .
tell me , are you and ensign pistol friends again yet ?
for my part , i really don ’ t care .
then we can all three be comrades on our way to france .
how about it , corporal nym ?
it ’ s not for me to say .
things are what they are .
there must be some resolution .
well , it ’ s not for me to say .
here comes ensign pistol and his wife .
i swear , i scorn the word .
pish to you , you mangy dog , you pointy-eared icelandic mutt .
corporal nym , be a man and put away your sword .
get lost , will you ?
i am not some fiend of hell : you can ’ t get rid of me with spells .
i ’ m in a mood to beat you up pretty good .
your grave is gaping open , and your death is near .
so take your last breath .
that ’ s an oath of great power , and our fury must subside .
i swear , he ’ ll be food for the crows soon .
the king has broken his heart .
good husband , come home soon .
come on , can i get you two to make up ?
let rivers flood and fiends howl for food !
are you going to pay the eight shillings i won from you in a bet ?
paying debts is for peasants .
i ’ m going to take it from you now .
we ’ ll see , won ’ t we ?
by this sword , i ’ ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust .
by this sword , i will .
by this sword ” is an oath , and oaths must be kept .
come on , put it away .
well , then , that ’ s how it is .
if you ever had a mother , come in quickly to sir john .
the poor thing , he is so shaken with a fever that it ’ s terrible to see .
sweet men , come to him .
nym , what you say is true .
he has his moods and his ways .
how smooth and cool they seem !
just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful .
the king has been informed of all their plans , but they have no idea .
now that the wind is favorable , let ’ s board the ship .
no doubt it will , my liege , if each man does his best .
there never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself , your majesty .
i don ’ t think there ’ s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government .
yes , i have great cause to be thankful .
uncle of exeter , release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me .
that ’ s merciful but a bit careless .
oh , let us be merciful anyway .
and now , let ’ s turn to our business with the french .
who are the new commissioners ?
i am one , my lord .
your highness told me to ask for my commission today .
you told me to do the same , my liege .
and me , too , my royal sovereign .
i confess my crime and throw myself on your highness ’ s mercy .
to which we all appeal .
the mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice .
all other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive , put together from shreds
why , so did you .
why , so did you .
do they come from good families ?
why , so did you .
why , so did you .
that ’ s how sound a man you appeared .
your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion .
this treachery of yours is like the second
richard earl of cambridge , i arrest you for high treason .
henry lord scroop of masham , i arrest you for high treason .
thomas grey , knight , of northumberland , i arrest you for high treason .
pardon my crime , sovereign , but not my person .
may god in his mercy forgive you .
i ’ m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed .
let ’ s go forth , dear countrymen .
i ’ ll be no king of england if i ’ m not also king of france .
no , because my manly heart is grieving .
bardolph , be happy.—nym , rouse your bragging spirits.—boy , be brave .
oh , no , he ’ s surely not in hell .
he ’ s in they say he cried out against sherry .
no , he did not .
he could never bear carnation .
it was a color he never did like .
he once said the devil would get him because of women .
well , the shall we get moving ?
the king will already have left southampton .
look after my goods and possessions .
but how will we keep it from being passed now , my lord ?
we have to think about that .
that ’ s what the bill says .
but what can be done to prevent it ?
the king is virtuous and kind .
and a true lover of the holy church .
i ’ ve heard that ’ s not the most nourishing food .
kiss her soft mouth , and we ’ ll be off .
and keep yourself hidden , i command you .
the king of england ’ s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool .
oh , please , prince dauphin !
you are completely wrong about this king .
but even if i thought you were right , it doesn ’ t matter .
this king is a branch of that same victorious stock .
ambassadors of harry , king of england , request a hearing with your majesty .
we ’ ll see them immediately .
my good king , surprise the english and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over .
self-love , my liege , is not so great a sin as self-neglect .
from our brother monarch , the king of england ?
and what will happen if i don ’ t ?
bloodshed will force you to .
i ’ ll think it over .
regarding the dauphin , you can speak to me .
what ’ s the message from the english king ?
we ’ ll give you an answer tomorrow .
you ’ ll have your answer soon .
a night isn ’ t much time for addressing matters of this importance .
picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging .
hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub .
follow it , follow it !
once there , make your thoughts work harder , and witness a siege .
take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of harfleur .
imagine the french ambassador returning to inform harry that the king offers him
his daughter , katherine , with some insignificant , unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry .
indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings .
now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare .
don ’ t dishonor your mothers !
prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you .
prove you are worthy of your birth , which i do not doubt for a moment .
we are fortunate in the change .
listen to him talk about war , and you ’ ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles .
on , on , on , on , on !
to the breach , to the breach !
please , corporal , stop !
you can see how it is all around .
i wish i were in an alehouse in london !
i would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety .
up to the breach , you dogs !
great duke , be merciful to mortal men .
dear man , calm your rage .
your honor ’ s is unhealthy talk .
young though i am , i ’ ve been observing these three blowhards closely .
they will steal anything and call it spoils .
i must leave them and seek some better employment .
their villainy nauseates me , and i must therefore vomit it up .
by jesus , i think they will blow up everything if we don ’ t improve our tactics .
it ’ s captain macmorris , right ?
jesus , he ’ s an ass if there ever was one !
i will say as much to his face .
he knows no more about the proper practice of war , see—the ancient practices—than a puppy .
here he comes with captain jamy , the scots captain .
good day to you , captain fluellen .
good evening to your worship , good captain james .
tell me , captain macmorris , have you left the tunnels ?
have the excavators stopped work ?
christ , it ’ s a disaster .
i swear by this hand and my father ’ s soul , the whole thing is a disaster .
it ’ s all stopped .
i could have blown up the town in an hour .
look , he ’ s approaching caesar .
keep an eye on him .
brutus , what will we do ?
where ’ s metellus cimber ?
he should go up and offer his petition to caesar now .
they ’ re speaking to him .
go up there and second his petition .
casca , you ’ ll be the first to raise your hand .
i have to stop you , cimber .
what , even you , brutus ?
i could be convinced if i were like you .
if i could beg others to change their minds , begging would convince me , too .
the sky shows countless stars .
so it is on earth .
to show you that that ’ s me , let me prove it a little even in this case .
would you try to lift mount olympus ?
haven ’ t i resisted even brutus , begging from his knees ?
hands , speak for me !
run and proclaim it in the streets .
don ’ t run away—stay where you are .
go to the platform , brutus .
we don ’ t intend any harm to you , nor to anyone else .
tell them this , publius .
and leave us , publius , in case the people storming us should harm you .
and let no one suffer for this deed except us , the perpetrators .
he ran to his house , stunned .
why , the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death .
who ’ s calling me ?
who in the crowd is calling me ?
i hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “ caesar ! ” speak .
a soothsayer tells you to beware of march 15th .
bring him in front of me .
let me see his face .
you , fellow , step out of the crowd .
this is caesar you ’ re looking at .
what do you have to say to me now ?
let ’ s leave him .
are you going to watch the race ?
yes , every man forward .
brutus will lead , and we ’ ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of rome .
who ’ s that coming ?
it ’ s a friend of antony ’ s .
your master is a wise and honorable roman .
i never thought any less of him .
i know that he ’ ll be on our side .
but here comes antony.—welcome , mark antony .
do you lie so low ?
have all your conquests , glories , triumphs , achievements , come to so little ?
oh , antony , don ’ t beg us to kill you .
they are full of pity for caesar .
for you , our swords have blunt edges , too dull to harm you , mark antony .
your vote will be as strong as anyone ’ s in the reordering of the government .
but just be patient until we ’ ve calmed the masses , who are beside themselves with fear .
i don ’ t doubt your wisdom .
each of you , give me your bloody hand .
mark antony— pardon me , caius cassius .
you may , mark antony .
brutus , may i have a word with you ?
it ’ ll help us more than hurt us .
mark antony , take caesar ’ s body .
and you ’ ll speak on the same platform as i do , after i ’ m done .
i don ’ t want anything more .
prepare the body , then , and follow us .
you are what ’ s left of the noblest man that ever lived .
pity the hand that shed this valuable blood .
fierce civil war will paralyze all of italy .
i do , mark antony .
caesar wrote for him to come to rome .
he received caesar ’ s letters , and he is coming .
grief seems to be contagious , for my eyes , seeing the tears in yours , began to fill .
he rests tonight within twenty-one miles of rome .
report back to him fast and tell him what has happened .
don ’ t go back until i ’ ve carried the corpse into the marketplace .
then follow me and listen to my speech , friends .
cassius , go to the next street and divide the crowd .
let those who will hear me speak stay .
i ’ ll listen to brutus .
i ’ ll listen to cassius , and we will compare their reasons .
noble brutus has mounted the platform .
be patient until i finish .
romans , countrymen , and friends !
listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear .
believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind , so you may believe me .
be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly .
i weep for caesar in that he was good to me .
i rejoice in his good fortune .
i honor him for being brave .
but his ambition—for that , i killed him .
who here is so low that he wants to be a slave ?
if there are any , speak , for it is he whom i ’ ve offended .
who here is so barbarous that he doesn ’ t want to be a roman ?
if there are any , speak , for it is he whom i ’ ve offended .
who here is so vile that he doesn ’ t love his country ?
if there are any , speak , for it is he whom i have offended .
i will pause for a reply .
no one , brutus , no one .
then i have offended no one .
i ’ ve done no more to caesar than you will do to me .
the reasons for his death are recorded in the capitol .
let ’ s carry him in triumph to his house !
i don ’ t like sports .
i ’ m not competitive like antony .
but don ’ t let me keep you from going , cassius .
i ’ ll go my own way .
cassius , don ’ t take it badly .
tell me , good brutus , can you see your face ?
caesar ’ s better qualities exist in brutus , and we will crown him .
we ’ ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration !
good countrymen , let me leave alone .
i ask that none of you leave , except myself , until antony has finished .
let him mount the pulpit .
we ’ ll listen to him .
for brutus ’ s sake , i am indebted to you .
what does he say about brutus ?
he says that for brutus ’ s sake he finds himself indebted to us all .
he ’ d better not speak badly of brutus here .
that ’ s for sure .
we ’ re lucky that rome is rid of him .
let ’ s hear what antony has to say .
you gentle romans— quiet there !
friends , romans , countrymen , give me your attention .
i have come here to bury caesar , not to praise him .
the evil that men do is remembered after their deaths , but the good is often buried with them .
it might as well be the same with caesar .
the noble brutus told you that caesar was ambitious .
he was my friend , he was faithful and just to me .
but brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .
he brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city .
is this the work of an ambitious man ?
when the poor cried , caesar cried too .
ambition shouldn ’ t be so soft .
yet brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .
if you think about it correctly , caesar has suffered a great wrong .
caesar wouldn ’ t take the crown .
therefore it ’ s certain that he wasn ’ t ambitious .
if it turns out he wasn ’ t , certain people are going to get it .
antony ’ s eyes are fiery red from crying .
there isn ’ t a nobler man than antony in all of rome .
only yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world .
now he lies there worth nothing , and no one is so humble as to show him respect .
i will not do them wrong .
i would rather wrong the dead , and wrong myself and you , than wrong such honorable men .
but here ’ s a paper with caesar ’ s seal on it .
we want to hear the will .
read it , mark antony .
the will , the will !
we want to hear caesar ’ s will .
it isn ’ t proper for you to know how much caesar loved you .
you aren ’ t wood , you aren ’ t stones—you ’ re men .
and , being men , the contents of caesar ’ s will would enrage you .
we want to hear it , antony .
you have to read us the will , caesar ’ s will .
i ’ ve said too much in telling you of it .
i ’ m afraid that i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar .
they were villains , murderers .
you force me to read the will , then ?
we ’ ll let you .
stand away from the hearse .
stand away from the body .
make room for antony , most noble antony !
no , don ’ t press up against me .
if you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
you all know this cloak .
i remember the first time caesar ever put it on .
it was the day he overcame the nervii warriors .
look , here ’ s where cassius ’ s dagger pierced it .
see the wound that casca made .
for brutus , as you know , was caesar ’ s angel .
the gods know how dearly caesar loved him !
this was the most unkind cut of all .
oh , what a fall it was , my countrymen !
then you and i and all of us fell down , while bloody treason triumphed .
oh , now you weep , and i sense that you feel pity .
look at this , here is the man—scarred , as you can see , by traitors .
oh , what a sad sight !
oh , traitors , villains !
oh , most bloody sight !
listen to the noble antony .
those who have done this deed are honorable .
i don ’ t know what private grudges they had that made them do it .
they ’ re wise and honorable , and will no doubt give you reasons for it .
i haven ’ t come to steal your loyalty , friends .
we ’ ll burn brutus ’ s house .
let ’ s go , then !
come , find the conspirators !
wait , and listen to me , countrymen .
why , friends , you don ’ t even know what you ’ re doing yet .
what has caesar done to deserve your love ?
alas , you don ’ t know .
i must tell you then .
you ’ ve forgotten the will i told you about .
let ’ s stay and hear the will !
we ’ ll revenge his death .
when will there be another like him ?
we ’ ll start a fire .
now , let it work .
what ’ s up , my man ?
sir , octavius has already arrived in rome .
he and lepidus are at caesar ’ s house .
i will go straight to visit him .
i ask for him , and he comes .
fortune is happy today and , in this mood , will give us anything we want .
i heard octavius say that brutus and cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of rome .
they probably received warning about how much i stirred up the people .
i ’ ll tell you , good brutus .
and don ’ t be suspicious of me , noble brutus .
i ’ m afraid the people have made caesar their king .
really , are you afraid of that ?
then i have to assume you don ’ t want him to be king .
i dreamed last night that i feasted with caesar , and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination .
i have no desire to go outside , yet something leads me there .
what ’ s your name ?
are you a married man or a bachelor ?
answer all of us , now .
yes , and be brief .
yes , and be wise .
what ’ s my name ?
am i a married man or a bachelor ?
then , to answer every man briefly , wisely , and truthfully—wisely i say , i am a bachelor .
you imply that married men are fools .
you ’ ll get a blow from me for that , i think .
right this instant , i ’ m going to caesar ’ s funeral .
as a friend or an enemy ?
getting right to the point , i live near the capitol .
tell us your name , sir , truthfully .
truthfully , my name is cinna .
he ’ s a conspirator .
i ’ m not cinna the conspirator .
it doesn ’ t matter .
his name ’ s cinna .
pull only his name out of his heart and let him go .
tear him apart , tear him up !
come , firebrands , over here !
to brutus ’ s , to cassius ’ s , let ’ s burn them all .
some of you go to decius ’ s house and some to casca ’ s .
some to ligarius ’ s .
these ones , then , will be assassinated .
i agree— put a mark next to his name too , antony .
on the condition that your sister ’ s son , publius , also must die , mark antony .
see—i ’ ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name .
but , lepidus , go to caesar ’ s house .
will you be here when i return ?
either here or at the capitol .
he ’ s an unremarkable man , fit only to be sent on errands .
octavius , i ’ m older than you are .
you can do what you want , but he ’ s an experienced and honorable soldier .
so is my horse , octavius , and for that reason i give him all the hay he wants .
pass on the command to halt !
what ’ s happening now , lucillius ?
he ’ s nearby , and pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master .
if he ’ s nearby , i want an explanation .
can i have a word with you , lucillius ?
you ’ ve described a warm friend who ’ s cooling off .
plain and simple loyalty doesn ’ t make anyone act phony .
they plan to spend the night in sardis .
the larger part , the main body of cavalry , are coming with cassius .
march to meet him at a dignified pace .
most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
let the gods judge me !
do i mistreat even my enemies ?
and when you do— cassius , calm down .
order them to move back .
then , in my tent , you can elaborate on your complaints , and i ’ ll listen .
pindarus , order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground .
have lucius and titinius guard the door .
you wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man .
in a time like this , it doesn ’ t make sense to criticize every offense .
me , “ greedy ” !
you know , if you were anyone other than brutus , that speech would be your last .
the name of cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions , and so they go unpunished .
remember march , march 15th .
didn ’ t great caesar bleed for the sake of justice ?
who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice ?
i ’ d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of roman .
brutus , do not provoke me .
i will not take it .
you ’ re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner .
i ’ m a soldier , more experienced than you , and better able to give orders .
you are not , cassius .
i say you ’ re not .
don ’ t provoke me any further or i ’ ll forget to restrain myself .
if you care about your health , you won ’ t push me any further .
leave , you little man .
listen to me , for i have something to tell you .
does a madman scare me when he stares at me ?
but why do you keep me here so long ?
what do you want to tell me ?
i know this quality in you , brutus—it ’ s as familiar to me as your face .
indeed , honor is what i want to talk to you about .
i was born as free as caesar .
we both have eaten as well , and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he .
go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks .
show your slaves how mad you are , and make your servants tremble .
has it come to this ?
you say you ’ re a better soldier .
make your boasts come true , and i ’ ll be thrilled .
i ’ m always happy to hear about brave men .
you wrong me in every way .
you wrong me , brutus .
when caesar was alive , even he wouldn ’ t dare anger me like this .
you wouldn ’ t have dared to tempt him so .
i wouldn ’ t have dared !
you wouldn ’ t have dared , out of fear for your life .
don ’ t take my love for granted .
i might do something i ’ ll be sorry for .
you ’ ve already done something you should be sorry for .
i asked you for gold to pay my soldiers , and you wouldn ’ t give it to me .
was that the caius cassius that i knew ?
and would i have ever done that to you ?
i didn ’ t refuse you .
the man who brought my answer to you was a fool .
you have broken my heart .
a friend should put up with his friend ’ s weaknesses , but you exaggerate mine .
i don ’ t until you practice them on me .
you don ’ t love me .
i don ’ t like your faults .
a friend would never see those faults .
no , a flatterer wouldn ’ t , even if the faults were as huge as mount olympus .
oh , i could weep my soul right out of myself !
there ’ s my dagger put away your dagger .
be angry whenever you like , it ’ s all right with me .
do whatever you want , and i ’ ll say your insults are just a bad mood .
when i said that , i was angry too .
you admit it , then ?
what ’ s the matter ?
what ’ s the matter ?
you should be ashamed , generals !
what do you think you ’ re doing ?
love each other and be friends , like two such men should be .
listen to me , because i ’ m older than you , surely .
be patient with him , brutus .
that ’ s just how he is .
i ’ ll humor him when he learns how to behave .
what should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post ?
get out of here , my friend .
away , away , be gone .
lucillius and titinius , order the commanders to have the men camp for the night .
and return to us immediately , bringing messala with you .
i didn ’ t think you could even be so angry .
oh cassius , i ’ m tired out by many sorrows .
what an irreplaceable and grievous loss !
what sickness did she die of ?
and that ’ s how she died ?
my heart is thirsty for that noble promise .
fill my cup , lucius , until the wine overflows it .
i can not drink too much of brutus ’ s love .
now let ’ s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs .
portia , are you really gone ?
no more about that , please .
i have received letters that say the same .
on that point , our letters don ’ t agree .
my letters say only seventy senators were killed , one being cicero .
cicero is dead , by their decree .
and you haven ’ t heard any news about her in your letters ?
i think that ’ s strange .
have you heard something of her in your letters ?
now , as you ’ re a roman , tell me the truth .
then you must take the truth i have to tell like a roman .
it ’ s certain that she is dead , and she died in a strange way .
well , good-bye , portia .
we all must die , messala .
that ’ s the way great men ought to endure great losses .
well , let ’ s move on to our work with the living .
what do you think of marching to philippi immediately ?
i don ’ t think it ’ s a good idea .
here ’ s why : it ’ d be better for the enemy to come after us .
if we meet him at philippi , these people will be at our backs .
listen to me , good brother .
our regiments are full to the brim ; our cause is ready .
the enemy gets larger each day .
we , now at our largest , can only decrease .
if that ’ s what you want , all right .
we ’ ll go forward with you and meet them at philippi .
that ’ s all there is to say .
there ’ s nothing else .
we ’ ll rise and leave early tomorrow .
let ’ s pray that we never come into conflict like that again .
let ’ s not , brutus .
in spain , caesar had a fever , and it made him shake .
it ’ s true , this so-called “ god ” —he shook .
his cowardly lips turned white , and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam .
i think this applause is for some new honors awarded to caesar .
men can be masters of their fate .
it is not destiny ’ s fault , but our own faults , that we ’ re slaves .
brutus ” and “ caesar. ” what ’ s so special about “ caesar ” ?
why should that name be proclaimed more than yours ?
write them together—yours is just as good a name .
pronounce them—it is just as nice to say .
good night , my lord .
good night , good brother .
good night , lord brutus .
where ’ s your lute ?
what , are you sleepy ?
call claudio and some of my other men .
i ’ ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
did you call , my lord ?
sirs , i ask you to sleep in my tent .
i might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother cassius .
if you like , we ’ ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need .
look , lucius , here ’ s the book i was searching for .
i put it in the pocket of my nightgown .
i was sure that you hadn ’ t given it to me .
can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute ?
yes , my lord , if you would like .
i would , my boy .
i ask too much of you , but you ’ re always willing .
it ’ s my duty , sir .
i shouldn ’ t make you do more than you ’ re able .
i know that young men look forward to their rest .
i ’ ve already slept , my lord .
that was good planning , and you ’ ll sleep some more .
i won ’ t keep you very long .
if i live through this , i ’ ll be good to you .
this is a sleepy tune .
gentle boy , good night .
i won ’ t trouble you so much as to wake you .
good night , good boy .
let me see , let me see .
didn ’ t i turn down the page where i left off reading ?
here it is , i think .
i think it ’ s my bad eyesight that ’ s making me see this horrible vision .
it ’ s coming toward me .
tell me what you are .
i ’ m your evil spirit , brutus .
why do you come here ?
to tell you that you ’ ll see me at philippi .
then i ’ ll see you again ?
alright , then i ’ ll see you at philippi .
evil spirit , i want to talk some more .
he thinks he ’ s still playing his instrument .
were you dreaming , lucius ?
my lord , i don ’ t think i cried out .
why did you cry out in your sleep ?
did we , my lord ?
no , my lord , i didn ’ t see anything .
me neither , my lord .
go to my brother cassius .
order him to advance his forces first thing , and we ’ ll follow .
now , antony , our prayers have been answered .
you said the enemy wouldn ’ t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions .
i know how they think , and i understand why they ’ re doing this .
but they aren ’ t .
the enemy approaches with great display .
they show their bloody heralds of battle , and something must be done immediately .
octavius , lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field .
i ’ ll go to the right side .
you stay on the left .
why are you defying me in this urgent matter ?
we have to go out and talk to them .
mark antony , should we give the signal to attack ?
no , octavius caesar , we ’ ll respond to their charge .
the generals want to speak with us .
is that how it is , countrymen ?
not that we love words more than fighting , like you do .
good words are better than bad strokes , octavius .
brutus , you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes .
but your words are as sweet as honey—you ’ ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing .
i took their stings too , wouldn ’ t you say ?
now , brutus , you have only yourself to thank .
come , come , let ’ s remember why we ’ re here .
if arguing makes us sweat , the real trial will turn that water to blood .
caesar , you ’ re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself..
i hope you ’ re right .
i wasn ’ t born to die on your sword .
if you were the noblest of your family , young man , you couldn ’ t die more honorably .
an annoying schoolboy , unworthy of such an honor , joined by a masquerader and a partier !
still the same old cassius !
if you dare to fight today , come to the field .
if not , come when you have the courage .
now let the wind blow , waves swell , and ships sink !
the storm has begun and everything is at stake .
messala , today is my birthday—i was born on this very day .
give me your hand , messala .
you know that i used to believe in epicurus and his disregard for omens .
i ’ ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens .
their shadows are like a deadly canopy , under which our army lies , ready to die .
don ’ t believe in this .
i only partly believe it , for i ’ m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering .
if we lose this battle , this is the last time we ’ ll speak to each other .
if we lose , what do you plan to do ?
our era should be ashamed !
rome has lost the ability to raise noble men !
until now , no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast rome .
now , though , in all of rome , there ’ s room for only one man .
i have no doubt that you love me .
i ’ m beginning to understand what you want me to do .
for now , don ’ t try to persuade me anymore—i ask you as a friend .
i ’ m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you .
no , cassius , no .
don ’ t imagine that i ’ ll ever allow myself to return to rome in chains .
my mind is too great for that .
therefore , accept my everlasting farewell .
forever and forever , farewell , cassius !
if we meet again , then we ’ ll smile .
if not , then this parting was well done .
forever and forever , farewell , brutus !
if we meet again , then we ’ ll smile indeed .
if not , it ’ s true , this parting was well done .
oh , i wish i could know what will happen today before it happens !
ride , ride , messala , ride , and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side .
ride , ride , messala .
i ’ ve become an enemy to my own soldiers !
oh , cassius , brutus gave the orders too soon .
retreat further , my lord , retreat further .
mark antony is in your tents , my lord .
therefore you must run , noble cassius .
are those my tents on fire ?
they are , my lord .
i ’ ll be back quicker than you can think a thought .
go , pindarus , climb a little higher on this hill .
my eyesight has always been bad .
watch titinius and tell me what you see in the field .
today was the day i breathed my first breath .
time has come round , and i ’ ll end where i began .
my life has run its circle .
come down , look no more .
come now , keep your oath .
caesar , you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you .
so i ’ m free .
but i didn ’ t want to be free like this .
oh , cassius , i ’ ll run far from this country to where no romans can find me .
this news will comfort cassius .
where did you leave him ?
on this hill and in despair , with his slave pindarus .
isn ’ t that him on the ground ?
he doesn ’ t seem to be alive .
isn ’ t that him ?
where are you , pindarus ?
hurry , messala , and i ’ ll look for pindarus in the meantime .
why did you send me out , brave cassius ?
didn ’ t i meet up with your allies ?
didn ’ t you hear their shouts ?
alas , you misunderstood everything !
but let me place this wreath on your head .
your brutus ordered me to give it to you , and i ’ ll do what he says .
where is his body , messala ?
over there , where titinius mourns it .
he ’ s been killed .
oh , julius caesar , you are still powerful .
your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs .
could you have found two romans as good as these two ?
good-bye to you , the last of all the romans .
i will find the time to cry for you , cassius , i ’ ll find the time .
come , then , and send his body to thasos .
let ’ s proceed to the field .
labio and flavio , push our armies onward .
who is so low that he wouldn ’ t ?
who will advance with me ?
i will proclaim my name around the field .
i am the son of marcus cato !
an enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country .
i am the son of marcus cato !
and i am brutus , marcus brutus .
brutus , my country ’ s friend .
know that i am brutus !
oh , young and noble cato , have you been slain ?
i ’ d rather die .
here is some money for you to kill me immediately .
kill brutus and be honored by the killing .
he is a noble prisoner !
tell antony that brutus has been taken .
i ’ ll tell him the news .
he ’ s safe , antony .
i can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble brutus alive .
the gods protect him from so great a shame !
the games are done and caesar is returning .
i ’ ll do so .
but look , cassius , caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they ’ ve been scolded .
casca will tell us what ’ s the matter .
come , last of my friends , rest on this rock .
statilius waved the torchlight at us , but he hasn ’ t come back .
he ’ s been captured or killed .
who , me , my lord ?
no , not for all the world .
don ’ t give it away .
i ’ d rather kill myself .
would i dare do something like that ?
come here , good volumnius .
what is it , my lord ?
once at sardis and once last night , here in philippi fields .
i know that my hour has come .
no , it hasn ’ t , my lord .
no , i ’ m sure it has , volumnius .
you see how the world goes , volumnius .
our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave .
it ’ s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us .
good volumnius , you know that we went to school together .
that ’ s not a job for a friend , my lord .
run , run , my lord .
we can ’ t wait here .
farewell to you , and you , and you , volumnius .
strato , you ’ ve slept this whole time .
so farewell , all , for my tongue has almost finished with its life .
i can ’ t see ahead of me .
my bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour .
run , my lord , run .
i beg you , strato , stay by me .
you ’ re a man with a good reputation .
your life has had honor in it .
then , hold my sword and turn your face away while i run on it .
give me your hand , first .
free from the bondage you are in , messala .
i ’ ll take all who served brutus into my service .
you , will you join with me ?
yes , if messala recommends me to you .
do so , good messala .
how did my master die , strato ?
i held the sword and he ran on it .
then take this man into your service , octavius , for he did the final service to my master .
this was the noblest roman of them all .
all the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great caesar .
only he acted from honesty and for the general good .
his body will lie in my tent tonight , with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .
tell us what happened today that put caesar in such a serious mood .
but you were with him , weren ’ t you ?
if i were , i wouldn ’ t need to ask you what happened .
what was the second noise for ?
what was the last cry for ?
the crown was offered to him three times ?
who offered him the crown ?
tell us how it happened , noble casca .
i can ’ t explain it .
then antony offered it the third time .
but wait a minute , please .
did you say caesar fainted ?
he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless .
that ’ s very likely .
he has epilepsy , a disease where you fall down .
no , caesar doesn ’ t have epilepsy .
you and i , and honest casca , we have epilepsy—we ’ ve fallen .
i don ’ t know what you mean by that , but i ’ m sure caesar fell down .
what did he say when he regained consciousness ?
but never mind them—if caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would ’ ve forgiven him .
and after that he came back here looking so serious ?
go home , you lazy men .
what , is today a holiday ?
i ’ m a carpenter , sir .
where are your leather apron and your ruler ?
what are you doing , wearing your best clothes ?
but what ’ s your trade ?
it is a trade , sir , that i practice with a clear conscience .
you insolent rascal , what trade ?
sir , please , don ’ t be angry .
but if your soles are worn out , i can mend you .
what do you mean by that ?
mend ” me , you impertinent fellow ?
yes , he said something in greek .
if i told you i understood greek , i ’ d be lying .
but those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
as for myself , it was greek to me .
i have more news too .
murellus and flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of caesar .
there was even more foolishness , if i could only remember it .
will you have dinner with me tonight , casca ?
no , i have a commitment .
will you dine with me tomorrow ?
i ’ ll expect you .
what a stupid man he ’ s become !
he was so sharp when he was in school .
you ’ re right , that ’ s how it is .
i ’ ll leave you for now .
if you ’ d like to talk tomorrow , i ’ ll come to your home .
i ’ ll do so .
until then , think about the well-being of rome .
well , brutus , you ’ re noble .
caesar resents me , but he loves brutus .
if i were brutus now and brutus were me , i wouldn ’ t have let him influence me .
did you accompany caesar home ?
and yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .
they ’ re natural enough. ” i think these things are omens of things to come in our country .
indeed , it ’ s a strange time .
but men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves .
is caesar visiting the capitol tomorrow ?
he is , because he told antonius to tell you he ’ d be there tomorrow .
good night then , casca .
this bad weather isn ’ t good to walk around in .
it ’ s casca—i know your voice .
cassius , what a night this is !
it ’ s a very pleasing night to honest men .
who ever saw the heavens threaten like this ?
those who have known how bad things are here on earth .
but why did you tempt the heavens like that ?
mankind ’ s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals .
you go pale , you stare , and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens .
let it be who it is .
our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak , like women .
i know where i ’ ll wear this dagger , then .
i ’ ll kill myself to save myself from slavery .
in suicide , gods make the weak strong .
in suicide , gods allow tyrants to be defeated .
but if a man becomes weary of these obstacles , he can always kill himself .
let everyone beware : i can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever i choose .
in fact , every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself .
how can caesar be a tyrant then ?
i know he wouldn ’ t be a wolf if the romans didn ’ t act like sheep .
he couldn ’ t be a lion if the romans weren ’ t such easy prey .
people who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs .
what have i said in my grief ?
that ’ s a deal .
no , it ’ s casca , someone who ’ s going to work with us .
aren ’ t the others waiting for me , cinna ?
i ’ m glad casca is with us .
what a fearful night this is !
two or three of us have seen strange things .
oh , cassius , if you could only convince brutus to join us— don ’ t worry .
are decius brutus and trebonius there ?
well , i ’ ll hurry and put these papers where you told me .
when you ’ ve finished , go back to pompey ’ s theater .
come on , casca , you and i will go see brutus at his house before sunrise .
yes , you ’ re absolutely right about how worthy brutus is and how much we need him .
wake up , i say !
did you call me , my lord ?
put a candle in my study , lucius .
call me when it ’ s lit .
i will , my lord .
i have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people .
he wants to be crowned .
the question is , how would being king change him ?
you ’ re a cobbler , are you ?
sir , i make my living using an awl .
i ’ m a surgeon to old shoes .
when they ’ re endangered , i save them .
the noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork .
but why aren ’ t you in your shop today ?
why are you leading these men through the streets ?
well , to wear out their shoes and get myself more work .
why would you celebrate it ?
what victory does he bring home ?
what foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels ?
rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion .
caesar might act like that .
therefore , in case he does , we must hold him back .
the candle is burning in your study , sir .
it isn ’ t daybreak yet .
is tomorrow the 15th of march , boy ?
i don ’ t know , sir .
check the calendar and come tell me .
sir , fifteen days of march have gone by .
i haven ’ t slept since cassius first began to turn me against caesar .
instead , hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness .
i ’ m afraid we ’ re intruding too boldly on your sleep time .
i ’ ve been up all night .
do i know these men who are with you ?
he ’ s welcome here .
he ’ s welcome too .
and this is metellus cimber .
they ’ re all welcome .
what worries have kept you awake tonight ?
can i have a word with you ?
here ’ s the east .
won ’ t the dawn come from here ?
you ’ re both wrong .
and let us swear to our resolution .
no , let ’ s not swear an oath .
then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim .
only men whom you wouldn ’ t trust anyway would swear oaths , and for the worst reasons .
should we see what he thinks ?
i think he will stand strong with us .
let ’ s not leave him out .
no , by no means .
they ’ ll assume that cicero , with his sound judgment , ordered the actions .
no , don ’ t even mention him .
he ’ ll never follow anything that other men have started .
indeed , he ’ s not right for this .
we ’ d find that he was a dangerous plotter .
let ’ s be sacrificers but not butchers , caius .
we ’ re all against what caesar stands for , and there ’ s no blood in that .
oh , how i wish we could oppose caesar ’ s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up caesar himself !
but , unfortunately , caesar has to bleed if we ’ re going to stop him .
noble friends , let ’ s kill him boldly but not with anger .
this will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful .
if he loves caesar , then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for caesar .
there ’ s nothing to fear in him .
count how many times the clock chimes .
it ’ s time to leave .
don ’ t worry about that .
if he ’ s reluctant , i can convince him .
let me work on him .
i can put him in the right mood , and i ’ ll bring him to the capitol .
no , we ’ ll all go there to bring him .
is that the latest we can do it ?
caius ligarius doesn ’ t like caesar , who berated him for speaking well of pompey .
i wonder that none of you thought about getting his support .
good metellus , go to him now .
he likes me , and i ’ ve given him good reason to .
just send him here , and i ’ ll persuade him .
we ’ ll leave , brutus .
friends , go your separate ways .
but all of you , remember what you ’ ve said and prove yourselves true romans .
good gentlemen , look like you ’ re rested and happy .
and so , good morning to all of you .
well , enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep .
that ’ s why you sleep so soundly .
portia , what are you doing awake ?
it isn ’ t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw , cold morning .
it ’ s not good for your health , either .
you rudely snuck out of bed .
i asked you again , and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently .
my dear lord , tell me what ’ s bothering you .
you go down toward the capitol , and i ’ ll go this way .
undress the statues if they ’ re decorated in honor of caesar .
i ’ ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets .
you do the same , wherever the crowds are thick .
i ’ m not feeling well—that ’ s all .
i ’ m doing so .
good portia , go to bed .
and is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning ?
don ’ t kneel , noble portia .
if that were true , then i ’ d know your secret .
i won ’ t betray them .
i ’ ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh .
if i can bear that pain , then i can bear my husband ’ s secrets .
oh , gods , make me worthy of this noble wife !
lucius , who ’ s that knocking ?
here ’ s a sick man who wants to speak with you .
how i wish you felt better !
i ’ m not sick if you ’ ve prepared some honorable exploit for me .
a deed that will make sick men healthy .
but aren ’ t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick ?
neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight .
calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep , “ help , someone !
they ’ re murdering caesar ! ” who ’ s there ?
go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately , and bring me their interpretation of the results .
i will , my lord .
what are you doing , caesar ?
are you planning to go out ?
you ’ re not leaving the house today .
the things that threaten me have only seen my back .
when they see the face of caesar , they will vanish .
caesar , i never believed in omens , but now they frighten me .
a lioness gave birth in the streets , and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead .
these things are beyond anything we ’ ve seen before , and i ’ m afraid .
how can we avoid what the gods want to happen ?
when beggars die there are no comets in the sky .
the heavens only announce the deaths of princes .
cowards die many times before their deaths .
the brave experience death only once .
what do the priests say ?
they don ’ t want you to go out today .
they pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn ’ t find its heart .
the gods do this to test my bravery .
so , i won ’ t .
alas , my lord , your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom .
don ’ t go out today .
say that it ’ s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own .
here ’ s decius brutus .
he ’ ll tell them so .
good morning , worthy caesar .
i ’ ve come to take you to the senate house .
would i send a lie ?
decius , go tell them that caesar won ’ t come .
the reason is that it ’ s what i want .
i ’ m not coming .
that ’ s enough for the senate .
but for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i ’ ll tell you .
calphurnia , my wife , is keeping me at home .
this dream has been interpreted all wrong .
it was a good and lucky vision .
this is what calphurnia ’ s dream means .
you ’ ve offered an excellent interpretation .
i will have when you hear the rest of what i have to say .
the senate has decided to give mighty caesar a crown today .
if you send them word that you won ’ t come , they might change their minds .
how foolish your fears seem now , calphurnia !
i ’ m ashamed that i yielded to them .
give me my robe , because i ’ m going .
and look , here ’ s publius , come to fetch me .
caesar , the clock has struck eight .
i thank you all for your trouble and courtesy .
and to you , most noble caesar .
i ’ m to blame for making you wait for me .
remember to see me today .
stay near me so i ’ ll remember .
good friends , go in and have some wine with me .
and we ’ ll leave together , like friends .
i ’ m here , my lord .
when caesar says “ do this , ” it is done .
continue , then , and don ’ t forget to perform all of the rituals .
caesar , beware of brutus .
don ’ t go near casca .
keep an eye on cinna .
don ’ t trust trebonius .
pay attention to metellus cimber .
decius brutus doesn ’ t love you .
you ’ ve wronged caius ligarius .
these men all have one intention , and it ’ s directed against caesar .
if you aren ’ t immortal , watch those around you .
a sense of security opens the door to conspiracy .
i pray that the mighty gods defend you !
if you read this , caesar , you might live .
if not , the fates are on the side of the traitors .
boy , i beg you to run to the senate house .
don ’ t stay to answer me—get going .
i want you there and back again before i can even tell you what you should do there .
madam , what should i do ?
run to the capitol and nothing else ?
and then return to you and nothing else ?
yes , return and tell me if your master looks well , because he was sick when he left .
and pay attention to what caesar does and which men are close to him .
what ’ s that noise ?
i don ’ t hear anything , madam .
i beg you , listen well .
truly , madam , i don ’ t hear anything .
where are you coming from ?
my own house , good lady .
around nine o'clock , madam .
has caesar gone to the capital yet ?
i ’ m going to stand so i can see him pass on the way to the capitol .
you have some plea for caesar , don ’ t you ?
yes , i do , lady .
why , do you know of any harm intended toward him ?
nothing that i know for sure , but a lot that i ’ m afraid might happen .
the street is narrow here .
i ’ ll move to a more open place and there speak to great caesar as he walks past .
yes , caesar , but it ’ s not gone yet .
oh , caesar , read mine first , for my petition affects you more directly .
read it , great caesar .
whatever pertains to myself i will deal with last .
don ’ t delay , caesar .
what , is the man insane ?
what ’ s going on here ?
stop it , i order you .
the next person to strike again dies .
what ’ s going on here ?
these are the messengers from my sister and the king .
what are you fighting about ?
i ’ m out of breath , sir .
that ’ s an odd thing to say .
how can a tailor make a person ?
definitely a tailor , sir .
but tell me what you ’ re fighting about .
don ’ t you have any manners , you savage ?
yes , sir , but not when i ’ m enraged .
are you laughing at what i say , as if i were a fool ?
are you insane , old man ?
why are you calling him a jerk ?
what did he do to you ?
i don ’ t like his face .
but maybe you don ’ t like mine , or his , or hers either .
no flattery for him , no sir !
he ’ s honest , he ’ s got to speak the truth .
if people take what he says , fine .
if not , he ’ s got truth on his side !
i tried to stop speaking plainly , since you dislike plain speech so much .
sir , i know i ’ m not a flatterer .
i never offended him at all .
these cowards manage to make fools of brave men .
don ’ t put me in the stocks .
i serve the king , who sent me here .
i swear on my life and honor , he ’ ll sit here in the stocks until noon .
only until noon , my lord ?
no , the whole day , and all night too .
ma'am , you wouldn ’ t treat me like this if i were your father ’ s dog .
but since you ’ re his scoundrel servant , i will .
i beg you not to do this , my lord .
he ’ s done wrong , and his master the king will punish him for it .
the king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated .
i ’ ll take responsibility for that .
i ’ m sorry , my friend .
i ’ ll try talking to him again .
please don ’ t , sir .
even good men have bad luck .
it ’ s wrong for the duke to do this .
the king will be angry with him .
but do you mean what you ’ re saying ?
so young and so cruel ?
so young , my lord , and honest .
then that ’ s the way it ’ ll be .
the truth will be all the inheritance you get .
but sir— be quiet , kent .
i heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree .
every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout , waiting to capture me .
well , at least that ’ s something .
as edgar , i ’ m nothing at all .
it ’ s strange that regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger .
according to what i heard , they had no travel plans as of last night .
are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ?
that ’ s a nasty garter belt .
no , no , they wouldn ’ t .
they couldn ’ t , they wouldn ’ t .
it ’ s worse than murder to humiliate a king ’ s messenger like this .
my lord , when i arrived at their home i gave them your letter .
he woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams .
that ’ s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully .
fathers who wear rags make their children neglect them .
but fathers who are rich make their children kind .
lady luck is a fickle whore and never gives the poor a break .
i feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart .
inside , sir , with the earl .
don ’ t follow me .
you didn ’ t do anything else to earn this punishment ?
tell me , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ?
everyone can see that , and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now .
but if you see a wheel going uphill , latch on for the ride .
i only want idiots following my advice , the advice of a fool .
but i ’ ll linger .
and let the wise man run away .
where did you learn that song , fool ?
not in the stocks , fool .
how can they refuse to speak with me ?
they ’ re playing with me .
my dear lord , you know how passionately stubborn the duke is .
damn it all to hell !
gloucester , gloucester , i want to speak with the duke of cornwall and his wife .
my lord , i informed them as much .
do you understand what i ’ m saying , man ?
the king wants to speak with cornwall .
did you inform them of that ?
the “ passionate ” duke ?
tell the hot-headed duke that i… but no , not yet .
maybe he ’ s not feeling well .
i just want everything to be all right between you .
oh , my heart , my heart is rising into my throat !
that ’ s right , uncle , talk to your heart , like the good morning to you both .
i ’ m glad to see your highness .
i believe you are , regan .
you know why i think so ?
my dear regan , your sister ’ s not worth anything .
oh , regan , she ’ s torn me apart with unkindness , like a vulture , right here .
calm down , sir , please .
i can ’ t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way .
sir , you ’ re old .
your life is stretched to its limit .
please go back to goneril ’ s house .
go back to my sister ’ s .
shush , sir , please !
i hope lightning strikes her in the eyes !
i hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion !
that ’ s how you ’ ll talk about me when you ’ re in this mood .
her eyes are vicious , but yours are comforting .
you haven ’ t forgotten the half of a kingdom i gave you .
sir , let ’ s get to the point .
call the duke of burgundy .
let your anger fall on me then , even if its sharpness pierces my heart .
kent can speak rudely when lear goes mad .
what are you doing , old man ?
when a majestic king starts acting silly , then it ’ s my duty to be blunt .
what ’ s that trumpet ?
she ’ ll be here soon , just like her letter said .
what do you mean , your highness ?
who put my servant in the stocks ?
regan , i hope you didn ’ t know anything about that.—ah , who ’ s this ?
why shouldn ’ t she take my hand , father ?
how exactly have i offended you ?
i sent him there , sir , but his crimes deserved a worse punishment .
please , father , since you ’ re weak , act like it .
get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister .
right now i ’ m away from home and i can ’ t provide you with proper care .
i ’ d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here .
as you wish , sir .
i beg you , daughter , don ’ t make me crazy .
i won ’ t bother you .
we ’ ll never see each other again .
you ’ re a pustule , a sore , a tumor digesting my bloodline .
but i ’ ll stop rebuking you .
i won ’ t beg the gods to punish you , or caution you to fear their judgment .
person when you ’ re ready , if you ’ re inclined .
i ’ ll wait patiently .
meanwhile i ’ ll stay with regan with my hundred knights .
it ’ s not quite that simple .
i wasn ’ t expecting you , and i ’ m not ready to receive you .
please hear what goneril is saying .
how could so many people , under two masters , get along under one roof ?
it would be hard , almost impossible .
why couldn ’ t you be attended by my servants , or by regan ’ s ?
yes , why not , my lord ?
then if they ’ re negligent , we could control them .
i won ’ t lodge any more than that under my roof .
i gave you everything— and it was about time too .
why should i now have to make do with only twenty-five ?
regan , is that what you said ?
yes , i ’ ll say it again , my lord .
not being the worst daughter deserves some praise , i guess .
hear me out , my lord .
why do you need even one ?
oh , don ’ t ask me why i “ need ” them !
you ’ re a well-dressed lady .
oh , gods , give me patience !
you expect me to cry ?
well , i won ’ t .
let ’ s go inside .
there ’ s going to be a storm .
this is a small house .
there ’ s no room for the old man and his followers .
it ’ s his fault that he ’ s all worked up like this .
he has to pay the price for his foolish actions .
that ’ s what i intend to do too .
he followed the old man .
where ’ s he going ?
he has called for his horse , but i don ’ t know where he ’ s headed .
it ’ s best just to let him go .
he won ’ t listen to anyone ’ s advice .
there ’ s hardly a bush for miles around .
oh , sir , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions .
his attendants are desperate , violent men .
lock the doors , my lord .
it ’ s a wild night .
come in out of the storm .
who ’ s there , aside from this foul weather ?
someone whose mood is as foul as the weather , very troubled .
where ’ s the king ?
struggling with the wind and rain .
but who ’ s with him ?
sir , i know you , and i trust you enough to share something very important with you .
now this is where you come in .
let ’ s discuss it some more .
let me shake your hand .
do you have anything else to tell me ?
let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .
let quick sulfurous lightning , strong enough to split enormous trees , singe the white hair on my head .
please , uncle , let ’ s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you .
this storm has no pity for either wise men or fools .
the rain , the wind , the thunder and lightning are not my daughters .
nature , i don ’ t accuse your weather of unkindness .
so go ahead and have your terrifying fun .
here i am , your slave—a poor , sick , weak , hated old man .
anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders .
on my life i swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn ’ t love you least .
kent , if you want to stay alive , stop talking .
get out of my sight !
listen to me , you traitor .
for there never was a pretty woman who didn ’ t like to preen in the mirror .
no , i ’ ll be patient .
i won ’ t say a word .
a wise man and a fool .
let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light .
it will give you some protection from this storm .
they are harder than the stones the house is made of .
i ’ m starting to lose my mind .
that ’ s true , my good boy.—come on , take us to that hut .
i ’ ll recite a prophecy before i go .
and whoever lives to see that day will walk with his feet .
this is the prophecy that the wizard
oh , oh , edmund , i don ’ t like this monstrous business .
that ’ s uncivilized and unnatural !
there ’ s a feud between the two dukes .
it ’ s dangerous to talk about it .
i ’ ve locked it up in my room .
the humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly .
armed forces have already landed .
we have to take the king ’ s side .
i ’ ll look for him and secretly help him .
you go and talk to the duke so he won ’ t notice i ’ m helping the king .
if he asks to see me , tell him i ’ m sick and went to bed .
even if i have to die—as they threaten—i have to help the king .
strange things are about to happen , edmund .
and i ’ ll tell him about the letter too .
the young generation rises while the old one falls .
here ’ s the hut , my lord .
the night ’ s too rough for humans to bear .
leave me for a bit .
my lord , here is the entrance .
will you break my heart ?
i ’ d rather break my own heart .
you think it ’ s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin .
it ’ s a big deal to you .
but whenever you feel a larger pain , the smaller one disappears .
when your mind is at peace , your body is sensitive to the elements .
isn ’ t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it ?
but i ’ ll punish them thoroughly .
no , i won ’ t cry any more .
imagine them locking me out on a night like this !
but let it rain ; i ’ ll survive .
on a night like this !
i want to avoid that .
no more of these thoughts .
my lord , please go inside here .
this storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more .
but i ’ ll go in .
go out and feel what the impoverished feel .
don ’ t come in here , uncle !
there ’ s a spirit in here !
help me , help me !
a ghost , a ghost !
he says his name ’ s poor tom .
who are you , moaning in the hut like that ?
the devil ’ s after me !
the cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees .
get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up .
did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this ?
oh do-de , do-de , do-de .
god protect you from tornadoes , evil stars , and diseases !
take pity on poor tom , who is persecuted by the devil .
there ! … and over there ! … and over there !
have his daughters made him crazy like this ? —couldn ’ t you have kept something for yourself ?
did you have to give them everything ?
if he hadn ’ t , we ’ d all be embarrassed to look at him .
then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners !
he doesn ’ t have any daughters , sir .
nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this .
is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity ?
i ’ m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters .
this stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen .
what were you before this ?
i loved wine and gambling , and had more women than a turkish sultan keeps in his harem .
the cold wind ’ s still blowing through the hawthorn tree .
please calm down , uncle .
this is a nasty night to go swimming .
look , here comes a walking fire .
this is the devil flibbertigibbet .
he gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn .
and go away , witch , go away .
how are you , your highness ?
calm down , smulkin , you fiend !
he ’ s called modo and mahu .
poor tom ’ s chilly .
come back to my house with me .
i couldn ’ t bear to obey all of your daughters ' harsh orders .
first let me talk with this philosopher here.—
now get out of here !
i swear by jupiter i ’ ll never revoke this punishment .
here are the rulers of france and burgundy , my lord .
my lord the ruler of burgundy , i ’ ll speak to you first .
you ’ ve been competing with this king for my daughter .
let me ask you something in private .
his daughters want to kill him .
ah , good old kent said this would happen—that poor , banished man .
you say the king is losing his mind .
let me tell you , my friend , i ’ m almost insane myself .
i had a son , whom i ’ ve legally disowned .
he tried to kill me recently , very recently .
i loved him , as much as any father ever loved his son .
excuse me , sir.— tom ’ s chilly .
come on , let ’ s all go inside .
this way , my lord .
come on , my dear greek philosopher .
i ’ ll get my revenge before i leave this house .
how unlucky am i , having to apologize for doing the right thing !
come with me to see the duchess .
if this letter ’ s right , you ’ ve got a lot to deal with .
right or not , it ’ s made you the earl of gloucester .
i put my trust in you .
it ’ s better here than outside .
i ’ ll do what i can to make you even more comfortable .
i won ’ t be gone long .
he can ’ t bear his grief and so he ’ s losing his mind .
may god reward you for your kindness !
he ’ s a king , a king !
i see regan and goneril in hell—a thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them !
the nasty devil ’ s biting my butt .
i ’ ll do it .
the devil sings like a nightingale to haunt poor tom .
the demon hoppedance is in tom ’ s belly , crying for some fish to eat .
i ’ ve got no food to give you .
let ’ s have the evidence .
let ’ s give a fair verdict .
she can ’ t deny it .
and here ’ s regan , whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart .
you corrupt judge , why did you let her escape ?
look at the three little dogs , tray , blanch , and sweetheart—all barking at me .
tom will chase them off.—go away , you mongrels !
whether you bite to kill , mastiff , greyhound , or ugly mutt ,
with one little toss of his head , he can scare you off for good .
whether your mouth is black or white , do-dee , dee-dee da .
run off , go visit fairs and festivals !
poor tom , your cup is empty .
is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart ?
please lie down and rest a while , my lord .
be quiet , be quiet .
draw the curtains , just like that .
we ’ ll have supper in the morning .
and i ’ ll go to bed at noon .
he ’ s here , sir , but please don ’ t bother him .
he ’ s out of his right mind .
please get him , my friend , i beg you .
come on , come on .
the person who suffers alone suffers the most .
companions in sorrow alleviate our grief .
let ’ s go , tom .
whatever else happens tonight , i hope the king escapes safely !
leave him to my wrath.—edmund , go with my sister-in-law .
you shouldn ’ t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father .
tell the duke of albany to prepare for war immediately .
we will do the same .
we ’ ll keep the lines of communication open between us .
where ’ s the king ?
lord gloucester has helped him leave .
prepare the horses for your lady .
goodbye , my sweet lord.—goodbye , my sister .
go find the traitor gloucester .
tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me .
tie up his withered old arms .
my friends , remember that you ’ re my guests here .
don ’ t play any nasty tricks on me .
tie him up , i tell you .
your highness , i want nothing more than what you ’ ve already offered .
i know you ’ ll offer nothing less than that .
there she is , over there .
i don ’ t know what to say .
so do you take her or leave her ?
then leave her , sir .
tie him up harder.—you filthy traitor !
i ’ m not a traitor , unfair lady .
as old and white-haired as you are , and you ’ re such a traitor ?
this is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house .
what do you think you ’ re doing ?
tell us about the letters that you got from france .
get to the point , since we already know the truth .
and what ’ s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently ?
the ones you ’ ve sent our lunatic king to .
it came from a neutral party , not from someone opposed to you .
where have you sent the king ?
weren ’ t you ordered , on penalty of— why dover ? —let him answer that question first .
i ’ m backed into a corner with nowhere to run .
and the poor old man just wept , mixing his tears with the rain .
but soon i ’ ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father .
oh , help me , anyone who wants to live long !
now he ’ s a little crooked .
what ’ s this , you dog ?
i am willing to fight you if i must .
what do you mean by all this ?
i am dying ! —my lord , you still have one eye left to see cornwall punished .
where ’ s your sparkle now ?
where ’ s my son edmund ?
you ’ re appealing to a son who hates you .
he ’ s too good to have any compassion for you .
what a fool i ’ ve been !
this means i ’ ve mistreated edgar .
he can sniff his way to dover .
follow me , madam.—throw the blind traitor outside .
and throw this dead peasant into the manure pit.—regan , i ’ m bleeding .
it ’ s a bad time for such an injury .
if our criminal master gets off free , i won ’ t care what happens to me anymore .
if she lives a long and happy life , then all women may as well turn into monsters .
as a wandering lunatic , he can do whatever he wants .
i ’ ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face .
at the bottom , any change is for the better .
so i welcome this wind freely .
my father , led by a poor peasant ?
oh , life is full of surprises !
we age and die because they wear us out .
i ’ ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years .
away , get out of here .
leave me , my friend .
but you can ’ t see where you ’ re going , sir .
i don ’ t have anywhere to go , so i don ’ t need to see .
when i could see , i didn ’ t always see clearly .
i was reminded of my son , even though i despised my son at that time .
is that the naked guy ?
but sir , he ’ s crazy .
it ’ s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind .
do as i asked you .
or rather , do what you feel like doing .
hey , naked guy— poor tom ’ s chilly .
do you know the way to dover ?
poor tom has been scared out of his mind .
there ’ s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea .
take me to the edge of it , and i ’ ll reward all your troubles with something valuable .
once i ’ m there , i won ’ t need a guide anymore .
poor tom will take you there .
i ’ m surprised my bland husband didn ’ t meet me on the way here .
where ’ s your master ?
but it ’ d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible .
love ’ s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters .
she herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be .
i ’ m at your service until death .
what a man ! —especially compared to my husband .
edmund , you deserve me to be your woman .
there ’ s a fool sharing my bed now .
ma'am , my master ’ s coming .
so you finally find me worthy of your attentions .
goneril , you aren ’ t worth the dust the wind blows in your face .
i don ’ t trust you .
you can ’ t trust anyone who abuses her own father , her flesh and blood .
she will wither and come to a bad end .
bad people can ’ t appreciate wisdom or goodness .
they only like things as bad as themselves .
what have you two sisters done ?
you ’ re tigers , not daughters .
could my good brother-in-law—a man to whom the
shame on you , warped hag !
your true demonic features are distorting your body .
if i let myself do what i yearn to , i ’ d rip the flesh off your bones .
but i won ’ t attack a woman , even if she is a demon .
i sneeze on your manhood .
what news do you bring ?
there ’ s justice in heaven after all !
that these crimes are punished so quickly is proof .
but oh , poor glou-cester !
did he lose his other eye ?
he lost both , my lord.—ma'am , this letter is from your sister , and needs an immediate answer .
he was on his way here with your wife .
but he isn ’ t here now .
he was the one who denounced his father .
what else you do know ?
do you know why the king of france suddenly went back home ?
it was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence .
whom did he leave in charge here ?
the marshal of france , monsieur la far .
was queen cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered ?
she seemed to be trying to control her emotions , which were overwhelming her .
so she was moved by it ?
if everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow , then sorrow would be highly prized .
she didn ’ t ask anything ?
once she exclaimed , “ sisters , sisters , shame on you !
kent , father , sisters !
what , out in a storm in the middle of the night ?
i can ’ t believe it. ” the tears fell from her eyes like holy water .
then she ran away to grieve alone .
have you not spoken to her since then ?
did this happen before the king of france returned home ?
he ’ s too overwhelmed with shame .
all those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from cordelia .
oh , the poor man !
have you heard about albany ’ s and cornwall ’ s troops ?
they ’ re on the march .
well , sir , i ’ ll take you to lear and have you stay with him a while .
i have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer .
sadly , it ’ s the king that ’ s missing .
there is a way , ma'am .
then i ’ ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow .
may they relieve a sick old man ’ s suffering .
go find those herbs for him , before his madness puts his life in danger .
i have news , ma'am .
the british forces are on their way here .
our forces are ready for them .
oh , father , i ’ m taking care of your business .
that ’ s why the king of france listened to my pleas and tears .
i hope i see him and hear him again soon .
have my brother-in-law ’ s troops been mobilized ?
is he there in person ?
yes , making a big fuss .
your sister ’ s the better soldier of the two .
lord edmund didn ’ t speak to your master at home ?
what could my sister ’ s letter to him say ?
i don ’ t know , ma'am .
he rushed away on serious business .
it was a huge mistake to let old gloucester live after we blinded him .
wherever he goes , he inspires compassion and people turn against us .
and also to find out the size of the enemy army .
i have to follow him and give him the letter .
our troops are deployed tomorrow .
it ’ s dangerous out there .
peace to you , my lord of burgundy .
since you love money and power so much , i won ’ t be your wife .
she ’ s no longer my daughter , and i ’ ll never see her face again .
say goodbye to your sisters .
i can ’ t , ma'am .
my lady ordered me to deliver her letter .
why would she write to edmund ?
it probably has something to do with… i don ’ t know .
ma'am , i ’ d rather— i know your lady goneril doesn ’ t love her husband .
i ’ m sure of that .
and when she was here recently she flirted with edmund and gave him significant glances .
i know she trusts you and tells you everything .
i know what i ’ m talking about .
so i recommend you take note of what i ’ m about to say .
edmund and i have talked , and it makes more sense for him to marry me than goneril .
you can figure out the rest .
when will we get to the top of that cliff ?
the ground feels flat to me .
no , it ’ s dreadfully steep .
no , really , i don ’ t .
then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness .
you ’ re mistaken about all that .
the only thing different about me is my clothes .
i think you ’ re more articulate .
it ’ s so scary to look down !
the crows flying down below look as small as ants .
halfway down the cliff there ’ s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs—a risky business !
that big ship over there looks no bigger
up here you can ’ t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks .
lead me to where you ’ re standing .
you ’ re now within a foot of the cliff ’ s edge .
let go of my hand .
oh , you mighty gods !
go away and let me die .
you just fell the height of ten ship masts , straight down .
it ’ s a miracle you ’ re alive .
but did i fall or not ?
you fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff .
look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there ?
the lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard .
it used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people .
can you feel your legs ?
what was that thing i saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell ?
that was a poor unlucky beggar .
from down here , i thought his eyes looked like full moons .
he had a thousand noses and twisted horns , like wave crests in a storm at sea .
i thought that thing you ’ re talking about was a man .
cheer up and be at peace .
i ’ m the king himself .
piece of cheese will get him.—i challenge you to a match .
oh , that arrow was well shot .
goneril with a white beard ?
i tell you , they are not honest men .
they told me i was everything .
i recognize something about that voice .
isn ’ t that the king ?
yes , every inch a king .
what are you accused of ?
i ’ ll commute your death sentence .
little birds do it , and dragonflies copulate right in front of me .
get to it , be lustful , sleep around—i need soldiers for my army .
women are sex machines below the waist , though they ’ re chaste up above .
that ’ s where hell is , and darkness , and fires and stench !
give me an aphrodisiac , pharmacist .
there ’ s money in it for you .
oh , let me kiss his hand !
let me wipe it off first .
i remember your eyes quite well .
are you squinting at me ?
oh ho , is that what you ’ re getting at ?
no eyes in your head til there ’ s money in your wallet ?
what , are you crazy ?
you don ’ t need eyes to see how the world works .
look how the judge yells at a simple thief .
have you seen a farmer ’ s dog bark at a beggar ?
and you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt ?
you stupid cop , stop your violence !
why are you whipping that whore ?
you can ’ t blame anyone for it anyone , i say .
i ’ ll vouch for that .
believe me , my friend , since i have the power to stop the prosecutors .
if you want to cry over my bad luck , i ’ ll give you my eyes .
your name ’ s gloucester .
you have to be patient with me .
the first time we see the world as newborns , we cry and scream .
i ’ ll read you a sermon .
that ’ s a nice hat you ’ ve got there .
how ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt .
i ’ ll test it out .
what , i ’ m a prisoner ?
there ’ s a ransom .
you can have anything you want .
will no one back me up ?
that would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears .
i ’ ll die you ’ re of royal blood , and we obey you .
then there ’ s still a chance .
but you ’ ll have to catch me !
catch me if you can !
sa , sa , sa , sa .
in a king , the sight is unbearable .
how do you do , sir .
how can i help you ?
have you heard any news of impending battle ?
everyone who can hear has heard about it .
could you tell me how near the enemy is ?
very near , and approaching fast .
the main body of the army is expected here any hour now .
that ’ s all i wanted to know .
don ’ t tell us what our duty is .
time will tell what you ’ ve got up your sleeve .
come with me , my dear cordelia .
sister , i have a lot to say about things that concern us both .
i think that our father will leave here tonight .
yes , i ’ m sure he will—to stay with you .
next month he ’ ll stay with us .
he ’ s so flighty in his old age , as we keep noticing .
he has always loved cordelia best , and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious .
the queen is here on special business , and her army has moved on .
gentle gods in heaven , please let me die .
don ’ t tempt me to suicide again .
and who are you , good sir ?
i ’ m a poor man who ’ s been humbled by many misfortunes .
that blind head of yours was created to make me rich .
you old traitor , repent all your sins .
i hope you ’ re strong enough to do it .
whoa , man , you dare to support someone who ’ s been proclaimed a traitor ?
get out of here , before his bad luck infects you too .
let go of his arm .
let go of him , peasant , or you die !
i ’ ll knock your teeth out , sir .
to hell with your sword .
you ’ re a hardworking villain who ’ d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to .
let ’ s look in his pockets .
the letters he spoke of may help me .
i ’ m just sorry i had to be the one to kill him .
let ’ s see here .
come on , envelope , open up for me .
reading their mail isn ’ t as bad .
don ’ t forget the vows we made to each other .
it ’ d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything .
i think i hear the drums far away .
come , father , i ’ ll leave you at a friend ’ s house .
oh , kent , what could i ever do to become as good as you are ?
i won ’ t live long enough , and all my efforts will fail me .
just being thanked is more than enough for me , madam .
i hope all reports about me simply tell the truth , no more or less .
all right , my lord.—how ’ s the king doing ?
he ’ s still sleeping , ma'am .
would you mind if we woke up the king ?
he ’ s slept a long time .
is he in his royal garments ?
stay close by when we wake him up , ma'am .
i ’ m sure he will stay under control .
please come closer.— make the music louder , please !
if you hadn ’ t been their father , your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion .
and were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums ?
you talk to him , ma'am .
that ’ s most appropriate .
how are you , my royal lord ?
how is your majesty doing ?
you do me wrong by taking me out of the grave .
even my tears burn me like molten lead .
sir , do you know who i am ?
you ’ re a spirit , i know .
let him be for a bit .
i ’ ve been tricked .
i would die of pity to see someone else in my condition .
i don ’ t know what to say .
i can ’ t even be sure these are my hands .
i wish i knew what is happening .
please don ’ t make fun of me .
to put it plainly , i ’ m afraid i ’ m not quite sane .
i feel i should recognize you and that man
i can ’ t recall where i slept last night .
don ’ t laugh at me , but i swear i think this lady is my child cordelia .
and i am , i am .
yes , indeed they are .
please don ’ t cry .
if you have poison for me , i ’ ll drink it .
but you didn ’ t , even though you had every reason .
i had no reason , no reason .
you ’ re in your own kingdom , sir .
don ’ t deceive me .
you can relax , ma'am .
his insane period is over .
but it ’ s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost .
ask him to go in .
don ’ t trouble him further until his mind is more settled .
would your highness like to take a walk ?
you ’ ll have to bear with me .
i ’ m old and foolish .
is it true , sir , that the duke of cornwall was killed as they say ?
yes , it ’ s true , sir .
who is leading his men ?
they say gloucester ’ s bastard son is .
i hear that edgar , gloucester ’ s exiled son , is with the earl of kent in germany .
you can ’ t trust all the rumors .
it ’ s time to reassess the situation .
the british troops are coming near .
it will likely be a bloody fight .
i ’ m afraid that may be the case , madam .
now , my sweet lord , you know how much i like you .
tell me truthfully , do you love my sister ?
no , i swear on my honor , i haven ’ t , madam .
he ’ s going senile .
but then again he ’ s never really understood his own feelings very well .
yes , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life .
we ’ ll probably witness many more outbursts from him , like banishing kent .
there ’ s still the king of france ’ s farewell ceremony .
let ’ s put our heads together .
we ’ ll have to think about it carefully .
we have to strike while the iron ’ s hot .
i can ’ t stand her .
please , my lord , don ’ t be friendly with her .
don ’ t worry about me.—your sister and the duke are here .
why are we talking about this ?
then let ’ s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next .
i ’ ll meet you at your tent .
goneril , are you coming with us ?
it ’ s the best thing to do .
wait until i read the letter .
i was ordered not to .
when the time comes , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and i ’ ll return .
i ’ ll take a look at your letter .
we ’ ll be ready when the time comes .
which one of them should i pick ?
i can ’ t enjoy either of them as long as the other one ’ s alive .
if i ever come back , i ’ ll bring you good news .
we have to get out of here , old man .
let me help you up .
he and his daughter are captured .
i can ’ t go any further , sir .
and that ’ s true too .
officers , take them away .
guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them .
no , no , no , no !
come on , let ’ s go to prison .
the two of us together will sing like birds in a cage .
in prison we ’ ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change .
my cordelia , even the gods admire how much you ’ ve sacrificed for me .
have i hugged you yet ?
our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again .
we ’ ll watch them starve to death first .
i ’ ll do it , sir .
when you ’ ve finished , you ’ ll be a happy man .
go immediately , and do exactly as i wrote down .
i can ’ t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse .
if it ’ s work for a man , i ’ ll do it .
i sent the french queen with him too , for the same reason .
we need a more appropriate place to discuss cordelia and her father .
that ’ s for to me to decide .
he ’ d really be your proxy if he married you .
you ’ re so infatuated with him that you ’ re hallucinating .
are you trying to sleep with him ?
nor is it up to you , my lord .
yes it is , you half-blood .
you ’ ve got a sword , gloucester .
oh , i ’ m sick , sick !
i feel sicker and sicker .
she ’ s not feeling well .
take her to my tent .
come here , herald.—let the trumpet sound ! —read this out .
all right then , legitimate brother edgar , i have to have your lands .
look out , i ’ m on my way up .
kent ’ s been banished just like that ?
all this so suddenly ? —edmund , what ’ s going on ?
what ’ s the news ?
i ’ ve lost my name and title to a traitor .
but i ’ m as noble as my opponent .
who ’ s the spokesman for edmund , earl of gloucester ?
i ’ m my own spokesman .
what do you have to say to me ?
normally i would ask you what your name is first .
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—trumpets , blow !
you were tricked into fighting , gloucester .
according to the laws of war , you didn ’ t have to fight a stranger .
i make the laws , not you .
who can prosecute me for it ?
don ’ t ask me what i know .
i ’ ve done everything you accuse me of—and more , much more .
you ’ ll find out everything in due time .
it ’ s all over now , and so am i. let ’ s forgive each other .
i ’ m no less noble than you are , edmund .
if i ’ m more noble than you , you ’ ve done me wrong .
my name is edgar , and i ’ m your father ’ s son .
the gods are fair , and they use our little vices to punish us .
i swear i never hated you or your father !
where have you been hiding ?
how did you know what happened to your poor father ?
listen to my little story , and when it ’ s done , oh , my heart will break !
to escape the decree condemning me
i became his guide , i led him and begged for him , and kept him from suicide .
your words have moved me , and maybe it ’ ll do some good .
you look like you have something more to say .
if there ’ s anything more sorrowful left to add , keep it to yourself .
i ’ m almost ready to break down hearing this much .
this may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness , but if i went on i could outdo it .
then i heard the trumpets blow twice , and left him there in a trance .
but who was that man ?
help , help , oh , help !
what kind of help do you need ?
what is that bloody knife ?
it ’ s still warm from the cut .
it was just removed from from the heart of—oh , she ’ s dead !
your wife , sir , your wife .
and her sister ’ s dead too , poisoned by your wife .
i was engaged to both of them .
all three of us will marry now in death .
i thought the king preferred the duke of albany to the duke of cornwall .
we used to think so too .
yes , i ’ ve been responsible for his upbringing .
do you smell something naughty ?
well , i wouldn ’ t want to undo the naughtiness , since the boy turned out so well .
oh , is that kent ?
i ’ ve come to say farewell to my king and master .
isn ’ t he here ?
what an enormous thing for us to forget ! —edmund , tell us , where ’ s the king ?
and where ’ s cordelia ? — do you see this , kent ?
oh , why is this so ?
still , edmund was beloved .
one of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me , and then killed herself .
i wish i could live longer .
i want to do a little good despite my evil nature .
go quickly—hurry—to the castle , for i ’ ve given orders to have lear and cordelia killed .
hurry , send someone immediately !
run , run , oh , run !
whom should we look for in the castle ? —whose job is it ?
send something along to prove you ’ re withdrawing the orders .
the captain—give it to the captain .
run as if your life depended on it .
heaven help her ! —get him out of here for now .
howl , howl , howl , howl !
oh , you men are made of stone !
she ’ s gone forever .
i know how to tell when someone is alive or dead .
she ’ s as dead as the cold ground .
let me borrow a mirror .
if her breath steams up the glass , then she ’ s alive .
or just a foretaste of it ?
let the world collapse around us .
this feather moved because of her breath .
if that ’ s true , it makes up for all the sorrows i ’ ve ever known .
oh , my good master !
it ’ s noble kent , your friend .
curse you all , you ’ re all murderers and traitors !
i could have saved her .
now she ’ s gone forever.—cordelia , cordelia , stay a while .
it ’ s true , my lords , he did .
but i ’ m old now , and suffering has weakened me .
aren ’ t you kent ?
he ’ s a good fellow , i can tell you that much .
he ’ s dead and rotting in the dirt now .
no , my lord , that was me .
i ’ m the one who— i ’ ll get right on that .
followed you on your sad wanderings , ever since your bad luck began .
it was me , no one else .
everything is gloomy , dark , and dreadful .
your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair .
yes , i think that ’ s true .
he doesn ’ t know what he ’ s saying .
edmund is dead , my lord .
and my poor he ’ s fainted.—my lord , my lord !
don ’ t disturb his soul .
let it go up to heaven .
oh , he ’ s really gone .
what ’ s amazing is how long he lasted .
our business now is mourning and grief .
why are you hiding that letter ?
i don ’ t have any news to report , my lord .
what ’ s that paper you were reading ?
it ’ s nothing , my lord .
then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ?
if it were nothing , you wouldn ’ t need to hide it .
please , sir , i beg you .
it ’ s a letter from my brother that i haven ’ t finished reading yet .
give me that letter , sir .
now i ’ ll offend you whether i give it to you or not .
the problem is in what the letter says , as far as i can tell .
i hope for my brother ’ s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor .
i will have to go on a journey to death soon , sir .
my master ’ s calling me .
i can ’ t say no .
we must remember the gravity of this sad day .
we should speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
come talk to me about this .
how could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart ?
how did you get this letter ?
nobody delivered it , my lord .
that ’ s what ’ s clever about it .
it was tossed into the window of my room .
you ’ re sure the handwriting is your brother ’ s ?
if he ’ d written nice things , i ’ d swear yes right away .
but as it stands , i wish i could believe it wasn ’ t .
but it is his handwriting ?
has he ever tested out these ideas on you before ?
oh , what a villain !
that ’ s just what he said in the letter .
i ’ ll arrest him .
i ’ m not sure , my lord .
he can ’ t possibly be such a monster— and i ’ m sure he isn ’ t .
toward his own father who loves him so completely .
edmund , go find him .
these recent eclipses of the sun and moon don ’ t bode well for us .
though science can explain them away , disasters still come after eclipses .
love cools off , friendships break up , and brothers become enemies .
break out , civil war erupts , kings are betrayed , and the bond between father and son snaps .
this wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father .
the king acts unnaturally—father against child .
we ’ ve seen the best our age has to offer .
conspiracies , fakery , betrayal , and disorder are all that ’ s left until we die .
find out what this villainous edgar is thinking , edmund .
you won ’ t lose any respect .
it ’ s strange , strange .
fa , sol , la , mi .
what are you thinking about so seriously ?
how long have you believed in astrology ?
when was the last time you saw my father ?
did you speak to him ?
yes , we talked for a couple of hours .
did you leave on good terms ?
did he express any dissatisfaction with you , either in his words or his face ?
no , none at all .
some villain has told lies about me .
that ’ s what i ’ m afraid of .
i suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little .
here ’ s my key .
if you go outside , arm yourself .
brother , i ’ m giving you good advice .
will i hear from you soon ?
i ’ ll help you through this business .
i know exactly how to proceed .
any trick that works is good for me .
did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ?
every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge .
i won ’ t stand for it .
his knights are getting out of control , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail .
when he comes back from hunting , i ’ m not going to speak to him .
tell him i ’ m sick .
i ’ ll take responsibility for it .
he ’ s coming , ma'am .
be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him—you and the other servants .
if he doesn ’ t like it , he can go live with my sister .
that useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he ’ s given away .
i swear , old fools become like babies again .
remember what i ’ ve told you .
and make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights .
don ’ t worry about the consequences .
tell your men as much .
i want this to provoke confrontations , so i can give him a piece of my mind .
i ’ ll write to my sister and tell her my plans .
now go , set up for dinner .
i love my master , and he ’ ll find me very hard-working .
don ’ t make me wait for dinner even a moment .
what ’ s your profession ?
what do you want from me ?
an honest guy who ’ s as poor as the king .
if you ’ re as poor a subject as he is a king , you definitely are poor .
to work as a servant .
who do you want to work for ?
what work can you do ?
i ’ m good at everything that ordinary men can do .
the best thing about me is that i ’ m hardworking .
you ’ ll work for me .
where ’ s my fool ? —go call my fool and have him come here .
no , i don ’ t , my lord .
very pleased to meet you , my lord .
i look forward to getting to know you better .
i ’ ll try to make myself worth your knowledge .
he ’ s been gone for nine years and he ’ s leaving again soon .
go escort the lords of france and burgundy , gloucester .
you , sir , where ’ s my daughter ?
i beg your pardon , sir— what did that guy say ?
call the numbskull back in here .
where ’ s my fool ?
you ’ d think everyone was asleep .
so what ’ s going on ?
where ’ s that dog ?
he says your daughter ’ s not feeling well , my lord .
why didn ’ t the jerk come back to me when i called him ?
sir , he told me quite bluntly that he didn ’ t feel like it .
didn ’ t feel like it ?
the servants , the duke , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly .
do you really mean that ?
no , you ’ re just reminding me of something i ’ ve also noticed .
i ’ ll look into it further .
but where ’ s my fool ?
i haven ’ t seen him for two days .
ever since cordelia left for france , sir , the fool has been depressed .
let ’ s not talk about it .
i ’ ve noticed it myself .
go and tell my daughter i want to speak with her .
and you , go call my fool .
you there , sir , come here please .
who am i , sir ?
you dog , you peasant !
i won ’ t be hit , my lord .
now , my friendly servant , thank you .
well hello , my good boy .
for standing up for this unpopular king .
no , if you can ’ t adjust to political changes , you ’ ll suffer for it .
there , take my fool ’ s cap .
this guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to .
i wish i had two fool ’ s caps and two daughters .
if i gave them all i own , i ’ d have two fool ’ s caps for myself .
ask your daughters for another one .
watch out , boy—remember i can whip you .
a constant pain to me !
i ’ ll recite something for you , guy .
have more than you show , speak less than you know , lend less than you owe .
in that case it ’ s like the words of an unpaid lawyer .
why , no , boy .
nothing can be made out of nothing .
you ’ re a bitter fool .
do you know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet one ?
bring here the gentleman who advised you to give away your land .
you can stand in his place .
the sweet and bitter fool will appear right away .
the sweet fool in a fool ’ s costume—that ’ s me .
the bitter one is the other one—that ’ s you.lear are you calling me a fool , boy ?
well , you ’ ve given away all your other rightful titles .
which two crowns would those be ?
when did you become so fond of singing , boy ?
i want to learn how to lie .
if you lie , boy , we ’ ll have you whipped .
i ’ m amazed how similar you and your daughters are .
i ’ d rather be anything besides a fool .
and yet i wouldn ’ t want to be you , uncle .
here comes the owner of one piece .
what ’ s going on , daughter ?
why are you frowning like that ?
i think you ’ ve been frowning too much recently .
the man who gives away his crust and his crumbs will discover that he needs some crumbs back .
so the candle went out and now we ’ re all in the dark .
does anyone here know who i am ?
i ’ m not lear .
i don ’ t think so .
who can tell me who i am ?
you ’ re lear ’ s shadow .
daughters who can make you obey them .
this fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks .
i ’ m asking you to understand my point of view .
since you ’ re old and respected , you should be wise .
it ’ s shameful , and we have to make some changes right away .
you ’ re not really my daughter , but i still have one daughter left .
you hit my servants , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants .
you ’ ll be sorry later , but it ’ ll be too late .
ingratitude is always hideous , but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster !
please , sir , be patient .
that may be true , my lord .
ah , dear nature , my goddess , listen to me !
dear gods in heaven , what ’ s the reason for this ?
you ’ ll see , i promise you .
goneril , you know how much i love you , but still i have to say— shush , please .
come , sir , no more.—oswald , come here !
so the fool follows you .
my father can ’ t think straight—a hundred knights !
you may be exaggerating the risks .
that ’ s better than exaggerating our trust .
it ’ s always better to get rid of what you ’ re scared of than to be afraid .
i know how his mind works .
i ’ ve written to my sister telling her everything he ’ s said .
have you written that letter to my sister yet ?
take some men and horses and go to her .
add details of your own to back up what i ’ m saying .
now go , and hurry back .
but people often screw things up trying to make them better .
no , not at all— all right , all right .
i won ’ t sleep until i ’ ve delivered your letter , my lord .
if a man ’ s brain were in his feet , wouldn ’ t it be susceptible to frostbite ?
ha , ha , ha !
your other daughter regan will treat you kindly , you ’ ll see .
and what do you know , boy ?
i know that regan will taste just like goneril—both of them sour crabapples .
do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person ’ s face ?
i was wrong to her— do you know how an oyster makes its shell ?
but i know why a snail carries its house on its back .
he can ’ t give his house away to his daughters , leaving himself without shelter .
i want to forget what i am .
such a kind father ! —are my horses ready ?
your attendant asses are getting the horses ready .
there ’ s a nice reason why the constellation pleiades has only seven stars in it .
because it doesn ’ t have eight ?
you ’ d make a good fool .
i could take back my crown by force—what outrageous ingratitude !
you ’ re not supposed to get old until you ’ re wise .
oh , dear god , don ’ t let me go mad !
keep me balanced and sane .
i don ’ t want to go mad .
they ’ re ready , my lord .
i don ’ t know .
you haven ’ t heard of the war brewing between the dukes of cornwall and albany ?
you may hear about it soon .
the duke will be here tonight ?
his arrival fits perfectly into my plan .
fast work and a little luck are all i need.—brother , could i have a word with you ?
father is on the lookout .
get out of here quickly !
it has leaked out that you ’ re hiding here .
you haven ’ t said anything against the duke of cornwall , have you ?
he ’ s rushing on his way here right now , and regan ’ s with him .
i hear my father coming .
i have to pretend to threaten you with my sword .
edmund , where ’ s your wicked brother ?
look , sir , i ’ m bleeding .
where is the villain , edmund ?
he ran out that way , sir , when he couldn ’ t— follow him , now !
when he couldn ’ t what ?
let him run far away .
if he stays in this country he ’ ll be found .
the duke of cornwall , my master and patron , is arriving tonight .
come on , “ nothing ” will get you nothing .
i don ’ t have a talent for putting my heart ’ s feelings into words .
i love you as a child should love her father , neither more nor less .
what are you saying , cordelia ?
revise your statement , or you may damage your inheritance .
he answered , “ you penniless bastard !
do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours , anyone would believe you ?
he said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?
the duke ’ s trumpets .
i don ’ t know why he ’ s come here .
i ’ ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors .
the villain won ’ t escape .
the duke will agree with me on that .
how are you , my friend ?
ever since i arrived here , just now , i ’ ve been hearing strange rumors .
how are you , my lord ?
oh , madam , my old heart is broken , broken .
oh , my lady , i ’ m ashamed to admit it .
wasn ’ t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father ?
i don ’ t know , madam .
oh , it ’ s too terrible .
to answer your question , ma'am—yes , he was friendly with those knights .
then it ’ s no surprise they had a bad influence on him .
they probably put him up to killing old man gloucester to get his money .
i just did my duty , sir .
are your men searching for him ?
if he ’ s caught , he ’ ll never make trouble for anyone again .
i need people as trustworthy as you .
i ’ ll always be loyal to you , sir .
you don ’ t know why we came to visit you— yes , and so unexpectedly , at night .
their messengers are ready , waiting to deliver our response in these matters .
so please , old friend , give us some good advice .
i ’ m at your service , madam .
both of you are very welcome here .
good morning to you , friend .
do you work in this house ?
where should we stable our horses ?
please , sir , be kind to me and tell me .
i won ’ t be kind to you .
in that case , i don ’ t much care for you either .
if i could get my hands on you , i ’ d make you care .
why are you talking to me like this ?
i don ’ t even know you .
ah , but i know you .
what a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don ’ t know me !
it was just two days ago that i tripped you and beat you up in front of the king .
draw your sword , scoundrel .
i ’ ll make ground beef out of you .
i ’ ve got nothing to do with you .
draw your sword , you jerk !
draw your sword , scoundrel , or i ’ ll slice your thighs like flank steak .
stand and fight , you overdressed servant , fight !
there ’ s still a bit of daylight in the sky .
now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns .
the rest of the king ’ s guests are already inside .
then let the rain come down .
oh , this is treachery !
get out of here , good fleance , run , run , run !
someday you can get revenge.—oh , you bastard !
who put out the light ?
wasn ’ t that the best thing to do ?
there ’ s only one body here .
we failed in half of our mission .
well , let ’ s get out of here and tell macbeth what we did accomplish .
from the highest to the lowest of you , i bid you a hearty welcome .
i will walk around and mingle with all of you , playing the humble host .
and they respond to you with their hearts as well .
the table is full on both sides .
i will sit here in the middle .
soon we will toast around the table .
then it must be banquo ’ s .
my lord , his throat is cut .
i did that to him .
you are the best of the cutthroats .
if you cut both their throats , then you are the absolute best .
most royal sir , fleance has escaped .
now i ’ m scared again .
yes , my good lord .
the adult snake lies in the ditch .
i ’ ll talk to you again tomorrow .
my royal lord , you ’ re not entertaining the guests .
when you just want to eat , it ’ s better to do that at home .
where have you been , sister ?
a sailor ’ s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them .
give me one , ” i said .
get away from me , witch ! ” the fat woman cried .
and i will give you some more .
i ’ ll drain the life out of him .
he won ’ t catch a wink of sleep , either at night or during the day .
he will live as a cursed man .
for eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony .
it ’ s nice of you to remind me .
why don ’ t you have a seat , your highness ?
his absence means he ’ s broken his promise , sir .
the table ’ s full .
here ’ s an empty seat , sir .
what , my good lord ?
his highness is not well .
sit down , worthy friends .
my husband is often like this , and he has been since he was a child .
eat your dinner and pay no attention to him .
yes , and a brave one , who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil .
oh , that ’ s nonsense !
this is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you ’ re afraid .
these outbursts of yours don ’ t even look like real fear .
why are you making these faces ?
when the vision passes , you ’ ll see that you ’ re just looking at a stool .
please , just look over there .
as sure as i ’ m standing here , i saw him .
but now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools .
this haunting business is even stranger than murder .
my worthy lord , your noble friends miss your company .
too bad it ’ s spoiling our pleasure tonight .
or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place .
if i tremble then , you can call me a little girl .
get out of here , you horrible ghost , you hallucination .
i am a man again .
what things , my lord ?
please , don ’ t speak to him .
he ’ s getting worse and worse .
a kind good night to all !
gravestones have been known to move , and trees to speak , to bring guilty men to justice .
it ’ s almost morning .
did you send for him , sir ?
i ’ ve heard about this indirectly , but i will send for him .
in every one of the lords ' households i have a servant paid to spy for me .
tomorrow , while it ’ s still early , i will go see the witches .
my own safety is the only important thing now .
i have to do these things before i have a chance to think about them .
yes , let ’ s go to sleep .
my strange self-delusions just come from inexperience .
we ’ re still just beginners when it comes to crime .
what ’ s wrong , hecate ?
don ’ t i have a reason to be angry , you disobedient hags ?
but you can make it up to me .
go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell .
macbeth will go there to learn his destiny .
you bring your cauldrons , your spells , your charms , and everything else .
i ’ m about to fly away .
i ’ ll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen .
i have a lot to do before noon .
an important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon .
i ’ ll catch it before it falls to the ground .
as you all know , overconfidence is man ’ s greatest enemy .
i ’ m being called .
look , my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me .
all i ’ m saying is that strange things have been going on .
clearly , men should not go out walking too late !
and who can help thinking how monstrous it was for malcolm and donalbain to kill their gracious father ?
those are the things we pine for now .
macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he ’ s preparing for war .
did he tell macduff to return to scotland ?
i ’ ll send my prayers with him .
although i can ’ t make his ship disappear , i can still make his journey miserable .
look what i have here .
show me , show me .
a drum , a drum !
the tawny cat has meowed three times .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
we ’ ll cool the mixture with baboon blood .
i admire your efforts , and all of you will share the rewards .
now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies , enchanting everything you put in .
i can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs .
doors , open up for whoever is knocking !
what ’ s going on here , you secret , evil , midnight hags ?
something there isn ’ t a word for .
tell me what i want to know .
would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master ’ s ?
pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring .
tell me , you unknown power— he can read your thoughts .
listen , but don ’ t speak .
beware the thane of fife .
whatever you are , thanks for your advice .
you have guessed exactly what i feared .
but one word more— he will not be commanded by you .
here ’ s another , stronger than the first .
if i had three ears i ’ d listen with all three .
be violent , bold , and firm .
laugh at the power of other men , because nobody born from a woman will ever harm macbeth .
but even so , i ’ ll make doubly sure .
that way i can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night .
listen but don ’ t speak to it .
be brave like the lion and proud .
macbeth will never be defeated until birnam wood marches to fight you at dunsinane hill .
who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth ?
but my heart is still throbbing to know one thing .
don ’ t try to find out more .
i demand to be satisfied .
if you refuse , let an eternal curse fall on you .
why is that cauldron sinking ?
and what is that music ?
show him and make him grieve .
come like shadows and depart in the same way !
you look too much like the ghost of banquo .
come , sisters , let ’ s cheer him up and show him our talents .
let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed .
what does your grace want ?
did you see the weird sisters ?
didn ’ t they pass by you ?
no , indeed , my lord .
i heard the galloping of horses .
who was it that came here ?
two or three men , my lord , who brought the message that macduff has fled to england .
yes , my good lord .
time , you thwart my dreadful plans .
i will do this deed before i lose my sense of purpose .
but no more spooky visions ! —where are the messengers ?
come , bring me to them .
what did he do that made him flee this land ?
you have to be patient , madam .
he was crazy to run away .
you don ’ t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee .
how could it be wisdom !
his running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love .
my dearest relative , i ’ m begging you , pull yourself together .
i ’ ll say good-bye now .
it won ’ t be long before i ’ m back .
he has a father , and yet he is fatherless .
if i stay longer , i ’ ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying .
i ’ m leaving now .
young man , your father ’ s dead .
what are you going to do now ?
how are you going to live ?
are you going to start eating worms and flies ?
i mean i will live on whatever i get , like birds do .
you ’ d be a pitiful bird .
you wouldn ’ t know enough to be afraid of traps .
no matter what you say , my father is not dead .
yes , he is dead .
what are you going to do for a father ?
maybe you should ask , what will you do for a husband ?
oh , i can buy twenty husbands at any market .
speak , if you can .
hail to you , thane of glamis !
you are lesser than macbeth but also greater .
you are not as happy as macbeth , yet much happier .
your descendants will be kings , even though you will not be one .
so all hail , macbeth and banquo !
if so , you ’ d be buying them to sell again .
you talk like a child , but you ’ re very smart anyway .
was my father a traitor , mother ?
someone who makes a promise and breaks it .
and is everyone who swears and lies a traitor ?
everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged .
and should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged ?
if he were dead , you ’ d be weeping for him .
silly babbler , how you talk !
bless you , fair lady !
you don ’ t know me , but i know you ’ re an important person .
i ’ m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you .
go away and take your children .
and harm is getting close !
i haven ’ t done anything wrong .
so then why should i offer this womanish defense that i ’ m innocent ?
i hope he ’ s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him .
he ’ s a traitor .
you ’ re lying , you shaggy-haired villain !
what ’ s that , you runt ?
he has killed me , mother .
run away , i beg you !
let ’ s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out .
what you just said may perhaps be true .
you were one of his favorites .
he hasn ’ t done anything to harm you yet .
even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command .
but i beg your pardon .
my fears can ’ t actually make you evil .
angels are still bright even though lucifer , the brightest angel , fell from heaven .
even though everything evil wants to look good , good still has to look good too .
but i beg you , don ’ t interpret my suspicions as slander against you .
you may really be honest , no matter what i think .
bleed , bleed , poor country !
don ’ t be offended .
i don ’ t completely distrust you .
i do think scotland is sinking under macbeth ’ s oppression .
our country weeps , it bleeds , and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds .
the english have promised me thousands of troops .
who are you talking about ?
even in hell you couldn ’ t find a devil worse than macbeth .
but there is no end , absolutely none , to my sexual desires .
it would be better for macbeth to rule than someone like me .
endless greed and lust in a man ’ s nature is a kind of tyranny .
it has caused the downfall of many kings .
but don ’ t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you .
there are more than enough willing women around .
greed has been the downfall of many kings .
but i don ’ t have any good sides .
no , if i had power i would take world peace and throw it down to hell .
if someone like me is fit to be king , let me know .
i ’ m still a virgin .
it ’ s hard to make sense of such different stories .
well , we ’ ll speak more soon .
what disease is he talking about ?
it ’ s called the evil .
along with this strange power , he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities .
who ’ s that coming over here ?
by his dress i can tell he ’ s my countryman , but i don ’ t recognize him .
my noble kinsman , welcome .
is scotland the same as when i left it ?
alas , our poor country !
it ’ s too frightened to look at itself .
oh , your report is too poetic , but it sounds so true !
banquo and macbeth , all hail !
stay and tell me more .
speak , i command you .
where did they disappear to ?
i wish they had stayed !
were these things we ’ re talking about really here ?
or are we both on drugs ?
your children will be kings .
you will be the king .
isn ’ t that what they said ?
that ’ s exactly what they said .
they ’ re well too .
what ’ s the news ?
now is the time when we need your help .
gracious king edward has sent us noble siward and ten thousand soldiers .
i wish i could repay this happy news with good news of my own .
what is this news about ?
if it ’ s for me , don ’ t keep it from me .
let me have it now .
i think i can guess what you ’ re about to say .
your wife and children were savagely slaughtered .
they killed my children too ?
they killed your wife , your children , your servants , anyone they could find .
and i had to be away !
my wife was killed too ?
he doesn ’ t have children .
all my pretty little children ?
oh , that bird from hell !
what , all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop ?
fight it like a man .
i can ’ t help remembering the things that were most precious to me .
did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help ?
sinful macduff , they were killed because of you !
as wicked as i am , they were slaughtered because of me , not because of anything they did .
may god give their souls rest .
let this anger sharpen your sword .
transform your grief into anger .
i could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how i will avenge them !
but gentle heavens , don ’ t keep me waiting .
bring me face to face with macbeth , that devil of scotland .
now you sound like a man .
come on , let ’ s go see king edward .
macbeth is ripe for the picking .
cheer up as much as you can .
when was the last time you saw her sleepwalking ?
when she is like this , besides walking and performing various activities , have you heard her say anything ?
she says something , sir , but i will not repeat it to you .
look , here she comes !
this is exactly how she always looks , and—i swear it—she is fast asleep .
how did she get that candle ?
it stands by her bedside .
she always has to have a light next to her .
you see , her eyes are open .
yes , but they don ’ t see anything .
what ’ s she doing now ?
look how she rubs her hands .
she looks like she ’ s washing her hands .
there ’ s still a spot here .
i ’ ll write down what she says , so i ’ ll remember it better .
the thane of fife had a wife .
you ’ ve heard something you shouldn ’ t have .
she said something she shouldn ’ t have said , i ’ m sure of that .
heaven knows what secrets she ’ s keeping .
i still have the smell of blood on my hand .
all the perfumes of arabia couldn ’ t make my little hand smell better .
oh , oh , oh !
her heart is carrying a heavy weight .
i wouldn ’ t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen .
well , well , well .
i hope what she ’ s saying is well , sir !
this disease is beyond my medical skills .
but i have known people who sleepwalked and weren ’ t guilty of anything .
to bed , to bed !
there ’ s a knocking at the gate .
will she go to bed now ?
unnatural acts will cause good night , good doctor .
the english army is near , led by malcolm , his uncle siward , and the good macduff .
does anyone know if donalbain is with his brother ?
he is definitely not there , sir .
i have a list of all the important men .
what is the tyrant macbeth doing ?
he is fortifying his castle at dunsinane with heavy defenses .
one thing is certain : he ’ s out of control .
who can blame him for acting crazy , when inside he condemns himself for everything he ’ s done ?
let ’ s proceed on our march to birnam .
messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country .
the king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him .
why are you giving me his title ?
don ’ t bring me any more reports .
until birnam wood gets up and moves to dunsinane , i won ’ t be affected by fear .
what ’ s the boy malcolm ?
wasn ’ t he born from a woman ?
the spirits that know the future have told me this : “ don ’ t be afraid , macbeth .
my mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear .
may the devil turn you black , you white-faced fool !
why do you look like a frightened goose ?
there are ten thousand— geese , you idiot ?
go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face , you cowardly boy .
that pale face of yours will frighten the others as well .
the english army , sir .
get out of my sight .
i have lived long enough .
all the rumors have been confirmed .
i ’ ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones .
you don ’ t need it yet .
i ’ ll put it on anyway .
for that kind of relief , the patient must heal herself .
medicine is for the dogs .
i won ’ t have anything to do with it .
yes , my good lord .
your preparation for war sounds like something .
kinsmen , i hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms .
we don ’ t doubt it .
what ’ s the name of this forest behind us ?
tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him .
we ’ ll do it .
we shouldn ’ t make any judgments until we achieve our goal .
hang our flags on the outer walls .
they can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease .
what ’ s that noise ?
it ’ s women crying , my good lord .
i ’ ve almost forgotten what fear feels like .
what was that cry for ?
the queen is dead , my lord .
she would have died later anyway .
tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
out , out , brief candle .
life is a story told by an idiot , full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning .
punish me if it ’ s not true .
three miles from here you can see it coming , a moving forest .
if what you say is true , you can do the same to me .
we ’ re close enough now .
if we meet macbeth ’ s army tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .
they have me tied to a stake .
i can ’ t run away .
you ’ ll be afraid to hear it .
no i won ’ t , even if you were one of the worst demons in hell .
my name ’ s macbeth .
the devil himself couldn ’ t say a name i hate more .
no , nor could the devil ’ s name be more frightening .
you lie , you disgusting tyrant .
i ’ ll prove with my sword that i ’ m not scared of you .
you were born from a woman .
swords don ’ t frighten me .
i laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman .
but this whole thing is strange .
the noise is coming from over there .
tyrant , show your face !
i ’ ll either fight you , macbeth , or else i ’ ll put down my sword unused .
you must be over there .
come this way , my lord .
our noblemen are battling bravely .
sir , enter the castle .
turn around , you dog from hell , turn around !
i have nothing to say to you .
my sword will talk for me .
you are too evil for words !
you might as well try to stab the air with your sword .
i lead a charmed life , which can ’ t be ended by anyone born from a woman .
i won ’ t fight you .
i ’ ll put up my shield and battle you .
macduff is missing , and so is your noble son .
my lord , your son has paid the soldier ’ s price : death .
so he ’ s dead ?
yes , and he ’ s been carried off the field .
your grief should not be equal to his worth , because then your sorrow would never end .
were his wounds on his front side ?
yes , on his front .
well then , he ’ s god ’ s soldier now !
and that ’ s all there is to it .
he is worth more mourning than that , and i will mourn for him .
he is worth no more than that .
they tell me he died well , and settled his scores .
with that , i hope god is with him !
because that ’ s what you are now .
look , here i have macbeth ’ s cursed head .
we are free from his tyranny .
hail , king of scotland !
my thanes and kinsmen , i name you all earls , the first earls that scotland has ever had .
look at macbeth—he ’ s in a daze .
good macbeth , we ’ re ready when you are .
let ’ s go to the king .
until then , we ’ ve said enough .
my king , they haven ’ t come back yet .
he never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died .
there ’ s no way to read a man ’ s mind by looking at his face .
with that , i ’ ll be off .
when should the three of us meet again ?
will it be in thunder , lightning , or rain ?
that will happen before sunset .
we ’ ll meet macbeth there .
when i tried desperately to question them further , they vanished into thin air .
what news do you bring ?
the king is coming here tonight .
you must be crazy to say that !
take good care of him .
my dearest love , duncan is coming here tonight .
and when is he leaving ?
he plans to leave tomorrow .
that day will never come .
greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes , your hands , and your words .
you should look like an innocent flower , but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower .
we will speak about this further .
leave all the rest to me .
this castle is in a pleasant place .
the air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses .
i ’ ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest .
look , here comes our honored hostess !
sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient , but i still accept it as love .
fair and noble hostess , we are your guests tonight .
bring me to my host , macbeth .
i love him dearly , and i shall continue to favor him .
whenever you ’ re ready , hostess .
what news do you have ?
he has almost finished dinner .
why did you leave the dining room ?
has he asked for me ?
don ’ t you know he has ?
we can ’ t go on with this plan .
the king has just honored me , and i have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people .
were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before ?
from now on this is what i ’ ll think of your love .
are you afraid to act the way you desire ?
you ’ re like the poor cat in the old story .
and whatever we do , we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants .
go now , and pretend to be a friendly hostess .
hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false , evil heart .
how ’ s the night going , boy ?
the clock hasn ’ t struck yet .
the moon sets at twelve , right ?
i think it ’ s later than that , sir .
here , take my sword .
the heavens are being stingy with their light .
i ’ m tired and feeling heavy , but i can ’ t sleep .
merciful powers , keep away the nightmares that plague me when i rest !
you ’ re not asleep yet , sir ?
the king ’ s in bed .
he ’ s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants .
this diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality .
who is this bloody man ?
judging from his appearance , i bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt .
this is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured .
tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it .
i had a dream last night about the three witches .
i don ’ t think about them now .
if you stick with me , when the time comes , there will be something in it for you .
rest easy in the meantime .
is this a dagger i see in front of me , with its handle pointing toward my hand ?
i ’ m going now .
the alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold .
the same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up .
i have done the deed .
did you hear a noise ?
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
didn ’ t you say something ?
who ’ s sleeping in the second chamber ?
that ’ s a stupid thing to say .
but why couldn ’ t i say “ amen ” ?
i desperately needed god ’ s blessing , but the word “ amen ” stuck in my throat .
we can ’ t think that way about what we did .
if we do , it ’ ll drive us crazy .
i thought i heard a voice cry , “ sleep no more !
what are you talking about ?
the voice kept crying , “ sleep no more ! ” to everyone in the house .
go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands .
why did you carry these daggers out of the room ?
they have to stay there .
go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood .
only children are afraid of scary pictures .
if duncan bleeds i ’ ll paint the servants ' faces with his blood .
where is that knocking coming from ?
what ’ s happening to me , that i ’ m frightened of every noise ?
i hear someone knocking at the south entry .
let ’ s go back to our bedroom .
a little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt .
it ’ s so simple !
you ’ ve lost your resolve .
there ’ s more knocking .
put on your nightgown , in case someone comes and sees that we ’ re awake .
snap out of your daze .
wake duncan with your knocking .
knock , knock , knock !
who ’ s there , in the other devil ’ s name ?
come on in , con man .
knock , knock , knock !
maybe it ’ s an english tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people ’ s clothes .
come on in , tailor .
you can heat your iron up in here .
never a moment of peace !
ah , this place is too cold to be hell .
i won ’ t pretend to be the devil ’ s porter anymore .
i ’ m coming , i ’ m coming !
please , don ’ t forget to leave me a tip .
what three things does drink make a man do ?
it sets you up for a fall .
it persuades you and discourages you .
i believe drink did all of this to you last night .
our knocking woke him up .
good morning , noble sir .
good morning to both of you .
is the king awake , worthy thane ?
he commanded me to wake him up early .
i ’ ve almost missed the time he requested .
i ’ ll bring you to him .
the work we enjoy is not really work .
i ’ ll wake him , because that ’ s my job .
is the king leaving here today ?
he told us to arrange it .
the night has been chaotic .
the wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping .
the owl made noise all night .
some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever .
it was a rough night .
i ’ m too young to remember anything like it .
oh , horror , horror , horror !
this is beyond words and beyond belief !
what ’ s the matter ?
the worst thing imaginable has happened .
do you mean the king ?
didn ’ t this frighten our captains , macbeth and banquo ?
the new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles , or rabbits frighten a lion .
your words , like your wounds , bring you honor .
take him to the surgeons .
he looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .
go into the bedroom and see for yourself .
don ’ t ask me to talk about it .
go look and then do the talking yourselves .
wake up , wake up !
banquo and donalbain , malcolm !
shake off sleep , which looks like death , and look at death itself !
get up , get up , and look at this image of doomsday !
speak up and tell me !
if i repeated it to you , it would kill you as soon as you heard it .
oh banquo , banquo , the king has been murdered !
what , in our own house ?
dear macduff , i beg you , tell us you were lying and say it isn ’ t so .
if i had only died an hour before this event i could say i had lived a blessed life .
everything is a sick joke .
the graceful and renowned king is dead .
the wine of life has been poured out , and only the dregs remain .
you are , but you don ’ t know it yet .
the source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped .
your royal father is murdered .
it seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it .
their hands and faces were all covered with blood .
so were their daggers , which we found on their pillows , unwiped .
they stared at us in confusion .
no one ’ s life should have been entrusted to them .
and yet i still regret the anger that drove me to kill them .
what did you do that for ?
who could have restrained himself , who loved duncan and had the courage to act on it ?
help me out of here , quickly !
take care of the lady .
right now we ’ re shaken up by fears and doubts .
let ’ s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall .
what are you going to do ?
let ’ s not stay here with them .
it ’ s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none .
i ’ m going to england .
i ’ ll go to ireland .
we ’ ll both be safer if we go separate ways .
wherever we go , men will smile at us while hiding daggers .
our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us .
we haven ’ t yet encountered that danger , and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely .
there ’ s good reason to escape when there ’ s no mercy to be found anymore .
the clock says it ’ s daytime , but dark night is strangling the sun .
they say the horses ate each other .
i saw it with my own eyes .
here comes the good macduff .
how are things going now ?
can ’ t you see for yourself ?
they were paid to betray their master .
everything about this is unnatural !
then it looks like macbeth will become king .
he has already been named king and has left for scone to be crowned .
where is duncan ’ s body ?
are you going to scone ?
no , cousin , i ’ m going to fife .
well , i ’ ll go to scone .
i hope things go well there .
if the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too .
i ’ ll shut up now .
whatever your highness commands me to do , it is always my duty to do it .
are you going riding this afternoon ?
yes , my good lord .
i ’ m going far enough that i ’ ll be riding from now until dinner .
unless my horse goes faster than expected , i will be back an hour or two after sunset .
don ’ t miss our feast .
my lord , i won ’ t miss it .
hurry up and get to your horse .
good-bye , until you return tonight .
is fleance going with you ?
yes , my good lord .
it ’ s time we hit the road .
everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight .
until then , god be with you !
i ’ m very afraid of banquo .
he has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely .
i ’ m not afraid of anyone but him .
then , like prophets , they named him the father to a line of kings .
so now sweno , the norwegian king , wants a treaty .
i ’ ll get it done right away .
the thane of cawdor has lost what the noble macbeth has won .
now go to the door and stay there until i call for you .
wasn ’ t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other ?
it was yesterday , your highness .
well , did you think about what i said ?
i did that and more , which brings me to the point of this second meeting .
are you so patient and forgiving that you ’ re going to let him off the hook ?
we are men , my lord .
it ’ s the same with men .
you both know banquo was your enemy .
it ’ s true , my lord .
we ’ ll do what you want us to , my lord .
though our lives— we have decided , my lord .
i ’ ll call for you soon .
banquo , if your soul is going to make it to heaven , tonight ’ s the night .
has banquo left the court ?
yes , madam , but he ’ ll be back tonight .
go tell the king i want to talk to him for a few minutes .
what ’ s going on , my lord ?
what ’ s done is done .
we have slashed the snake but not killed it .
we killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace .
after that , nothing can hurt him further—not weapons , poison , rebellion , invasion , or anything else .
come on , relax , dear .
you have to stop talking like this .
you know that banquo and his son fleance are still alive .
what are you going to do ?
so i guess it ’ s you , you silver treasure house .
tell me once more what you say .
no one should have an honor he doesn ’ t deserve .
how many people who are humble now would be great then ?
how many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants ?
well , let me get back to my choice .
you thought about it too long , considering what you found there .
i ’ ll read it.—it looks so unlike portia !
the one who chooses me will get what he deserves ” !
didn ’ t i deserve anything more than a fool ’ s head ?
don ’ t i deserve more than this ?
this box was tested in the fire seven times .
they only feel the shadow of joy .
this choice was as foolish as they are .
i ’ ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger .
this is how the candle burned the moth .
when they choose , they only know how to lose .
you know what they say .
destiny chooses when you ’ ll die and who you ’ ll marry .
come on , close the curtain , nerissa .
where ’ s lady portia ?
how can i help you , sir ?
i haven ’ t seen such a promising candidate for your love .
please don ’ t tell me any more .
come on , nerissa , i want to go see this man who ’ s come so courteously .
so , what ’ s the news on the rialto ?
well , the point is , he ’ s lost a ship .
i hope that ’ s all he loses .
how ’ s it going , shylock ?
what ’ s the news among the merchants ?
i even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off .
she ’ ll be damned for it .
that ’ s true—if the devil ’ s judging her .
my own flesh and blood turned against me !
your i mean my daughter is my flesh and blood .
but tell us , did you hear anything about antonio ’ s loss at sea ?
all right , we ’ ll see you at dinnertime .
gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in venice .
you promised to tell me .
let him think about his own debt .
he liked to call me a loan shark ; let him think about his debt to me .
but you won ’ t take his flesh if he can ’ t pay .
what ’ s that good for ?
i ’ ll use it for fish bait .
because i ’ m a jew .
doesn ’ t a jew have eyes ?
if you prick us with a pin , don ’ t we bleed ?
if you tickle us , don ’ t we laugh ?
if you poison us , don ’ t we die ?
and if you treat us badly , won ’ t we try to get revenge ?
if we ’ re like you in everything else , we ’ ll resemble you in that respect .
if a jew offends a christian , what ’ s the christian ’ s kind and gentle reaction ?
we ’ ve been looking for him everywhere .
you couldn ’ t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a jew .
did you find my daughter ?
i went to many places where i heard news about her , but i couldn ’ t find her .
oh , oh , oh !
i never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond , and other precious , precious jewels !
i wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels !
i wish she were in her coffin here , with the ducats in her coffin !
you couldn ’ t find out anything about them ?
i don ’ t even know how much i ’ m spending to find them .
well , other men have bad luck too .
antonio , as i heard in genoa— what , what , what ?
bad luck , bad luck ?
he ’ s had a ship wrecked coming from tripolis .
thank god , thank god !
is it true , is it true ?
i spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck .
good news , good news !
ha , ha , heard in genoa .
i also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in genoa one night .
oh , you ’ re sticking a dagger in me !
i ’ ll never see my gold again .
eighty ducats in one shot !
i ’ m very glad about that .
i ’ ll hound him .
i ’ ll torture him .
i ’ m very glad .
one creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey .
you ’ re torturing me , tubal .
that was my turquoise ring !
leah gave it to me before we were married .
i wouldn ’ t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys .
but antonio ’ s certainly ruined .
that ’ s true , that ’ s very true .
with him out of venice , i can make whatever bargains i want when i lend money.—go , tubal .
meet me at the synagogue .
i feel tortured by all this talking .
they ’ re as opposite as hot and cold .
promise me you ’ ll let me live , and i ’ ll confess the truth .
all right then , confess and live .
confess and love ” is more like it .
but let me try my luck on the boxes .
i ’ m locked in one of them .
play some music while he chooses .
then if he loses , it ’ ll be his swan song , music before the end .
what music should we play then ?
we ’ ve all come out to see what will happen.—go , hercules !
if you survive , i ’ ll live .
i ’ m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself .
ding , dong , bell .
how many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like hercules or mars , the god of war ?
curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful .
my lady , with your permission , this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss .
you see me standing here , lord bassanio .
i ’ m even happier that i ’ m not stupid , and i can learn .
everything i am and everything i have now belongs to you .
but as of right this second all these things are yours .
with this ring i give them all to you .
please let me know your plan , bassanio .
by risking the second arrow , i ’ d often get both of them back .
i ’ m telling you this story for a reason .
i owe you a lot , and like a spoiled kid i ’ ve lost what i owe you .
just tell me what to do , and i ’ ll do it .
if you see me without it , you can be confident i ’ m dead .
and when you get married , i hope i can be married at the same time .
absolutely , if you can find a wife by then .
i think i ’ ve found one already , thanks to you , my lord .
and do you mean what you ’ re saying , gratiano ?
hey , if i lay down my “ welcome , lorenzo and salerio .
i do too , my lord .
they ’ re entirely welcome .
that ’ s true , and with good reason .
this letter is for you from signor antonio .
before i open this letter , please tell me how my good friend is doing .
his letter will tell you how he ’ s doing .
i wish you ’ d won the something bad in that letter is making bassanio turn pale .
oh portia , these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper .
when i said that , i told you the truth .
have all his business ventures failed ?
not one , my lord .
anyway , even if he had the money now , the jew probably wouldn ’ t take it .
i ’ ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man .
and i know that unless the law intervenes , it ’ ll be bad news for poor antonio .
is this your good friend who ’ s in so much trouble ?
how much does he owe the jew ?
what , that ’ s all ?
pay him six thousand and cancel the debt .
i ’ ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over .
when it ’ s paid , bring your friend back .
until you get back , nerissa and i will live like virgins and widows .
put on a happy face , and welcome your friends .
but let me hear the letter from your friend .
dear bassanio , my ships have all been wrecked .
my creditors are getting mean .
my money ’ s almost run out .
i couldn ’ t pay my debt to the jew on the due date .
in any case , do what you want .
since you ’ re letting me leave , i ’ ll hurry .
but i won ’ t sleep till i get back .
jailer , watch out for this one .
this is the fool who lent out money without charging interest .
jailer , keep an eye on him .
listen to me , good shylock .
i ’ m going to get my please , listen to me .
i won ’ t listen to you .
i want my bond , so stop talking .
i won ’ t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to christian meddlers .
don ’ t follow me .
i ’ m not talking with you .
he ’ s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans .
i won ’ t follow him around with useless pleas anymore .
i know the real reason .
i ’ ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him .
that ’ s why he hates me .
i ’ m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced .
lorenzo , please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back .
madam , with all my heart .
i ’ ll do anything you ask .
they ’ ll consider you and jessica masters of this house in place of lord bassanio and myself .
so goodbye until we meet again .
sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me .
i ’ ll meet you at the ferry .
i ’ ll go as fast as i can , madam .
we ’ ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us .
they will , nerissa , but we ’ ll be disguised as men .
i know a thousand immature tricks like that , and i ’ ll use them all .
why , are we turning to men ?
what kind of question is that !
so hurry up , because we have twenty miles to cover today .
yes , look , it ’ s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers .
that ’ s why i ’ m worried about you .
i ’ ve always been straightforward with you , so now i ’ m telling you what i think .
cheer up , because i think you ’ re going to hell .
there ’ s only one hope for you , and even that ’ s a kind of illegitimate hope .
what hope is that , may i ask ?
you can hope your father isn ’ t your real father .
that really is an illegitimate hope .
then i ’ d be punished for the sins of my mother .
in that case i ’ m afraid you ’ re damned by both your father and your mother .
when you avoid one trap , you fall into another .
you ’ re in trouble either way .
my husband will save me .
he ’ s made me a christian .
he was wrong to do that .
there were enough christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other .
all these new christians will make the price of hogs go up .
i ’ ll tell my husband what you ’ ve said , launcelot .
no , you don ’ t need to worry about us , lorenzo .
launcelot and i can ’ t agree on anything .
i can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with portia ’ s african servant .
the it ’ s too bad there ’ s more of the moor than there ought to be .
that ’ s already been done , sir .
they ’ re all ready to eat dinner .
good lord , what a clown you are !
are you planning on showing me all your wit at once ?
about the table , sir , dinner will be served on it .
as for the food , it will be served in covered dishes .
as for your coming in to dinner , just do what you feel is right .
oh , he ’ s good at bending words around !
anyway , how are you , jessica ?
and how do you like lord bassanio ’ s wife ?
i like her more than i can say .
the poor rude world doesn ’ t have her equal .
as good a wife as she is , that ’ s how good a husband i am to you .
first let ’ s go to dinner .
no , let me say some good things about you while i ’ m in the mood .
no , please , save it for dinner conversation .
yes , sir , i ’ m here .
i feel sorry for you .
i ’ m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger .
one of you go call the jew into court here .
he ’ s standing ready outside the door .
here he comes , my lord .
we all expect a nice answer from you , jew .
i won ’ t answer that .
is that enough of an answer ?
do you have your answer yet ?
so , to answer your question .
it doesn ’ t excuse your cruel behavior .
i don ’ t have to give you answers that you like .
does everyone kill what they don ’ t love ?
what , would you let a snake bite you twice ?
you might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his jewish heart .
i would choose to take my penalty .
how can you ever hope for mercy for yourself , when you don ’ t give any now ?
why should i be afraid of your judgment when i haven ’ t done anything wrong ?
should i say to you , “ set them free !
let them marry your children !
why are you making them work so hard ?
let their beds be as soft as yours , and let them eat the same food as you ” ?
the pound of flesh that i want from him was very expensive .
it ’ s mine and i ’ m going to get it .
if you refuse me , the laws of venice have no validity .
oh nerissa , my poor little body is tired of this great big world .
but as far as i can tell , people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing .
the best way to be happy is to be in between .
good point , and well said .
it would be better if you actually applied it to your life .
it takes a good priest to practice what he preaches .
but thinking like this won ’ t help me choose a husband .
isn ’ t it a pain that i can ’ t choose or refuse anyone , nerissa ?
i have the authority to dismiss this court , unless bellario comes today .
keep up your courage , man !
i ’ m like the one sick sheep in the flock , the one who deserves to die .
the weakest fruit drops to the ground first , so let me drop .
bassanio , the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone .
have you come from bellario ’ s office in padua ?
to cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there .
you ’ re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul , you cruel jew .
no metal—not even the executioner ’ s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred .
can ’ t any prayers reach your heart ?
no , none that you ’ re smart enough to make .
you make me want to agree with the philosopher pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies .
that ’ s why your desires are wolfish , bloody , and ravenous .
be quiet , boy , or you ’ ll lose your mind .
i stand here with the law on my side .
this letter from bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert .
he ’ s waiting nearby to find out if you ’ ll invite him in .
i leave him to you .
did old bellario send you here ?
are you familiar with the case currently before the court ?
antonio and shylock , both of you come forward .
do you acknowledge the contract ?
then the jew must show you mercy .
why do i have to do that ?
no one shows mercy because he has to .
it just happens , the way gentle rain drops on the ground .
it blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it .
it ’ s strongest in the strongest people .
it looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him .
kingly power seems most like god ’ s power when the king mixes mercy with justice .
i take all responsibility for my decisions .
i want the law , the penalty , and the fulfillment of my contract .
can ’ t he pay back the money ?
there ’ s no power in venice that can change an established decree .
the change will be recorded as a precedent , and many bad legal decisions will result .
that can ’ t happen .
please , let me review the contract .
shylock , they ’ re offering you three times the money you lent .
but i made an oath , an oath , an oath in heaven .
should i perjure my soul by disobeying it ?
no , not for all of venice .
take three times your money .
tell me to tear up this contract .
i ’ ll tear it up when it ’ s paid .
you seem like a good judge .
i urge you to deliver your verdict .
i swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind .
i ’ m sticking to the contract .
i beg the court to deliver the verdict .
well , then , here it is : you must prepare yourself for his knife .
oh , you excellent young man !
the law fully authorizes the penalty , which you have to pay according to the contract .
you ’ re so much older than you look !
nearest his heart. ” —those are the very words .
is there a scale here to weigh the flesh ?
is that called for in the contract ?
not explicitly , but so what ?
it wouldn ’ t hurt you to be charitable .
i can ’ t find it .
it ’ s not in the contract .
i ’ m ready and waiting.—give me your hand , bassanio .
if the jew cuts deep enough , i ’ ll pay it instantly with all my heart .
antonio , i married a woman as dear to me as life itself .
your wife wouldn ’ t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer .
i have a wife i love .
it ’ s nice you ’ re offering to sacrifice her behind her back .
that ’ s what you get for marrying christian husbands .
the court awards it and the law authorizes it .
and you have to cut this flesh from his chest .
the law allows it , and the court awards it .
come on , get ready .
there ’ s something else .
this contract doesn ’ t give you any blood at all .
you can see for yourself .
you asked for justice , so rest assured you ’ ll get more justice than you bargained for .
pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the christian go .
the jew will have justice .
wait , don ’ t rush !
he ’ s not getting anything except the penalty .
so get ready to cut off the flesh .
don ’ t shed any blood , or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh .
a second daniel ! —a daniel , jew !
i ’ ve got you now , pagan .
why is the jew waiting ?
give me my money and let me go .
i have it ready for you .
your father was an extremely moral man , and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds .
well , first there was the prince from naples .
i ’ m afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith .
then there ’ s the count palatine .
god protect me from these two !
what did you think about that french lord , monsieur le bon ?
no , he refused it publicly , in open court .
he will have only justice and his penalty .
you can ’ t have anything but the penalty , to be taken at your peril , jew .
well , then , i hope he chokes on it !
i ’ m not staying here to argue anymore .
wait a minute , jew .
the law has another hold on you .
the other half goes to the state .
so get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke .
so you ’ ll be hanged at the state ’ s expense .
half of your wealth goes to antonio .
the other half goes to the state .
yes , the state ’ s half can be reduced , but not antonio ’ s .
no , go ahead and take my life .
don ’ t pardon that .
you take my house away when you take the money i need for upkeep .
you take my life when you take away my means of making a living .
what mercy can you show him , antonio ?
nothing else , for god ’ s sake !
he must do this , or i ’ ll recant the pardon i just delivered .
are you satisfied , jew ?
i ’ m not well .
send the deed after me and i ’ ll sign it .
go , but sign the deed .
i should really leave right away .
i ’ m sorry you don ’ t have time.—antonio , give this gentleman a reward .
we owe you love and service forever .
being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough .
in saving you i consider myself well paid .
my thoughts were never on money .
i hope you ’ ll recognize me when we meet again .
take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude , not as a fee .
this ring , sir—oh no , it ’ s nothing .
i ’ d be ashamed to give you this .
i don ’ t want anything but that .
now that i think about it , i really want it .
there ’ s more to this ring than its cash value .
but as for this ring , please excuse me .
i see you like to make big offers , sir .
good sir , this ring was given to me by my wife .
many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts .
well , anyway , goodbye .
bassanio , let him have the ring .
come on , you and i will go soon .
early in the morning we ’ ll both rush to belmont .
find out where the jew ’ s house is .
give him this deed and have him sign it .
we ’ ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back .
lorenzo will be happy with what we ’ ve done .
and could you please take my servant to old shylock ’ s house ?
i ’ ll do that .
you know where i ’ ll be waiting .
the moon ’ s bright tonight .
who are you , coming so fast in this quiet night ?
what ’ s your name , please , friend ?
she ’ s still at the monastery , kneeling and praying for a happy marriage .
who ’ s coming with her ?
no one except her maid and a holy hermit .
has my master returned yet ?
have you seen master lorenzo !
tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news .
my master will be here in the morning .
my dear , let ’ s go inside and wait for them to arrive .
but i guess it doesn ’ t matter .
we might as well call him a man , since god created him .
his horse is better than the neapolitan ’ s and he frowns more than the count palatine .
what about falconbridge , that young english baron ?
i have no opinion about him .
he ’ s great-looking , but how can you talk to someone who doesn ’ t speak your language ?
he was dressed so oddly too !
what do you think of his neighbor , the scottish lord ?
how beautiful the moonlight ’ s shining on this bank !
let ’ s sit here and let the music fill our ears .
stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music .
look at the stars , see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold .
wake up the moon goddess with a hymn !
get her attention and draw her home with music .
i ’ m never in the mood to laugh when i hear sweet music .
his soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld .
nobody like that should be trusted .
pay attention to the music .
that light we see is coming from my hall .
look how far that little candle sends its light !
that ’ s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world .
while the moon was shining we didn ’ t even notice the candle .
well , brighter lights always dim the smaller ones .
it ’ s your music , madam , from your house .
now i see that you can ’ t call anything good except in right context .
how many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen !
look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can ’ t be awoken !
if i ’ m not mistaken , that ’ s portia ’ s voice .
he recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice .
dear lady , welcome home .
we ’ ve been praying for our husbands ' welfare .
tell my servants not to mention that we were gone .
i think this night is just like sick daylight .
it only looks a little paler .
it looks like a day when the sun is hidden .
i ’ ll give thank you , darling .
i ’ d like to introduce you to my friend .
this is antonio , my dearest friend .
sir , welcome to our house .
but action speaks louder than words , so i ’ ll cut short these polite words .
what , an argument already ?
what ’ s the matter ?
and now you claim you gave it to a judge ’ s clerk !
he will if he lives long enough to become a man .
yes , if a woman grows up to be a man .
i didn ’ t have the heart to say no to him .
i gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away .
to tell the truth , gratiano , you ’ re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset .
if it were me , i ’ d be very upset too .
bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it , and deserved it too .
and then his clerk , who went to a lot of trouble with the writing , begged for mine .
neither of them would take anything but the two rings .
which ring did you give away , my lord ?
not the one i gave you , i hope .
if i could make things better by lying , i ’ d deny it .
but you see my finger doesn ’ t have the ring on it .
nerissa ’ s got the right idea .
i ’ ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring !
what could i say , my dear ?
i had to send it to him .
don ’ t let that lawyer ever come near my house !
i ’ ll recognize him all right , i ’ m sure of it .
so don ’ t spend one night away from this house .
watch me like a hawk .
all these quarrels are about me .
don ’ t be upset .
he sees himself in my two eyes , so there ’ s two of him .
he should swear by his two-faced self , and that ’ s an oath i ’ ll believe !
no , just listen to me .
if you forgive my mistake , i swear i ’ ll never break an oath with you again .
i lent my body once to make him rich .
my god , it ’ s the same one i gave the judge !
i got it from him .
what , did you cheat on us before we deserved it ?
don ’ t be crass.—you all look confused .
yes , but the clerk will never do it , unless he grows up to be a man .
madam , you ’ ve given me life and given me a living too .
how did you like the young german , the duke of saxony ’ s nephew ?
i ’ ll do anything rather than marry a drunk , nerissa .
you don ’ t have to worry about any of these lords , my lady .
i wish them all safe trips home .
how are you , lorenzo ?
my clerk has some comforting news for you , too .
yes , and i ’ ll give it to him for free .
ladies , you ’ re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people .
let ’ s go inside and we ’ ll answer all your questions truthfully .
yes , madam , that ’ s the one .
he deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men i ’ ve ever seen .
i remember him well , and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise .
hello , do you have any news ?
the four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye , madam .
let ’ s go , nerissa.—
three thousand ducats , hmmm .
yes , for three months .
for three months , hmmm .
as i said before , antonio will guarantee the loan .
if i default , he ’ ll pay you .
antonio will guarantee it , hmmm .
what ’ s your answer ?
three thousand ducats for three months , and antonio will guarantee it .
antonio ’ s a good man .
have you heard anything to the contrary ?
but his investments are uncertain right now .
he has one ship bound for tripoli , another heading for the indies .
what ’ s more , people at the
but ships are just fragile boards , and sailors are just men .
there are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms , winds , and rocks .
but in spite of all this , the man is still wealthy enough .
i assure you he can .
oh yes—to smell this is signor antonio .
to be honest , i don ’ t know why i ’ m so sad .
i ’ m tired of it , and you say you ’ re tired of it too .
i ’ d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports , piers , and waterways .
everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad .
shylock , are you listening ?
if i remember correctly , i can ’ t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately .
tubal , a wealthy jew i know , will supply me with the cash .
how many months do you want ?
oh yes , three thousand ducats .
yes , i forgot—three months .
that ’ s not how i do business .
jacob didn ’ t have any control over what happened .
that your interest payments are like jacob ’ s sheep ?
but listen to me , signor—
an evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you .
oh , liars can look so honest !
three months from twelve months of the year .
the interest rate will be— well , shylock ?
signor antonio , you ’ ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the rialto .
and all because i use my own money to make a profit .
and now it looks like you need my help .
and now you ’ re asking for money .
what can i tell you ?
shouldn ’ t i say , “ does a dog have money ?
instead , lend it to me as your enemy .
look at you getting all riled up !
i ’ m making a kind offer—zero percent financing .
that really would be kind .
i ’ ll show you how kind i am .
it ’ s a deal .
i ’ ll agree to those terms and even say that jews are nice .
no , you can ’ t sign a contract like that for me !
i ’ d rather go without the money .
a pound of human flesh taken isn ’ t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef .
if he agrees , great .
and i hope you won ’ t think badly of me .
yes , shylock , i ’ ll sign the contract and agree to its terms .
then meet me right away at the notary ’ s .
hurry up , my jewish friend .
my ships will come home a month before the money is due .
i wouldn ’ t change it except to make you think of me , my darling queen .
thank you for saying that .
show me the caskets and let me try my luck .
let me take my chances .
let ’ s go to the temple first .
you can take your chances after dinner .
i ’ m sure i ’ ll feel guilty if i run away from this jew , my master .
anyway , my conscience says , “ stay put. ” “ go , ” the devil says .
don ’ t go , ” says my conscience .
the devil ’ s advice is nicer .
i ’ ll run , devil .
tell me to run , and i ’ ll run .
excuse me , young man , how do i get to the jew ’ s residence ?
young man , excuse me , how do i get to the jew ’ s ?
turn right at the next turn , but at the following turn , turn left .
good heavens , those are difficult directions .
can you tell me if a man named launcelot , who lives with him , is still there ?
are you talking about young master launcelot ?
he ’ s just launcelot .
who wouldn ’ t get sad thinking about things like that ?
no , that ’ s not it , trust me .
so it ’ s not my business that ’ s making me sad .
well then , you must be in love .
you ’ re not in love either ?
but excuse me , yes , i ’ m talking about launcelot , sir .
the boy was going to support me in my old age !
what am i , a cane ?
don ’ t you recognize me , father ?
heaven help me , i don ’ t know you , sir .
but please tell me , is my boy—god rest his soul—alive or dead ?
you really don ’ t recognize me , father ?
sir , i ’ m half-blind .
i don ’ t know you .
even if you had your eyes , you still might not recognize me .
it takes a wise father to know his own child .
well , old man , i ’ ll tell you news of your son .
i ’ m sure you aren ’ t launcelot , my boy .
i ’ m launcelot , who was your boy , is your son , and will be your child .
i can ’ t believe you ’ re my son .
yes , you ’ re right , her name is margery .
if you ’ re launcelot , then you ’ re my own flesh and blood .
then dobbin ’ s tail must be growing backward .
lord , how you ’ ve changed !
how are you and your master getting along ?
i ’ ve brought him a present .
my master ’ s a total jew .
you ’ re giving him a present ?
give him a noose to hang himself .
he ’ s starving me to death .
you can see my ribs so well you can count them .
i ’ m glad you ’ ve come , father .
give me your present to give to master bassanio .
what do you want with me ?
to work for you , sir .
that ’ s what we ’ re trying to say , sir .
i know who you are .
you can have what you want .
bassanio please , leonardo , think about this i ’ ll do my best .
he ’ s walking over there , sir .
i have a favor to ask .
don ’ t say no .
let me go with you to belmont .
well , if you have to go , you have to go .
but listen to me , gratiano .
sometimes you get a bit too wild , and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude .
listen , signor bassanio , there ’ s nothing to worry about .
i ’ ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more .
if i don ’ t do all this , never trust me again .
well , we ’ ll see how you act .
okay , but tonight doesn ’ t count .
you can ’ t judge me based on what i do tonight .
i ’ d rather see you having fun , because we have friends coming who want to have fun .
anyway , i have to say goodbye to you now .
i ’ ve got some business to take care of .
i ’ m sorry you ’ re leaving my father like this .
it ’ s hell in our house , and you helped cheer it up , like a funny devil .
i ’ m sure some christian will resort to trickery to get you .
it ’ s not manly to cry .
oh god , what a heinous sinner i am , being ashamed to be my father ’ s child !
but i need to remember i ’ m related to him by blood , not behavior .
but we haven ’ t made any preparations .
we haven ’ t even talked about who ’ ll be our torchbearers .
i think it ’ s better to call it off .
it ’ s only four o'clock now .
we have two hours to get ready .
launcelot , what ’ s going on ?
i bet it ’ s a love letter !
to invite my former boss , the jew , to dine tonight with my new master , the christian .
meet me and gratiano at his house in about an hour .
it ’ s good we ’ re doing this .
wasn ’ t that letter from jessica ?
you ’ re both very precious to me .
you need to leave to take care of your own business .
bassanio , we ’ ll say goodbye for now , since you ’ ve found antonio .
don ’ t worry , i ’ ll be there .
i have to tell you everything .
who asked you to call her ?
i ’ m not asking you to call her .
you always loved to tell me i couldn ’ t do anything without being told .
i ’ ve been invited to supper , jessica .
here are my keys.—but why should i go ?
i wasn ’ t invited because they like me .
they ’ re just flattering me .
i don ’ t feel like going .
i know because i dreamed of money bags last night .
my new master is expecting your approach .
and i ’ m expecting his reproach .
and they ’ ve been plotting things together .
what , there ’ s going to be a masquerade ?
block up my house ’ s ears—i mean the windows .
i ’ ll go ahead of you , sir .
what did that gentile fool say to you , hmmm ?
he said “ goodbye , madam , ” and nothing else .
he sleeps all day like a cat .
anyway , jessica , go inside .
i might come back soon .
do as i told you .
shut the doors after you .
this is the roof under which lorenzo said to meet him .
yes , and that ’ s surprising , because lovers are usually early .
yes , for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who ’ ve been married forever .
that ’ s always true .
who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down ?
can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time ?
we chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it .
we ’ ll talk about this later .
my dear friends , thanks for your patience .
i had business that made me late .
who ’ s in there ?
tell me so i can be sure , though i swear i recognize your voice .
i ’ m lorenzo , your love .
and now who but you knows whether i ’ m yours ?
as god is my witness , you know you ’ re mine .
here , catch this box .
it ’ ll be worth your while .
you have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade .
what , i have to hold a candle up so people can see what i ’ m doing ?
i ’ ll lock up the doors , grab some more ducats , and be with you right away .
my god , she can ’ t be a jew , she ’ s too nice !
god , i ’ m crazy about her .
she ’ s wise , if i ’ m judging her right .
she ’ s beautiful , if my eyes can see .
and she ’ s loyal , as she has proven .
ah , you ’ re here ? —come on , gentlemen , let ’ s go !
our masquerade mates are waiting for us .
it ’ s nine o'clock !
our friends are all waiting for you .
there ’ s no masquerade tonight .
i ’ ve sent twenty people to look for you .
i want to head out tonight .
one of them contains my picture .
if you choose that one , i ’ m yours , along with the picture .
i wish some god could help me choose !
i ’ ll look over the inscriptions again .
what does the lead box say ?
he who chooses me must give and risk all he has. ” must give everything—for what ?
this box is too threatening .
men who risk everything hope to make profits .
a golden mind doesn ’ t bend down to choose something worthless .
so i won ’ t give or risk anything for lead .
what does the silver one say ?
what if i went no further and chose this one ?
the whole world wants her .
princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of arabia to come see the beautiful portia .
one of these three boxes contains her lovely picture .
could the lead one contain it ?
no , it ’ d be a sin to think such a low thought .
lead ’ s too crass to hold her .
is she enclosed in silver , which is ten times less valuable than gold ?
oh , what a sinful thought !
nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold .
you don ’ t look well , antonio .
people with too much invested in the world always get hurt .
i ’ d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun .
i ’ ll talk to you more about this some other time .
i ’ m a fool.—let ’ s go , lorenzo.—goodbye for now .
i ’ ll finish my lecture after dinner .
here an angel ’ s lying in a golden bed.—give me the key .
i will choose this one and try my chances .
it ’ s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket .
i ’ ll read it aloud .
all that glitters is not gold— you ’ ve often heard that said .
many men have sold their souls just to view my shiny surface .
but gilded tombs contain worms .
portia , goodbye to you .
my heart ’ s too sad for long goodbyes .
good riddance ! —close the curtains and leave.—i hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice .
i saw bassanio sail away , and gratiano went with him .
i ’ m sure lorenzo isn ’ t on their ship .
that wicked jew got the duke to listen to his complaints .
the duke went with him to search bassanio ’ s ship .
he got there too late .
the ship was already sailing .
in any case , antonio assured the duke they weren ’ t with bassanio on his ship .
i ’ ve never heard such confused emotions as what that jew dog was shouting in the streets .
ran off with a christian !
justice , find the girl !
i hope antonio repays his loan on time , or he ’ ll suffer for this .
that ’ s a good point .
you should tell antonio what you hear—but don ’ t do it suddenly , because it might upset him .
i saw bassanio and antonio say goodbye .
bassanio told him he ’ d try to hurry back .
as for the jew ’ s contract , don ’ t let it be a factor in your plans .
then he shook bassanio ’ s hand affectionately—and they separated .
i think he only loves life because of bassanio .
let ’ s go find him and cheer him up .
yes , let ’ s do that .
hurry , hurry , close the curtain quick .
the prince of arragon has taken his oath , and he ’ s coming to make his choice now .
look , here are the boxes , prince .
if you choose the one that contains my picture , we ’ ll be married right away .
but if you fail , you have to leave immediately .
everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules .
okay , i ’ m ready .
i hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for !
gold , silver , and common lead .
what does the golden box say ?
hmm , let me see :
we seemed to have two separate bodies , but we had one heart .
do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend ?
it ’ s not friendly , and it ’ s not ladylike .
i ’ m not insulting you .
it sounds more like you ’ re insulting me .
why does he talk like that to a girl he can ’ t stand ?
and why does lysander deny that he loves you , when he loves you so deeply ?
you should pity me for that reason , not hate me .
i don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about .
it ’ s partly my own fault , since i followed you here .
my love , my life , my soul , beautiful helena !
that ’ s a good one .
you can ’ t force me any more than hermia can beg me .
your threats are no stronger than her whining.—helena , i love you .
i say that i love you more than he does .
if that ’ s what you say , go fight a duel with me and prove it .
lysander , where are you going with all this ?
why have you gotten so rude ?
get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
get out , you horrible poison .
of course he is , and so are you .
demetrius , i ’ m ready to fight you as promised .
i wish we had a signed legal contract .
i don ’ t trust you .
sure , i hate her , but i wouldn ’ t hurt her .
i certainly did , and i never wanted to see you again .
so stop hoping and wondering what i mean .
i ’ ve spelled it out for you clearly .
oh , that ’ s very nice !
you ought to be ashamed of yourself !
why “ puppet ” ? —oh , i see where this is going .
so how short am i , you painted barber pole ?
good hermia , please don ’ t act so bitter toward me .
and i followed him because i loved him .
but he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me , kick me—even kill me .
you see how naïve and foolish i ’ ve been .
well , get out of here then !
what ’ s keeping you ?
my stupid heart , which i ’ m leaving behind here .
what , you ’ re leaving it with lysander ?
don ’ t be afraid .
she can ’ t hurt you , helena .
she was a hellcat in school .
and she ’ s fierce , even though she ’ s little .
let me at her ! .
how are you , my love ? —demetrius and egeus , come with us .
we ’ re following you not only because it is our duty , but also because we want to .
what ’ s going on , my love ?
why are you so pale ?
why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly ?
listen , in books they say that true love always faces obstacles .
either the lovers have different social standings—
don ’ t talk about helena .
don ’ t take helena ’ s side .
if you continue treating hermia so badly , you ’ ll pay for it .
hermia ’ s not holding onto me anymore .
follow me if you ’ re brave enough , and we ’ ll fight over helena .
no , i ’ ll walk right next to you , side by side .
all this fighting is because of you .
i don ’ t know what to say .
believe me , king of illusions , i made a mistake .
as you can see , these lovers are looking for a place to fight .
hurry up , robin , and make the night dark and cloudy .
we ’ ve got to act fast , my lord of the fairies .
but you should hurry anyway .
we still have time to get all of this done before daybreak .
up and down , up and down , i will lead them up and down .
the people fear me in the country and the town .
goblin , lead them up and down .
here comes one of them now .
where are you , demetrius , you arrogant bastard ?
you coward , did you run away from me ?
are you behind some bush ?
he ’ s walking ahead of me , and he keeps daring me to follow him .
when i reach the place he ’ s calling from , he disappears .
this villain is much quicker than i am .
i ’ ll rest here .
no , you ’ re just taunting me .
you ’ ll pay for this if i ever see you face-to-face in the daylight .
oh , what a long , tedious , exhausting night !
we ’ re still waiting for one more .
two of both kinds makes four .
ah , here she comes , angry and sad .
cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this .
i ’ ll sleep here until morning .
if they do fight , i hope lysander is safe !
sleep well there on the ground .
scratch my head , peaseblossom .
where ’ s monsieur cobweb ?
don ’ t tire yourself out , monsieur .
oh , and monsieur , be careful not to break the honey-sac .
i ’ d hate to see you drowned in honey , sir .
where ’ s monsieur mustardseed ?
give me your first , mr. mustardseed .
please , stop bowing , good sir .
what would you like me to do ?
nothing , good sir , except to help sir cobweb scratch my head .
would you like to hear some music , my sweet love ?
i have a pretty good ear for music .
let ’ s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks .
or tell me , my sweet love , what you ’ d like to eat .
actually , i ’ d like a few pounds of grass .
i ’ d like to munch on some good dry oats .
or maybe i ’ ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay .
there ’ s nothing like good hay , really sweet hay .
i ’ d rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
but please don ’ t let any of your people wake me up .
i really want to sleep now .
go to sleep , and i will wrap my arms around you .
oh , how i love you !
i ’ m so crazy about you !
do you see this sweet sight ?
now i ’ m starting to pity titania for being so infatuated .
but first i ’ ll release the fairy queen from the spell .
now , titania , wake up , my sweet queen .
there ’ s your boyfriend , sleeping right over there .
oh , i hate looking at his face now !
play the kind of music that puts people to sleep .
being too old to marry someone young .
that ’ s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed .
if true lovers are always thwarted , then it must be a rule of fate .
that ’ s the right attitude .
so , listen , hermia .
she lives about twenty miles from athens , and she thinks of me as a son .
so here ’ s the plan .
i can hear the lark singing .
one of you go find the forest ranger .
unleash the dogs in the western valley .
now go find the forest ranger .
i was with the heroes hercules and cadmus once , when their spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear .
i ’ d never heard such raucous music , such pleasant thunder .
i don ’ t understand why they ’ re all here together .
but tell me , egeus .
it is , my lord .
go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up .
good morning , my friends .
valentine ’ s day is over .
are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now ?
forgive us , my lord .
please , all of you , stand up .
i swear , at the moment i really couldn ’ t tell you how i ended up here .
now the only person i love , and believe in , and want to look at , is helena .
i was engaged to her before i ever met hermia .
you pretty lovers are lucky you met me here .
we ’ ll talk more about this later.—egeus , i ’ m overriding your wishes .
come with us to athens .
we three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .
are you sure we ’ re awake ?
it seems to me like we ’ re still sleeping , still dreaming .
and he told us to follow him to the temple .
well , then , we ’ re awake .
and i ’ ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play .
or maybe , to make it even more lovely , i ’ ll sing it when the heroine dies .
have you sent anyone to bottom ’ s house ?
has he come home yet ?
no one ’ s heard from him .
i ’ m sure he ’ s been kidnapped .
if he doesn ’ t show up , the play is ruined .
it won ’ t go on .
no , it would be impossible .
he ’ s quite simply the smartest working-man in athens .
yes , and the best looking too .
and his voice is the paramour of sweetness .
you mean “ paragon. ” a the duke ’ s leaving the temple .
two or three more lords and ladies have been married too .
if we ’ d been able to put on our play , we would have had it made .
oh that great , funny guy , bottom !
he would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life .
six pence a day would ’ ve been forced on him .
and he would have deserved it too .
where are my good fellows ?
oh , how wonderful to see you !
oh , what a relief !
i ’ ll tell you everything exactly as it happened .
no , you won ’ t get a word out of me .
all i ’ ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already .
now it ’ s time to get your costumes together .
meet me at the palace as soon as possible .
look over your lines again .
and no one eat any onions or garlic .
these lovers are saying some strange things , theseus .
i ’ ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales .
lunatics , lovers , and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations .
their story is bizarre and astounding , but it ’ s solid and consistent .
here come the lovers , laughing happily.—i wish you joy , my friends !
where is our entertainment director ?
what performances have been prepared ?
here i am , theseus .
which plays , what music ?
how will we pass the time without some entertainment ?
keep your promise , my love .
look , here comes helena .
did you just call me “ beautiful ” ?
you ’ re the beautiful one as far as demetrius is concerned .
oh , you ’ re so lucky !
if the world were mine , i ’ d give it all up—everything except demetrius—to be you .
that ’ s like hot ice and strange snow .
how can this drama be so many contradictory things ?
it ’ s tragic because pyramus kills himself .
so let ’ s see it .
no , my noble lord .
this play isn ’ t right for you .
i ’ ll watch this play .
come on , bring them in .
you won ’ t see anything like that , sweetheart .
he just said that they ’ re no good at acting .
your grace , the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready .
if we happen to offend you , it ’ s because we want to .
please keep in mind we ’ re only here out of spite .
we don ’ t come here with the intention of making you happy .
we ’ re absolutely not here to delight you .
by watching their show , you ’ ll find out everything you ’ re likely to know .
this guy doesn ’ t pay much attention to punctuation .
he rode that prologue like a wild horse .
he didn ’ t know how to stop it .
his speech was like a tangled chain .
i wonder if the lion ’ s going to talk .
it wouldn ’ t surprise me , my lord .
can you imagine cement and stone talking better ?
it ’ s the smartest partition i ’ ve ever heard speak , my lord .
pyramus is coming up to the wall .
god bless you for doing this .
but what ’ s this i see ?
i don ’ t see any thisbe .
oh wicked wall , through which i don ’ t see any happiness !
damn your stones for disappointing me like this !
since the wall is conscious , it should curse back at him .
i ’ ll go to the hole to see if i can hear my thisbe ’ s face .
you are my love , my love , i think .
i ’ m your love , no matter what you think .
will you meet me right away at ninny ’ s grave ?
neither death nor life will stop me from coming .
i , wall , have done my part .
now that i ’ m done , wall can go away .
this is the silliest thing i ’ ve ever seen .
in that case it ’ s your imagination that ’ s interesting , not the play .
look , here come two noble animals , a man and a lion .
ah , it ’ s a sensitive animal , with a good conscience .
he ’ s as brave as a fox .
and as wise as a goose .
oh , that ’ s not true , my lord .
he ’ s not brave enough to be wise .
he ’ s not wise enough to be brave .
anyway , he is what he is .
let ’ s listen to the moon .
this lantern represents the moon .
the man should be inside the lantern .
how else is he the “ man in the moon ” ?
he can ’ t go in there because of the candle .
it ’ s too hot .
i ’ m tired of this moon .
well , all of these should be in the lantern , because they ’ re all in the moon .
but be quiet , here comes thisbe .
this is old ninny ’ s tomb .
but where is my love ?
good shining , moon ! —really , the moon shines very well .
that ’ s good , lion !
i frown at him , but he still loves me .
oh , if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns !
i curse him , but he loves me .
if only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection !
the more i hate him , the more he follows me around .
the more i love him , the more he hates me .
it ’ s not my fault he acts like that , helena .
that ’ s true , it ’ s your beauty ’ s fault .
i wish i had a fault like that !
he won ’ t see my face ever again .
lysander and i are running away from here .
before i saw lysander , athens seemed like paradise to me .
but lysander ’ s so attractive that he ’ s turned heaven into hell !
helena , we ’ ll tell you about our secret plan .
and then pyramus showed up .
sweet moon , i thank you for your sunny beams .
but , look , poor me , what a terrible tragedy is here !
eyes , do you see ?
oh , fate , come and cut the thread of my life .
conquer , crush , conclude , and kill !
oh , mother nature , why did you create lions ?
and so i ’ m dying .
okay , now i ’ m dead .
now die , die , die , die , die .
with a doctor ’ s help he might recover and become an ass again .
i don ’ t think a ridiculous pyramus like that one deserves much moaning .
i hope she keeps it short .
look , she ’ s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers .
and now she ’ ll start moaning , of course— are you asleep , my love ?
what , are you dead , my dove ?
oh , pyramus , get up !
can ’ t you talk ?
the dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes !
your lily-white lips , your cherry-red nose , and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone , gone forever .
lovers , moan and weep .
his eyes were as green as leeks .
oh , fate , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk .
soak your hands in blood and gore , since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors .
tongue , do not speak .
come , blade , drench my breast with blood .
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead .
yes , and wall too .
never apologize—when the actors are all dead , no one can be blamed .
it ’ s a good tragedy , very well done .
but come on , let ’ s see you do your dance .
the clock has chimed midnight .
lovers , it ’ s time to go to bed .
it ’ s almost fairy time .
dear friends , let ’ s go to bed .
let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house .
first rehearse your song from memory , and make sure each note is pretty .
we ’ ll all join hands and sing , and bless this place with our fairy grace .
if you forgive us , we ’ ll make everything all right .
if not , then i ’ m a liar .
so good night to everyone .
give me some applause , if we ’ re friends , and robin will make everything up to you .
from then on we ’ ll turn our backs on athens .
we ’ ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers .
we need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow .
i will , my hermia .
i hope demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him !
demetrius doesn ’ t think so , and that ’ s all that matters .
he refuses to admit what everyone else knows .
love can make worthless things beautiful .
when we ’ re in love , we don ’ t see with our eyes but with our minds .
that ’ s why paintings of cupid , the god of love , always show him as blind .
that ’ s why they say love is a child .
he ’ ll run after her .
answer when i call your name.—nick bottom , the weaver ?
tell me which part i ’ m going to play , then go on .
you , nick bottom , have been cast as pyramus .
i could do a great job with hercules , or any other part that requires ranting and raving .
a lover would have to be weepier , of course .
francis flute , the bellows-repairman ?
a knight on a quest ?
thisbe is the lady pyramus is in love with .
no , come on , don ’ t make me play a woman .
i ’ m growing a beard .
that doesn ’ t matter .
you ’ ll wear a mask , and you can make your voice as high as you want to .
in that case , if i can wear a mask , let me play thisbe too !
bottom , you ’ re pyramus.—and flute , you ’ re thisbe .
robin starveling , the tailor ?
robin starveling , you ’ re going to play thisbe ’ s mother.—tom snout , the handyman .
i hope this play is well cast now .
do you have the lion ’ s part written down ?
if you do , please give it to me , because i need to start learning the lines .
let me play the lion too .
and that would get us all executed .
yeah , that would get every single one of us executed .
so you ’ re the only one who could play pyramus .
well then , i ’ ll do it .
what kind of beard should i wear for the part ?
whatever kind you want , i guess .
no , you ’ ll see , four days will quickly turn into four nights .
and since we dream at night , time passes quickly then .
sadness is only appropriate for funerals .
we don ’ t want it at our festivities .
but i ’ ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals , public festivities , and celebration .
long live theseus , our famous and respected duke !
meanwhile , i ’ ll make a list of props that we ’ ll need for the play .
don ’ t leave me in the lurch .
we ’ ll be there , and there we ’ ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully , truly obscenely .
we ’ ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke ’ s forest .
be there , or don ’ t show your face again .
i wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the earth .
i work for titania , the fairy queen , and organize fairy dances for her in the grass .
the cowslip flowers are her bodyguards .
their sweet smells come from those little freckles .
now i have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower .
goodbye , you dumb old spirit .
i ’ ve got to go .
the queen and her elves will be here soon .
he ’ s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an indian king .
he wants the child for himself , to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests .
instead , she puts flowers in the boy ’ s hair and makes a fuss over him .
you do their work for them and give them good luck .
that ’ s you , right ?
what you say is true .
that ’ s me you ’ re talking about , the playful wanderer of the night .
but step aside , fairy !
and here ’ s my mistress , titania .
i wish he ’ d go away !
how what , are you jealous , oberon ? —fairies , let ’ s get out of here .
i ’ ve sworn i ’ ll never sleep with him or talk to him again .
wait just a minute , you brazen hussy .
the only reason you left india was to come here and see that butch amazon hippolyta .
these are nothing but jealous lies .
so the pale , angry moon , who controls the tides , fills the air with diseases .
and this is all because of our argument .
we are responsible for this .
do something about it , then .
you have the power to fix it .
why would titania want to argue with her oberon ?
all i ’ m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew .
i won ’ t give up this child for all of fairyland .
how long do you plan to stay here in this forest ?
maybe until after theseus ’ s wedding day .
if not , leave me alone , and i ’ ll stay away from your turf .
give me that boy and i ’ ll come with you .
not for your entire fairy kingdom.—come , fairies , let ’ s go .
we ’ re going to have an out-and-out brawl if i stay any longer .
well , go on your way , then .
you won ’ t leave this grove until i ’ ve paid you back for this insult .
you couldn ’ t see him , but i could .
but i paid attention to where cupid ’ s arrow fell .
young girls call it “ love-in-idleness. ” bring me that flower .
i showed it to you once .
bring me this plant , and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles .
i could go around the world in forty minutes .
but who ’ s that coming this way ?
look , i don ’ t love you , so stop following me around .
where are lysander and beautiful hermia ?
lysander i want to stop , but hermia stops my heart from beating .
you told me they escaped into this forest .
go away , get out of here , and stop following me .
you attract me to you , you cruel magnet !
but you must not attract iron , because my heart is as true as steel .
do i ask you to follow me ?
do i speak to you kindly ?
don ’ t i tell you in the clearest terms that i do not and can not love you ?
yes , but that makes me love you even more .
i ’ m your little dog , demetrius .
the more you beat me , the more i ’ ll love you .
just let me follow behind you , even though i ’ m not good enough for you .
just looking at you makes me sick .
and i get sick when i can ’ t look at you .
i rely on your virtue to protect me .
the wildest animal isn ’ t as cruel as you are .
yes , you already hurt me in the church , in the town , and in the fields .
shame on you , demetrius !
your behavior is an insult to all women .
we can not fight for love as men can .
i ’ ll follow you and turn this hell i ’ m in into a kind of heaven .
do you have the flower ?
yes , here it is .
please , give it to me .
what ’ s new with you ?
what do you have to say for yourself , hermia ?
demetrius is an admirable man .
titania sleeps there sometimes at night , lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights .
snakes shed their skin there , and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
don ’ t worry , sir .
i ’ m at your service .
okay , let ’ s go !
everything ’ s fine now .
one of us will stay and stand guard .
whatever you see first when you wake up , think of it as your true love .
wake up when something nasty is nearby .
let ’ s do that , lysander .
i ’ m going to rest my head on this little slope .
we ’ ll have one heart , one bed , two bodies , and one faithful vow .
don ’ t sleep so close to me .
i just meant that our hearts are joined , so we can almost think of them as one heart .
so let me sleep next to you .
stay away for now , and good night , my sweet friend .
i hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life !
i ’ ll sleep over here .
stop , even if only to kill me .
oh , will you leave me alone in the dark ?
stay here at your own risk .
i ’ m going on alone .
oh , i ’ m out of breath from this foolish chase .
the more i pray , the less i get out of it .
hermia is lucky , wherever she is , because she has beautiful eyes .
how did her eyes get so bright ?
if that ’ s the case , tears wash my eyes more than hers .
so it ’ s no surprise that demetrius runs away from me as if i were a monster .
what evil and deceitful mirror made me think i could rival hermia ’ s starry eyes ?
don ’ t say that , lysander .
don ’ t say that .
why do you care that he loves hermia ?
i regret all the boring time i wasted with her .
i don ’ t love hermia ; i love helena .
fruits and vegetables don ’ t ripen until the right season of the year .
likewise , i ’ m young , and my sense of reason has just ripened .
do you have to harp on my inadequacy ?
i have to tell you , i thought you were a much kinder person than this .
this is the perfect place to rehearse .
this clearing will be the stage , and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room .
peter quince— what is it , jolly bottom ?
there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never work .
what should we do about that ?
i think we ’ ll have to leave out all the killing , come to think of it .
i ’ ve got a plan that will fix everything .
that ’ ll keep them from being afraid .
all right , we ’ ll have a prologue then .
we ’ ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines , just like in a ballad .
no , add a couple more syllables .
make it eight and eight .
won ’ t the ladies be scared of the lion ?
i ’ m really worried about that .
there ’ s no scarier wild bird than the living lion , and we should remember that .
so we need another prologue to tell everyone he ’ s not a real lion .
because , you know , pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight .
you ’ re right , lysander ’ s admirable too .
i wish my father could see them with my eyes .
no , you must see them as your father sees them .
your grace , please forgive me .
but please , tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if i refuse to marry demetrius .
so think carefully about what you want , beautiful hermia .
consider how young you are , and question your feelings .
will the moon be shining on the night we ’ re performing our play ?
look up moonshine , look up moonshine !
what do you think , bottom ?
if we can do that , everything will be all right .
now sit down , everybody , and rehearse your parts—pyramus , you start .
speak , pyramus.—thisbe , come forward .
that ’ s “ ninus ’ s grave , ” man .
and don ’ t say all of that yet .
you just said all your lines at once , cues and all.—pyramus , enter .
it ’ s “ never get tired. ” oh !
it ’ s a monster !
we ’ re being haunted .
run , everyone , run !
i ’ ll follow you .
sometimes i ’ ll turn into fire !
why are they running away ?
oh , bottom , you ’ ve changed !
what have you got on your head ?
what do you think i ’ ve got on my head ?
you ’ re acting like an ass , don ’ t you think ?
god bless you , bottom , god bless you .
but i won ’ t leave this spot , no matter what they do .
who ’ d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird ?
i don ’ t think you ’ ve got much of a reason to love me .
it ’ s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn ’ t introduce them .
you ’ re as wise as you are beautiful .
no , that ’ s not true .
i ’ m no ordinary fairy .
be kind and polite to this gentleman .
leap and dance for him .
feed him apricots and blackberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
pluck off colorful butterfly wings , and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps .
bow to him , fairies , and curtsy to him .
i beg your pardon , sirs.—please tell me your name , sir ?
i ’ d like to get to know you better , mr. cobweb .
please , give my regards to your mother , mrs. peapod , and your father , mr. peapod .
good mr. mustardseed , i know you very well .
i swear to you , many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before .
i look forward to getting to know you better , mr. mustardseed .
take good care of him .
take him to my sleeping area .
the moon looks sad to me .
when she cries , all the little flowers cry too .
bring him to me in silence .
ah , here comes my messenger.—what ’ s going on , you crazy spirit ?
what havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest ?
my mistress titania is in love with a monster .
i led them on in this frightened , distracted state , and left sweet
at that exact moment , titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him , an ass .
this is going even better than i planned .
why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much ?
save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy .
he was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime .
would he have snuck away from me while i was asleep ?
the only possibility is that you ’ ve murdered him .
a murderer should look like you do , so pale and grim .
what does that have to do with my lysander ?
oh , good demetrius , will you find him for me ?
did you kill him , then ?
oh , how brave of you !
a snake could do that as easily as you could .
i didn ’ t kill lysander .
as far as i know , he ’ s not even dead .
then please tell me he ’ s all right .
if i told you that , what would i get out of it ?
please give in , sweet hermia.—and lysander , stop acting like she ’ s yours .
her father loves you , demetrius .
she ’ s mine , and i ’ m giving her to demetrius .
the privilege of never seeing me again .
and now i ’ m going to leave your despised company .
you ’ ll never see me again , whether or not he ’ s dead .
so i ’ ll stay here for a while .
that ’ s the way of the world .
should we watch this ridiculous scene ?
lord , what fools these mortals are !
the noise they ’ re making will wake up demetrius .
then the two of them will both pursue one girl .
why do you think i ’ m making fun of you when i tell you i love you ?
people don ’ t cry when they ’ re mocking someone .
you get trickier and trickier .
demetrius loves her , and he doesn ’ t love you .
i see you ’ re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs .
don ’ t be cruel , demetrius .
lysander , keep your hermia .
i don ’ t want her .
helena , it ’ s not true .
look , here comes the woman you love .
why did you leave me alone so unkindly ?
why stay when love tells you to go ?
but what love could make my lysander leave me ?
why are you looking for me ?
didn ’ t you figure out that i left you because i hate you ?
you can ’ t mean what you ’ re saying .
so , she ’ s in on this too !
now i see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me .
our friendship in our schooldays , our childhood innocence ?
we grew together like twin cherries—which seemed to be separate but were also together—two lovely cherries on one stem .
there is scorn and disdain in her eyes , and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon .
she can ’ t even imagine what “ love ” is .
it would be bad if she knew about benedick ’ s love and teased him about it .
and so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has .
but who would dare tell her ?
she ’ d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit .
like a fire that gets covered up , benedick should smother his love and waste away .
no , instead i ’ ll go to benedick and advise him to fight his emotions .
you don ’ t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word .
oh , don ’ t injure your cousin like that !
he ’ s the only worthy man in italy , aside from my dear claudio .
true , he has an excellent reputation .
and he deserves it , having been excellent before he had a reputation for it .
when are you getting married , madam ?
tomorrow , and then every day after that .
come on , let ’ s go inside .
i ’ ll go with you , my lord , if you ’ ll allow me .
gentleman , i am not the same man i was before .
i hope he ’ s in love .
there isn ’ t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love .
if he looks serious , he must need money .
what , are you moaning on about your toothache ?
i repeat , he ’ s in love .
he brushes his hat in the mornings .
what do you think that means ?
has any man seen him at the barber ’ s ?
no , but the barber ’ s assistant has been seen with him .
and he ’ s rubbed himself with perfume .
can you smell out his secret now ?
but when you take up your duties too cheerfully .
that ’ s what her mother always tells me .
ah , he got you back , benedick !
congratulations , lady : you resemble a most honorable man .
i ’ m amazed you ’ re still talking , signior benedick .
no one ’ s listening to you .
look , it ’ s my dear lady disdain !
aren ’ t you dead yet ?
that ’ s as good as proof that the sweet young man ’ s in love .
the biggest clue is his seriousness .
and when has he ever been known to wash his face ?
yes , or to wear cosmetics ?
i hear what they say about him for doing that .
a conclusion , a conclusion : he is in love .
oh , and i know who loves him .
she ’ ll be buried with her face upwards , then .
this chatter is no cure for my toothache .
my lord and brother , god save you .
if you don ’ t mind , i ’ d like to speak with you .
but count claudio can stay , for what i ’ m about to say concerns him .
what ’ s the matter ?
you know that he does .
i don ’ t know that , once he knows what i know .
if there ’ s any reason we shouldn ’ t get married , i urge you to tell me .
you may think that i don ’ t love you .
i hope that , after i tell you my news , you will think better of me .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
that ’ s the one : leonato ’ s hero , your hero , every man ’ s hero .
the word is too good to represent her wickedness .
she is worse than wicked .
if you can think of a more awful title , i ’ ll call her that .
but don ’ t keep wondering without more proof .
if you still love her after that , then marry her tomorrow .
but you would be more honorable if you changed your mind .
i won ’ t consider it .
and since i wooed her in your name , i ’ ll join you in disgracing her .
remain calm until midnight , and then you ’ ll see what the trouble is .
oh , this day has turned into a disaster !
oh , mischief has ruined our plans !
oh , a plague has been prevented , thank god !
that ’ s what you ’ ll say once you ’ ve seen part two .
are you all good and honest men ?
come here , sir seacole .
god has blessed you with a good name .
to be good-looking is a matter of luck , but to read and write is a natural gift .
both of which , master constable— you have .
i knew that would be your answer .
well , for your good looks , sir , thank god and don ’ t boast about it .
you ’ re thought to be the most
you will and what if he won ’ t stop ?
we know what ’ s appropriate for a watch .
why , you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman .
and what if they won ’ t go ?
well then , leave them alone until they ’ re sober .
so if we know that a man is a thief , should we try to arrest him ?
you , constable , are representing the prince himself .
if you meet the prince in the night , you can order him to stop .
no , by our lady , i don ’ t think he can .
i ’ ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it .
by our lady , i think that ’ s true .
and if anything important happens , find me and let me know .
well gentlemen , we ’ ve heard our assignment .
let ’ s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed .
one more thing , good gentlemen .
come to think of it , i thought i felt a scab there .
i ’ ll get you for that .
now get on with your story .
you should know i ’ ve earned a thousand gold pieces from don john .
is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?
you should ask instead if it ’ s possible that any criminal could be so rich .
because when rich villains need poor villains ' services , those poor ones can name the price .
i can ’ t believe it .
that only proves how inexperienced you are .
you know that the style of a man ’ s jacket or hat or coat means nothing .
yes , it ’ s just clothing .
yes , fashion is fashion .
c ’ mon , i might as well say the fool ’ s the fool !
but don ’ t you see what a did you hear someone ?
but you ’ re all wound up about fashion , too .
no , i ’ m not wound up .
but i will tell you that i seduced margaret , the lady hero ’ s waiting woman , tonight .
that makes lady courtesy a traitor .
all ladies love me , except you .
it ’ s too bad i ’ m so hard-hearted , because i really don ’ t love anyone .
women are lucky , then .
you would make a nasty suitor .
if he has a face like yours , a good scratching couldn ’ t make him look any worse .
listen to you , instructing me like a parrot would .
i ’ d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you .
i wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless .
that ’ s it—i ’ m done .
you always slip out of the argument like this .
i know you from before .
i think he ’ s actually serious , and not just being polite .
and they thought margaret was hero ?
we charge you , in the prince ’ s name , to stop !
call up the master constable dogberry .
we have and one of them is the criminal deformed .
i know him ; he wears a lock of hair .
gentlemen , gentlemen— gentlemen , don ’ t speak .
we ’ re probably a very valuable catch for these guys .
let ’ s go , we ’ ll obey you .
good ursula , go wake my cousin and ask her to get up .
and request that she come here .
really , i think your other ruff is better .
no , please good meg , i ’ ll wear this one .
my cousin ’ s a fool , and you are too .
i ’ ll wear this one and none other .
oh , they say that dress surpasses all others .
but for a fine , elegant , graceful , and excellent dress , yours is worth ten of those .
i hope i enjoy wearing it , for my heart is very heavy .
it will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man .
shame of what , lady ?
sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar , right ?
and isn ’ t your husband an honorable man ?
good morning , sweet hero .
why do you sound so odd ?
you sound out of tune .
you sing , and i ’ ll dance .
the count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves .
sorry , i ’ m all stuffed .
ever since you lost yours .
doesn ’ t my wit suit me well ?
god , i ’ m really sick .
i just meant that you should use some holy thistle .
maybe you think that i think you ’ re in love .
and yet i think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does .
it ’ s not a false gallop , anyway .
good cousin , good meg , good ursula , come help me get dressed .
what do you want from me , my good man ?
indeed , sir , it is .
yes , it truly is .
what ’ s the news , my good friends ?
sorry , sir , goodman verges tends to ramble .
but truly , if i were as
oh , so you ’ d give me all your tediousness ?
god gives those gifts—i had nothing to do with it .
now i must return to the wedding .
one more thing , sir .
examine them yourselves , then bring me your findings .
now i ’ m in a great hurry , as i ’ m sure you can see .
my lord , they ’ re waiting for you to give your daughter away to claudio .
go to francis seacole , the constable of the watch .
tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail .
we won ’ t hold back any of our wisdom .
we ’ ll drive them to a
i am being serious , my lord .
i ’ m not a man who talks a lot , but i thank you .
if it pleases you , your highness , will you lead us all inside ?
give me your hand , leonato .
we will go in together .
benedick , did you notice signior leonato ’ s daughter ?
i saw her , but i didn ’ t notice her .
isn ’ t she a well-mannered young lady ?
do you want my true opinion ?
or do you want me to criticize her like i do all women ?
no , please , speak seriously .
you think i ’ m kidding .
please tell me seriously what you think of her .
all right , friar francis , let ’ s keep this short .
no , he comes to be married lady , do you come here to be married to this count ?
do you know any , hero ?
do you know any , count ?
i ’ m sure i can answer for him—he doesn ’ t know any , either .
oh , the things men dare to do !
the things men are allowed to do !
the things men do daily , not knowing what they ’ re doing !
what , are we playing with interjections ?
well then , add some interjections that indicate laughter , like hold on , friar .
as freely , son , as god gave her to me .
and what should i give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift ?
nothing , sir , except grandchildren .
there , leonato , take your daughter back .
she only appears honorable from the outside .
look , how she blushes like a virgin !
oh , sin can disguise itself so artfully !
doesn ’ t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent ?
but she is no virgin .
she has been in a man ’ s bed .
she blushes from guilt , not modesty .
what do you mean , my lord ?
and have i ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you ?
curse you for your false appearances !
is that why you ’ re talking so wildly ?
good prince , say something !
i ’ ve been dishonored : i arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore .
are you really saying these things , or am i dreaming ?
they ’ re really being spoken , sir , and they ’ re true .
this doesn ’ t look like a wedding .
leonato , am i standing here ?
is this the prince ’ s brother ?
is this face hero ’ s ?
yes , that ’ s all true—but what do you mean by it , my lord ?
as my child , i order you to do so .
oh , god help me !
what kind of game is this ?
we just want you to answer to your real name .
isn ’ t my name hero ?
who can stain that name with a just accusation ?
indeed , hero herself can !
you ’ ve stained your virtue with your own actions .
what man were you talking to at your window last night , between the hours of midnight and one ?
if you ’ re a virgin , you ’ ll answer this question .
i wasn ’ t talking to any man at that time , my lord .
pretty lady , i ’ m much ashamed of your shocking behavior .
what ’ s wrong , cousin ?
come , let ’ s go .
these revelations have overwhelmed her .
she ’ s dead , i think.—help , uncle ! —hero , why hero !
death is the best way to cover over her shame .
how are you , hero ?
yes , why shouldn ’ t she ?
isn ’ t every living thing condemning her ?
am i sorry that i only had one child ?
do i blame nature for being so thrifty ?
oh , one child is one too many !
why did i ever have one ?
why did you once seem lovely to me ?
sir , sir , calm down .
i ’ m so amazed by this , i don ’ t know what to say .
oh , on my soul , my cousin has been slandered falsely !
lady , did you sleep in her room last night ?
no , i didn ’ t , but i did every night for the past year .
then it ’ s confirmed !
but she must be , friar .
the princes are under some strange misunderstanding .
i don ’ t know .
if they have spoken the truth about hero , i will tear her apart with my bare hands .
hold on a moment , and listen to my advice .
the princes left your daughter here for dead .
why should we do this ?
that will be a good thing .
that ’ s how claudio will respond .
signior leonato , listen to the friar ’ s plan .
are you thinking of buying her ?
but tell me , are you speaking seriously ?
or are you just teasing ?
i think she ’ s the most wonderful woman i ’ ve ever laid eyes on .
but , hey , this doesn ’ t mean you ’ re looking to get married , does it ?
what ’ s going on these days ?
isn ’ t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife ?
look , don pedro has come back for you .
this is a good agreement .
come , lady ; you must die in order to live .
hopefully , your wedding day is only postponed .
lady beatrice , have you been crying this entire time ?
yes , and i ’ ll keep crying a while longer .
i don ’ t wish that on you .
i really believe your cousin was falsely accused .
oh , the man who avenged her could ask anything of me !
is there any way i could show such friendship to you ?
a very clear way , but there is no friend who will undertake it .
can a man do it ?
it ’ s a job meant for a man , but not you .
there is nothing in the world that i love as much as you .
isn ’ t that strange ?
it ’ s as strange as this other thing which i don ’ t understand .
i feel awful for my cousin .
by my sword , beatrice , you love me .
not with any sauce they could provide for them .
i swear , i love you .
well then , god forgive me !
why , what have you done , sweet beatrice ?
you got to me first .
i was about to swear that i loved you .
then do so , with all your heart .
i love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with .
come , ask me to do anything for you .
i wouldn ’ t do that for the whole wide world .
then , rejecting my request , you kill
my body waits here , but the rest of me is gone .
you don ’ t really love me .
i beg you to let me go .
beatrice— i swear , i ’ m going .
not until we part as friends .
how dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy .
hasn ’ t he proven himself to be a great villain—slandering , scorning , and dishonoring my cousin ?
oh , i wish i were a man !
i would rip his heart out in public and eat it .
listen to me , beatrice— talking with a man outside her bedroom window !
he ’ s a proper count , that count sugarplum , a sweet gentleman , for sure !
oh , if only i were a man !
or had a friend who would be a man for me !
all this conversing has turned men into tongues—and fancy ones , at that .
the man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as hercules .
i swear by this hand that i love you .
that ’ s enough for me , then .
i ’ ll challenge him .
i ’ ll kiss your hand , and with that i leave you .
i swear that claudio will pay dearly for this .
keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin .
which ones are the malefactors ?
sir , that would be me and my partner .
have them come in front of the master constable .
yes , indeed , bring them before me .
what ’ s your name , friend ?
please , write down “ borachio. ” —and yours ?
i ’ m a gentleman , sir , and my name is conrade .
write down “ master gentleman conrade. ” —gentlemen , are you good christians , and do you serve god ?
yes , sir , we hope so .
how do you both plead ?
honestly , sir , we say that we are not criminals .
sir , i tell you we believe you ’ re both lying criminals .
sir , i tell you that we are not .
well , okay.—i swear to god , both their stories match .
have you written that down , that they aren ’ t criminals ?
master constable , you ’ re going about this all wrong .
first , you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them .
yes , good idea ; that ’ s the
this man said , sir , that don john , the prince ’ s brother , was a villain .
write down that prince john is a villain .
i swear , i don ’ t like the look of you .
that don john had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the lady hero .
that ’ s burglary , that is .
yes , by god , that it is .
what else did you hear ?
i ’ ll get there first and tell him what we found out .
honest to god , where ’ s the sexton ?
come on , tie them up .
get away from me , you ass !
don ’ t you suspect my office ?
if you keep on the way you ’ ve been going , you ’ ll kill yourself .
stop advising me ; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve .
find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as i loved hero and ask
so don ’ t advise me .
please , leave me alone .
but don ’ t take all that pain on yourself .
make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too .
now you ’ re talking .
in my soul , i believe hero has been falsely accused .
the prince and claudio are hurrying this way .
good evening , good evening .
good day to both of you .
listen , my lords— we ’ re in a bit of a hurry , leonato .
your highness will have to force me to tell .
it ’ s good if you love hero , because she ’ s worthy of your love .
you ’ re trying to trick me , my lord .
i swear , i ’ m telling you what i honestly think .
a bit of a hurry , my lord !
well then , good bye , my lord .
you ’ re in a hurry , are you ?
well then , don ’ t bother .
come on , don ’ t quarrel with us , good old man .
if it ’ s fighting he is after , some of us here should run and hide .
indeed , you have wronged me , you liar .
don ’ t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword .
i ’ m not scared of you .
curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you .
really , i had no intention of going for my sword .
damn you , don ’ t mock and sneer at me .
you have ruined my innocent child .
yours , claudio , yours , i say .
you ’ ve got it wrong , old man .
i ’ ll have nothing to do with you .
you think you can get rid of me that easily ?
he ’ ll have to kill both of us , and indeed we ’ re both men .
but let him start off easy by killing one of us .
come on—kill me and brag about it !
i will , as surely as i am a gentleman .
but brother anthony— don ’ t , it ’ s no big deal .
don ’ t bother with it .
let me deal with this .
gentlemen , we won ’ t stay here and anger you further .
my lord , my lord— i don ’ t want to hear any more about it .
i ’ m determined to be heard by someone .
and you will be , or some people here will suffer for it .
look , here comes just the man we were looking for .
what ’ s up , mister ?
you just missed a fight that was barely avoided .
we were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth .
i think if we had fought , we would have proven too young and strong for them after all .
there ’ s no bravery in an unfair fight .
look : benedick is so pale—are you sick , or angry ?
sir , don ’ t even try to beat me in a battle of wits .
i think he really is angry .
if he is , that ’ s his problem .
can i have a word with you privately ?
god forbid he wants to challenge me !
you ’ ve killed an innocent woman , and you ’ re going to pay dearly for her death .
what , are we having a feast ?
benedick , beatrice praised your wit the other day .
i said you had a fine wit .
leonato ’ s daughter had told us everything .
and , moreover , god saw benedick when he was hid in the garden .
but when exactly will we see benedick married ?
yes , with the sign underneath him that says : “ here lives benedick the married man ” ?
you know what i intend .
i ’ ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman .
i ’ m leaving your court now .
your brother don john the bastard has run away from messina .
the three of you have killed a sweet , innocent woman .
lord babyface over there will meet me in a duel , and good luck to him then .
very serious , and i ’ m sure it ’ s because of beatrice .
and he challenged you to a duel ?
he did , very sincerely .
what a strange sight—a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home !
let me gather my wits and get serious here .
didn ’ t he say my brother has run away ?
since you are a lying hypocrite , we must look after you .
two of my brother ’ s men , all tied up !
officers , what crime have these men committed ?
i tricked your own eyes .
they ’ ve recorded my crimes , and i would rather die than have to retell this shameful story .
the lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master .
his words are like poison to me .
yes , and paid me well for doing it .
he is made of treachery , and has run away to avoid his crimes .
come , take away the here comes master signior leonato with the sexton .
which one of them did it ?
if you want to see your deceiver , then look at me .
are you the slave who , with your slanderous words , killed my innocent child ?
yes , i am the one .
no , villain , but you didn ’ t work alone .
i don ’ t know how to ask you for forgiveness , but i have to say something .
my brother has a daughter who looks exactly like hero ; this girl is heir to both our estates .
marry her as you should have married her cousin , and i will let my revenge die .
and i feel that i love her .
i know that she is worthy of that love .
or in the power of reason .
i was conceived by a woman , and i thank her very much for all her effort .
and then she brought me up , and i thank her for that , too .
i swear , before i die i ’ m going to see you sick with love .
your overwhelming kindness makes me weep .
i willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands .
i will see you tomorrow , then .
now i have to leave .
thank you for all your efforts .
you speak like a very thankful and respectful boy , and may god bless you .
god save the charitable organization !
i hope that god restores you to health .
we ’ ll see you tomorrow .
we ’ ll be there .
i will mourn hero tonight .
please margaret , help me write this poem for beatrice .
it ’ s just that my wit is very gentlemanly , margaret , and refuses to hurt a woman .
now please , tell beatrice to come out .
i ’ ll go get beatrice for you , who can walk here by herself—she has legs .
so that means she ’ ll come .
i ’ m really a pitiful singer .
take beatrice , have you come because i called for you ?
yes , sir , and i ’ ll leave when you ask me to .
oh , well , stay till then !
i spoke angry , foul words to him , and with that i will kiss you .
thus , i ’ ll leave without being kissed .
your wit is so forceful , it frightens the very meaning out of your words .
now , tell me—which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first ?
but tell me—which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me ?
that ’ s a good way of putting it .
i do suffer love , because i love you against my will .
you love me in spite of your heart , i think .
exactly how long is that , do you think ?
about an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying .
that ’ s why i praise myself , who—if i do say so myself—is quite praiseworthy .
but tell me , how is your cousin ?
i ’ m very sick , too .
have faith , love me , and you will get better .
madam , you have to go to your uncle ’ s .
will you come with me to hear this news , sir ?
is this the family tomb of leonato ?
it is , my lord .
here lies hero , the heroic maiden killed by slanderous words .
to repay her for her troubles , death gives her undying fame .
so the life that died with shame lives on with fame .
this epitaph will hang here forever , continuing to praise hero after i die .
now start the music , and sing the solemn hymn .
now i say good night to your bones , hero .
i will perform this ceremony every year .
didn ’ t i tell you she was innocent ?
well , i ’ m glad that everything has been sorted out .
me too—otherwise i would have had to duel with claudio .
when i send for you , come out wearing masks .
the prince and claudio are supposed to be here by now.—you know your job , brother .
you have to pretend to be your niece ’ s father , and give her away to claudio .
what do you need me to do ?
she sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her , it ’ s true .
and i see her also through the eyes of love .
and those eyes were endowed with sight by claudio , the prince , and me .
but what did you want ?
sir , i ’ m puzzled by what you just said .
and i ’ ll help you .
here comes the prince and claudio .
good morning to all these lovely people .
good morning , prince ; good morning , claudio .
we ’ re waiting here for you .
are you still set on marrying my brother ’ s daughter ?
i wouldn ’ t change my mind even if she were
well , time will tell .
bring her out , brother .
the friar ’ s ready .
i think he ’ s nervous—he ’ s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated .
but here are other matters to be dealt with .
which is the lady i ’ m supposed to marry ?
this one , and i will give her to you .
it ’ s another hero !
and as surely as i am alive , i am a virgin .
it ’ s the former hero !
she was only dead , my lord , as long as her slander lived .
i can confirm that all these shocking things are true .
which one of you is beatrice ?
no , no more than is reasonable .
well then , your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived .
truly , no—no more than is reasonable .
they swore that you were sick with love for me .
they swore that you were nearly dead with love for me .
so you don ’ t love me ?
no , i don ’ t—except as a friend .
come on , niece , i ’ m sure you love him .
our handwriting gives away our hearts .
i ’ ll stop your mouth with a kiss .
how does it feel to be benedick the married man ?
you think i care what i ’ m called ?
well , i don ’ t .
musicians , play us a song.—prince , you look sad .
you should get a wife !
into god ’ s hands .
from my house , if i had a house— ” “ the sixth of july .
before you make my lord , you could really help me out now .
i am at your service .
does leonato have a son , my lord ?
hero is his only child , and his only heir .
do you like her , claudio ?
look , if you really love the beautiful hero , enjoy it .
isn ’ t that the reason you told me all this ?
but i didn ’ t want you to think that i ’ m hasty in my emotions .
that ’ s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses .
let ’ s get started right away .
has he taken care of the music ?
he is taking care of it as we speak .
but brother , i have some strange news for you .
is this servant of yours a smart man ?
he ’ s very bright .
i ’ ll get him to come here , and you can ask him yourself .
he must be very near by now .
when i left him , he was less than nine miles from here .
how many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought ?
not many , and no one important .
a victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely .
claudio deserves to be honored , and don pedro has rewarded him accordingly .
he has an uncle here in messina who will be glad to hear this news .
no , no , until it comes true we ’ ll pretend it was just a dream we had .
but my daughter should know about this , so she can be prepared with an answer just in case .
go to her and tell her for me .
cousins , you all have work to do.—oh , i beg your pardon .
come with me now , and help me out .
really , my lord , why are you so excessively sad ?
therefore my sadness is without limit .
you should listen to reason .
i can ’ t hide what i am .
sure , but don ’ t do it at full volume until there ’ s no danger in it .
you have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose .
i ’ d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother ’ s garden .
until that happens , let me be who i am and don ’ t try to change me .
can ’ t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage ?
i use it all the time , since it ’ s all that i have .
what ’ s going on , borachio ?
who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage ?
your brother ’ s right-hand man .
that pretty boy , claudio ?
that ’ s the one .
hero , the daughter and heir of leonato .
how did you learn about this ?
as i was working on one musty room , the prince and claudio entered .
come , let ’ s go to the dance .
this just may cheer me up .
if there ’ s any way i can spoil his life , i ’ ll be overjoyed .
you ’ ll both help me , right ?
until the day we die , my lord .
let ’ s go to this great feast .
lead the way , sir .
wasn ’ t don john at dinner tonight ?
i didn ’ t see him .
that man always looks so sour !
just looking at him gives me heartburn .
he has a very gloomy attitude .
it would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between don john and benedick .
honestly , she is too ill-tempered .
maybe you will find a husband without a beard .
and then what would i do with him ?
so you ’ ll go to hell ?
no , i won ’ t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt .
what woman wouldn ’ t be distressed , being lorded over by a handful of dust ?
can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay ?
no , uncle , i won ’ t be married .
the wooing is like a scottish jig : hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion .
niece , you are exceptionally perceptive .
i have a good eye , uncle .
i can see what ’ s in broad daylight .
let ’ s give them room .
my lady , will you have a dance with me ?
and when will that be ?
when i like the way you look , for god forbid your face be as ugly as your mask !
my mask is like the roof of the poor
if you wish to speak of love , speak more softly .
well , i wish you liked me .
i say my prayers out loud .
that makes me love you even more .
go ahead—say “ amen. ” no more talking .
i ’ ve got my answer .
no , really , i ’ m not .
i can tell by the way you waggle your head .
really , i ’ m only pretending to be him .
you could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself .
look , you ’ ve got his wrinkled hands .
you are antonio , you are he .
in short , i ’ m not .
come on , do you think i can ’ t recognize you by your excellent wit ?
can a good thing hide itself ?
be quiet , you are antonio .
a man ’ s virtues will always show themselves , and that ’ s the end of that .
won ’ t you tell me who told you that ?
no , you ’ ll have to excuse me .
and you won ’ t tell me who you are ?
well , it must have been signior benedick .
i ’ m sure you know him .
no i don ’ t , believe me .
what , he never made you laugh ?
there ’ s no face more sincere than one washed in tears .
there was no signior montanto in our army .
who are you talking about , niece ?
my cousin means signior benedick of padua .
oh , yes , benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever .
please tell me , who is this man ?
why , he ’ s the prince ’ s fool , and a very dull fool at that .
i ’ m sure he ’ s out there dancing .
i could have sworn he trampled on me .
when i meet this gentleman , i ’ ll tell him what you ’ ve said .
come on , we have to follow the leaders of the dance .
in every good thing they do .
you know me too well .
sir , my brother is very fond of you .
he is in love with hero .
please make him change his mind .
how do you know he loves her ?
i heard him swear he did .
i did too , and he also swore he would marry her tonight .
come on , let ’ s get to the banquet .
though i said my name was benedick , i heard this news with claudio ’ s ears .
of course the prince wants hero for himself .
friendship is enduring except when love is involved .
therefore , all lovers should speak for themselves .
beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion .
yes , that ’ s me .
will you come with me ?
right over to that i hope he enjoys her .
you sound like a cattle dealer : that ’ s the way they sell bulls .
but do you really think the prince would treat you that way ?
please , leave me alone .
look at you , thrashing about like a blind man .
a boy robbed you , but you ’ ll beat up the post instead .
if you won ’ t leave , then
oh , the poor bird .
the prince ’ s fool ” !
maybe they call me that because i am cheerful .
yes , but i am insulting myself by thinking this way .
i don ’ t have that kind of reputation !
well , i ’ ll get my revenge .
now , sir , where is claudio ?
yes , my lord , i played the part of a gossip and brought him the news .
i found him here , beating ?
why , what did he do ?
what , is trusting a friend such a crime ?
the criminal is the one who stole the nest .
lady beatrice is angry with you .
the gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her .
she speaks daggers , and every word stabs .
i wouldn ’ t marry her , even if she were as blessed as paradise .
please , don ’ t mention her .
look , here she comes .
your highness , could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth ?
i ’ ll go to the antipodes for any little errand you can think of .
really , he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice .
so i suppose your grace can truly say that i have lost it .
you ’ ve humiliated him , lady : you ’ ve put him down .
why are you so sad ?
i ’ m not sad , my lord .
i ’ m neither , my lord .
i ’ ve told her father , and he ’ s given his permission .
tell us when you wish to get married , and may god give you joy .
claudio , take my daughter , and , with her , take my fortunes .
the prince has made the match , and may god bless it .
speak , claudio , that ’ s your cue .
for you , i give myself away and i ’ m ecstatic about the exchange .
truly , lady , you have a merry heart .
i thank my heart—the poor fool—for it keeps away from seriousness .
look , my cousin is whispering to claudio that she loves him .
why , you ’ re absolutely right , cousin .
thank the lord for alliances !
so everyone goes off into the world except me , who stays in because i ’ m sunburned .
i ’ d rather get a husband from your father .
don ’ t you have any brothers like you ?
your father ’ s sons would make excellent husbands , if only a girl could catch one for herself .
will you take me , my lady ?
no , my lord , unless i could have another husband for the work week .
you are too expensive to wear every day .
but please , forgive me , your highness .
i was born to speak cleverly , not seriously .
niece , will you take care of those things i mentioned ?
oh , yes , i ’ m sorry , uncle.—if you ’ ll excuse me , your grace .
i swear , she ’ s a very good-natured lady .
there ’ s very little about her that ’ s gloomy , my lord .
she ’ s only sad when she sleeps—and not even then .
she can ’ t stand to hear about getting a husband .
no , not at all .
she mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit .
she would make a good wife for benedick .
oh , lord , if they were married , they ’ d drive themselves crazy within a week .
count claudio , when do you plan to go to church and be married ?
me too , my lord .
and you , sweet hero ?
i ’ ll do any decent thing , my lord , to help my cousin get a good husband .
and benedick is not the worst husband i can think of .
come inside with me , and i will tell you my plan .
but i ’ m sure he ’ ll get even with you .
signior benedick served well in the war , my lady .
you had rotten food , and he helped you eat it .
he ’ s a good soldier too , lady .
he ’ s a lord to a lord and a man to a man .
he is positively stuffed with honorable virtues .
absolutely—he is stuffed , like a dummy .
please don ’ t take my niece the wrong way , sir .
benedick and beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves .
whenever they meet , there ’ s a little battle .
every month he has a new best friend .
the count claudio will marry leonato ’ s daughter .
yes , my lord , but i can spoil it .
any obstacle or barrier to claudio ’ s happiness will be like medicine to me .
how will you wreck this marriage ?
quickly , tell me how .
how will that kill this marriage ?
that part is up to you .
what will be my evidence ?
evidence enough to deceive the prince , anger claudio , ruin hero , and kill leonato .
is there anything else you wish ?
that ’ s all i want , and i ’ ll do anything to accomplish it .
find a time to speak with don pedro and claudio alone .
tell them you know that hero loves me .
of course , they won ’ t believe you without proof .
if you make the accusation convincingly , then my cunning won ’ t fail me .
i ’ ll go now to find out the date of the wedding .
in my bedroom window there is a book .
go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard .
i ’ m already here , sir .
i ’ m not sure , but i don ’ t think so .
look , it ’ s the prince and mr. love .
i ’ ll hide in the arbor .
well , should we hear some music ?
come on , balthasar , let ’ s hear that song again .
oh , my good lord , don ’ t make me insult music again with my awful singing .
come on , please sing .
listen to him speaking in quarter notes !
that ’ s a good song .
and a bad singer , my lord .
yes , do you hear me , balthasar ?
please , get some excellent music , because tomorrow we want to serenade lady hero at her bedroom window .
i ’ ll do the best i can , my lord .
what was it that you told me today—that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick ?
i didn ’ t , either .
maybe she ’ s just pretending .
yes , that ’ s quite likely .
no one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this , then .
why , what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?
what symptoms , my lord ?
she will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how .
yes , she did tell us .
please , please tell me !
i would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love .
i would have sworn that , too , my lord , especially against benedick .
has she told benedick how she feels ?
no , and she swears she never will .
that ’ s what ’ s driving her crazy .
it ’ s true , hero says so .
my daughter told me everything .
now that you speak of paper , i remember a funny story of hero ’ s .
yes , that ’ s the one .
if she won ’ t tell benedick , someone else should .
and what would that accomplish ?
he ’ ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more .
if he did that , it would be a charitable deed to hang him .
she ’ s an excellent , sweet woman , and there ’ s no doubt that she is virtuous .
and she is very smart .
i wish she were in love with me instead .
i would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife .
please , tell benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say .
is that a good idea , do you think ?
she ’ s probably right .
he ’ s a very proper man .
and i swear to god he ’ s very smart .
he does indeed show sparks of something like wit .
it ’ s entirely possible .
i can see you don ’ t like this gentleman .
but please tell me , who ’ s his best friend ?
he spends most of his time with the good , noble claudio .
oh god , benedick will plague him like a disease !
i ’ m going to make sure i stay on your good side , lady .
do that , my friend .
you will never fall victim to benedick ’ s charms , my niece .
no , not until we see a hot january .
if he fears god , he must necessarily keep the peace .
if he breaks the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
well , i ’ m sorry for your niece .
should we go find benedick and tell him about beatrice ’ s love ?
against my will , i ’ ve been told to bring you in to dinner .
lovely beatrice , i thank you for taking the pains to tell me that .
i didn ’ t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me .
if the job had been painful , i would not have come .
so you took pleasure in bringing me this message ?
yes , as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint .
you don ’ t want to eat , sir ?
if i don ’ t love her , i ’ m completely
margaret , run into the sitting room .
you ’ ll find beatrice there , talking to claudio and the prince .
she can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation .
do it well , and then leave us .
i ’ ll make her come right away , i promise you .
whenever i mention him , praise him more than any man deserves .
it ’ ll be my job to talk about how benedick is sick with love for beatrice .
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice that much ?
that ’ s what the prince and my fiancé say .
and did they ask you to tell beatrice about this , madam ?
why did you do that ?
doesn ’ t benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with beatrice ?
what ’ s the matter , lieutenant ?
i ’ ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave !
you ’ ll beat me ?
are you talking , you villain ?
no , don ’ t hit him , lieutenant !
please , sir , restrain yourself .
let me go , or i ’ ll knock you on the head .
come on , you ’ re drunk .
no , lieutenant—god , gentlemen—help—lieutenant—sir , montano—help , men ! —the night guard is coming !
who ’ s sounding that alarm ?
the whole town will riot !
you ’ ll be ashamed of this forever !
what is the matter here ?
i ’ ll kill him !
the general is talking to you !
stop , for god ’ s sake !
for heaven ’ s sake , stop this savage brawl !
stop that alarm from ringing , it ’ s scaring the islanders .
what ’ s the matter here , gentlemen ? —honest iago , you look upset .
i don ’ t know .
i ’ d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this !
you ’ re famous for it .
what in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler ?
othello , i ’ ve been seriously hurt .
all right , now i ’ m starting to lose my cool .
that ’ s unbelievably bad .
iago , who started it ?
you ’ re hitting close to home there .
i ’ d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about michael cassio .
but i don ’ t think it ’ ll hurt him to tell the truth .
they were nearly killing each other , as you saw when you pulled them apart .
i can ’ t tell you anything else .
i ’ ll make you an example for the others to learn from .
what ’ s the matter , dear ?
everything ’ s fine , now , sweetheart .
are you hurt , lieutenant ?
yes , but no doctor can help me .
oh i hope that ’ s not true !
you know i ’ m powerful enough to make you pay for this .
why are you talking about robbery ?
your grandsons will neigh to you like horses .
your whole family will be ruined .
what kind of crude jerk are you ?
the kind that tells you that the moor is having sex with your daughter right now .
you ’ re a villain !
you ’ re a senator !
you ’ re going to pay for this , roderigo .
i know who you are .
i ’ ll answer for everything .
my reputation , my reputation !
oh , my reputation , iago , my reputation !
i swear i thought you meant you ’ d been hurt physically .
your physical health matters more than your reputation .
you haven ’ t lost it unless you think you have .
there are lots of ways to get on the general ’ s good side again .
go to him , petition him .
ranting and raving to my own shadow !
oh , wine is the devil !
who were you chasing with your sword ?
what did he do to you ?
i don ’ t know .
i remember a jumble of impressions , but nothing distinctly .
i remember a fight , but not why we were fighting .
why do we party until we ’ re like animals ?
you seem all right now .
how did you get better ?
one weakness led to another , to make me hate myself .
come on , you ’ re being too hard on yourself .
i wish none of this had happened , given the situation here , and your rank .
but since this has happened , you should fix it for your own good .
even if i had a whole bunch of mouths , i wouldn ’ t be able to answer that .
i was a reasonable man , then i became a fool , and finally a beast !
every glass of liquor is damned , and the devil ’ s the main ingredient !
come on now , wine is good for you , if you know how to use it .
don ’ t say anything bad about wine anymore .
lieutenant , i think you know i ’ m your friend .
i know that , sir .
imagine , me , a drunk !
any man can get drunk sometime .
i ’ ll tell you what to do .
othello ’ s wife has a lot of influence now .
ask her to help you get back your position .
ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you .
that ’ s good advice .
early in the morning i ’ ll go visit desdemona and plead my case .
you ’ re doing the right thing .
good night , honest iago .
who can say i ’ m evil when my advice is so good ?
that ’ s really the best way to win the moor back again .
it ’ s easy to get desdemona on your side .
she ’ s full of good intentions .
how am i evil to advise cassio to do exactly what ’ ll do him good ?
i ’ ve spent most of my money , and tonight i got beaten up .
so with no money , but a little more wisdom , i ’ m going back to venice .
you ’ re a poor man if you ’ re this impatient !
no , it heals gradually .
we achieve things with our intelligence , not by magic , and intelligent planning takes time .
aren ’ t things going well ?
my god , it ’ s morning .
all this excitement has made the time fly by .
go back to where you ’ re staying and go to sleep .
now two things still need to be done .
i ’ ll put her on that .
yes , that ’ s the way i ’ ll do it .
i ’ ll pay you for your trouble .
oh , there ’ s the problem .
what ’ s the problem ?
well , we ’ ll stop , then .
if you ’ ve got any music that can ’ t be heard , then play that .
but as i said , the general isn ’ t really in the mood to hear music now .
we don ’ t have any music that can ’ t be heard .
then pack up your instruments and go away .
do you hear , my friend ?
please don ’ t play games .
cassio she ’ s awake , sir .
if she feels like coming over here , i ’ ll give her your message .
good to see you , iago .
you didn ’ t go to sleep , then ?
i ’ m going to ask her to let me talk to desdemona .
even for a good morning , lieutenant .
i ’ m sorry about what happened , but i ’ m sure everything will turn out all right .
the general and his wife are talking about it now , and she ’ s defending you strongly .
i ’ ll take you to a place where you can speak freely .
now that ’ s done , i ’ m going to walk on the fortification walls .
i will , my lord .
shall we go see this fortification , men ?
we ’ re at your service , my lord .
i ’ ll do everything i can for you , cassio .
i ’ m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before .
but if you didn ’ t know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us .
i ’ d never play pranks on you .
if she is , you can sue me for lying to you .
wake up my whole household !
it ’ s time for me to say goodbye to you .
i ’ m your advocate , and i ’ d rather die than give up on you .
madam , here comes your husband .
madam , i ’ d better leave now .
why not stay and hear me talk to him ?
i ’ m very uncomfortable , and that won ’ t help my case .
well , do whatever you think best .
i don ’ t like that .
nothing , my lord , or if i did—i don ’ t know what .
wasn ’ t that cassio leaving my wife ?
i really think it was him .
what ’ s this , my lord ?
i was talking to a petitioner here just now , someone who ’ s suffering from your anger .
please call him and tell him to come back here .
was that him just now ?
my love , call him back in here .
not now , my sweet desdemona .
but will it be soon ?
very soon , because you want it .
will it be tonight at supper ?
well then , tomorrow night , or tuesday morning .
or tuesday noon or at night , or wednesday morning .
please just name a time , but don ’ t wait more than three days .
so when should he come ?
i swear , i could do so much— please , no more .
i won ’ t refuse you anything .
i won ’ t deny you anything !
but in return , please , do one thing for me : leave me alone for a little while .
would i ever deny you anything ?
i ’ ll come see you right away .
god help me , i love you !
my noble lord— what is it , iago ?
when you were wooing desdemona , did michael cassio know about it ?
yes , he knew about it the whole time .
why are you curious , iago ?
i didn ’ t realize he knew her .
do you see something wrong with that ?
isn ’ t he an honest man ?
honest , yes , honest .
as far as i know , sir .
you ’ re thinking something .
just a minute ago i heard you say you didn ’ t like it when cassio left my wife .
what didn ’ t you like ?
if you ’ re my friend , tell me what you ’ re thinking .
my lord , you know i ’ m your friend .
if they ’ re not honest , they shouldn ’ t look like they are !
absolutely , people should be what they appear to be .
in that case , i think cassio ’ s an honest man .
no , i think there ’ s more to this than you ’ re letting on .
please tell me what you ’ re thinking—even your worst suspicions .
you want me to say what i ’ m thinking ?
what are you talking about ?
a good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike .
if you steal my money , you ’ re just stealing trash .
i ’ m going to find out what you ’ re thinking .
beware of jealousy , my lord !
it ’ s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours .
the person who ’ s poor and contented is rich enough .
god , help us not be jealous !
why are you telling me this ?
do you think i would live a life of jealousy , tormented by new suspicions every hour ?
if there ’ s any doubt , there is no doubt .
when a woman is virtuous , talents like these just make her better .
so please listen to me .
i ’ m not talking about proof yet .
i know the people of venice well .
they let god see things they wouldn ’ t show their husbands .
do you really think so ?
that ’ s right , she did .
well , there you go .
she was so young , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft !
but i ’ m sorry i ’ ve blurted all this out .
i beg your pardon for loving you too much .
i ’ m indebted to you forever .
you seem a little depressed about this .
not at all , not at all .
really , i ’ m afraid you are .
i hope you remember that i said all this because i love you .
but i see you ’ re troubled .
please don ’ t take what i said more seriously than it deserves to be taken .
cassio ’ s a good friend of mine—my lord , i can see you ’ re upset .
no , not too upset .
if you see anything else , let me know .
tell your wife to watch her .
leave me alone now , iago .
my lord , i ’ ll say goodbye now .
and affection , even if it ’ s just an act .
he and i will be there .
the rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness .
do you think they ’ re married ?
yes , i really think so .
oh , heaven , how did she get out ?
my own flesh and blood rebels against me !
fathers , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent .
are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray ?
have you ever heard of anything like that , roderigo ?
yes , sir , i have .
i think i can find him .
giving it back to him .
that will tell you a lot .
don ’ t worry about how i handle it .
i ’ ll say goodbye once more .
this iago is extremely honest and good , and he knows a lot about human behavior .
oh what a curse marriage is !
this is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men .
it ’ s our destiny , like death .
we are destined to be betrayed when we are born .
oh , here she comes .
if she ’ s cheated on me , then heaven itself is a fake .
i don ’ t believe it .
what ’ s going on , othello , darling ?
the nobles of cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you .
i have a that ’ s from lack of sleep .
it ’ ll go away .
let me wrap up your head , and it will feel okay in less than an hour .
come on , i ’ ll escort you to dinner .
i ’ m very sorry you ’ re not feeling well .
i ’ ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to iago .
heaven knows what he ’ s going to do with it .
what ’ s going on ?
what are you doing here alone ?
don ’ t snap at me .
i ’ ve got something for you .
you ’ ve got something for me ?
it ’ s a common what ?
to have a stupid wife .
oh , is that so ?
and what would you give me for the handkerchief ?
the one the moor gave to desdemona , which you asked me to steal so many times .
you stole it from her ?
look , here it is .
good girl , give it to me .
and what are you going to do with it ?
what ’ s it to you ?
if you don ’ t need it for some important reason , then give it back to me .
poor lady , she ’ ll go crazy when she sees it ’ s missing .
now go , leave me .
the moor ’ s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions .
no drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night .
she ’ s cheating on me ?
it is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little .
what ’ s with you , my lord ?
i had no idea she was cheating on me .
i never saw it or suspected it , so it never hurt me .
i slept well , ate well , and was happy .
i never saw cassio ’ s kisses on her lips .
i ’ m sorry to hear this .
oh , goodbye to my peace of mind !
goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great !
and you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods , goodbye !
othello ’ s career is over .
is this possible , my lord ?
has it come to this ?
show me , or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt .
oh , heaven help me !
aren ’ t you a rational human being ?
don ’ t you have any sense at all ?
what a horrible world we live in !
it ’ s not safe to be straightforward and honest .
you should always be honest .
i should always be wise .
i swear , i think my wife ’ s faithful , and i think she ’ s not .
i think you ’ re trustworthy one minute and then not the next .
i see you ’ re all eaten up with emotion .
i ’ m sorry i said anything .
yes , i want it , and i ’ ll get it .
how will you get proof ?
are you going to hide and watch them having sex ?
i think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched .
but if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof , we can get that .
give me one good reason to think she ’ s cheating on me .
i don ’ t like what you ’ re asking me to do .
i recently shared a bed with cassio , and i couldn ’ t sleep because of a raging toothache .
no , it was just a dream .
it ’ s a reason for suspicion , even though it ’ s just a dream .
and it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy .
i ’ ll tear her to pieces !
oh , i ’ d kill that bastard cassio forty thousand times if i could !
killing him once is not enough revenge .
now i see it ’ s true .
my heart feels like it ’ s full of poisonous snakes !
be patient , i ’ m telling you .
you may change your mind later .
i swear to god i ’ ll get revenge .
don ’ t get up yet .
let him command me , and i ’ ll do whatever he asks , no matter how violent .
i accept your devotion with my deepest love .
within the next three days i want to hear you tell me that cassio ’ s dead .
oh , damn her , damn her !
i ’ m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .
you ’ re my lieutenant now .
i ’ m yours forever .
i ’ ll stop at every house .
i ’ ll reward you for your troubles .
why do you say that ?
telling you where he ’ s sleeping is like telling you where i ’ m lying .
what on earth does that mean ?
can you ask around and find out ?
find him and tell him to come here .
i think i can do that .
where could i have lost that handkerchief , emilia ?
i don ’ t know , madam .
believe me , i ’ d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins .
he ’ s not jealous ?
i think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land .
look , here he comes .
i won ’ t leave him alone until he gives cassio his job back.—how are you , my lord ?
hot , hot and moist .
with a hand like this you need to
fast and pray to stave off temptations .
it ’ s a nice hand , an open one .
but these days , people give each other their hands without their hearts .
i don ’ t know about that .
now , don ’ t forget , you promised me something .
what did i promise , my dear ?
i sent for cassio to come talk with you .
i have a bad cold that ’ s bothering me .
no , the one i gave you .
i don ’ t have it with me .
that ’ s not good .
almost read people ’ s thoughts .
yes , it ’ s true .
there ’ s magic in its fabric .
a two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance .
the silk came from sacred silkworms , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts .
it ’ s absolutely true , so take good care of it .
i wish i had never seen it !
why are you yelling at me so angrily ?
tell me , is it missing ?
what do you have to say for yourself ?
it ’ s not lost , but what if it were ?
i ’ m telling you , it ’ s not lost .
bring me the handkerchief—my mind is full of doubt .
and you say he ’ s not jealous ?
i never saw him like this before .
they ’ re like stomachs and we ’ re just the food .
they eat us up hungrily , and when they ’ re full , they vomit us up .
look , here comes cassio and my husband .
there ’ s no other way .
she ’ s the one who ’ s got to do it .
go ahead and ask her .
then i could stop wondering , and find some other career .
if his face changed as much as his personality has , i wouldn ’ t recognize him .
you ’ ll just have to be patient for a little while .
i ’ ll do what i can , more than i ’ d do for myself .
let that be enough for you .
can he even get angry ?
if he ’ s angry , there must be something seriously wrong .
that ’ s the way it goes .
i hope to god it ’ s something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you .
i never gave him reason to be jealous .
but jealous people don ’ t think like that .
they ’ re never jealous for a reason ; they ’ re just jealous .
it ’ s like a monster that just grows and grows , out of nothing .
i hope god keeps that monster from growing in othello ’ s mind !
amen to that , lady .
i ’ ll go look for him—cassio , stay around here .
i thank you , lady .
why are you so far from home ?
how are you , my pretty bianca ?
to tell you the truth , i was just going to your house .
and i was just going to yours .
you ’ ve kept away from me for a week ?
seven days and seven nights ?
a hundred and sixty-eight hours ?
and lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones !
oh , cassio , where did you get this ?
has it come to this ?
oh , come on , woman .
well , whose is it ?
so i ’ d like it copied .
take it and do that for me , and leave me alone for a while .
and why ’ s that ?
it ’ s not because i don ’ t love you .
but you don ’ t love me .
i can only walk a little way with you , since i ’ m waiting here .
but i ’ ll see you soon .
all right , have it your way .
i have to make do .
nine or ten times i wanted to stab him under the ribs .
it ’ s better that you didn ’ t kill him .
but please tell me , sir , is your marriage let him do his worst .
the services i have done for the venetian government will count for more than his complaints will .
do you really think so ?
what do you mean , do i think so ?
what , just because they kissed in private ?
naked in bed together , but without doing anything ?
as long as they didn ’ t do anything , it would only be a minor sin .
but if i gave my wife a handkerchief— then what ?
her reputation is also her own .
can she give that away too ?
but a handkerchief— god , i wish i could forget about the handkerchief !
what you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he ’ s got my handkerchief !
yes , what about it ?
that ’ s not good .
what if i ’ d said i saw him do something to hurt you ?
yes , but he ’ d deny it all .
he said he did—i don ’ t know .
he was in bed with— with her ?
with her , on top of her—however you want to say it .
my god , it ’ s nauseating !
noses , ears , lips .
this is the way to trick gullible fools .
what ’ s the matter ?
this is his second fit like this .
no , don ’ t .
if you interrupt it , he ’ ll foam at the mouth and go crazy .
look , he ’ s moving .
why don ’ t you go away for a bit ?
when he leaves , it ’ s very important that i talk to you .
did you hit your head ?
are you making fun of me ?
i wish you could face your bad news like a man !
he ’ s subhuman , like an animal .
sir , be a man .
your case is better than that .
then i ’ ll know exactly what she is , just as i know what i am .
that ’ s for sure .
while you were dazed by grief—which isn ’ t appropriate for a man like you—cassio showed up here .
i got him to leave , and made up an excuse for your trance .
i told him to come back and talk to me in a bit , and he promised he would .
i ’ m telling you , just watch his face .
do you hear what i ’ m saying , iago ?
now i ’ ll ask cassio about bianca , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes .
whenever he talks about her he can ’ t stop laughing .
and when he laughs , othello will go crazy .
he ’ s laughing already !
i never knew a woman who loved a man so much .
the poor thing , i really think she loves me .
now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off .
have you heard this , cassio ?
he ’ s asking him to tell the story again .
go on , tell it .
she says you ’ re going to marry her .
ha , ha , ha !
do you think you ’ ve won ?
please give me a little credit !
i ’ m not that stupid .
ha , ha , ha !
so , so , so , so !
she thinks i ’ ll marry her because she loves me .
iago is gesturing for me to come closer .
now he ’ s telling the story .
she was here just now .
she hangs around me all the time .
i was talking to some venetians down by the shore , and the fool showed up .
ha , ha , ha !
now he ’ s saying how she took him into our bedroom .
look out , here she comes .
what did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ?
i was an idiot to take it !
you want me to copy the embroidery pattern ?
what is it , my dear bianca ?
my god , that ’ s my handkerchief !
if you want to come have dinner with me , you can .
if you don ’ t want to , then good riddance .
go after her , go .
will you be having dinner with her tonight ?
did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?
and did you see the handkerchief ?
it was yours , i swear .
and do you see how much your foolish wife means to him ?
she gave it to him , and he gave it to his whore .
i wish i could keep killing him for nine years straight .
oh , she ’ s a fine woman !
no , you have to forget all that now .
yes , let her die and rot and go to hell tonight .
oh , the world never saw a sweeter creature .
but that ’ s not how you ’ re going to be .
she ’ s so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician .
oh , she could sing a wild bear to sleep !
oh , she ’ s so witty and creative !
all the worse that she stooped this low , then .
oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has !
yes , a little too sweet .
yes , that ’ s for sure .
oh , it ’ s dreadful , dreadful , iago !
if you still feel so affectionate toward her , then why not give her permission to cheat on you ?
i ’ ll chop her into pieces .
oh , it ’ s horrible of her .
get me some poison tonight , iago .
i won ’ t argue with her , so her beautiful body won ’ t disarm me.—tonight , iago .
don ’ t do it with poison .
strangle her in her bed , the same bed she ’ s contaminated .
good , good , i like that—it ’ s only fair !
and let me kill cassio .
you ’ ll hear more from me by midnight .
that ’ s her father and his friends , who ’ ve been roused out of bed .
you ’ d better go inside .
no , i must let them find me .
my good qualities , my legal status as desdemona ’ s husband , and my innocence will protect me .
i don ’ t think so .
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant ?
what ’ s going on ?
he needs to see you right away .
what do you think he wants ?
i think it ’ s important .
they ’ re very anxious for you to get there .
when you weren ’ t at home , the senate sent out three different search parties to find you .
it ’ s good you found me .
what ’ s that trumpet for ?
i think someone ’ s coming from venice .
look , your wife is with him .
the duke and senators of venice greet you .
what ’ s new , cousin lodovico ?
very nice to see you , sir .
well , he ’ s alive .
are you sure of that ?
he didn ’ t say anything , he ’ s reading .
so there ’ s a rift between othello and cassio ?
i ’ d do anything to bring them back together , since i really care for cassio .
excuse me , my lord ?
are you in your right mind ?
i think they want him to go home and appoint cassio governor in his place .
i ’ m happy about that .
oh , are you really !
i ’ m glad you ’ re insane enough to admit it in front of me .
why , sweet othello— i haven ’ t done anything to deserve this !
oh , you devil , you devil !
get out of my sight !
i wouldn ’ t want to stay here and make you angry .
she ’ s obedient—a fine lady .
please , my lord , call her back .
what do you want with her , sir ?
see how well she can turn ?
she can turn and turn , and then turn on you again .
and she can cry , sir—oh , how she can cry !
cassio can have my job .
and tonight , sir , i invite you have dinner with me .
is this the same moor whom the senate considers so capable ?
he ’ s changed a great deal .
is he losing his mind ?
he is what he is .
i won ’ t say anything negative about what he might be .
if he isn ’ t what he might be , then i wish to god he were !
it ’ s true , that wasn ’ t such a nice thing to do .
but i wish i could say that ’ s the last time he ’ ll do it !
is it a habit of his ?
oh , it ’ s too bad !
it wouldn ’ t be right for me to tell you everything i ’ ve seen and heard .
just go after him and watch what he does next .
i ’ m sorry i was so wrong about him .
you haven ’ t seen anything , then ?
no , and i didn ’ t hear anything either , or suspect anything at all .
but you ’ ve seen her and cassio together .
yes , but i didn ’ t see anything wrong , and i heard every syllable they said .
didn ’ t they ever whisper ?
or ask you to leave the room ?
not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ?
tell her to come here .
she says all the right things , but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story .
i ’ ve seen her do it .
my lord , what do you want ?
please , dear , come here .
what can i do for you ?
let me see your eyes .
what horrible thing are you imagining ?
i can tell you ’ re furious , but i don ’ t understand what you ’ re saying .
go ahead , swear to that , so you ’ ll be damned to hell for lying .
heaven knows you ’ re as unfaithful as hell .
leave me alone , desdemona , go away !
if you ’ ve been ordered back to venice because of my father , don ’ t blame me .
you may have lost his respect , but so have i .
even that i could put up with .
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from , has rejected me !
even the goddess of patience couldn ’ t look at this and be patient—it ’ s too horrifying !
i hope you think i ’ m faithful to you .
as faithful as flies in rotting meat , which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows .
oh , i wish you ’ d never been born !
have i done something to offend you without knowing it ?
was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore ?
i swear to god you ’ re accusing me wrongly !
so you ’ re saying you ’ re not a whore ?
no , i ’ m as honest as i am christian .
what , you ’ re not a whore ?
no , i swear it .
oh , heaven help us !
i mistook you for that sly venetian woman who married othello.—you whorehouse-keeper .
we ’ ve finished our business .
here ’ s some money for you .
please lock the door and keep quiet .
what ’ s he talking about ?
how are you , madam ?
ensign , what ’ s he doing in there ?
tonight he boarded a treasure ship .
if he can keep it , he ’ ll be set forever .
i don ’ t understand .
here comes another group looking for you .
he intends to do something bad to you .
sir , it ’ s the moor .
get him , he ’ s a thief !
i don ’ t have a lord .
don ’ t talk to me , emilia .
it ’ s fair for him to treat me like this , very fair .
what have i ever done that he has anything to complain about ?
what can i do for you , madam ?
i don ’ t know .
when grown-ups teach little children , they do it gently and easily .
what ’ s the matter , lady ?
am i that name , iago ?
what my lord said i was .
why did he do that ?
i don ’ t know .
i just know i ’ m not one .
don ’ t cry , don ’ t cry .
what a day this is !
doesn ’ t that make you want to cry ?
it ’ s just my bad luck .
how did he get such an idea ?
i bet my life on it .
nobody ’ s that bad .
if there is , then heaven help him !
why should he call her a whore ?
who ’ s been with her ?
the moor is being tricked by some crook , some terrible villain , some rotten bastard .
oh , to hell with those people !
you ’ re a fool .
oh god , iago , what can i do to win my husband back again ?
please go to him , my friend .
i swear i have no idea why he stopped loving me .
then i hope i have a life of misery !
unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it ’ ll never destroy my love .
i can ’ t say “ whore. ” it makes me sick to say the word even now .
political business is bothering him , and he ’ s just taking it out on you .
if only that were all it is— it is , i promise .
those trumpets are calling us in to dinner .
the venetians are waiting for their food .
go in , and don ’ t cry .
everything will be all right .
how are you , roderigo ?
i don ’ t think you ’ re treating me fairly .
what makes you say that ?
well , i won ’ t take it any longer .
will you listen to me , roderigo ?
your words and actions don ’ t match up .
that ’ s not fair .
it ’ s the truth .
well , all right then .
fine ! ” he says .
all right ! ” it ’ s not fine , and i ’ m not all right !
it ’ s wrong , and i ’ m starting to realize i ’ m being cheated !
it ’ s not okay !
i ’ m going to tell desdemona my feelings .
if she returns my jewels , i ’ ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her .
if not , i ’ ll challenge you to a duel .
you ’ ve said what you have to say now .
yes , and i ’ ll do everything i just said .
from this moment on i have a higher opinion of you than before .
give me your hand , roderigo .
it doesn ’ t look that way to me .
well , what ’ s your plan ?
venice has made cassio governor here on cyprus .
then desdemona and othello will go back to venice .
what do you mean , get rid of him ?
i mean knock his brains out , so he can ’ t take othello ’ s place .
and that ’ s what you want me to do !
yes , if you want to help yourself .
he ’ s having dinner tonight with a prostitute , and i ’ ll go visit him .
he doesn ’ t know he ’ s been appointed governor yet .
i ’ ll be nearby to help you , and between the two of us we can handle him .
it ’ s nearly dinner time , and the night ’ s going to be wasted .
i want to hear more about this .
please , sir , don ’ t trouble yourself .
you ’ re most welcome .
would you walk out with me , sir ? —oh , desdemona— yes , my lord ?
go to bed right this minute .
i ’ ll be there shortly .
i will , my lord .
he looks calmer than he did before .
that ’ s what he said .
so give me my nightgown , emilia , and i ’ ll say goodnight .
we shouldn ’ t displease him .
i wish you ’ d never met him .
that ’ s not what i wish .
i put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked .
it doesn ’ t matter .
oh , how silly we are !
if i die before you do make sure i ’ m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin .
don ’ t be silly !
i can ’ t get that song out of my head tonight .
should i get your nightgown ?
no , just help me unpin this .
that lodovico is a good-looking man .
he ’ s very handsome .
it ’ s the wind .
my eyes itch—is that an omen i ’ ll be crying soon ?
no , it doesn ’ t mean anything .
i heard someone say that ’ s what it means .
oh , these men , these men !
there are women like that out there , no question .
come on , i ’ ll fight you .
sir , your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do .
you evil thief , where have you hidden my daughter ?
you devil , you ’ ve put a spell on her !
it ’ s obvious to everyone that you ’ ve tricked her , drugged her , or kidnapped her .
if he struggles , use force !
where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ?
would you ever do such a thing for all the world ?
why , wouldn ’ t you ?
by the light of heaven , no , i would not !
i wouldn ’ t either , by daylight .
it would be easier to do it in the dark .
could you really do such a thing , for all the world ?
the world ’ s huge .
it ’ s a big prize for such a small sin .
i don ’ t think you would .
actually i think i would , and then i ’ d undo it after i did it .
but for the whole world ?
who wouldn ’ t cheat on her husband to make him king ?
i ’ d risk my soul for that .
i ’ d never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world !
i don ’ t think any woman like that exists .
yes , a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world , in fact .
but i do think it ’ s the husband ’ s fault if we wives cheat on them .
husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too .
they see , smell , and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands .
is it out of lust ?
then tell them to treat us well .
good night , good night .
here , stand behind this wall ; he ’ ll come right away .
don ’ t be afraid .
i ’ ll be right next to you .
this will either make us or break us .
i ’ m right behind you .
be bold , and get ready .
i don ’ t really want to do this , but he ’ s given me good reasons .
i guess it ’ s only one man—no big deal .
i know the sound of his walk.—die , villain !
oh , i ’ m dead !
i ’ ll be crippled forever !
that ’ s cassio ’ s voice .
iago has kept his word .
oh , what a villain i am !
that ’ s the truth .
brave iago , how honest and trustworthy you are !
you teach me how i should act .
whore , your lover ’ s dead now , and you ’ ll be going to hell soon .
i ’ m coming , slut !
i ’ ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart .
isn ’ t there a guard around ?
something ’ s wrong , the man sounds panicked .
i ’ ve acted like such a villain !
two or three men are groaning .
but it ’ s dark out , and it could be a trap .
it ’ s not safe to go near them till we get more help .
i ’ ll bleed to death .
here ’ s someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons .
who ’ s shouting “ murder ” ?
we don ’ t know .
didn ’ t you hear someone shouting ?
i ’ m here , here !
for heaven ’ s sake , help me !
he ’ s a good man .
is that you , iago ?
i ’ m here , i ’ ve been destroyed by villains !
what villains did this to you ?
i think one of them is nearby and can ’ t get away .
that ’ s one of them .
killing men in the dark ?
are you good or evil ?
cassio ’ s been wounded .
how are you doing , brother ?
my leg ’ s been cut in two .
bring me some light , gentlemen , i ’ ll bind the wound with my shirt .
what ’ s the matter ?
oh , my dear cassio !
oh , cassio , cassio , cassio !
cassio , do you know who might have stabbed you like this ?
i ’ m sorry to find you like this .
i ’ ve been looking all over for you .
oh cassio , cassio , cassio !
do you recognize this face ?
that ’ s the one , sir .
i ’ m glad to see you .
how are you doing , cassio ? —someone bring me a stretcher !
it ’ s him , it ’ s him .
good—here ’ s the stretcher .
get somebody strong to carry him out of here .
i ’ ll get the general ’ s surgeon .
there wasn ’ t any problem .
i don ’ t even know him .
keep an eye on her .
the guilty speak volumes even when they ’ re silent .
what ’ s the matter ?
what ’ s the matter , husband ?
cassio was attacked here in the dark by roderigo and men who escaped .
he ’ s near death , and roderigo ’ s dead already .
oh , no , good gentleman !
oh no , good cassio !
this is what happens when you visit whores .
please , emilia , ask cassio where he was at dinner tonight.—
he ate at my house , but that doesn ’ t make me nervous .
i order you to come with me .
go to hell , you whore !
emilia , go to the castle and tell othello and desdemona what happened.—will you please go now ?
to prison , until you ’ re called into court .
his messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately , on pressing state business .
the duke ’ s in a meeting right now , and he ’ s sent for you too .
the duke ’ s in a meeting ?
at this time of night ?
the law ’ s on my side .
if we let crimes like this happen , slaves and heathens will be our rulers .
i have to do it , i have to do it .
but she ’ s got to die , or she ’ ll cheat on other men .
put out the light of the candle , and then put out the light of her heart .
if i extinguish the candle , i can light it again if i regret it .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
oh , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
i ’ ll wait over here .
i don ’ t want to kill you before you ’ ve readied your soul .
no , i don ’ t want to send your soul to hell when i kill you .
you ’ re talking about killing ?
then heaven have mercy on me .
amen to that , from the bottom of my heart .
if you really feel that way , then i hope you won ’ t kill me .
i don ’ t know why i should be afraid , since i haven ’ t done anything wrong .
but i ’ m still afraid .
my only sin was loving you too much .
yes , that ’ s why you have to die .
you ’ re wrong to kill me for loving you .
why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ?
you ’ re shaking with emotion .
these are bad omens , but i hope , i hope , they don ’ t predict my future .
what ’ s this all about ?
you gave that handkerchief , the one i loved and gave to you , to cassio .
no , i swear by my life and soul !
bring him here and ask him .
you ’ re on your deathbed .
but i ’ m not dying yet !
so confess your sin freely now .
you ’ re going to die .
then heaven have mercy on me !
and you have mercy on me too !
i never gave him any token of romantic love .
i saw him holding the handkerchief !
he ’ s already done so .
that he had sex with you .
he wouldn ’ t say that .
honest iago ’ s arranged that .
what , is he dead ?
oh , he ’ s been betrayed , and i ’ ve been ruined .
send me away , my lord , but don ’ t kill me !
kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight .
no , if you struggle with me— just half an hour !
just let me say one prayer !
it ’ s too late .
what ’ s that noise ?
aren ’ t you dead yet ?
yes , it ’ s emilia .
what ’ s the matter with you now ?
yes , just now , my lord .
cassio ’ s killed a young venetian named roderigo .
roderigo ’ s been killed ?
and cassio ’ s killed ?
no , cassio wasn ’ t killed .
cassio ’ s not dead ?
then the wrong man is dead , and sweet revenge has gone wrong .
oh , i ’ ve been murdered unfairly !
oh lord , who ’ s that crying ?
oh , no , that was my lady ’ s voice .
oh , lady , speak again .
oh sweet mistress , speak !
i ’ m dying an innocent woman .
oh , who did this thing ?
give my love to my kind husband .
why , how could she have been murdered ?
my god , who knows ?
you heard her say it wasn ’ t me .
yes , she said that .
i must go report what happened .
she was lying even as she was going down to hell .
then she was even more an angel , and you ’ re an even blacker devil !
she cheated on me , and she was a whore .
you slander her , you devil .
she was fickle and unfaithful , like water .
she was utterly true to you !
ask your husband if you doubt me .
your husband knew about everything .
he said she was unfaithful ?
yes , he ’ s the one who first told me about her .
he ’ s an honest man who detests evil actions .
why do you keep repeating that , woman ?
i ’ m telling you , your husband .
oh , my mistress , a villain has made a mockery of your love !
my husband said she was unfaithful !
yes , him , woman .
i said “ your husband. ” —do you understand that word ?
my friend , your husband , the honest , honest iago .
if he said that , then i hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever .
he ’ s lying through his teeth !
she was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that !
go ahead , do your worst .
you weren ’ t good enough for her .
you ’ d better shut up !
i ’ ll tell everyone what you did , even if it
the moor ’ s killed my mistress !
what ’ s the matter ?
what ’ s going on here , general ?
oh , are you here , iago ?
you ’ ve done a good job , that other men can attribute their murders to you !
what ’ s the matter ?
i told him what i thought .
but did you tell him she cheated on him ?
then you told a lie , a sick , wicked lie .
i swear on my soul it was a lie .
you said she slept with cassio .
my mistress here lies murdered in her bed— no , heaven forbid !
you can ’ t trust them .
it ’ s true , they ’ re inconsistent .
my letters say there are a hundred and seven ships .
and mine say a hundred and forty .
and mine say two hundred .
but often in these cases , reports are just estimates .
yes , we get the idea .
it ’ s a messenger from the warships .
and your lies caused this murder .
i ’ ll kill myself out of grief !
oh , evil , evil !
i ’ m ordering you , go home .
good gentlemen , give me permission to speak .
i know i ought to obey my husband , but not now .
maybe i ’ ll never go home again , iago !
yes , go ahead and moan , because you killed the sweetest , most innocent woman who ever lived !
i ’ m glad your father isn ’ t alive to see this .
it would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell .
it ’ s sad , but iago knows she had sex with cassio a thousand times .
damn it , shut your mouth .
let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up .
if you ’ re smart , you ’ ll go home .
drawing your sword on a woman ?
oh , you stupid moor !
i found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband .
he ’ d begged me to steal it many times .
you think she gave it to cassio ?
no , i found it and gave it to my husband .
you piece of filth , you ’ re lying !
i swear i ’ m not lying .
he ’ s killed his wife !
lay me next to my mistress .
he ’ s gone , and his wife ’ s dead .
kill him rather than let him leave this room .
but why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did ?
what did your song mean , lady ?
i ’ ll die like a swan .
they sing when they die .
uncle , i ’ m coming out !
