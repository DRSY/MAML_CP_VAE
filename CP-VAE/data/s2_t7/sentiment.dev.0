look in on me , and talk with me , or i ’ ll attack even without a weapon .
what ’ s the matter ?
look , i have a weapon , the best sword a soldier could have .
i ’ ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon .
who can control his fate ?
i ’ m not like that now .
don ’ t be afraid , even though you see me with a weapon .
this is the end of my journey , the end of my life .
are you backing away in fear ?
there ’ s no reason to be afraid .
where would othello go ? —oh , look at you !
you ’ re as pale as your nightgown !
you ’ re cold , cold , and you were never hot with lust .
whip me , you devils , so i don ’ t have to look at this heavenly sight !
where is that poor rash man ?
you mean the man who used to be othello ?
where ’ s that snake ?
i don ’ t like it that you knew about this , iago .
damn it , you ’ re not listening to me !
you told me you hated him .
but that ’ s just a fairy tale .
if you are a devil , i won ’ t be able to kill you .
take his sword away from him .
i ’ m bleeding , but you didn ’ t kill me .
i ’ m not sorry , either .
i want you to live , since to me , death is happiness .
this poor guy ’ s partly confessed his plan .
did you plan cassio ’ s death with him ?
dear general , i never gave you any reason to hate me .
i believe you , and i ask you to forgive me .
will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul ?
don ’ t ask me anything .
you know what you know .
from this moment on , i ’ ll never say another word .
what , not even to pray ?
well , do your best .
this one talks about how roderigo should kill cassio .
oh , you wicked scoundrel !
cassio , how did you get my wife ’ s handkerchief ?
you ’ re stripped of your power and your command , and cassio will govern cyprus .
you ’ ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the venetian government.—okay , take him away .
when you record these sad events in your letters , please describe me exactly as i am .
don ’ t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility .
oh , what a bloody end to all this !
everything we ’ ve heard is bad .
what do you think about this change ?
they can ’ t have changed ; there ’ s no way this could be true .
it ’ s a trick to confuse us .
here ’ s some more news coming in .
that ’ s just what i thought .
how many , can you guess ?
now they ’ ve turned around and are clearly heading for cyprus .
then it ’ s certain they ’ re heading for cyprus .
is marcus luccicos in town ?
no , he ’ s in florence .
here come brabantio and the brave moor .
forgive me , your grace .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
it ’ s my daughter !
she ’ s dead to me .
i humbly thank you , sir .
we ’ re sorry to hear this .
nothing , but this is true .
there ’ s nothing more .
i ’ m awkward in my speech and i ’ m not a smooth talker .
she blushes at the slightest thing .
the devil must be behind this .
therefore i say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her .
or did you agree to this as equals ?
you know where she is .
when i talked about all these things , desdemona used to listen attentively .
i took the hint and spoke to her .
that ’ s the only witchcraft i ever used .
here comes my wife now .
she ’ ll confirm everything .
i think a story like that would win my own daughter over .
if she admits she wanted this , then i won ’ t blame othello.—come here , my child .
who do you obey here ?
father , this isn ’ t easy for me .
you ’ re the one i have to obey .
i ’ m your daughter .
i ’ m finished , then .
duke , please go ahead with your state business .
i ’ d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—come here , moor .
you would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—i ’ m done , my lord .
please , i ’ m asking you , go ahead and get back to your state affairs .
the turks are heading for cyprus with a powerful fleet .
she can stay at her father ’ s house .
i won ’ t allow it .
dear duke , please listen to what i have to say .
what do you want to do , desdemona ?
when i fell in love with othello i made up my mind that i wanted to live with him .
i saw othello ’ s true face when i saw his mind .
let me go with him .
please allow her to do this .
you can decide that privately .
what ’ s important is the urgency of this mission .
you ’ ll have to leave tonight .
with all my heart , i ’ ll go right away .
we ’ ll meet again at nine in the morning .
he ’ ll accompany my wife , and bring whatever else you think i might need .
which any peace-lover can do .
his military understanding is all theory , no practice .
and there ’ s nothing i can do about it .
that ’ s the curse of military service .
now , you tell me : should i feel loyal to the moor ?
if you don ’ t like him you should quit .
i ’ m serving under him to take advantage of him .
we can ’ t all be masters , and not all masters should be followed .
they ought to be whipped for being so stupid .
keep an eye on her , moor .
she lied to me , and she may lie to you .
iago , i ’ m leaving my dear desdemona with you .
have your wife attend to her , and bring them along as soon as you can .
we ’ re on a tight schedule .
what do you have to say , noble friend ?
what do you think i should do ?
go to bed , and sleep .
i ’ m going to go drown myself .
if you do that , i ’ ll never respect you again .
why , you silly man !
can ’ t help it ?
what we are is up to us .
our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener .
thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts .
i don ’ t believe it .
you feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower .
come on , be a man .
drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don ’ t drown yourself !
i ’ ve told you i ’ m your friend , and i ’ ll stick by you .
i ’ ve never been more useful to you than i will be now .
here ’ s what you ’ ll do .
moors are moody people.—so sell your lands and raise a lot of cash .
what seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter .
she ’ ll have to have it .
so have your money ready .
if you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself .
raise all the money you can .
and to hell with drowning yourself !
that ’ s completely beside the point .
go now and get cash .
i told you before , and i ’ ll tell you again and again : i hate the moor .
so let ’ s join forces and get revenge .
we ’ ll speak again tomorrow .
where will we meet in the morning ?
i ’ ll be there early .
no more talk about killing yourself , okay ?
i ’ ve changed my mind about that .
put a lot of cash together .
i ’ m going to sell all my land .
that ’ s how i always do it , getting money from fools .
i ’ m not sure it ’ s true , but just the suspicion is enough for me .
he thinks highly of me .
cassio ’ s a handsome man .
let ’ s see , how can i
get his position and use him to hurt othello at the same time ?
i ’ ve worked it out .
what can you see out on the ocean ?
it was windy on shore too .
a big blast of wind shook our fortifications .
what do you think will be the result of this storm ?
the turkish navy will be broken up .
i ’ ve never seen the waters so disturbed .
if the turkish fleet isn ’ t protected in some harbor , their men must all be drowned .
no ship could survive this storm .
i ’ ve got news , boys , the war ’ s over !
this terrible storm has smashed the turks so badly that their plans are ruined .
one of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked .
michael cassio , lieutenant of the moor othello , has arrived on shore .
the moor himself is still at sea .
i ’ m happy about that .
he ’ ll be a good governor .
the two of them were separated during the storm .
i hope to god othello ’ s all right .
let ’ s do that .
every minute we expect more ships to arrive .
thanks , you brave men who defend this island and respect othello .
i hope heaven protects him from the weather , because i lost sight of him on the stormy sea .
yes , it ’ s well built , and the ship ’ s pilot is very expert and experienced .
what ’ s all that shouting about ?
please go find out for certain who has arrived .
i ’ ll do that .
good lieutenant , is your general married ?
a man named iago , the general ’ s ensign .
look , the precious desdemona has arrived on shore .
we should all kneel before her , men of cyprus !
greetings , my lady , and may god always be with you .
thank you , brave cassio .
is there any news about my husband ?
he hasn ’ t arrived yet .
as far as i know , he ’ s okay and will arrive here soon .
oh , but i ’ m worried .
how did you two get separated ?
go find out the news .
i ’ m not who i appear to be .
do it , and shout like the city ’ s on fire .
check on your daughter , your house , your money !
she ’ s always talking when i want to sleep .
i admit that in front of you , my lady , she keeps a bit quiet .
you have no reason to say that .
come on , come on .
in your own kitchens you act like wildcats .
shame on you , you slanderer !
no , it ’ s true , or if it ’ s not , i ’ m a villain .
you wake up to have fun , and you start work when you go to bed .
no , i don ’ t .
but if you had to say something nice about me , what would you say ?
don ’ t make me do it , my lady .
i ’ m critical by nature .
i ’ m not as happy as i seem .
come on , what would you say about me ?
this is getting worse and worse !
what if she ’ s pretty but stupid ?
you don ’ t know a thing !
you give your best praise to the worst women .
would raise babies and clip coupons .
oh , that ’ s pathetic !
don ’ t listen to him , emilia , even though he ’ s your husband .
what do you think about him , cassio ?
isn ’ t he a horrible man ?
he speaks bluntly , madam .
he ’ s more of a soldier than a wise man .
let ’ s go greet him when he lands .
look , here he comes .
i ’ m amazed you got here before me .
but i ’ m overjoyed !
god willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older .
i can ’ t talk about my happiness anymore .
it ’ s too much .
let ’ s go up to the castle .
the war ’ s over and the turks are drowned .
and bring the ship ’ s captain to the castle .
he ’ s a good man.—let ’ s go , desdemona .
meet me down at the harbor.—come here .
lieutenant cassio will be on guard duty tonight .
but first , i have to tell you that desdemona ’ s completely in love with him .
be quiet and listen to me .
othello isn ’ t any of those things .
i can ’ t believe that .
she ’ s very moral .
they were lusting after each other .
but listen to me ; let me guide you .
i brought you here from venice .
be on guard duty tonight .
cassio doesn ’ t know you .
i ’ ll be nearby .
he ’ s hot-tempered , and he might try to hit you with his staff .
try to get him to do that .
to get what you want , you need to get cassio out of the way .
i ’ ll do it , if you help me out .
meet me in a little while at the citadel .
i need to get othello ’ s things from the ship .
i won ’ t be satisfied until i get even with him , wife for wife .
for besides the good news , we are also celebrating his marriage .
that ’ s the end of the announcement .
there will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven .
god bless the island of cyprus and our noble general othello !
iago ’ s a good man .
come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—come with me , my dear love .
it ’ s time for us to stand guard .
the general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with desdemona.—i can ’ t blame him .
what ’ s the reason for this horrible shouting ?
what ’ s the matter ?
sir , is everyone in your family at home ?
why are you asking me that ?
for god ’ s sake , sir , you ’ ve been robbed .
your heart ’ s going to break .
it ’ s like half your soul ’ s been ripped out .
at this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb .
wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens .
get up , i tell you !
do you recognize my voice , noble lord ?
my name ’ s roderigo .
i told you not to hang around my house .
i ’ ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you .
yes , she ’ s young and tender .
but she ’ s modest and ladylike too .
and when she speaks , doesn ’ t her voice stir up passion ?
she ’ s a perfect woman , it ’ s true .
well , good luck to them tonight in bed !
i ’ m not much of a drinker .
i wish there was less social pressure to drink .
oh , but these are our friends .
i ’ ll do most of the drinking for you .
what are you talking about , man ?
i ’ ll do it , but i don ’ t like it .
if the future turns out as i hope it will , i ’ m all set for success .
my god , they ’ ve given me a lot to drink .
no , it was a little one , not more than a pint .
my god , what a great song !
i learned it in england , where they have a talent for drinking .
are englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?
they drink danes under the table , and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink germans .
let ’ s drink to our general !
i ’ ll drink as much as you do !
god , that song ’ s even better than the other one .
do you want to hear it again ?
no , because we shouldn ’ t be doing that—stuff .
that ’ s true , lieutenant .
speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—i hope i ’ m going to heaven .
okay , but please not before me .
the lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign .
by the way , i don ’ t want anyone thinking i ’ m drunk .
i ’ m not drunk .
i can stand well enough , and i can speak just fine .
yes , you ’ re speaking very well .
so don ’ t think that i ’ m drunk .
it ’ s too bad .
but is he often like this ?
he drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep .
he ’ d stay up all night and all day if he didn ’ t drink himself to sleep .
the general should be informed about this .
don ’ t you think so ?
we should definitely say something to the moor .
now i ’ ve done a good day ’ s work .
you must all keep up this united front .
don ’ t simply hide your hatred .
swear your love for each other .
on my honor , i swear i love rivers with all my heart .
and i love hastings with all my heart .
take my hand , hastings .
dorset , embrace hastings.—hastings , express your affection for the marquess of dorset .
i swear i will never break this promise of love .
and so do i , my lord .
noble buckingham , your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart .
and just in time , here he comes with sir richard ratcliffe .
good morning to my sovereign king and queen .
happy indeed , the way we have spent the day .
what blessed work , my king .
i hate it and want all good men ’ s love .
today shall always be remembered as a holy day .
if only all struggles ended this well .
please pardon our brother clarence .
why , madam , have i offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king ?
who doesn ’ t know that the good duke is dead ?
who doesn ’ t know he ’ s dead ?
oh my god , what a terrible world this is !
do i look as pale as everyone else does , lord dorset ?
but i reversed the death sentence .
well , the poor man died by your first order , which was carried by a winged messenger .
some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order , who came after clarence was already buried .
my soul is full of sorrow .
i will not rise until your highness hears me .
then hurry up and tell me what you want .
we know you have a job to do , brakenbury , and we ’ ll do what you say .
it doesn ’ t make either of us happy , i know .
well , your imprisonment won ’ t last long .
in the meantime , be patient .
go walk the path that you will never return from .
but who ’ s coming ?
good afternoon , my dear lord !
the same to you , my lord !
welcome to the open air again .
how did you tolerate prison ?
but his punishment was bitter death .
who pleaded with me to pardon
this is what happens when you act rashly .
oh , they continually urged the king to do it .
but come , lords , will you come with me to edward ’ s room to comfort him ?
we ’ ll come with you , your grace .
tell me , good grandmother , is our father dead ?
my pretty children , both of you misunderstand me .
so you ’ re admitting clarence , my father , is dead .
my uncle the king is to blame for this .
quiet , children , quiet .
the king loves you very much .
innocent sweethearts , you have no idea who ’ s responsible for your father ’ s death .
you think my uncle was lying , grandmother ?
i can ’ t believe that .
what ’ s that noise ?
i plan to fall into the blackest despair .
why are the branches still living when the root is gone ?
why aren ’ t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up ?
if you do intend to live , then mourn .
i could drown the world .
my poor husband , my dear edward !
our poor father , clarence !
my sons edward and clarence !
what support did i have other than edward ?
and now he ’ s gone .
what support did we have besides our father ?
and now he ’ s gone .
and now they ’ re both gone .
there has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me .
there have never been orphans who ’ ve suffered what we have .
there was never a mother who suffered so much loss .
alas , i am the mother of all these others ' griefs .
be a careful mother , madam , and think about your son , the young prince .
your peace of mind depends on him .
all of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king .
on my knee , i humbly ask your blessing .
god bless you and make you obedient , loving , and kind .
though we have lost a generous king , we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king .
we must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again .
why only a few courtiers , my lord of buckingham ?
the king made peace among all of us .
and so do i. i think we all do .
so , i agree with noble buckingham—only a few should go to meet the prince .
you are my other self , my oracle , my prophet , my dear brother !
good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
i ’ m telling you , i hardly know myself .
did you hear the news that ’ s going around ?
yes , that the king is dead .
good day to you , sir .
is it true that good king edward has died ?
yes , sir , it ’ s all too true , god help us .
then , gentlemen , we can count on trouble .
no , no , with god ’ s help , his son will be king .
it ’ s bad news when a country is ruled by a child .
with patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
what ’ s the news abroad ?
where is he , in his bed ?
you go ahead , and i will follow you .
come , come , we ’ re worrying about the worst-case scenario .
i ’ m sure everything will be fine .
when storms arrive early , you can expect the harvest will be damaged .
it ’ s always like this in times of change .
but leave it all to god .
where are you all off to ?
the court has sent for us .
they ’ ll be here tomorrow or the next day .
i ’ m dying to see the prince .
i hope he ’ s grown a lot since i last saw him .
yes , mother , but i wish i hadn ’ t .
it ’ s good to grow .
well , it certainly wasn ’ t true for richard !
and no doubt he is , gracious madam .
i hope he is , but mothers get to have their doubts .
what would you have said , my young york ?
it took me two years before i had a single tooth .
grandmother , this would have been a biting joke .
pretty york , who told you about his teeth ?
why , she was dead before you were even born .
well , if it wasn ’ t her , i don ’ t know .
come , come , you are too clever for your own good .
good lady , don ’ t be angry with the child .
little pitchers have big ears .
what ’ s the news ?
my lord , it ’ s news i wish i didn ’ t have to report .
how ’ s the prince ?
he ’ s fine and healthy , madam .
the powerful dukes gloucester and buckingham .
what did they do wrong ?
i ’ ve told you everything i know .
i see the downfall of my family .
welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre !
the tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy .
i want more uncles here to welcome me .
those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous .
your grace heard their saccharine words , but didn ’ t take note of their poisonous intentions .
god protect you from them and from other false friends !
god should keep me from false friends , but they weren ’ t false .
my lord , the mayor of london is here to greet you .
god bless your grace with health and happy days .
and , just in time , here comes the sweaty lord .
what , isn ’ t my mother coming ?
god knows why , but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in westminster abbey .
your sweet brother wanted to come meet you , but his mother wouldn ’ t let him .
i wouldn ’ t commit so serious a crime for anything .
in these less dainty times , you ’ re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him .
lord hastings , will you go with me ?
i ’ m coming , my lord .
go as fast as you can .
say , uncle richard , if my brother comes , where will i stay till my coronation ?
whatever seems best to you .
of all places , i don ’ t like the
he started it , my noble lord , and succeeding generations rebuilt it .
is it on record that he built it , or is it just word of mouth ?
on record , my gracious lord .
what did you say , uncle ?
the king won ’ t live , i hope .
i ’ ll marry the earl of warwick ’ s youngest daughter , lady anne .
so what if i killed her husband and her father ?
but i ’ m running ahead of myself .
clarence is still alive ; edward is not only alive , he ’ s king .
only when they ’ re dead can i start to count my gains .
what , my dear lord ?
richard of york , how are you doing , my loving brother ?
very well , my supreme lord—that ’ s what i have to call you now .
how ’ s my nephew doing , noble lord of york ?
thank you for asking , uncle .
oh , my lord , you once said that lazy weeds grow fast .
the prince has far outgrown me .
he has , my lord .
does that mean he ’ s lazy ?
oh , my handsome nephew , i must not say that .
in that case , he ’ s more obliged to you than i am .
he may command me as my king , but you still have power over me as a relative .
uncle , please give me your dagger .
my dagger , little nephew ?
are you begging , brother ?
i ’ ll give you a greater gift than that , nephew .
that must mean a sword .
yes , gentle cousin , if it were light enough for you .
oh , i see , you will only part with lightweight presents .
for more important things , you ’ ll say no .
a sword ’ s too heavy for you to wear .
i wouldn ’ t think much of it even if it were heavier .
but , uncle , you know how to bear with him .
you mean , to bear me , not to bear my protector , richard , insists on it .
i can ’ t sleep quietly in the tower .
why , what are you afraid of ?
my uncle clarence ’ s angry ghost .
my grandmother told me he was murdered there .
i ’ m not afraid of dead uncles .
nor living ones , i hope .
well , i hope not .
no doubt , no doubt .
oh , he ’ s a dangerously clever boy—bold , quick-witted , capable .
he ’ s his mother ’ s child from head to toe .
well , enough about them.—come here , catesby .
won ’ t he join us ?
he ’ ll do whatever hastings does .
if he seems game to our plan , encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons .
but if he ’ s resistant and chilly , then be like that too and break off the conversation .
give my regards to hastings , catesby .
my good lords , i plan to .
will we hear from you before bedtime , catesby ?
you will , my lord .
you ’ ll find us both at crosby place .
whatever we decide to do .
i look forward to that present .
you ’ ll find i ’ ll give it to you very willingly .
come , let ’ s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans .
a messenger from lord stanley .
four o'clock in the morning .
can ’ t lord stanley sleep ?
i guess not—for good reason , as you ’ ll soon hear .
first , he sends his regards .
tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries .
good morning , my noble lord .
you ’ re up early .
what news can you tell me in this fast-moving , unsteady state of ours ?
i believe it won ’ t stop moving and stand upright till richard wears the wreath of the realm .
what do you mean , “ wears the wreath ” ?
are you talking about the crown ?
yes , my good lord .
i ’ ll have my head cut from my shoulders before i ’ ll see the crown so misplaced .
but do you think that ’ s what he ’ s aiming for ?
well , i ’ m not sorry to hear that , because they have always been my enemies .
well , let ’ s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind .
but as for now—before two weeks have gone by , i ’ m going to send some people packing .
yes , monstrous , monstrous !
i know they do , and i certainly deserve it .
you ’ re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear ?
my lord , good morning .
i hope to god i ’ m proven wrong !
well , should we head to the tower ?
the day is well on its way .
set down your honorable load , men , if there is ever any honor in being dead .
you know what , my lord ?
those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today .
they deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions .
but come , my lord , let ’ s go .
i ’ ll talk with this good man .
what ’ s up , man ?
how ’ s it going ?
better , since your lordship was nice enough to ask .
well , let ’ s hope your good fortune continues !
here , drink to me .
god be good to you !
a nice coincidence , my lord .
i ’ m glad to see you .
i thank you , sir john , with all my heart .
i am indebted to you for your last sermon .
by next week , i ’ ll be able to pay you .
your friends at pomfret , they ’ re the ones who need a priest .
when i ran into this holy man , those men you mentioned did come to mind , in fact .
are you headed to the tower ?
i ’ ll be off before you are .
yes , probably , because i ’ m staying for lunch .
i ’ ll follow you , my lord .
oh , pomfret , pomfret !
oh , you bloody prison , fatal and threatening to noble lords !
oh god , remember to hear her prayer for them , just as for us !
the hour of death is approaching .
in god ’ s name , speak .
when should the royal day be ?
is everything ready for that event ?
tomorrow ’ s a good day .
who knows what the lord protector thinks ?
who ’ s closest to him ?
you , i think , would best know what he ’ s thinking .
lord hastings , you and he are close .
right on cue , here ’ s the duke himself .
my noble lords and relatives , good morning .
no one may be bolder than my lord hastings .
buckingham , i need to have a word with you .
i ’ ll come soon .
we have not yet set the coronation day .
where is my lord , the duke of gloucester ?
i have sent for the strawberries .
richard is looking cheerful today .
i pray to god he isn ’ t .
then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes .
if they have done this thing , my noble lord— if ?
you lover of that damned whore , you ’ re talking to me of “ ifs ” ?
you ’ re a traitor.—off with his head .
i pity england , but not myself .
stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him , and i laughed and refused to flee with him .
oh , now i really need that priest who spoke to me today !
oh margaret , margaret , your heavy curse has now landed on poor hastings ’ s miserable head !
he ’ s eager to see your head .
come , come , hurry up .
it ’ s pointless to talk now .
those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves .
frightening looks are also at my service , as are fake smiles .
what wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite ?
lord mayor , the reason we have sent— look behind you !
god defend and guard us innocents against them !
they ’ re friends—ratcliffe and lovell .
here ’ s the head of that notorious traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected hastings .
i loved this man so much it makes me weep .
what , do you think we ’ re turks or savages , instead of christians ?
i didn ’ t expect any better from him once he got involved with mistress shore .
that is exactly why we wanted you here , your lordship—to avoid the public carping and complaints .
there was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on .
but only hint at this vaguely , because , as you know , my mother ’ s still alive .
if things go well , bring the crowd to i ’ m off .
around three or four o'clock , look for news from the meeting hall .
lovell , go as fast as you can to doctor shaw .
what a backward world we live in !
why , who ’ s so stupid that he can ’ t see through this fraud ?
the world is a bad place , where you can ’ t speak what you know .
it ’ s incredible—they didn ’ t say a word .
did you mention that edward ’ s children are bastards ?
they wouldn ’ t say anything ?
aren ’ t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming ?
the mayor is here at hand .
and make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests , okay ?
but don ’ t be easily won over .
i ’ m going now .
hurry , go up to the roof .
the lord mayor is knocking .
i don ’ t think he wants to be disturbed .
now , catesby , what does your lord say to my request ?
my lord , he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day .
return to the gracious duke , good catesby .
i ’ ll tell him right away , my lord .
ah , my lord , this prince is nothing like edward !
england would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king .
but i ’ m afraid we ’ ll never get him to agree to be king .
but god forbid he says no to us !
i ’ m afraid he will .
what ’ s up , catesby , what does your master say ?
my lord , he ’ s afraid you mean him harm .
i ’ m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me .
see how he stands between two clergymen !
my lord , you don ’ t need to apologize .
i beg you to pardon me .
you have , my lord .
sweet saint , for goodness ’ s sake , don ’ t be so angry .
if you enjoy looking at your awful deeds , take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries .
it ’ s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins .
oh earth , which soaks up this blood , revenge his death !
god forbid that i snatch the crown from him .
don ’ t refuse the love we offer you .
oh , make them joyful !
alas , why would you heap all these responsibilities on me ?
i am unfit to rule and to be king .
oh , please don ’ t swear , my lord of buckingham .
if you refuse it , the whole country will regret it .
would you tie me to a whole world of worries ?
well , call them back again .
if you say that , you ’ ll only be telling the truth .
then i salute you with this royal title : long live richard , england ’ s worthy king !
will you be crowned tomorrow ?
whenever you want , since you ’ re the one who wants it .
my granddaughter , with her kind aunt , the duchess of gloucester , leading her by the hand ?
we can all go together .
and here comes the warden , just in time .
they ’ re just fine , my dear madam .
but i ’ m sorry—i ’ m not allowed to let you visit them .
the king has strictly forbidden it .
i meant to say the lord protector .
the lord keep him from the title of king !
richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?
who ’ s going to keep me from them ?
i am their father ’ s mother .
i am their aunt , and i love them like a mother .
so take me to see them .
officer , i ’ ll take the responsibility from you , and the blame too .
no , madam , no .
i can ’ t do this .
i am bound by oath , so please forgive me .
your mother ’ s name has become a threat to her own children .
but don ’ t delay .
o , this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery .
it has hatched a i go unwillingly .
if you want to make me happy , don ’ t wish yourself harm .
every night i ’ m awakened by his poor dear , goodbye .
no more than i do yours .
you are a rude , ragged nurse and an old , sullen playmate for such tender princes .
please treat my babies well .
dear woman , you don ’ t know the rules of charity .
villain , you don ’ t know the laws of god or of man .
even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity .
if i know nothing about pity , that must mean i ’ m not an animal .
it ’ s even stranger when an angel is so angry .
you who are beautiful beyond words , calm down and let me explain myself .
such an expression of despair would only prove that i was guilty .
because of your advice and your help , i have a high position now .
but will i wear these honors for only a day or will i enjoy them for a long time ?
young prince edward is still alive—what do you think i ’ m going to say next ?
go on , my loving lord .
but edward is still alive .
oh , how bitter it is that edward—the real “ true , noble prince ” —should still be alive !
cousin , you didn ’ t used to be so thickheaded .
shall i put it plainly ?
your grace can do whatever he wants .
tut , tut , you ’ ve become rather icy .
tell me , do i have your consent to kill them ?
give me a little breathing space , my lord , a little pause to think .
i ’ ll let you know my answer shortly .
do you know anyone who would kill someone for money ?
what ’ s his name ?
his name is tyrrel , my lord .
i know the man a bit .
go , bring him here , boy .
look who ’ s here !
what ’ s the news with you ?
spread the rumor abroad that anne , my wife , is very sick .
and find a poverty stricken gentleman who i can marry straightaway to clarence ’ s daughter .
look at you , standing there in a stupor !
i repeat , spread the rumor that anne , my wife , is sick and likely to die .
james tyrrel—and your most obedient subject .
do you dare kill a friend of mine ?
well , that ’ s what you get to do .
two great enemies , in fact , enemies to my peace of mind .
tyrrel , i mean those bastards in the tower .
give me access to them , and soon you won ’ t have to worry about them anymore .
that ’ s music to my ears .
by this token , you ’ ll be admitted to their cell .
get up and listen to me .
that ’ s all there is to it .
as soon as the deed is done , you will be in my favor and i will promote you .
i ’ ll do it right away .
my lord , i have thought over the request you just made of me .
well , it doesn ’ t matter anymore .
dorset has fled to the earl of richmond .
i heard the news , my lord .
stanley , richmond is your wife ’ s son .
stanley , pay attention to your wife ’ s doings .
if she sends any letters to richmond , you will be accountable to me for it .
what do you say , your highness , about my just request ?
my lord , your promise of the earldom— richmond !
yes , what time is it ?
i ’ m reminding your grace what you promised me .
well , but what time is it ?
it ’ s almost ten o'clock .
well , let it strike ten then .
why “ let it strike ” ?
because you ’ re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell—you keep interrupting my thoughts .
i am not in the giving mood today .
you ’ re bothering me .
i ’ m not in the mood .
does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt ?
did i work to make him king for this ?
oh , let me remember what happened to hastings and hurry to
it was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of .
their lips , like four red roses on a stalk , touched .
kind tyrrel , will your news make me happy ?
but did you see them dead ?
i did , my lord .
and buried , noble tyrrel ?
tyrrel , come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths .
in the meantime , think about how i can do you good and give you what you want .
is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking ?
bad news , my lord .
ely joining richmond troubles me more than buckingham and his quickly assembled army .
let ’ s say i didn ’ t kill them .
then you might as well say they ’ re not dead .
but they are dead , and you killed them , you slave of the devil .
i did not kill your husband .
well , then he must be alive .
queen margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood .
she provoked me with her lying mouth , accusing me of crimes i didn ’ t commit .
no , what provoked you was your own bloody mind , which never thinks about anything but butchering .
you killed this king , didn ’ t you ?
yes , i ’ ll grant you that .
you ’ ll grant me , you hedgehog ?
then let god grant me that you ’ ll be damned for that wicked deed .
oh , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
that will please god , who has him now .
he is in heaven , where you will never go .
let him thank me , who helped him get there .
i ’ ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies .
i ’ ll head to france soon .
it ’ s time to hide , wretched margaret .
ah , my poor princes !
hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved , with her children dead before their time .
i ’ ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute .
edward plantagenet , why are you dead ?
will you abandon such gentle lambs , god , and throw them to the wolves ?
have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done ?
let my sorrow have the upper hand .
you had a clarence , too , and richard killed him .
o harry ’ s wife , do not triumph in my sorrow !
with god as my witness , i swear i have wept for yours .
your son edward , who stabbed my son edward , is dead .
your clarence , who stabbed my edward , is also dead .
and i was right , because where ’ s your husband now ?
you once stole my position ; now you get to have the grief that goes with it .
your english sorrows will make me smile in france .
you who are so skilled in cursing , stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies .
making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse .
think like this all day , and you ’ ll learn how to curse .
your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine .
but give words a chance .
if that ’ s true , then don ’ t be tongue-tied .
come with me , and let ’ s smother my fiendish son—who smothered your two sweet sons—in bitter words .
who ’ s blocking the way ?
tell me , you villainous lowlife , where are my children ?
where are the noble hastings , rivers , vaughan , grey ?
don ’ t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the lord ’ s anointed king .
either be calm and polite or i ’ ll drown you out with the music of war .
yes , i thank god , my father , and yourself .
then patiently listen to my impatience .
oh , let me speak !
go ahead , but i won ’ t listen .
i ’ ll be gentle and mild .
and brief , good mother—i ’ m in a hurry .
god knows i waited for you in anguish , pain , and agony when i gave birth to you .
and didn ’ t i finally arrive to comfort you ?
so , what hour of comfort have i ever had in your company ?
you ’ re too bitter .
i ’ ll never speak to you again .
though i have far more reason , i don ’ t have as much energy to curse you .
but i say amen to everything she said .
i need to speak a word with you .
i have no more royal sons for you to murder .
you have a daughter named elizabeth , who is virtuous and beautiful , aristocratic and full of grace .
and does she have to die for this ?
oh , let her live , and i ’ ll ruin her manners and her beauty .
don ’ t wrong her birth .
to save her life , i ’ ll say she doesn ’ t .
yes , as safe as her brothers ' lives were .
my children would have enjoyed a better death if god had blessed you with a purer life .
whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts , you ’ re the one who gave the order .
what good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now ?
the advancement of your children , noble lady .
advancement to some scaffold , to lose their heads .
no , advancement to the dignity and height of honor , to a high , imperial kind of glory .
and you ’ re not suited for any place except hell .
yes , and one other place , if you ’ ll only let me name it .
there is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are !
exactly , madam , until i sleep with you .
then know that from my soul i love your daughter .
that you love my daughter to spite your soul .
don ’ t be so quick to twist my meaning .
the one who makes her queen , of course .
who else should it be ?
what do you think , madam ?
how would you woo her ?
and madam , with all my heart .
come , come , you ’ re making fun of me .
this is not the way to win your daughter .
there isn ’ t any other way , unless you took on another form and became someone else .
but suppose i did all the things you named out of love for her .
then she has no choice but to hate you , as you purchased her love with murder .
whatever has already been done can ’ t be undone now .
men act imprudently sometimes , then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them .
if i have killed your children , i will have children with your daughter .
a grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is .
your children caused you trouble in your youth , but mine will bring you comfort in your old age .
indeed , we have many good days to look forward to !
go , then , mother , to your daughter .
what should i say to her ?
that her father ’ s brother wants to be her husband ?
or should i say it ’ s her uncle ?
or should i describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles ?
claim fair england ’ s peace depends on this alliance .
she will purchase that peace with an everlasting war .
tell her that the king , who has the power to command people , asks her .
he asks her to do what god say she will be a high and mighty queen .
only to watch that title become worthless , as her mother has .
say i will love her everlastingly .
but how long will “ ever ” last ?
until her beautiful life ’ s end .
but how long will her beautiful life last ?
as long as heaven and nature extend it .
as long as hell and richard want it .
tell her that i , her king , am her lowly subject .
but she , your subject , hates such a king .
be eloquent on my behalf .
an honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply .
then tell her my loving story in simple terms .
you can ’ t tell a story simply when it ’ s a lie .
your answers are too shallow and too hasty .
oh no , my reasons are deep and as permanent as death .
don ’ t harp on that point , madam—it ’ s past .
i will harp on it till my heartstrings break .
i swear— by nothing , because this is no oath .
st. george loses his holiness once then , by myself— you ’ ve misused yourself .
now , by the world— it ’ s full of your ugly wrongdoings .
by my father ’ s death— your life has dishonored his death .
what can you swear by now ?
don ’ t swear by the future , because you ’ ve ruined it before it has even arrived .
may i only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere !
my happiness and yours lie in her .
shall i be tempted by the devil ?
yes , if the devil tempts you to do good .
yes , if your memories do you no good .
yet you killed my children .
but in your daughter ’ s womb i will bury them .
should i go convince my daughter to marry you ?
and be a happy mother by doing so .
write to me very soon and i ’ ll let you know what she thinks .
word is that richmond is the navy ’ s admiral .
someone who can ride fast , go to the duke of here , my good lord .
catesby , fly to the duke .
i will my lord , as fast as i can .
oh , right , good catesby .
what would you like me to do at salisbury ?
why , what is there to do before i get there ?
your highness just told me that i should ride there before you .
stanley , what news do you have ?
well , how nice , a riddle !
why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point ?
once again , what ’ s the news ?
richmond is sailing on the sea .
let him sink there so the sea will cover him !
lily-livered coward , what ’ s he doing there ?
well , what do you guess ?
they are my daylight , my life .
then i hope night shadows your day , and death takes your life !
don ’ t damn yourself .
i wish i were , so i could deprive you of both day and life .
there is no better one on earth .
is the army without a leader ?
is the king dead , the empire dispossessed ?
what heir of the york family is there alive other than myself ?
and who is england ’ s king but an heir of the great york ?
therefore , tell me , what is he doing at sea ?
where is your army , then , to beat him back ?
where are your tenants and your followers ?
then they ’ re cold friends to me .
what are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king ?
they haven ’ t been commanded to go to the west , mighty king .
most mighty sovereign , you have no reason to doubt my friendship .
i was never disloyal , and i never will be .
then go gather your men , but leave behind your son , george stanley .
buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where .
even if we don ’ t fight foreign enemies , we ’ ll beat down these rebels at home .
while we ’ re talking here , a royal battle could be won and lost .
someone deliver the order that buckingham be brought to salisbury .
everyone else , march on with me .
but , tell me , where is the noble richmond now ?
at pembroke , or at harfordwest in wales .
now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads .
won ’ t king richard let me speak with him ?
no , my good lord .
this is it is , my lord .
why , then , it ’ s my body ’ s doomsday .
this , this all-souls ' day , is my just desserts .
this is how god forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves .
i have done wrong , so i will suffer wrong .
i suspect his friends will join us .
he has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him .
in his greatest need , even they will desert him .
so , in god ’ s name , let ’ s march .
hope with good cause is swift ; it flies as fast as a swallow .
it turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings .
my heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
my lord of norfolk— here , most gracious king .
norfolk , we ’ re going to have a few blows , right ?
we ’ ve got to give them and take them , my lord .
i ’ ll lie here tonight .
but where will i lie tomorrow ?
well , it doesn ’ t matter .
six or seven thousand , at most .
why , our troops amount to three times that .
let ’ s be disciplined and not delay , because tomorrow is a busy day .
upon my life , my lord , i ’ ll do it .
there is a man who loves you better than your husband could .
yes , that ’ s my husband ’ s name .
someone else has the same name , but he ’ s a better man .
why do you spit at me ?
if only i could spit poison .
poison never came from such a sweet place .
poison never landed on such an ugly toad .
get out of my sight !
you ’ re poisoning my eyes .
your beautiful eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine with love .
good night , dear captain blunt .
come , gentlemen , let ’ s discuss tomorrow ’ s action in my tent .
the night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors .
it ’ s dinnertime , my lord .
it ’ s nine o'clock .
i ’ m not going to eat dinner tonight .
give me some ink and paper .
is the visor of my helmet working better now ?
and has my armor been put in my tent ?
my good man norfolk , hurry to your post .
i ’ m off , my lord .
get up early tomorrow—at the sound of the lark—noble norfolk .
i will , my lord .
did you see the gloomy lord northumberland ?
good , i ’ m satisfied .
is my ink and paper ready ?
