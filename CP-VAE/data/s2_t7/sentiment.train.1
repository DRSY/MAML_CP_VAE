i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak ’ st .
madam , he ’ s well .
th ’ art an honest man .
caesar and he are greater friends than ever .
make thee a fortune from me .
but yet , madam— i do not like “ but yet. ” it does allay the good precedence .
prithee , friend , pour out the pack of matter to mine ear , the good and bad together .
free , madam , no .
i made no such report .
he ’ s bound unto octavia .
for the best turn i ’ th ’ bed .
i am pale , charmian .
madam , he ’ s married to octavia .
the most infectious pestilence upon thee !
hence , horrible villain , or i ’ ll spurn thine eyes like balls before me !
i ’ ll unhair thy head !
thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine , smarting in ling ’ ring pickle !
say ’ tis not so , a province i will give thee and make thy fortunes proud .
he ’ s married , madam .
rogue , thou hast lived too long .
nay then , i ’ ll run .
what mean you , madam ?
i have made no fault .
good madam , keep yourself within yourself .
some innocents ’ scape not the thunderbolt .
melt egypt into nile , and kindly creatures turn all to serpents .
though i am mad , i will not bite him .
he is afeard to come .
i will not hurt him .
though it be honest , it is never good to bring bad news .
i have done my duty .
dost thou hold there still ?
should i lie , madam ?
go , get thee hence .
i crave your highness ’ pardon .
take no offense that i would not offend you .
to punish me for what you make me do seems much unequal .
he ’ s married to octavia .
the merchandise which thou hast brought from rome are all too dear for me .
lie they upon thy hand and be undone by ’ em !
good your highness , patience .
in praising antony , i have dispraised caesar .
i am paid for ’ t now .
tis no matter.— go to the fellow , good alexas .
bid him report the feature of octavia : her years , her inclination .
let him not leave out the color of her hair .
bring me word how tall she is .
lead me to my chamber .
oh that i knew this husband , which , you say , must charge his horns with garlands !
i make not , but foresee .
pray , then , foresee me one .
no , you shall paint when you are old .
you shall be more beloving than beloved .
what was ’ t that moved pale cassius to conspire ?
thou canst not fear us , pompey , with thy sails .
we ’ ll speak with thee at sea .
at land , thou know ’ st how much we do o ’ ercount thee .
be pleased to tell us— for this is from the present—how you take the offers we have sent you .
there ’ s the point .
which do not be entreated to , but weigh what it is worth embraced .
you have made me offer of sicily , sardinia .
and i must rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send measures of wheat to rome .
this ’ greed upon to part with unhacked edges and bear back our targes undinted .
that ’ s our offer .
let me have your hand .
i did not think , sir , to have met you here .
i hope so , lepidus .
that ’ s the next to do .
we ’ ll feast each other ere we part , and let ’ s draw lots who shall begin .
that will i , pompey .
no , antony , take the lot .
but , first or last , your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame .
i have heard that julius caesar grew fat with feasting there .
i have fair meanings , sir .
and fair words to them .
then so much have i heard .
and i have heard apollodorus carried— what , i pray you ?
how far ’ st thou , soldier ?
well , and well am like to do , for i perceive , four feasts are toward .
let me shake thy hand .
i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behavior .
it nothing ill becomes thee.— aboard my galley i invite you all .
will you lead , lords ?
show ’ s the way , sir .
at sea , i think .
you have done well by water .
nor what i have done by water .
yes , something you can deny for your own safety : you have been a great thief by sea .
there i deny my land service .
but give me your hand , menas .
if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
all men ’ s faces are true , whatsome ’ er their hands are .
but there is never a fair woman has a true face .
we came hither to fight with you .
for my part , i am sorry it is turned to a drinking .
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune .
if he do , sure he can not weep ’ t back again .
you ’ ve said , sir .
we looked not for mark antony here .
pray you , is he married to cleopatra ?
caesar ’ s sister is called octavia .
she was the wife of caius marcellus .
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius .
then is caesar and he forever knit together .
if i were bound to divine of this unity , i would not prophesy so .
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
who would not have his wife so ?
not he that himself is not so , which is mark antony .
he will to his egyptian dish again .
antony will use his affection where it is .
he married but his occasion here .
and thus it may be .
come , sir , will you aboard ?
i have a health for you .
i shall take it , sir .
we have used our throats in egypt .
come , let ’ s away .
here they ’ ll be , man .
some o ’ their plants are ill-rooted already .
they have made him drink alms-drink .
they know by th ’ height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth or foison follow .
the higher nilus swells the more it promises .
you ’ ve strange serpents there ?
your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun .
i am not so well as i should be , but i ’ ll ne ’ er out .
not till you have slept .
i fear me you ’ ll be in till then .
nay , certainly , i have heard the ptolemies ’ pyramises are very goodly things .
without contradiction i have heard that .
what manner o ’ thing is your crocodile ?
it is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth .
it is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs .
of it own color too .
and the tears of it are wet .
i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
thou hast served me with much faith .
wilt thou be lord of the whole world ?
good now , some excellent fortune !
let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all .
then belike my children shall have no names .
prithee , how many boys and wenches must i have ?
if every of your wishes had a womb , and fertile every wish , a million .
you think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes .
we ’ ll know all our fortunes .
mine , and most of our fortunes tonight , shall be—drunk to bed .
no , pompey , i have kept me from the cup .
these three world-sharers , these competitors , are in thy vessel .
ah , this thou shouldst have done and not have spoke on ’ t !
in me ’ tis villainy , in thee ’ t had been good service .
thou must know , ’ tis not my profit that does lead mine honor ; mine honor , it .
repent that e ’ er thy tongue hath so betrayed thine act .
being done unknown , i should have found it afterwards well done , but must condemn it now .
here ’ s to thee , menas !
there ’ s a strong fellow , menas .
he bears the third part of the world , man .
the third part , then , is drunk .
this is not yet an alexandrian feast .
strike the vessels , ho !
here ’ s to caesar .
i could well forbear ’ t .
be a child o ’ th ’ time .
but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one .
let ’ s ha ’ t , good soldier .
give ’ s your hand .
come , down into the boat .
take heed you fall not .
menas , i ’ ll not on shore .
no , to my cabin .
there ’ s my cap .
caesar and antony have ever won more in their officer than person .
thou hast , ventidius , that without the which a soldier and his sword grants scarce distinction .
thou wilt write to antony ?
what , are the brothers parted ?
they have dispatched with pompey ; he is gone .
octavia weeps to part from rome .
oh , how he loves caesar !
nay , but how dearly he adores mark antony !
o antony , o thou arabian bird !
would you praise caesar , say “ caesar. ” go no further .
indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
but he loves caesar best ; yet he loves antony .
they are his shards , and he
so , this is to horse .
good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
for better might we have loved without this mean , if on both parts this be not cherished .
make me not offended in your distrust .
so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends .
farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well .
the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort !
i ’ ll tell you in your ear .
look , here i have you .
thus i let you go and give you to the gods .
e ’ en as the o ’ erflowing nilus presageth famine .
go , you wild bedfellow , you can not soothsay .
but how , but how ?
am i not an inch of fortune better than she ?
well , if you were but an inch of fortune better than i , where would you choose it ?
not in my husband ’ s nose .
our worser thoughts heavens mend .
therefore , dear isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly .
go to , go to.—come hither , sir .
good majesty , herod of jewry dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased .
that herod ’ s head i ’ ll have !
i looked her in the face , and saw her led between her brother and mark antony .
is she as tall as me ?
she is not , madam .
is she shrill-tongued or low ?
madam , i heard her speak .
that ’ s not so good .
he can not like her long .
o isis , ’ tis impossible .
i think so , charmian .
she shows a body rather than a life , a statue than a breather .
or i have no observance .
three in egypt can not make better note .
there ’ s nothing in her yet .
the fellow has good judgment .
and i do think she ’ s thirty .
bear ’ st thou her face in mind ?
is ’ t long or round ?
round , even to faultiness .
for the most part , too , they are foolish that are so .
her hair , what color ?
brown , madam , and her forehead as low as she would wish it .
thou must not take my former sharpness ill .
i will employ thee back again ; i find thee most fit for business .
go make thee ready ; our letters are prepared .
indeed , he is so .
i repent me much that so i harried him .
all may be well enough .
i warrant you , madam .
o my good lord , believe not all , or , if you must believe , stomach not all .
gentle octavia , let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it .
the meantime , lady , i ’ ll raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother .
the jove of power make me most weak , most weak , your reconciler !
provide your going ; choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to .
how now , friend eros !
there ’ s strange news come , sir .
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey .
so the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
more , domitius : my lord desires you presently .
my news i might have told hereafter .
twill be naught , but let it be .
contemning rome , he has done all this and more in alexandria .
this in the public eye ?
let rome be thus informed .
who , queasy with his insolence already , will their good thoughts call from him .
the people knows it , and have now received his accusations .
then does he say he lent me some shipping , unrestored .
sir , this should be answered .
tis done already , and the messenger gone .
he ’ ll never yield to that .
nor must not then be yielded to in this .
hail , caesar , and my lord !
hail , most dear caesar !
that ever i should call thee castaway !
you have not called me so , nor have you cause .
why have you stol ’ n upon us thus ?
you come not like caesar ’ s sister .
nay , the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven , raised by your populous troops .
we should have met you by sea and land , supplying every stage with an augmented greeting .
which soon he granted , being an obstruct ’ tween his lust and him .
he was disposed to mirth , but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him.—enobarbus !
fulvia thy wife first came into the field .
do not say so , my lord .
my lord , in athens .
no , my most wrongèd sister .
cleopatra hath nodded him to her .
ay me , most wretched , that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that does afflict each other !
best of comfort , and ever welcome to us .
each heart in rome does love and pity you .
pray you be ever known to patience .
my dear ’ st sister !
but why , why , why ?
thou hast forspoke my being in these wars and sayst it is not fit .
is ’ t not denounced against us ?
why should not we be there in person ?
what is ’ t you say ?
and their tongues rot that speak against us !
i will not stay behind .
nay , i have done .
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent .
by sea , what else ?
why will my lord do so ?
for that he dares us to ’ t .
so hath my lord dared him to single fight .
ay , and to wage this battle at pharsalia , where caesar fought with pompey .
but these offers , which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , and so should you .
in caesar ’ s fleet are those that often have ’ gainst pompey fought .
their ships are yare , yours , heavy .
no disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea , being prepared for land .
i ’ ll fight at sea .
but if we fail , we then can do ’ t at land .
the news is true , my lord .
canidius , our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , and our twelve thousand horse .
how now , worthy soldier ?
o noble emperor , do not fight by sea !
trust not to rotten planks .
do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds ?
let th ’ egyptians and the phoenicians go a-ducking .
we have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot .
well , well , away .
by hercules , i think i am i ’ th ’ right .
soldier , thou art ; but his whole action grows not in the power on ’ t .
so our leader ’ s led , and we are women ’ s men .
you keep by land the legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
this speed of caesar ’ s carries beyond belief .
while he was yet in rome his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies .
who ’ s his lieutenant , hear you ?
they say , one taurus .
well i know the man .
with news the time ’ s with labor , and throws forth each minute some .
strike not by land ; keep whole .
provoke not battle till we have done at sea .
our fortune lies upon this jump .
i can behold no longer .
gods and goddesses , all the whole synod of them !
what ’ s thy passion ?
the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance .
we have kissed away kingdoms and provinces .
mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view .
the nature of bad news infects the teller .
when it concerns the fool or coward .
things that are past are done , with me .
name cleopatra as she is called in rome .
i never saw an action of such shame .
experience , manhood , honor , ne ’ er before did violate so itself .
our fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably .
had our general been what he knew himself , it had gone well .
oh , he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own !
ay , are you thereabouts ?
why then , good night indeed .
toward peloponnesus are they fled .
to caesar will i render my legions and my horse .
i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way forever .
i have a ship laden with gold .
fly and make your peace with caesar .
i have fled myself , and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders .
i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you .
oh , i followed that i blush to look upon !
you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you .
pray you , look not sad , nor make replies of loathness .
take the hint which my despair proclaims .
let that be left which leaves itself .
i will possess you of that ship and treasure .
leave me , i pray , a little .
pray you now , nay , do so , for indeed i have lost command .
oh , fie , fie , fie !
madam , o good empress !
the queen , my lord , the queen .
go to him , madam , speak to him .
he is unqualitied with very shame .
well then , sustain me .
most noble sir , arise .
her head ’ s declined , and death will seize her but your comfort makes the rescue .
i have offended reputation , a most unnoble swerving .
oh , whither hast thou led me , egypt ?
o my lord , my lord , forgive my fearful sails !
i little thought you would have followed .
fall not a tear , i say .
one of them rates all that is won and lost .
even this repays me.— we sent our schoolmaster .
let him appear that ’ s come from antony .
such as i am , i come from antony .
for antony , i have no ears to his request .
this if she perform , she shall not sue unheard .
bring him through the bands .
what shall we do , enobarbus ?
is antony or we in fault for this ?
antony only , that would make his will lord of his reason .
the queen shall then have courtesy , so she will yield us up ?
let her know ’ t.— and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities .
that head , my lord ?
what , no more ceremony ?
he stays upon your will .
fulvia thy wife is dead .
her length of sickness , with what else more serious importeth thee to know , this bears .
so haply are they friends to antony .
he needs as many , sir , as caesar has , or needs not us .
if caesar please , our master will leap to be his friend .
for us , you know whose he is we are , and that is caesar ’ s .
he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love , but as you feared him .
he is a god and knows what is most right .
mine honor was not yielded , but conquered merely .
shall i say to caesar what you require of him ?
for he partly begs to be desired to give .
it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon .
what ’ s your name ?
most kind messenger , say to great caesar this in deputation : i kiss his conqu ’ ring hand .
tell him i am prompt to lay my crown at ’ s feet , and there to kneel .
what art thou , fellow ?
take hence this jack and whip him .
this jack of caesar ’ s shall bear us an errand to him .
good my lord— you have been a boggler ever .
oh , is ’ t come to this ?
i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar ’ s trencher .
alack , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , and it portends alone the fall of antony .
to flatter caesar , would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points ?
as it determines , so dissolve my life !
caesar sits down in alexandria , where i will oppose his fate .
our force by land hath nobly held .
our severed navy too have knit again , and fleet , threat ’ ning most sealike .
where hast thou been , my heart ?
dost thou hear , lady ?
if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips , i will appear in blood .
i and my sword will earn our chronicle .
there ’ s hope in ’ t yet .
that ’ s my brave lord !
i will be treble-sinewed , -hearted , -breathed , and fight maliciously .
come , let ’ s have one other gaudy night .
call to me all my sad captains .
let ’ s mock the midnight bell .
we will yet do well .
now he ’ ll outstare the lightning .
when valor preys on reason , it eats the sword it fights with .
i will seek some way to leave him .
he calls me “ boy ” and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt .
let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die , meantime laugh at his challenge .
give him no breath , but now make boot of his distraction .
never anger made good guard for itself .
let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight .
see it done and feast the army .
we have store to do ’ t , and they have earned the waste .
what ’ s your pleasure , sir ?
i must with haste from hence .
why , then , we kill all our women .
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them .
if they suffer our departure , death ’ s the word .
under a compelling occasion , let women die .
cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly .
i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment .
she is cunning past man ’ s thought .
we can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears .
he will not fight with me , domitius ?
he thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , he is twenty men to one .
tomorrow , soldier , by sea and land i ’ ll fight .
or i will live or bathe my dying honor in the blood shall make it live again .
woo ’ t thou fight well ?
i ’ ll strike and cry , “ take all. ” well said .
call forth my household servants .
let ’ s tonight be bounteous at our meal .
you have served me well , and kings have been your fellows .
well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
look , they weep , and i , an ass , am onion-eyed .
ho , ho , ho !
now the witch take me if i meant it thus !
grace grow where those drops fall !
heard you of nothing strange about the streets ?
belike ’ tis but a rumor .
well , sir , good night .
soldiers , have careful watch .
and if tomorrow our navy thrive , i have an absolute hope our landmen will stand up .
tis a brave army , and full of purpose .
music i ’ th ’ air .
it signs well , does it not ?
is ’ t not strange ?
do you hear , masters ?
follow the noise so far as we have quarter ; let ’ s see how it will give off .
come , good fellow , put thine iron on .
if fortune be not ours today , it is because we brave her .
nay , i ’ ll help too .
what ’ s this for ?
ah , let be , let be !
thou art the armorer of my heart .
sooth , la , i ’ ll help .
well , well , we shall thrive now.—seest thou , my good fellow ?
go put on thy defenses .
is not this buckled well ?
dispatch.—o love , that thou couldst see my wars today , and knew ’ st the royal occupation !
thou look ’ st like him that knows a warlike charge .
to business that we love we rise betimes and go to ’ t with delight .
tis well blown , lads .
this morning , like the spirit of a youth that means to be of note , begins betimes .
fare thee well , dame .
whate ’ er becomes of me , this is a soldier ’ s kiss .
i ’ ll leave thee now like a man of steel .
the gods make this a happy day to antony !
would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed to make me fight at land !
who ’ s gone this morning ?
sir , he is with caesar .
sir , his chests and treasure he has not with him .
go , eros , send his treasure after .
detain no jot , i charge thee .
write to him— i will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings .
say that i wish he never find more cause to change a master .
oh , my fortunes have corrupted honest men !
why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice .
this grief is crowned with consolation .
the business she hath broached in the state can not endure my absence .
let our officers have notice what we purpose .
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part .
say our pleasure , to such whose place is under us , requires our quick remove from hence .
go forth , agrippa , and begin the fight .
our will is antony be took alive .
the time of universal peace is near .
for this pains caesar hath hanged him .
canidius and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honorable trust .
i have done ill , of which i do accuse myself so sorely that i will joy no more .
enobarbus , antony hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with his bounty overplus .
the messenger came on my guard , and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules .
best you safed the bringer out of the host .
i must attend mine office , or would have done ’ t myself .
your emperor continues still a jove .
i am alone the villain of the earth , and feel i am so most .
no , i will go seek some ditch wherein to die .
the foul ’ st best fits my latter part of life .
we have engaged ourselves too far .
caesar himself has work , and our oppression exceeds what we expected .
o my brave emperor , this is fought indeed !
had we done so at first , we had droven them home with clouts about their heads .
thou bleed ’ st apace .
we ’ ll beat ’ em into bench-holes .
i have yet room for six scotches more .
they are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves for a fair victory .
let us score their backs and snatch ’ em up , as we take hares , behind !
tis sport to maul a runner .
i will reward thee once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold for thy good valor .
i ’ ll halt after .
we have beat him to his camp .
run one before and let the queen know of our gests .
o infinite virtue , com ’ st thou smiling from the world ’ s great snare uncaught ?
mine nightingale , we have beat them to their beds .
he has deserved it , were it carbuncled like holy phoebus ’ car .
if we be not relieved within this hour , we must return to th ’ court of guard .
o bear me witness , night— what man is this ?
stand close and list him .
let ’ s speak to him .
let ’ s hear him , for the things he speaks may concern caesar .
let ’ s do so .
swoons rather , for so bad a prayer as his was never yet for sleep .
awake , sir , awake .
the hand of death hath raught him .
let us bear him to th ’ court of guard .
our hour is fully out .
i shall do ’ t .
their preparation is today by sea .
we please them not by land .
for both , my lord .
but this it is : our foot upon the hills adjoining to the city shall stay with us .
to the vales , and hold our best advantage .
yet they are not joined .
where yond pine does stand i shall discover all .
i ’ ll bring thee word straight how ’ tis like to go .
swallows have built in cleopatra ’ s sails their nests .
this foul egyptian hath betrayèd me .
bid them all fly , for when i am revenged upon my charm , i have done all .
o sun , thy uprise shall i see no more .
fortune and antony part here .
even here do we shake hands .
oh , this false soul of egypt !
why is my lord enraged against his love ?
vanish , or i shall give thee thy deserving , and blemish caesar ’ s triumph .
let him take thee and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians !
follow his chariot , like the greatest spot of all thy sex .
she dies for ’ t.—eros , ho !
help me , my women !
there lock yourself and send him word you are dead .
the soul and body rive not more in parting than greatness going off .
say that the last i spoke was “ antony , ” and word it , prithee , piteously .
hence , mardian , and bring me how he takes my death .
eros , thou yet behold ’ st me ?
thou hast seen these signs .
it does , my lord .
my good knave eros , now thy captain is even such a body .
here i am antony , yet can not hold this visible shape , my knave .
nay , weep not , gentle eros .
oh , thy vile lady !
she has robbed me of my sword .
she hath betrayed me and shall die the death .
death of one person can be paid but once , and that she has discharged .
what thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand .
it was divided between her heart and lips .
she rendered life , thy name so buried in her .
o , cleave , my sides !
heart , once be stronger than thy continent .
crack thy frail case ! —apace , eros , apace .
you have been nobly borne .
i will o ’ ertake thee , cleopatra , and weep for my pardon .
since the torch is out , lie down and stray no farther .
now all labor mars what it does .
yea , very force entangles itself with strength .
seal then , and all is done.— eros ! —i come , my queen.—eros ! —stay for me .
dido and her aeneas shall want troops , and all the haunt be ours.—come , eros , eros !
since cleopatra died i have lived in such dishonor that the gods detest my baseness .
thou strik ’ st not me , ’ tis caesar thou defeat ’ st .
put color in thy cheek .
shall i do that which all the parthian darts , though enemy , lost aim and could not ?
i would not see ’ t .
draw that thy honest sword , which thou hast worn most useful for thy country .
o sir , pardon me !
do it at once , or thy precedent services are all but accidents unpurposed .
turn from me then that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies .
i did not see him since .
what should i do i do not ?
in each thing give him way .
tempt him not so too far .
in time we hate that which we often fear .
i am sick and sullen .
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— help me away , dear charmian !
tis said , man , and farewell .
thus i do escape the sorrow of antony ’ s death .
my queen and eros have by their brave instruction got upon me a nobleness in record .
to do thus i learned of thee .
what ’ s the noise ?
i have done my work ill , friends .
oh , make an end of what i have begun !
the star is fall ’ n .
and time is at his period .
let him that loves me strike me dead .
thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly .
this sword but shown to caesar , with this tidings , shall enter me with him .
there , diomed , there .
wilt thou not answer , man ?
art thou there , diomed ?
draw thy sword and give me sufficing strokes for death .
most absolute lord , my mistress cleopatra sent me to thee .
when did she send thee ?
she had a prophesying fear of what hath come to pass .
too late , good diomed .
call my guard , i prithee .
what ho , the emperor ’ s guard !
bear me , good friends , where cleopatra bides .
tis the last service that i shall command you .
woe , woe are we , sir , you may not live to wear all your true followers out .
nay , good my fellows , do not please sharp fate to grace it with your sorrows .
bid that welcome which comes to punish us , and we punish it , seeming to bear it lightly .
i have led you oft ; carry me now , good friends , and have my thanks for all .
o charmian , i will never go from hence .
be comforted , dear madam .
no , i will not .
all strange and terrible events are welcome , but comforts we despise .
our size of sorrow , proportioned to our cause , must be as great as that which makes it .
his death ’ s upon him , but not dead .
o antony , antony , antony !
help , charmian , help , iras , help !
not caesar ’ s valor hath o ’ erthrown antony , but antony ’ s hath triumphed on itself .
so it should be , that none but antony should conquer antony , but woe ’ tis so !
nay , but this dotage of our general ’ s o ’ erflows the measure .
if it be love indeed , tell me how much .
there ’ s beggary in the love that can be reckoned .
i ’ ll set a bourn how far to be beloved .
then must thou needs find out new heaven , new earth .
news , my good lord , from rome .
i am dying , egypt , dying .
not th ’ imperious show of the full-fortuned caesar ever shall be brooched with me .
if knife , drugs , serpents , have edge , sting , or operation , i am safe .
your wife octavia , with her modest eyes and still conclusion , shall acquire no honor demuring upon me .
oh , quick , or i am gone .
here ’ s sport indeed !
how heavy weighs my lord !
die when thou hast lived .
had my lips that power , thus would i wear them out .
i am dying , egypt , dying .
give me some wine and let me speak a little .
my resolution and my hands i ’ ll trust , none about caesar .
now my spirit is going .
noblest of men , woo ’ t die ?
hast thou no care of me ?
shall i abide in this dull world , which in thy absence is no better than a sty ?
oh , withered is the garland of the war .
the soldier ’ s pole is fall ’ n !
young boys and girls are level now with men .
the odds is gone , and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon .
she ’ s dead too , our sovereign .
o madam , madam , madam !
peace , peace , iras .
all ’ s but naught .
how do you , women ?
what , what , good cheer !
why , how now , charmian ?
good sirs , take heart .
this case of that huge spirit now is cold .
ah , women , women !
we have no friend but resolution , and the briefest end .
go to him , dolabella , bid him yield .
being so frustrate , tell him , he mocks the pauses that he makes .
and what art thou that dar ’ st appear thus to us ?
mark antony i served , who best was worthy best to be served .
if thou pleasest not , i yield thee up my life .
what is ’ t thou say ’ st ?
i say , o caesar , antony is dead .
the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack .
the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens .
the death of antony is not a single doom .
in the name lay a moiety of the world .
now , my dearest queen— pray you , stand farther from me .
what ’ s the matter ?
i know by that same eye there ’ s some good news .
what , says the married woman you may go ?
would she had never given you leave to come !
let her not say ’ tis i that keep you here .
i have no power upon you .
the gods best know— oh never was there queen so mightily betrayed !
yet at the first i saw the treasons planted .
riotous madness , to be entangled with those mouth-made vows which break themselves in swearing !
when you sued staying , then was the time for words .
i robbed his wound of it .
behold it stained with his most noble blood .
his taints and honors waged equal with him .
i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day , or look on thine .
but i will tell you at some meeter season .
the business of this man looks out of him .
we ’ ll hear him what he says .
bid her have good heart .
so the gods preserve thee !
go and say we purpose her no shame .
go , and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her .
gallus , go you along .
where ’ s dolabella , to second proculeius ?
let him alone , for i remember now how he ’ s employed .
he shall in time be ready .
go with me and see what i can show in this .
tis paltry to be caesar .
not being fortune , he ’ s but fortune ’ s knave , a minister of her will .
what ’ s thy name ?
you ’ re fall ’ n into a princely hand .
i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience , and would gladly look him i ’ th ’ face .
this i ’ ll report , dear lady .
you see how easily she may be surprised .
hold , worthy lady , hold !
do not yourself such wrong , who are in this relieved but not betrayed .
what , of death too , that rids our dogs of languish ?
cleopatra , do not abuse my master ’ s bounty by th ’ undoing of yourself .
let the world see his nobleness well acted , which your death will never let come forth .
where art thou , death ?
come , come and take a queen worth many babes and beggars !
oh , temperance , lady !
this mortal house i ’ ll ruin , do caesar what he can .
shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome ?
rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me .
rather on nilus ’ mud lay me stark naked and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring .
rather make my country ’ s high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains !
you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in caesar .
proculeius , what thou hast done thy master caesar knows , and he hath sent for thee .
for the queen , i ’ ll take her to my guard .
so , dolabella , it shall content me best .
most noble empress , you have heard of me ?
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams .
is ’ t not your trick ?
i understand not , madam .
i dreamt there was an emperor antony .
oh , such another sleep , that i might see but such another man !
his reared arm crested the world .
in his livery walked crowns and crownets .
realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket .
cleopatra— think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of ?
you lie up to the hearing of the gods .
hear me , good madam .
your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it as answering to the weight .
i thank you , sir .
know you what caesar means to do with me ?
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew .
arise , you shall not kneel .
i pray you , rise .
sir , the gods will have it thus .
take to you no hard thoughts .
i ’ ll take my leave .
and may , through all the world !
here , my good lord .
i would i had thy inches .
thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt .
our italy shines o ’ er with civil swords .
sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome .
she ’ s dead , my queen .
you shall advise me in all for cleopatra .
this is the brief of money , plate , and jewels i am possessed of .
tis exactly valued , not petty things admitted .
let him speak , my lord , upon his peril , that i have reserved to myself nothing .
madam , i had rather seal my lips than to my peril speak that which is not .
what have i kept back ?
enough to purchase what you have made known .
nay , blush not , cleopatra .
oh , behold how pomp is followed !
the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild .
thou shalt go back , i warrant thee !
but i ’ ll catch thine eyes , though they had wings .
cleopatra , not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i ’ th ’ roll of conquest .
still be ’ t yours .
no , dear queen , for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel .
our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend .
my master , and my lord !
but , hark thee , charmian .
where ’ s the queen ?
make your best use of this .
i have performed your pleasure and my promise .
dolabella , i shall remain your debtor .
i must attend on caesar .
now , iras , what think ’ st thou ?
thou an egyptian puppet shalt be shown in rome , as well as i .
mechanic slaves with greasy aprons , rules , and hammers shall uplift us to the view .
nay , ’ tis most certain , iras .
oh , the good gods !
nay , that ’ s certain .
i ’ ll never see ’ t !
for i am sure mine nails are stronger than mine eyes .
why , that ’ s the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents .
show me , my women , like a queen .
go fetch my best attires .
wherefore ’ s this noise ?
here is a rural fellow that will not be denied your highness ’ presence .
what poor an instrument may do a noble deed !
my resolution ’ s placed , and i have nothing of woman in me .
now from head to foot i am marble-constant .
now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine .
avoid , and leave him .
hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there , that kills and pains not ?
those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
remember ’ st thou any that have died on ’ t ?
very many , men and women too .
truly , she makes a very good report o ’ th ’ worm .
but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do .
but this is most falliable , the worm ’ s an odd worm .
i wish you all joy of the worm .
you must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman .
well , get thee gone .
i have immortal longings in me .
yare , yare , good iras , quick .
methinks i hear antony call .
i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act .
now to that name my courage prove my title !
i am fire and air , my other elements i give to baser life.—so , have you done ?
come then and take the last warmth of my lips .
have i the aspic in my lips ?
if thus thou vanishest , thou tell ’ st the world it is not worth leave-taking .
dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that i may say the gods themselves do weep !
come , thou mortal wretch , with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie .
poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch .
oh , couldst thou speak , that i might hear thee call great caesar ass unpolicied !
dost thou not see my baby at my breast , that sucks the nurse asleep ?
what should i stay— in this wild world ?
so , fare thee well .
now boast thee , death , in thy possession lies a lass unparalleled .
and golden phoebus never be beheld of eyes again so royal !
your crown ’ s awry .
i ’ ll mend it and then play— where ’ s the queen ?
caesar hath sent— too slow a messenger .
oh , come apace , dispatch !
there ’ s dolabella sent from caesar .
what work is here , charmian ?
it is well done and fitting for a princess descended of so many royal kings .
caesar , thy thoughts touch their effects in this .
thyself art coming to see performed the dreaded act which thou so sought ’ st to hinder .
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water ?
now i see , i see , in fulvia ’ s death how mine received shall be .
cut my lace , charmian , come !
i am quickly ill , and well , so antony loves .
my precious queen , forbear , and give true evidence to his love which stands an honorable trial .
i prithee , turn aside and weep for her .
then bid adieu to me , and say the tears belong to egypt .
o sir , you are too sure an augurer .
that you did fear is done .
the manner of their deaths ?
i do not see them bleed .
who was last with them ?
a simple countryman that brought her figs .
oh , caesar , this charmian lived but now .
i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress .
tremblingly she stood and on the sudden dropped .
here on her breast there is a vent of blood , and something blown .
the like is on her arm .
take up her bed and bear her women from the monument .
she shall be buried by her antony .
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous .
our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral , and then to rome .
come , dolabella , see high order in this great solemnity .
you ’ ll heat my blood .
you can do better yet , but this is meetly .
now , by my sword— and target .
i ’ ll leave you , lady .
courteous lord , one word .
sir , you and i must part , but that ’ s not it .
tis sweating labor to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this .
your honor calls you hence .
therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , and all the gods go with you !
upon your sword sit laurel victory , and smooth success be strewed before your feet .
here ’ s more news .
pompey is strong at sea , and it appears he is beloved of those that only have feared caesar .
i should have known no less .
many hot inroads they make in italy—the borders maritime lack blood to think on ’ t—and flush youth revolt .
antony , leave thy lascivious wassails .
thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at .
let his shames quickly drive him to rome .
pompey thrives in our idleness .
till which encounter it is my business too .
that i might sleep out this great gap of time my antony is away .
you think of him too much .
oh , ’ tis treason !
madam , i trust , not so .
what ’ s your highness ’ pleasure ?
not now to hear thee sing .
i take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has .
tis well for thee that , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of egypt .
not in deed , madam , for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done .
stands he or sits he ?
or is he on his horse ?
o happy horse , to bear the weight of antony !
now i feed myself with most delicious poison .
think on me , that am with phoebus ’ amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time .
nay , hear them , antony .
perform ’ t , or else we damn thee. ” how , my love ?
nay , and most like .
you must not stay here longer .
sovereign of egypt , hail !
how much unlike art thou mark antony !
yet , coming from him , that great med ’ cine hath with his tinct gilded thee .
how goes it with my brave mark antony ?
last thing he did , dear queen , he kissed—the last of many doubled kisses— this orient pearl .
mine ear must pluck it thence .
what was he , sad or merry ?
note him , note him , good charmian , ’ tis the man , but note him .
he was not sad , for he would shine on those that make their looks by his .
ay , madam , twenty several messengers .
why do you send so thick ?
who ’ s born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar .
ink and paper , charmian .
welcome , my good alexas .
did i , charmian , ever love caesar so ?
oh , that brave caesar !
be choked with such another emphasis !
say , “ the brave antony. ” the valiant caesar !
by isis , i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with caesar paragon again my man of men .
by your most gracious pardon , i sing but after you .
the people love me , and the sea is mine .
my powers are crescent , and my auguring hope says it will come to th ’ full .
mark antony in egypt sits at dinner , and will make no wars without doors .
caesar gets money where he loses hearts .
lepidus flatters both , of both is flattered , but he neither loves , nor either cares for him .
caesar and lepidus are in the field .
a mighty strength they carry .
i know they are in rome together looking for antony .
but all the charms of love , salt cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip !
let witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both .
tie up the libertine in a field of feasts , keep his brain fuming .
this is most certain that i shall deliver : mark antony is every hour in rome expected .
since he went from egypt ’ tis a space for farther travel .
his soldiership is twice the other twain .
i can not hope caesar and antony shall well greet together .
i know not , menas , how lesser enmities may give way to greater .
be ’ t as our gods will have ’ t .
it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands .
i shall entreat him to answer like himself .
tis not a time for private stomaching .
but small to greater matters must give way .
not if the small come first .
here comes the noble antony .
were we before our armies , and to fight , i should do thus .
my being in egypt , caesar , what was ’ t to you ?
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt .
yet if you there did practice on my state , your being in egypt might be my question .
how intend you , “ practiced ” ?
you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me .
your wife and brother made wars upon me , and their contestation was theme for you .
you were the word of war .
you do mistake your business .
my brother never did urge me in his act .
of this my letters before did satisfy you .
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me , but you patched up your excuses .
not so , not so .
as for my wife , i would you had her spirit in such another .
for that you must but say i could not help it .
i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria .
three kings i had newly feasted , and did want of what i was i ’ th ’ morning .
but next day i told him of myself , which was as much as to have asked him pardon .
let this fellow be nothing of our strife .
you have broken the article of your oath , which you shall never have tongue to charge me with .
no , lepidus , let him speak .
the honor is sacred which he talks on now , supposing that i lacked it.—but , on , caesar .
the article of my oath ?
to lend me arms and aid when i required them , the which you both denied .
neglected , rather , and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge .
you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
thou art a soldier only .
give me leave , caesar .
thou hast a sister by the mother ’ s side , admired octavia .
great mark antony is now a widower .
say not so , agrippa .
if cleopatra heard you , your reproof were well deserved of rashness .
i am not married , caesar .
let me hear agrippa further speak .
her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her .
the power of caesar , and his power unto octavia .
may i never to this good purpose , that so fairly shows , dream of impediment !
there ’ s my hand .
a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly .
let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never fly off our loves again !
time calls upon ’ s .
of us must pompey presently be sought , or else he seeks out us .
what is his strength by land ?
but by sea he is an absolute master .
let us , lepidus , not lack your company .
noble antony , not sickness should detain me .
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
you stayed well by ’ t in egypt .
eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast—and but twelve persons there !
this was but as a fly by an eagle .
we had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
she ’ s a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
oh , rare for antony !
upon her landing , antony sent to her , invited her to supper .
she replied it should be better he became her guest , which she entreated .
now antony must leave her utterly .
age can not wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety .
good enobarbus , make yourself my guest whilst you abide here .
humbly , sir , i thank you .
all which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you .
if you can , your reason ?
but yet hie you to egypt again .
say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , caesar ’ s or mine ?
therefore , o antony , stay not by his side .
but near him thy angel becomes afeard , as being o ’ erpowered .
therefore make space enough between you .
to none but thee , no more but when to thee .
thy luster thickens when he shines by .
and though i make this marriage for my peace , i ’ th ’ east my pleasure lies .
your commission ’ s ready .
follow me and receive ’ t .
pray you , hasten your generals after .
sir , mark antony will e ’ en but kiss octavia , and we ’ ll follow .
till i shall see you in your soldiers ’ dress , which will become you both , farewell .
my purposes do draw me much about .
you ’ ll win two days upon me .
music , moody food of us that trade in love .
let ’ s to billiards .
as well as i can , madam .
i ’ ll none now .
we ’ ll to th ’ river .
there , my music playing far off , i will betray tawny-finned fishes .
ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , that long time have been barren .
madam , madam— antonio ’ s dead !
if thou say so , villain , thou kill ’ st thy mistress .
first , madam , he is well .
why , there ’ s more gold .
but , sirrah , mark , we use to say the dead are well .
bring it to that , the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill-uttering throat .
good madam , hear me .
well , go to , i will .
i am the duke that loved your father .
support him by the arm .
give me your hand , and let me all your fortunes understand .
sir , sir , that can not be .
but look to it : find out thy brother , wheresoe'er he is .
oh , that your highness knew my heart in this : i never loved my brother in my life .
do this expediently , and turn him going .
hang there , my verse , in witness of my love .
and how like you this shepherd ’ s life , master touchstone ?
hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
such a one is a natural philosopher .
wast ever in court , shepherd ?
thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
not a whit , touchstone .
you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands .
that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .
why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
why , do not your courtier ’ s hands sweat ?
and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?
a better instance , i say .
besides , our hands are hard .
your lips will feel them the sooner .
thou worms ' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .
mend the instance , shepherd .
you have too courtly a wit for me .
good morrow to your worship .
can you tell if rosalind , the duke ’ s daughter , be banished with her father ?
where will the old duke live ?
god help thee , shallow man .
god make incision in thee ; thou art raw .
here comes young master ganymede , my new mistress ’ s brother .
no jewel is like rosalind .
her worth being mounted on the wind , through all the world bears rosalind .
all the pictures fairest lined are but black to rosalind .
let no fair be kept in mind but the fair of rosalind .
i ’ ll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted .
it is the right butter-women ’ s rank to market .
for a taste : if a hart do lack a hind , let him seek out rosalind .
if the cat will after kind , so , be sure , will rosalind .
winter garments must be lined , so must slender rosalind .
they that reap must sheaf and bind , then to cart with rosalind .
sweetest nut hath sourest rind ; such a nut is rosalind .
he that sweetest rose will find must find love ’ s prick , and rosalind .
this is the very false gallop of verses .
why do you infect yourself with them ?
peace , you dull fool .
i found them on a tree .
truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
you have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .
therefore heaven nature charged that one body should be filled with all graces wide-enlarged .
heaven would that she these gifts should have and i to live and die her slave .
didst thou hear these verses ?
but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?
and a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
nay , but who is it ?
nay , i prithee now , with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .
one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery .
i prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that i may drink thy tidings .
so you may put a man in your belly .
is he of god ’ s making ?
is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard ?
nay , he hath but a little beard .
why , god will send more , if the man will be thankful .
let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
nay , but the devil take mocking .
i ' faith , coz , ’ tis he .
what did he when thou saw ’ st him ?
did he ask for me ?
how parted he with thee ?
and when shalt thou see him again ?
answer me in one word .
but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man ’ s apparel ?
looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
but take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn .
it may well be called jove ’ s tree when it drops forth such fruit .
give me audience , good madam .
there lay he , stretched along like a wounded knight .
though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
cry “ holla ” to thy tongue , i prithee .
he was furnished like a hunter .
he comes to kill my heart .
i would sing my song without a burden .
thou bring ’ st me out of tune .
do you not know i am a woman ?
when i think , i must speak .
soft , comes he not here ?
and so had i , but yet , for fashion sake , i thank you too for your society .
god be wi ' you .
let ’ s meet as little as we can .
i do desire we may be better strangers .
i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks .
i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .
rosalind is your love ’ s name ?
i do not like her name .
what stature is she of ?
just as high as my heart .
you are full of pretty answers .
the worst fault you have is to be in love .
tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue .
i am weary of you .
there i shall see mine own figure .
which i take to be either a fool or a cipher .
i ’ ll tarry no longer with you .
farewell , good signior love .
i am glad of your departure .
adieu , good monsieur melancholy .
you should ask me what time o ' day .
there ’ s no clock in the forest .
marry , do i , sir , and i came to acquaint you with a matter .
i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .
and why not the swift foot of time ?
had not that been as proper ?
by no means , sir .
time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons .
i prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
who doth he gallop withal ?
who stays it still withal ?
where dwell you , pretty youth ?
are you native of this place ?
as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
i have been told so of many .
can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
i prithee , recount some of them .
no , i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .
i am he that is so love-shaked .
i pray you tell me your remedy .
there is none of my uncle ’ s marks upon you .
but you are no such man .
you are rather point-device in your accouterments , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
fair youth , i would i could make thee believe i love .
but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
yet i profess curing it by counsel .
did you ever cure any so ?
yes , one , and in this manner .
i would not be cured , youth .
now , by the faith of my love , i will .
tell me where it is .
with all my heart , good youth .
nay , you must call me rosalind.—come , sister , will you go ?
come apace , good audrey .
i will fetch up your goats , audrey .
doth my simple feature content you ?
your features , lord warrant us !
truly , i would the gods had made thee poetical .
i do not know what “ poetical ” is .
is it honest in deed and word ?
is it a true thing ?
do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
i do , truly , for thou swear ’ st to me thou art honest .
now , if thou wert a poet , i might have some hope thou didst feign .
would you not have me honest ?
well , i am not fair , and therefore i pray the gods make me honest .
i am not a slut , though i thank the gods i am foul .
well , praised be the gods for thy foulness ; sluttishness may come hereafter .
well , that is the dowry of his wife ; ’ tis none of his own getting .
the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
is the single man therefore blessed ?
here comes sir oliver.—sir oliver martext , you are well met .
will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
is there none here to give the woman ?
i will not take her on gift of any man .
truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
how do you , sir ?
you are very well met .
god 'ild you for your last company .
i am very glad to see you .
even a toy in hand here , sir .
nay , pray be covered .
will you be married , motley ?
and will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is .
then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
do , i prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .
but have i not cause to weep ?
as good cause as one would desire .
and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
i am heartily glad i came hither to you .
if he come tomorrow , i ’ ll give him his payment .
if ever he go alone again , i ’ ll never wrestle for prize more .
but it shall not be so long ; this wrestler shall clear all .
you have heard him swear downright he was .
he attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him .
so he laughed and let me go .
but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando ?
oh , that ’ s a brave man .
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
sweet phoebe , do not scorn me .
say that you love me not , but say not so in bitterness .
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee .
but now mine eyes , which i have darted at thee , hurt thee not .
nor , i am sure , there is no force in eyes that can do hurt .
but till that time come not thou near me .
but , mistress , know yourself .
cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer .
so take her to thee , shepherd .
besides , i like you not .
will you go , sister ? —shepherd , ply her hard .
come , sister.—shepherdess , look on him better , and be not proud .
though all the world could see , none could be so abused in sight as he .
sweet phoebe , pity me .
why , i am sorry for thee , gentle silvius .
why , that were covetousness .
but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employed .
know ’ st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
think not i love him , though i ask for him .
tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well— but what care i for words ?
yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear .
it is a pretty youth—not very pretty— but sure he ’ s proud—and yet his pride becomes him .
he ’ ll make a proper man .
he is not very tall—yet for his years he ’ s tall .
his leg is but so-so—and yet ’ tis well .
for what had he to do to chide at me ?
i marvel why i answered not again .
but that ’ s all one : omittance is no quittance .
i ’ ll write to him a very taunting letter , and thou shalt bear it .
phoebe , with all my heart .
i will be bitter with him and passing short .
go with me , silvius .
i prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
they say you are a melancholy fellow .
i do love it better than laughing .
why , ’ tis good to be sad and say nothing .
why then , ’ tis good to be a post .
by my faith , you have great reason to be sad .
i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men ’ s .
then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
yes , i have gained my experience .
and your experience makes you sad .
good day and happiness , dear rosalind .
my fair rosalind , i come within an hour of my promise .
i pray thee , rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
herein i see thou lov ’ st me not with the full weight that i love thee .
well , i will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .
by mine honor i will , and when i break that oath , let me turn monster .
therefore , my sweet rose , my dear rose , be merry .
from henceforth i will , coz , and devise sports .
let me see—what think you of falling in love ?
break an hour ’ s promise in love ?
pardon me , dear rosalind .
nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight .
i had as lief be wooed of a snail .
besides , he brings his destiny with him .
why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for .
but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
virtue is no hornmaker , and my rosalind is virtuous .
and i am your rosalind .
rosalind of a better leer than you .
what would you say to me now , an i were your very , very rosalind ?
i would kiss before i spoke .
how if the kiss be denied ?
who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
am not i your rosalind ?
i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her .
no , faith , die by attorney .
then love me , rosalind .
yes , faith , will i , fridays and saturdays and all .
and wilt thou have me ?
ay , and twenty such .
pray thee , marry us .
why , now , as fast as she can marry us .
i might ask you for your commission , but i do take thee , orlando , for my husband .
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
i will laugh like a hyena , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
but will my rosalind do so ?
oh , but she is wise .
or else she could not have the wit to do this .
the wiser , the waywarder .
make the doors upon a woman ’ s wit , and it will out at the casement .
shut that , and ’ twill out at the keyhole .
stop that , ’ twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue .
for these two hours , rosalind , i will leave thee .
i must attend the duke at dinner .
by two o'clock i will be with thee again .
ay , go your ways , go your ways .
i knew what you would prove .
my friends told me as much , and i thought no less .
tis but one cast away , and so , come , death .
two o'clock is your hour ?
therefore beware my censure , and keep your promise .
with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind .
well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .
you have simply misused our sex in your love-prate .
or rather bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
i ’ ll tell thee , aliena , i can not be out of the sight of orlando .
i ’ ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
and i ’ ll sleep .
which is he that killed the deer ?
tis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
is it not past two o'clock ?
no , i protest , i know not the contents .
what shall be our sport , then ?
when nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by fortune fall into the fire ?
come , come , you are a fool , and turned into the extremity of love .
i say she never did invent this letter .
this is a man ’ s invention , and his hand .
why , she defies me like turk to christian .
will you hear the letter ?
mark how the tyrant writes .
that a maiden ’ s heart hath burned ?
why , thy godhead laid apart , warr ’ st thou with a woman ’ s heart ?
it is no boast , being asked , to say we are .
i pray you , tell it .
this seen , orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother , his elder brother .
but to orlando : did he leave him there , food to the sucked and hungry lioness ?
was ’ t you he rescued ?
was ’ t you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
but for the bloody napkin ?
many will swoon when they do look on blood .
there is more in it.—cousin ganymede .
i would i were at home .
we ’ ll lead you thither .
i pray you , will you take him by the arm ?
be of good cheer , youth .
you lack a man ’ s heart .
i do so , i confess it .
ah , sirrah , a body would think this was well-counterfeited .
i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited .
there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .
counterfeit , i assure you .
well then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .
but i ' faith , i should have been a woman by right .
come , you look paler and paler .
that will i , for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother , rosalind .
but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him .
we shall find a time , audrey .
faith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman ’ s saying .
a most wicked sir oliver , audrey , a most vile martext .
but , audrey , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .
here comes the man you mean .
it is meat and drink to me to see a clown .
how old are you , friend ?
wast born i ' th ' forest here ?
ay , sir , i thank god .
thank god. ” a good answer .
faith , sir , so-so .
so-so ” is good , very good , very excellent good .
and yet it is not : it is but so-so .
ay , sir , i have a pretty wit .
why , thou sayst well .
then learn this of me : to have is to have .
he , sir , that must marry this woman .
i will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel .
i will bandy with thee in faction .
i will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways .
god rest you merry , sir .
our master and mistress seeks you .
trip , audrey , trip , audrey.—i attend , i attend .
mistress , you must come away to your father .
were you made the messenger ?
how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ?
ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
stand you both forth now : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
by our beards ( if we had them ) , thou art .
by my knavery ( if i had it ) , then i were .
is ’ t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ?
let your wedding be tomorrow .
thither will i invite the duke and all ’ s contented followers .
go you and prepare aliena , for look you , here comes my rosalind .
and you , fair sister .
o my dear orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf .
i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
they are in the very wrath of love , and they will together .
clubs can not part them .
they shall be married tomorrow , and i will bid the duke to the nuptial .
but oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man ’ s eyes .
why , then , tomorrow i can not serve your turn for rosalind ?
i can live no longer by thinking .
i will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
believe then , if you please , that i can do strange things .
speak ’ st thou in sober meanings ?
by my life i do , which i tender dearly , though i say i am a magician .
look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .
i care not if i have .
you are there followed by a faithful shepherd .
good shepherd , tell this youth what ’ tis to love .
it is to be all made of sighs and tears , and so am i for phoebe .
and i for no woman .
it is to be all made of faith and service , and so am i for phoebe .
and i for no woman .
and so am i for rosalind .
and so am i for no woman .
if this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
if this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
if this be so , why blame you me to love you ?
why do you speak , too , “ why blame you me to love you ? ” ?
to her that is not here , nor doth not hear .
pray you , no more of this .
tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon .
i ’ ll not fail , if i live .
tomorrow is the joyful day , audrey .
tomorrow will we be married .
here comes two of the banished duke ’ s pages .
well met , honest gentleman .
by my troth , well met .
come , sit , sit , and a song .
sit i ' th ' middle .
i ' faith , i ' faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .
dost thou believe , orlando , that the boy can do all this that he hath promisèd ?
that would i , had i kingdoms to give with her .
that would i , were i of all kingdoms king .
that will i , should i die the hour after .
but if you do refuse to marry me , you ’ ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
though to have her and death were both one thing .
i have promised to make all this matter even .
keep your word , silvius , that you ’ ll marry her if she refuse me .
and from hence i go to make these doubts all even .
i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter ’ s favor .
my lord , the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter .
good my lord , bid him welcome .
this is the motley-minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest .
he hath been a courtier , he swears .
if any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .
i have undone three tailors .
i have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
and how was that ta'en up ?
faith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
how “ seventh cause ” ? —good my lord , like this fellow .
i like him very well .
prithee , who is ’ t that thou mean ’ st ?
one that old frederick , your father , loves .
my father ’ s love is enough to honor him .
speak no more of him ; you ’ ll be whipped for taxation one of these days .
the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
with his mouth full of news .
which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .
then shall we be news-crammed .
we shall be the more marketable.—bonjour , monsieur le beau .
what ’ s the news ?
fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
god 'ild you , sir .
a poor virgin , sir , an ill-favored thing , sir , but mine own .
by my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
but for the seventh cause .
how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
he ’ s as good at anything and yet a fool .
he uses his folly like a stalking-horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
then is there mirth in heaven when earthly things , made even , atone together .
good duke , receive thy daughter .
if there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
if there be truth in sight , you are my rosalind .
if sight and shape be true , why then , my love adieu .
o my dear niece , welcome thou art to me , even daughter , welcome in no less degree .
let me have audience for a word or two .
i am the second son of old sir rowland , that bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
this to be true i do engage my life .
out of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learned .
stay , jaques , stay .
to see no pastime i .
what you would have i ’ ll stay to know at your abandoned cave .
we ’ ll so begin these rites as we do trust they ’ ll end , in true delights .
how shall i answer you ?
as wit and fortune will .
you tell us the manner of the wrestling .
well , the beginning that is dead and buried .
there comes an old man and his three sons— i could match this beginning with an old tale .
three proper young men of excellent growth and presence .
so he served the second , and so the third .
but what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?
why , this that i speak of .
or i , i promise thee .
but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
shall we see this wrestling , cousin ?
yonder sure they are coming .
let us now stay and see it .
since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
alas , he is too young .
how now , daughter and cousin ?
are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
call him hither , good monsieur le beau .
yonder comes my master , your brother .
go apart , adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
monsieur the challenger , the princess calls for you .
i attend them with all respect and duty .
young man , have you challenged charles the wrestler ?
he is the general challenger .
i come but in as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .
you have seen cruel proof of this man ’ s strength .
we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
the little strength that i have , i would it were with you .
and mine , to eke out hers .
pray heaven i be deceived in you .
your heart ’ s desires be with you .
you shall try but one fall .
i would i were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye , i can tell who should down .
no more , no more .
how dost thou , charles ?
he can not speak , my lord .
what is thy name , young man ?
orlando , my liege , the youngest son of sir rowland de boys .
i would thou hadst been son to some man else .
the world esteemed thy father honorable , but i did find him still mine enemy .
i would thou hadst told me of another father .
were i my father , coz , would i do this ?
gentle cousin , let us go thank him and encourage him .
shall we go , coz ?
ay.—fare you well , fair gentleman .
will you go , coz ?
what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?
i can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .
or charles or something weaker masters thee .
good sir , i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place .
sir , fare you well .
hereafter , in a better world than this , i shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
i rest much bounden to you .
thus must i from the smoke into the smother , from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .
not one to throw at a dog .
no , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs .
throw some of them at me .
but is all this for your father ?
no , some of it is for my child ’ s father .
if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
i would try , if i could cry “ hem ” and have him .
come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
oh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .
oh , a good wish upon you .
the duke my father loved his father dearly .
doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ?
by this kind of chase i should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly .
yet i hate not orlando .
no , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
doth he not deserve well ?
let me love him for that , and do you love him because i do .
look , here comes the duke .
with his eyes full of anger .
mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , and get you from our court .
i do beseech your grace , let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me .
if their purgation did consist in words , they are as innocent as grace itself .
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not .
thou art thy father ’ s daughter .
so was i when your highness took his dukedom .
so was i when your highness banished him .
my father was no traitor .
then , good my liege , mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous .
dear sovereign , hear me speak .
ay , celia , we stayed her for your sake .
i was too young that time to value her , but now i know her .
if she be a traitor , why so am i .
then open not thy lips .
firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have passed upon her .
pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege .
i can not live out of her company .
you are a fool.—you , niece , provide yourself .
if you outstay the time , upon mine honor and in the greatness of my word , you die .
o my poor rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?
i will give thee mine .
i charge thee , be not thou more grieved than i am .
now , sir , what make you here ?
i am not taught to make anything .
what mar you then , sir ?
marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
know you where you are , sir ?
o sir , very well : here in your orchard .
know you before whom , sir ?
ay , better than him i am before knows me .
thou hast not , cousin .
know ’ st thou not the duke hath banished me , his daughter ?
rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one .
shall we part , sweet girl ?
why , whither shall we go ?
to seek my uncle in the forest of arden .
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
i ’ ll put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face .
what shall i call thee when thou art a man ?
but what will you be called ?
would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
leave me alone to woo him .
now go we in content to liberty , and not to banishment .
are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court ?
i would not change it .
come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
and did you leave him in this contemplation ?
we did , my lord , weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer .
i love to cope him in these sullen fits , for then he ’ s full of matter .
i ’ ll bring you to him straight .
can it be possible that no man saw them ?
some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this .
i can not hear of any that did see her .
if he be absent , bring his brother to me .
i ’ ll make him find him .
do this suddenly , and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways .
why , what make you here ?
why do people love you ?
and wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant ?
why would you be so fond to overcome the bonny prizer of the humorous duke ?
your praise is come too swiftly home before you .
know you not , master , to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies ?
oh , what a world is this when what is comely envenoms him that bears it !
why , what ’ s the matter ?
within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives .
if he fail of that , he will have other means to cut you off .
i overheard him and his practices .
this is no place , this house is but a butchery .
abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
why , whither , adam , wouldst thou have me go ?
no matter whither , so you come not here .
yet this i will not do , do how i can .
i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
let me be your servant .
therefore my age is as a lusty winter , frosty but kindly .
let me go with you .
i ’ ll do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities .
master , go on , and i will follow thee to the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here livèd i , but now live here no more .
at seventeen years , many their fortunes seek , but at fourscore , it is too late a week .
yet fortune can not recompense me better than to die well , and not my master ’ s debtor .
o jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
i care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
i can not go no further .
for my part , i had rather bear with you than bear you .
ay , now am i in arden , the more fool i .
ay , be so , good touchstone .
look you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
wilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?
thou hast railed on thyself .
sweet masters , be patient .
for your father ’ s remembrance , be at accord .
let me go , i say .
i will not till i please .
my father charged you in his will to give me good education .
you have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .
the spirit of my father grows strong in me , and i will no longer endure it .
and what wilt thou do—beg when that is spent ?
well , sir , get you in .
i will not long be troubled with you .
you shall have some part of your will .
i pray you leave me .
that is the way to make her scorn you still .
o corin , that thou knew ’ st how i do love her !
i partly guess , for i have loved ere now .
into a thousand that i have forgotten .
oh , thou didst then ne'er love so heartily .
o phoebe , phoebe , phoebe !
alas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , i have by hard adventure found mine own .
but as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
thou speak ’ st wiser than thou art ware of .
nay , i shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it .
jove , jove , this shepherd ’ s passion is much upon my fashion .
and mine , but it grows something stale with me .
he ’ s not thy kinsman .
but i am shepherd to another man and do not shear the fleeces that i graze .
what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?
that young swain that you saw here but erewhile , that little cares for buying anything .
and we will mend thy wages .
assuredly the thing is to be sold .
more , more , i prithee , more .
it will make you melancholy , monsieur jaques .
more , i prithee , more .
i can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs .
more , i prithee , more .
i know i can not please you .
come , more , another stanzo .
nay , i care not for their names .
well then , if ever i thank any man , i ’ ll thank you .
but that they call “ compliment ” is like th ' encounter of two dog- apes .
and i have been all this day to avoid him .
he is too disputable for my company .
come , warble , come .
i ’ ll give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention .
dear master , i can go no further .
oh , i die for food .
here lie i down and measure out my grave .
why , how now , adam ?
no greater heart in thee ?
live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .
thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers .
but if thou diest before i come , thou art a mocker of my labor .
thou look ’ st cheerly , and i ’ ll be with thee quickly .
yet thou liest in the bleak air .
i think he be transformed into a beast , for i can nowhere find him like a man .
my lord , he is but even now gone hence .
here was he merry , hearing of a song .
if he , compact of jars , grow musical , we shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
tell him i would speak with him .
he saves my labor by his own approach .
why , how now , monsieur ?
what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company ?
what , you look merrily .
thus we may see , ” quoth he , “ how the world wags .
tis but an hour ago since it was nine , and after one hour more ’ twill be eleven .
motley ’ s the only wear .
oh , that i were a fool !
god be with my old master .
he would not have spoke such a word .
begin you to grow upon me ?
i will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.—holla , dennis !
was not charles , the duke ’ s wrestler , here to speak with me ?
so please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
twill be a good way , and tomorrow the wrestling is .
and they that are most gallèd with my folly , they most must laugh .
and why , sir , must they so ?
invest me in my motley .
i can tell what thou wouldst do .
what , for a counter , would i do but good ?
forbear , and eat no more .
why , i have eat none yet .
nor shalt not till necessity be served .
of what kind should this cock come of ?
you touched my vein at first .
but forbear , i say .
an you will not be answered with reason , i must die .
your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness .
i almost die for food , and let me have it .
sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
pardon me , i pray you .
there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limped in pure love .
i thank you ; and be blessed for your good comfort .
thou seest we are not all alone unhappy .
all the world ’ s a stage , and all the men and women merely players .
at first the infant , mewling and puking in the nurse ’ s arms .
then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face , creeping like snail unwillingly to school .
set down your venerable burden , and let him feed .
i thank you most for him .

how fondly dost thou reason !

sure , these are but imaginary wiles , and lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
master , here ’ s the gold you sent me for .
what adam dost thou mean ?
what , thou meanest an officer ?
is there any ships put forth tonight ?
some blessed power deliver us from hence !
well met , well met , master antipholus .
i see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now .
is that the chain you promised me today ?
i charge thee , tempt me not .
master , is this mistress satan ?
light is an effect of fire , and fire will burn : ergo , light wenches will burn .
your man and you are marvelous merry , sir .
will you go with me ?
we ’ ll mend our dinner here .
master , if you do , expect spoon meat ; or bespeak a long spoon .
i pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain .
i hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
avaunt , thou witch ! —come , dromio , let us go .
mistress , that you know .
now , out of doubt antipholus is mad ; else would he never so demean himself .
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , and for the same he promised me a chain .
both one and other he denies me now .
belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , on purpose shut the doors against his way .
this course i fittest choose , for forty ducats is too much to lose .
therefore , merchant , i ’ ll limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help .
i will , my lord .
fear me not , man .
i tell you , ’ twill sound harshly in her ears .
i think he brings the money .
have you that i sent you for ?
here ’ s that , i warrant you , will pay them all .
but where ’ s the money ?
why , sir , i gave the money for the rope .
i ’ ll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
to what end did i bid thee hie thee home ?
to a rope ’ s end , sir , and to that end am i returned .
and to that end , sir , i will welcome you .
good sir , be patient .
good now , hold thy tongue .
nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
i would i were senseless , sir , that i might not feel your blows .
thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
my wife is coming yonder .
mistress , wilt thou still talk ?
is not your husband mad ?
mark how he trembles in his ecstasy .
i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven .
peace , doting wizard , peace .
o , that thou wert not , poor distressèd soul !
you minion , you , are these your customers ?
thou villain , what sayest thou ?
sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
were not my doors locked up and i shut out ?
perdie , your doors were locked , and you shut out .
and did not she herself revile me there ?
sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
did not her kitchen maid rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
and did not i in rage depart from thence ?
in verity you did.—my bones bear witness , that since have felt the vigour of his rage .
alas , i sent you money to redeem you by dromio here , who came in haste for it .
went ’ st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
he came to me , and i delivered it .
and i am witness with her that she did .
god and the rope-maker bear me witness that i was sent for nothing but a rope .
mistress , both man and master is possessed .
i know it by their pale and deadly looks .
they must be bound and laid in some dark room .
i did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
and , gentle master , i received no gold .
but i confess , sir , that we were locked out .
let him not come near me .
the fiend is strong within him .
what , will you murder me ? —thou jailer , thou , i am thy prisoner .
wilt thou suffer them to make a rescue ?
masters , let him go .
he is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
go , bind this man , for he is frantic too .
if i let him go , the debt he owes will be required of me .
i will discharge thee ere i go from thee .
master , i am here entered in bond for you .
how idly do they talk !
one angelo , a goldsmith .
say , how grows it due ?
due for a chain your husband had of him .
he did bespeak a chain for me but had it not .
i long to know the truth hereof at large .
god for thy mercy , they are loose again !
and come with naked swords .
let ’ s call more help to have them bound again .
they ’ ll kill us .
i see these witches are afraid of swords .
she that would be your wife now ran from you .
i long that we were safe and sound aboard .
faith , stay here this night .
they will surely do us no harm .
you saw they speak us fair , give us gold .
methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh
i will not stay tonight for all the town .
therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
how is the man esteemed here in the city ?
his word might bear my wealth at any time .
tis so ; and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have .
good sir , draw near to me .
therefore give out you are of epidamnum , lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .
there is your money that i had to keep .
within this hour it will be dinnertime .
many a man would take you at your word and go indeed , having so good a mean .
i never did deny it .
yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
these ears of mine , thou know ’ st did hear thee .
fie on thee , wretch .
tis pity that thou liv ’ st to walk where any honest men resort .
thou art a villain to impeach me thus .
i ’ ll prove mine honor and mine honesty against thee presently if thou dar ’ st stand .
i dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
run , master , run .
for god ’ s sake , take a house .
in , or we are spoiled .
to fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
let us come in , that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery .
how long hath this possession held the man ?
this week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , and much different from the man he was .
but till this afternoon his passion ne'er brake into extremity of rage .
which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
you should for that have reprehended him .
why , so i did .
ay , but not rough enough .
ay , but not enough .
alone , it was the subject of my theme ; in company i often glancèd it .
still did i tell him it was vile and bad .
and thereof came it that the man was mad .
the venom clamors of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog ’ s tooth .
thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .
thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls .
in food , in sport , and life-preserving rest to be disturbed , would mad or man or beast .
the consequence is , then , thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
good people , enter and lay hold on him .
then let your servants bring my husband forth .
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath , a charitable duty of my order .
therefore depart and leave him here with me .
thou shalt not have him .
complain unto the duke of this indignity .
by this , i think , the dial points at five .
we will behold his death .
kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
justice , most sacred duke , against the abbess .
she is a virtuous and a reverend lady .
it can not be that she hath done thee wrong .
therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
thy master and his man are here , and that is false thou dost report to us .
mistress , upon my life i tell you true .
i have not breathed almost since i did see it .
ay me , it is my husband .
witness you that he is borne about invisible .
even for the blood that then i lost for thee , now grant me justice .
beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
a grievous fault.—say , woman , didst thou so ?
no , my good lord .
myself , he , and my sister today did dine together .
so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal .
ne'er may i look on day , nor sleep on night but she tells to your highness simple truth .
our dinner done and he not coming thither , i went to seek him .
in the street i met him , and in his company that gentleman .
by th ' way we met my wife , her sister , and a rabble more of vile confederates .
but had he such a chain of thee or no ?
i never saw the chain , so help me heaven , and this is false you burden me withal .
why , what an intricate impeach is this !
my present business calls me from you now .
i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city .
sir , i commend you to your own content .
he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i can not get .
how chance thou art returned so soon ?
rather approach ’ d too late !
you say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here denies that saying .
sir , he dined with her there , at the porpentine .
he did , and from my finger snatched that ring .
tis true , my liege ; this ring i had of her .
saw ’ st thou him enter at the abbey here ?
as sure , my liege , as i do see your grace .
i think you are all mated or stark mad .
most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word .
haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me .
now am i dromio , and his man , unbound .
i am sure you both of you remember me .
you are not pinch ’ s patient , are you , sir ?
why look you strange on me ?
i never saw you in my life till now .
but tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ?
no , trust me , sir , nor i. i am sure thou dost .
all these old witnesses—i can not err— tell me thou art my son antipholus .
i never saw my father in my life .
but seven years since , in syracusa , boy , thou know ’ st we parted .
i see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
most mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .
i see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
i , sir , am dromio .
i , sir , am dromio .
please , let me stay .
o , my old master.—who hath bound him here ?
o , if thou be ’ st the same egeon , speak , and speak unto the same emilia .
if i dream not , thou art emilia .
if thou art she , tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
i know not which is which .
i came from corinth , my most gracious lord .
brought to this town by that most famous warrior duke menaphon , your most renownèd uncle .
which of you two did dine with me today ?
and are not you my husband ?
that is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
i think it be , sir .
and you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
i think i did , sir .
no , none by me .
this purse of ducats i received from you , and dromio my man did bring them me .
these ducats pawn i for my father here .
thy father hath his life .
sir , i must have that diamond from you .
there , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .
after so long grief , such nativity !
with all my heart i ’ ll gossip at this feast .
dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked ?
your goods that lay at host , sir , in the centaur .
he speaks to me.—i am your master , dromio .
there is a fat friend at your master ’ s house that kitchened me for you today at dinner .
she now shall be my sister , not my wife .
will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
that ’ s a question .
how shall we try it ?
we ’ ll draw cuts for the signior .
till then , lead thou first .
stop in your wind , sir .
tell me this , i pray : where have you left the money that i gave you ?
the saddler had it , sir ; i kept it not .
i am not in a sportive humor now .
tell me , and dally not : where is the money ?
we being strangers here , how dar ’ st thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody ?
i pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner .
methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , and strike you home without a messenger .
come , dromio , come , these jests are out of season .
reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
where is the gold i gave in charge to thee ?
why , you gave no gold to me !
my mistress and her sister stays for you .
where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
what mistress , slave , hast thou ?
what , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , being forbid ?
there , take you that , sir knave .
what mean you , sir ?
for god ’ s sake , hold your hands .
nay , an you will not , sir , i ’ ll take my heels .
upon my life , by some device or other the villain is o'erraught of all my money .
neither my husband nor the slave returned that in such haste i sent to seek his master ?
sure , luciana , it is two o'clock .
perhaps some merchant hath invited him , and from the mart he ’ s somewhere gone to dinner .
good sister , let us dine and never fret .
if so , be patient , sister .
why should their liberty than ours be more ?
because their business still lies out o ' door .
why , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe .
then let your will attend on their accords .
this servitude makes you to keep unwed .
not this , but troubles of the marriage bed .
but , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
ere i learn love , i ’ ll practice to obey .
how if your husband start some otherwhere ?
till he come home again , i would forbear .
no marvel though she pause ; they can be meek that have no other cause .
well , i will marry one day , but to try .
say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
know ’ st thou his mind ?
but say , i prithee , is he coming home ?
it seems he hath great care to please his wife .
why , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .
horn mad , thou villain !
i mean not cuckold mad , but sure he is stark mad .
my mistress , sir , ” quoth i .
go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
go back again and be new beaten home ?
for god ’ s sake , send some other messenger .
back , slave , or i will break thy pate across .
you spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither .
if i last in this service , you must case me in leather .
fie , how impatience loureth in your face .
his company must do his minions grace , whilst i at home starve for a merry look .
hath homely age th ' alluring beauty took from my poor cheek ?
my decayèd fair a sunny look of his would soon repair .
but , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale and feeds from home .
poor i am but his stale .
self-harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere , or else what lets it but he would be here ?
sister , you know he promised me a chain .
would that alone o ' love he would detain , so he would keep fair quarter with his bed .
i see the jewel best enamelèd will lose his beauty .
how many fond fools serve mad jealousy !
proceed , solinus , to procure my fall , and by the doom of death end woes and all .
see , here he comes .
is your merry humor altered ?
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?
my house was at the phoenix ?
wast thou mad , that thus so madly thou didst answer me ?
when spake i such a word ?
i am glad to see you in this merry vein .
i pray you , master , tell me ?
yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
think ’ st thou i jest ?
hold , take thou that and that .
hold , sir , for god ’ s sake !
now your jest is earnest .
upon what bargain do you give it me ?
sconce ” call you it ?
shall i tell you why ?
well , sir , i thank you .
marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
i ’ ll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
but say , sir , is it dinnertime ?
in good time , sir , what ’ s that ?
well , sir , then ’ twill be dry .
if it be , sir , i pray you , eat none of it .
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
well , sir , learn to jest in good time .
there ’ s a time for all things .
i durst have denied that before you were so choleric .
by what rule , sir ?
marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself .
let ’ s hear it .
there ’ s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
why is time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
why , but there ’ s many a man hath more hair than wit .
why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
for two , and sound ones too .
nay , not sound , i pray you .
nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
when were you wont to use my sister thus ?
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner .
did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
what is the course and drift of your compact ?
i never saw her till this time .
villain , thou liest ; for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
i never spake with her in all my life .
what , was i married to her in my dream ?
or sleep i now and think i hear all this ?
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?
until i know this sure uncertainty i ’ ll entertain the offered fallacy .
dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
o , for my beads !
i cross me for a sinner .
this is the fairy land .
why prat ’ st thou to thyself and answer ’ st not ?
dromio—thou , dromio—thou snail , thou slug , thou sot .
i am transformèd , master , am i not ?
come , sir , to dinner.—dromio , keep the gate .
husband , i ’ ll dine above with you today , and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
am i in earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
known unto these , and to myself disguised !
master , shall i be porter at the gate ?
ay ; and let none enter , lest i break your pate .
alas , too soon we came aboard .
good signior angelo , you must excuse us all ; my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours .
say what you will , sir , but i know what i know .
i think thou art an ass .
you ’ re sad , signior balthasar .
i hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
good meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .
and welcome more common , for that ’ s nothing but words .
small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
ay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest .
but though my cates be mean , take them in good part .
better cheer may you have , but not with better heart .
my door is lock ’ d .
maud , bridget , marian , ciceley , gillian , ginn !
my master stays in the street .
ho , open the door .
i have not dined today .
what art thou that keep ’ st me out from the house i owe ?
o villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !
o lord , i must laugh .
have at you with a proverb : shall i set in my staff ?
do you hear , you minion ?
you ’ ll let us in , i hope ?
so , come , help .
there was blow for blow .
thou baggage , let me in .
master , knock the door hard .
you ’ ll cry for this , minion , if i beat the door down .
are you there , wife ?
you might have come before .
if you went in pain , master , this knave would go sore .
in debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
you would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
your cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .
it would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .
go , fetch me something : i ’ ll break ope the gate .
here ’ s too much “ out upon thee ! ” i pray thee , let me in .
well , i ’ ll break in .
go , borrow me a crow .
master , mean you so ?
fetch me an iron crow .
o , let it not be so .
i will depart in quiet and , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
i know a wench of excellent discourse , pretty and witty , wild and yet , too , gentle .
that chain will i bestow— be it for nothing but to spite my wife— upon mine hostess there .
i ’ ll meet you at that place some hour hence .
this jest shall cost me some expense .
shall , antipholus , even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot ?
what simple thief brags of his own attaint ?
tis double wrong to truant with your bed and let her read it in thy looks at board .
then , gentle brother , get you in again .
teach me , dear creature , how to think and speak .
against my soul ’ s pure truth why labour you to make it wander in an unknown field ?
would you create me new ?
transform me , then , and to your power i ’ ll yield .
far more , far more , to you do i decline .
what , are you mad that you do reason so ?
it is a fault that springeth from your eye .
for gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
why call you me “ love ” ?
thy sister ’ s sister .
that ’ s my sister .
all this my sister is , or else should be .
call thyself “ sister , ” sweet , for i am thee .
i ’ ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill .
why , how now , dromio .
where runn ’ st thou so fast ?
do you know me , sir ?
but ere they came , –o , let me say no more !
thou art dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
i am an ass , i am a woman ’ s man , and besides myself .
what woman ’ s man ?
what claim lays she to thee ?
i warrant her rags and the
if she lives till doomsday , she ’ ll burn a week longer than the whole world .
what complexion is she of ?
swart like my shoe , but her face nothing like so clean kept .
that ’ s a fault that water will mend .
no , sir , ’ tis in grain ; noah ’ s flood could not do it .
what ’ s her name ?
then she bears some breadth ?
she is spherical , like a globe .
in what part of her body stands ireland ?
marry , sir , in her buttocks .
faith , i saw it not , but i felt it hot in her breath .
where america , the indies ?
an if the wind blow any way from shore , i will not harbor in this town tonight .
she that doth call me husband , even my soul doth for a wife abhor .
i know it well , sir .
lo , here ’ s the chain .
what is your will that i shall do with this ?
i have made it for you .
made it for me , sir ?
not once , nor twice , but twenty times you have .
you are a merry man , sir .
i ’ ll to the mart , and there for dromio stay .
if any ship put out , then straight away .
even just the sum that i do owe to you is growing to me by antipholus .
at five o'clock i shall receive the money for the same .
pleaseth you walk with me down to his house , i will discharge my bond and thank you too .
i am not furnished with the present money .
besides , i have some business in the town .
then you will bring the chain to her yourself .
well , sir , i will .
have you the chain about you ?
nay , come , i pray you , sir , give me the chain .
you use this dalliance to excuse your breach of promise to the porpentine .
i pray you , sir , dispatch .
you hear how he importunes me .
why , give it to my wife , and fetch your money .
you know i gave it you even now .
either send the chain , or send me by some token .
fie , now you run this humor out of breath .
come , where ’ s the chain ?
i pray you , let me see it .
what should i answer you ?
the money that you owe me for the chain .
i owe you none till i receive the chain .
you know i gave it you half an hour since .
you wrong me more , sir , in denying it .
consider how it stands upon my credit .
well , officer , arrest him at my suit .
i do , this touches me in reputation .
i would not spare my brother in this case if he should scorn me so apparently .
i do arrest you , sir .
i do obey thee till i give thee bail .
nay , forward , old man .
do not break off so , for we may pity though not pardon thee .
o , had the gods done so , i had not now worthily termed them merciless to us .
why , thou peevish sheep , what ship of epidamnum stays for me ?
a ship you sent me to , to hire waftage .
thou drunken slave , i sent thee for a rope and told thee to what purpose and what end .
you sent me for a rope ’ s end as soon .
you sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
i will debate this matter at more leisure and teach your ears to list me with more heed .
to adriana , villain , hie thee straight .
tell her i am arrested in the street , and that shall bail me .
begone.— on , officer , to prison till it come .
that is where we dined , where dowsabel did claim me for her husband .
she is too big , i hope , for me to compass .
thither i must , although against my will , for servants must their masters ' minds fulfill .
ah , luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
looked he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ?
first he denied you had in him no right .
he meant he did me none ; the more my spite .
then swore he that he was a stranger here .
then pleaded i for you .
that love i begged for you he begged of me .
with what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
have patience , i beseech .
who would be jealous , then , of such a one ?
no evil lost is wailed when it is gone .
my heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
how hast thou lost thy breath ?
where is thy master , dromio ?
no , he ’ s in tartar limbo , worse than hell .
why , man , what is the matter ?
tell me at whose suit .
go fetch it , sister .
this i wonder at , that he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
do you not hear it ring ?
no , no , the bell .
tis time that i were gone .
it was two ere i left him , and now the clock strikes one .
that did i never hear .
not i , my lord .
then i would you were so honest a man .
to be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .
that ’ s very true , my lord .
i have , my lord .
let her not walk i ' th ' sun .
conception is a blessing , but , as your daughter may conceive—friend , look to ’ t .
words , words , words .
what is the matter , my lord ?
i mean , the matter that you read , my lord .
indeed , that is out of the air .
fare you well , my lord .
you go to seek the lord hamlet .
god save you , sir !
how dost thou , guildenstern ?
good lads , how do you both ?
happy , in that we are not overhappy .
on fortune ’ s cap we are not the very button .
then you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?
faith , her privates we .
but your news is not true .
let me question more in particular .
denmark ’ s a prison .
then is the world one .
we think not so , my lord .
to me it is a prison .
why then , your ambition makes it one .
tis too narrow for your mind .
a dream itself is but a shadow .
then are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars ' shadows .
shall we to th ' court ?
is it your own inclining ?
what should we say , my lord ?
i know the good king and queen have sent for you .
to what end , my lord ?
that you must teach me .
my lord , we were sent for .
what might be toward , that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint laborer with the day ?
who is ’ t that can inform me ?
i will tell you why .
why did you laugh then , when i said “ man delights not me ” ?
he that plays the king shall be welcome .
even those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .
how chances it they travel ?
their residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city ?
no , indeed are they not .
nay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace .
what , are they children ?
will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?
oh , there has been much throwing about of brains .
do the boys carry it away ?
it is not very strange .
sblood , there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .
gentlemen , you are welcome to elsinore .
your hands , come then .
but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived .
in what , my dear lord ?
i am but mad north-north-west .
when the wind is southerly , i know a hawk from a handsaw .
well be with you , gentlemen .
hark you , guildenstern , and you too—at each ear a hearer .
my lord , i have news to tell you .
my lord , i have news to tell you .
when roscius was an actor in rome— the actors are come hither , my lord .
upon my honor— then came each actor on his ass—
why , am i not i ' th ' right , old jephthah ?
if you call me jephthah , my lord , i have a daughter that i love passing well .
what follows , then , my lord ?
what speech , my good lord ?
one speech in it i chiefly loved .
it shall to the barber ’ s , with your beard.—prithee , say on .
moblèd queen ” is good .
my lord , i will use them according to their desert .
god ’ s bodykins , man , much better .
use them after your own honor and dignity .
the less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .
we ’ ll hear a play tomorrow .
we ’ ll ha ’ t tomorrow night .
follow that lord , and look you mock him not .
my good friends , i ’ ll leave you till night .
you are welcome to elsinore .
oh , what a rogue and peasant slave am i !
and all for nothing— for hecuba !
and terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands so by his father lost .
lo , where it comes again .
i ’ ll cross it though it blast me.—stay , illusion !
if thou hast any sound or use of voice , speak to me .
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?
tweaks me by the nose ?
remorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !
why , what an ass am i !
fie upon ’ t , foh !
for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
if he do blench , i know my course .
i ’ ll have grounds more relative than this .
the play ’ s the thing wherein i ’ ll catch the conscience of the king .
did he receive you well ?
niggard of question , but of our demands most free in his reply .
madam , it so fell out , that certain players we o'erraught on the way .
tis most true , and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter .
with all my heart , and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined .
good gentlemen , give him a further edge , and drive his purpose on to these delights .
we shall , my lord .
madam , i wish it may .
ophelia , walk you here .
let ’ s withdraw , my lord .
to die , to sleep .
there ’ s the respect that makes calamity of so long life .
good my lord , how does your honor for this many a day ?
well , well , well .
my lord , i have remembrances of yours that i have longèd long to redeliver .
i pray you now receive them .
ha , ha , are you honest ?
that if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .
could beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?
this was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .
i did love you once .
indeed , my lord , you made me believe so .
i was the more deceived .
get thee to a nunnery .
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven ?
we are arrant knaves , all .
go thy ways to a nunnery .
where ’ s your father ?
at home , my lord .
o , help him , you sweet heavens !
get thee to a nunnery , go .
heavenly powers , restore him !
i have heard of your paintings too , well enough .
god has given you one face and you make yourselves another .
go to , i ’ ll no more on ’ t .
it hath made me mad .
i say , we will have no more marriages .
those that are married already , all but one , shall live .
the rest shall keep as they are .
to a nunnery , go .
his affections do not that way tend .
what think you on ’ t ?
but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love.—how now , ophelia ?
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said .
if she find him not , to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think .
shall i strike at it with my partisan ?
do , if it will not stand .
it was about to speak when the cock crew .
speak the speech , i pray you , as i pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .
i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant .
pray you , avoid it .
be not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor .
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .
o , reform it altogether !
and the queen too , and that presently .
bid the players make haste .
will you two help to hasten them ?
here , sweet lord , at your service .
horatio , thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation coped withal .
o my dear lord— nay , do not think i flatter .
why should the poor be flattered ?
they are coming to the play .
how fares our cousin hamlet ?
excellent , i ' faith , of the chameleon ’ s dish .
i eat the air , promise-crammed .
you can not feed capons so .
i have nothing with this answer , hamlet .
these words are not mine .
no , nor mine now .
that did i , my lord , and was accounted a good actor .
i did enact julius caesar .
i was killed i ' th ' capitol .
they stay upon your patience .
here ’ s metal more attractive .
lady , shall i lie in your lap ?
i mean , my head upon your lap ?
do you think i meant country matters ?
what is , my lord ?
you are merry , my lord .
o god , your only jig-maker .
what should a man do but be merry ?
for , look you , how cheerfully my mother looks , and my father died within these two hours .
nay , ’ tis twice two months , my lord .
nay then , let the devil wear black , for i ’ ll have a suit of sables .
then there ’ s hope a great man ’ s memory may outlive his life half a year .
belike this show imports the argument of the play .
we shall know by this fellow .
the players can not keep counsel .
they ’ ll tell all .
will he tell us what this show meant ?
ay , or any show that you will show him .
be not you ashamed to show , he ’ ll not shame to tell you what it means .
you are naught , you are naught .
i ’ ll mark the play .
is this a prologue or the posy of a ring ?
tis brief , my lord .
as woman ’ s love .
madam , how like you this play ?
the lady protests too much , methinks .
oh , but she ’ ll keep her word .
is there no offense in ’ t ?
no offense i ' th ' world .
what do you call the play ?
it faded on the crowing of the cock .
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , as needful in our loves , fitting our duty ?
i could interpret between you and your love , if i could see the puppets dallying .
come , “ the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge— ”
the story is extant , and writ in choice italian .
you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago ’ s wife .
what , frighted with false fire ?
give me some light , away !
lights , lights , lights !
a whole one , i .
very well , my lord .
upon the talk of the poisoning ?
i did very well note him .
good my lord , vouchsafe me a word with you .
sir , a whole history .
the king , sir— ay , sir , what of him ?
is in his retirement marvelous distempered .
i am tame , sir .
the queen your mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you .
nay , good my lord , this courtesy is not of the right breed .
if not , your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business .
sir , i can not .
make you a wholesome answer .
my wit ’ s diseased .
therefore no more but to the matter .
o wonderful son that can so ’ stonish a mother !
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother ’ s admiration ?
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed .
we shall obey , were she ten times our mother .
have you any further trade with us ?
my lord , you once did love me .
and do still , by these pickers and stealers .
good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ?
sir , i lack advancement .
how can that be , when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark ?
i do not well understand that .
will you play upon this pipe ?
my lord , i can not .
believe me , i can not .
i know no touch of it , my lord .
it is as easy as lying .
but these can not i command to any utterance of harmony .
you would seem to know my stops .
sblood , do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe ?
god bless you , sir .
my lord , the queen would speak with you , and presently .
do you see yonder cloud that ’ s almost in shape of a camel ?
by th ' mass , and ’ tis like a camel indeed .
methinks it is like a weasel .
it is backed like a weasel .
then i will come to my mother by and by .
i will speak daggers to her but use none .
my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites .
i like him not , nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range .
i your commission will forthwith dispatch , and he to england shall along with you .
the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies .
never alone did the king sigh , but with a general groan .
arm you , i pray you , to this speedy voyage .
for we will fetters put upon this fear , which now goes too free-footed .
my lord , he ’ s going to his mother ’ s closet .
behind the arras i ’ ll convey myself to hear the process .
i ’ ll warrant she ’ ll tax him home .
fare you well , my liege .
i ’ ll call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know .
thanks , dear my lord .
it hath the primal eldest curse upon ’ t , a brother ’ s murder .
may one be pardoned and retain th ' offense ?
but ’ tis not so above .
yet what can it when one can not repent ?
o bosom black as death !
o limèd soul that , struggling to be free , art more engaged !
now might i do it pat .
and now i ’ ll do ’ t .
and so he goes to heaven .
and so am i revenged.—that would be scanned .
words without thoughts never to heaven go .
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works .
speak to her , hamlet .
to whom do you speak this ?
avoid what is to come .
o hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain .
good night—but go not to mine uncle ’ s bed .
assume a virtue if you have it not .
so , again , good night .
i must be cruel only to be kind .
thus bad begins and worse remains behind .
let it work , for ’ tis the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard .
tis fit we understand them .
ah , my good lord , what have i seen tonight !
alas , how shall this bloody deed be answered ?
go seek him out , speak fair , and bring the body into the chapel .
what have you done , my lord , with the dead body ?
tell us where ’ tis , that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel .
but such officers do the king best service in the end .
i am glad of it .
yet must not we put the strong law on him .
without , my lord ; guarded , to know your pleasure .
not where he eats , but where he is eaten .
that ’ s the end .
what dost you mean by this ?
thy loving father , hamlet .
i will do ’ t , my lord .
they are of norway , sir .
take thy fair hour , laertes .
thou know ’ st ’ tis common .
ay , madam , it is common .
god be wi ' you , sir .
what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed ?
a beast , no more .
i will not speak with her .
where is the beauteous majesty of denmark ?
nay , but , ophelia— pray you , mark .
how do you , pretty lady ?
god be at your table .
how long hath she been thus ?
oh , this is the poison of deep grief .
alack , what noise is this ?
i pray you , give me leave .
do not fear our person .
conscience and grace , to the profoundest pit !
my will , not all the world .
and for my means , i ’ ll husband them so well , they shall go far with little .
will you know them then ?
tears seven times salt , burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye !
by heaven , thy madness shall be paid by weight , till our scale turn the beam .
you must sing this nothing ’ s more than matter .
there ’ s rosemary , that ’ s for remembrance .
do you see this , o god ?
laertes , i must commune with your grief , or you deny me right .
let him bless thee too .
letters , my lord , from hamlet .
sailors , my lord , they say .
he received them of him that brought them .
how otherwise ? — will you be ruled by me ?
he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation .
and nothing is at a like goodness still .
but , good laertes , will you do this , keep close within your chamber .
i will do ’ t .
be as ourself in denmark.—madam , come .
alas , then she is drowned .
but yet it is our trick .
let ’ s follow , gertrude .
how much i had to do to calm his rage !
now fear i this will give it start again .
therefore let ’ s follow .
is she to be buried in christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation ?
the crowner hath sat on her and finds it christian burial .
how can that be , unless she drowned herself in her own defense ?
it must be nay , but hear you , goodman delver— give me leave .
ay , marry , is ’ t .
crowner ’ s quest law .
why , he had none .
marry , now i can tell .
has this fellow no feeling of his business ?
he sings at grave- making .
that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once .
it might , my lord .
mine ache to think on ’ t .
not a jot more , my lord .
i will speak to this fellow.—whose grave ’ s this , sirrah ?
you lie out on ’ t , sir , and therefore it is not yours .
tis for the dead , not for the quick .
what man dost thou dig it for ?
ay , marry , why was he sent into england ?
why , because he was mad .
twill not be seen in him there .
faith , e'en with losing his wits .
why he more than another ?
i am glad to see you well.— horatio ?
or i do forget myself ?
sir , my good friend , i ’ ll change that name with you .
what ’ s that , my lord ?
dost thou think alexander looked o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth ?
e'en so , my lord .
to what base uses we may return , horatio .
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole ?
twere to consider too curiously , to consider so .
no , faith , not a jot .
imperious caesar , dead and turned to clay , might stop a hole to keep the wind away .
but soft , but soft a while .
this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life .
couch we a while and mark .
for charitable prayers shards , flints and pebbles should be thrown on her .
must there no more be done ?
lay her i ' th ' earth , and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring !
i tell thee , churlish priest , a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling .
hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms .
o my son , what theme ?
forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum .
what wilt thou do for her ?
o , he is mad , laertes .
for love of god , forbear him .
swounds , show me what thou'lt do .
woo ’ t tear thyself ?
i ’ ll do ’ t .
and thus a while the fit will work on him .
but it is no matter .
i pray thee , good horatio , wait upon him .
you come most carefully upon your hour .
get thee to bed , francisco .
for this relief much thanks .
tis bitter cold , and i am sick at heart .
have you had quiet guard ?
if you do meet horatio and marcellus , the rivals of my watch , bid them make haste .
i think i hear them.—stand , ho !
so much for this , sir .
now shall you see the other .
you do remember all the circumstance ?
remember it , my lord ?
sir , in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep .
methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes .
wilt thou know th ' effect of what i wrote ?
ay , good my lord .
i had my father ’ s signet in my purse , which was the model of that danish seal .
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to ’ t .
why , man , they did make love to this employment .
they are not near my conscience .
their defeat does by their own insinuation grow .
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensèd points of mighty opposites .
why , what a king is this !
is ’ t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm ?
and is ’ t not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil ?
it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there .
the interim ’ s mine .
i ’ ll court his favors .
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion .
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark .
i humbly thank you , sir .
it is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .
but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .
it is very sultry—as ’ twere—i can not tell how .
a truant disposition , good my lord .
i know you are no truant .
but what is your affair in elsinore ?
we ’ ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart .
my lord , i came to see your father ’ s funeral .
i pray thee , do not mock me , fellow student .
i think it was to see my mother ’ s wedding .
indeed , my lord , it followed hard upon .
the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables .
would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day , horatio .
my father—methinks i see my father .
in my mind ’ s eye , horatio .
he was a goodly king .
take him for all in all .
i shall not look upon his like again .
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him .
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath ?
i know you are not ignorant— i would you did , sir .
yet in faith , if you did , it would not much approve me .
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is—
i mean , sir , for his weapon .
that ’ s two of his weapons .
what call you the carriages ?
the carriages , sir , are the hangers .
the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides .
i would it might be hangers till then .
why is this “ impawned , ” as you call it ?
how if i answer “ no ” ?
if it please his majesty , ’ tis the breathing time of day with me .
i commend my duty to your lordship .
he does well to commend it himself .
there are no tongues else for ’ s turn .
he did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it .
i am constant to my purpose .
they follow the king ’ s pleasure .
the king and queen and all are coming down .
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play .
you will lose this wager , my lord .
i do not think so .
since he went into france , i have been in continual practice .
i shall win at the odds .
but thou wouldst not think how ill all ’ s here about my heart .
but it is no matter .
i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .
if it be not to come , it will be now .
since no man of aught he leaves knows , what is ’ t to leave betimes ?
come , hamlet , come , and take this hand from me .
come , one for me .
i ’ ll be your foil , laertes .
you mock me , sir .
no , by this hand .
very well , my lord .
your grace hath laid the odds o ' th ' weaker side .
i have seen you both .
but since he is better we have therefore odds .
ay , my good lord .
set me the stoups of wine upon that table .
a hit , a very palpable hit .
stay , give me drink.—hamlet , this pearl is thine .
here ’ s to thy health .
set it by a while .
a touch , a touch , i do confess ’ t .
the queen carouses to thy fortune , hamlet .
gertrude , do not drink .
i will , my lord .
i pray you , pardon me .
i dare not drink yet , madam .
come , let me wipe thy face .
i do not think ’ t .
come , for the third , laertes .
i pray you , pass with your best violence .
i am afeard you make a wanton of me .
nay , come , again .
look to the queen there , ho !
they bleed on both sides.—how is it , my lord ?
how is ’ t , laertes ?
why , as a woodcock to mine own springe , osric .
she swoons to see them bleed .
the drink , the drink !
ho , let the door be locked .
it is here , hamlet .
hamlet , thou art slain .
no medicine in the world can do thee good .
in thee there is not half an hour of life .
the treacherous instrument is in thy hand , unbated and envenomed .
the foul practice hath turned itself on me .
lo , here i lie , never to rise again .
thy mother ’ s poisoned .
the king , the king ’ s to blame .
the point envenomed too ! —then , venom , to thy work .
my lord , i think i saw him yesternight .
the king my father ? !
for god ’ s love , let me hear .
o , yet defend me , friends .
here , thou incestuous , murderous , damnèd dane , drink off this potion .
it is a poison tempered by himself .
exchange forgiveness with me , noble hamlet .
mine and my father ’ s death come not upon thee , nor thine on me .
heaven make thee free of it .
i am more an antique roman than a dane .
here ’ s yet some liquor left .
as thou'rt a man , give me the cup .
by heaven , i ’ ll have ’ t .
o god , horatio , what a wounded name , things standing thus unknown , shall live behind me !
what warlike noise is this ?
young fortinbras , with conquest come from poland , to th ' ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley .
o , i die , horatio .
the potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit .
i can not live to hear the news from england .
but i do prophesy the election lights on fortinbras .
he has my dying voice .
o , o , o , o .
what is it ye would see ?
this quarry cries on havoc .
the sight is dismal , and our affairs from england come too late .
had it th ' ability of life to thank you .
for me , with sorrow i embrace my fortune .
and , for his passage , the soldiers ' music and the rites of war speak loudly for him .
my lord , upon the platform where we watch .
did you not speak to it ?
my lord , i did , but answer made it none .
as i do live , my honored lord , ’ tis true .
and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it .
indeed , indeed , sirs , but this troubles me .
hold you the watch tonight ?
we do , my lord .
my lord , from head to foot .
then saw you not his face ?
oh yes , my lord .
he wore his beaver up .
and fixed his eyes upon you ?
i would i had been there .
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred .
not when i saw ’ t .
his beard was grizzled , no ?
it was , as i have seen it in his life , a sable silvered .
and whatsoever else shall hap tonight , give it an understanding , but no tongue .
i will requite your loves .
upon the platform , ’ twixt eleven and twelve , i ’ ll visit you .
our duty to your honor .
your loves , as mine to you .
my father ’ s spirit in arms .
i doubt some foul play .
would the night were come !
till then sit still , my soul .
foul deeds will rise , though all the earth o'erwhelm them , to men ’ s eyes .
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth , contagious blastments are most imminent .
best safety lies in fear .
youth to itself rebels , though none else near .
i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart .
o , fear me not .
but here my father comes .
aboard , aboard , for shame !
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayed for .
there , my blessing with thee .
and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character .
give thy thoughts no tongue , nor any unproportioned thought his act .
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar .
give every man thy ear but few thy voice .
take each man ’ s censure but reserve thy judgment .
tis in my memory locked , and you yourself shall keep the key of it .
what is ’ t , ophelia , he hath said to you ?
so please you , something touching the lord hamlet .
give me up the truth .
he hath , my lord , of late made many tenders of his affection to me .
pooh , you speak like a green girl , unsifted in such perilous circumstance .
do you believe his “ tenders , ” as you call them ?
i do not know , my lord , what i should think .
marry , i ’ ll teach you .
think yourself a baby that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay , which are not sterling .
go to , go to .
and hath given countenance to his speech , my lord , with almost all the holy vows of heaven .
ay , springes to catch woodcocks .
i do know , when the blood burns , how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows .
look to ’ t , i charge you .
i shall obey , my lord .
and liegemen to the dane .
o , farewell , honest soldier .
say what , is horatio there ?
what , has this thing appeared again tonight ?
it is a nipping and an eager air .
i think it lacks of twelve .
no , it is struck .
it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk .
what does this mean , my lord ?
ay , marry , is ’ t .
this heavy-headed revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations .
they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition .
the dram of evil doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal .
look , my lord , it comes !
angels and ministers of grace defend us !
wherein we saw thee quietly interred , hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again .
it beckons you to go away with it , as if it some impartment did desire to you alone .
look , with what courteous action it waves you to a more removèd ground .
but do not go with it .
no , by no means .
do not , my lord .
why , what should be the fear ?
it waves me forth again .
i ’ ll follow it .
you shall not go , my lord .
still am i called.—unhand me , gentlemen .
by heaven , i ’ ll make a ghost of him that lets me .
he waxes desperate with imagination .
tis not fit thus to obey him .
nay , let ’ s follow him .
where wilt thou lead me ?
speak , i ’ ll go no further .
my hour is almost come when i to sulfurous and tormenting flames must render up myself .
i am bound to hear .
so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear .
but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood .
list , list , o , list !
if thou didst ever thy dear father love— o god !
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder .
murder most foul , as in the best it is .
but this most foul , strange and unnatural .
o hamlet , what a falling off was there !
oh , horrible , oh , horrible , most horrible !
if thou hast nature in thee , bear it not .
let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damnèd incest .
leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her .
fare thee well at once .
the glowworm shows the matin to be near , and 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire .
adieu , adieu , adieu .
o all you host of heaven !
and shall i couple hell ?
ay , thou poor ghost , whiles memory holds a seat in this distracted globe .
o villain , villain , smiling , damnèd villain !
at least i ’ m sure it may be so in denmark .
remember me. ” i have sworn ’ t .
my lord , my lord !
lord hamlet— heaven secure him !
illo , ho , ho , my lord !
hillo , ho , ho , boy .
come , bird , come .
how is ’ t , my noble lord ?
what news , my lord ?
good my lord , tell it .
not i , my lord , by heaven .
nor i , my lord .
how say you , then ?
but you ’ ll be secret ?
ay , by heaven , my lord .
well , sit we down , and let us hear barnardo speak of this .
look where it comes again !
in the same figure like the king that ’ s dead .
it harrows me with fear and wonder .
it would be spoke to .
by heaven , i charge thee , speak .
there ’ s ne'er a villain dwelling in all denmark but he ’ s an arrant knave .
there needs no ghost , my lord , come from the grave to tell us this .
why , right , you are in the right .
and so , without more circumstance at all , i hold it fit that we shake hands and part .
these are but wild and whirling words , my lord .
there ’ s no offense , my lord .
yes , by saint patrick , but there is , horatio , and much offense too .
touching this vision here , it is an honest ghost , that let me tell you .
for your desire to know what is between us , o'ermaster ’ t as you may .
what is ’ t , my lord ?
never make known what you have seen tonight .
my lord , we will not .
nay , but swear ’ t .
in faith , my lord , not i .
nor i , my lord , in faith .
we have sworn , my lord , already .
indeed , upon my sword , indeed .
never to speak of this that you have seen .
come hither , gentlemen , and lay your hands again upon my sword .
swear by my sword never to speak of this that you have heard .
well said , old mole !
once more remove , good friends .
o day and night , but this is wondrous strange !
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome .
there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio , than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
this not to do , so grace and mercy at your most need help you , swear .
nay , come , let ’ s go together .
give him this money and these notes , reynaldo .
i will , my lord .
my lord , i did intend it .
marry , well said , very well said .
ay , very well , my lord .
and in part him , but , ” you may say , “ not well .
addicted so and so.— ” and there put on him what forgeries you please .
but , sir , such wanton , wild , and usual slips
ay , or drinking , fencing , swearing , quarreling , drabbing—you may go so far .
my lord , that would dishonor him !
faith , no , as you may season it in the charge .
but , my good lord— wherefore should you do this ?
very good , my lord .
and then , sir , does he this , he does— what was i about to say ?
by the mass , i was about to say something .
you have me , have you not ?
my lord , i have .
god be wi ' you .
i shall , my lord .
and let him ply his music .
with what , i ' th ' name of god ?
come , go with me .
i will go seek the king .
that hath made him mad .
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him .
i feared he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee .
come , go we to the king .
welcome , dear rosencrantz and guildenstern .
thanks , rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern .
thanks , guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz .
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changèd son .
go , some of you , and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is .
heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him !
th ' ambassadors from norway , my good lord , are joyfully returned .
thou still hast been the father of good news .
have i , my lord ?
see , it stalks away .
i charge thee , speak !
you tremble and look pale .
is not this something more than fantasy ?
what think you on ’ t ?
before my god , i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes .
is it not like the king ?
as thou art to thyself .
such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated .
so frowned he once when , in an angry parle , he smote the sledded polacks on the ice .
oh , speak of that .
that do i long to hear .
give first admittance to th ' ambassadors .
my news shall be the fruit to that great feast .
thyself do grace to them , and bring them in .
i doubt it is no other but the main : his father ’ s death and our o'erhasty marriage .
well , we shall sift him.—welcome , my good friends !
say , voltemand , what from our brother norway ?
whereon old norway , overcome with joy ,
meantime we thank you for your well-took labor .
at night we ’ ll feast together .
this business is well ended .
thus it remains , and the remainder thus .
good madam , stay a while .
o dear ophelia , i am ill at these numbers .
but how hath she received his love ?
what do you think of me ?
as of a man faithful and honorable .
i would fain prove so .
it may be , very like .
how may we try it further ?
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby .
at such a time i ’ ll loose my daughter to him .
away , i do beseech you , both away .
i ’ ll board him presently .
o , give me leave .
how does my good lord hamlet ?
well , god- ' a'-mercy .
do you know me , my lord ?
so god sa ' me , ’ tis shame to stand still .
ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal .
who talks of my nation ?
i do not know you so good a man as myself .
so chrish save me , i will cut off your head .
gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .
ah , that ’ s a foul fault .
the town sounds a parley .
how yet resolves the governor of the town ?
this is the latest parle we will admit .
what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career ?
will you yield and this avoid or , guilty in defense , be thus destroyed ?
our expectation hath this day an end .
therefore , great king , we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy .
come , uncle exeter , go you and enter harfleur .
there remain and fortify it strongly 'gainst the french .
tonight in harfleur will we be your guest ; tomorrow for the march are we addressed .
doth his majesty incline to it or no ?
tis certain he hath passed the river somme .
an if he be not fought withal , my lord , let us not live in france .
let us quit all and give our vineyards to a barbarous people .
normans , but bastard normans , norman bastards !
and shall our quick blood , spirited with wine , seem frosty ?
where is montjoy the herald ?
let him greet england with our sharp defiance .
bar harry england , that sweeps through our land with pennons painted in the blood of harfleur .
prince dauphin , you shall stay with us in rouen .
not so , i do beseech your majesty .
be patient , for you shall remain with us .
now forth , lord constable and princes all , and quickly bring us word of england ’ s fall .
is the duke of exeter safe ?
he is called aunchient pistol .
captain , i thee beseech to do me favors .
the duke of exeter doth love thee well .
ay , i praise god , and i have merited some love at his hands .
fortune is an excellent moral .
aunchient pistol , i do partly understand your meaning .
die and be damned , and it is well .
why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal .
but you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvelously mistook .
if i find a hole in his coat , i will tell him my mind .
how now , fluellen , cam ’ st thou from the bridge ?
ay , so please your majesty .
the duke of exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge .
the french is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages .
i can tell your majesty , the duke is a prave man .
what men have you lost , fluellen ?
the perdition of th ' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great .
you know me by my habit .
well then , i know thee .
what shall i know of thee ?
my master ’ s mind .
advantage is a better soldier than rashness .
now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial .
what was th ' impediment that broke this off ?
the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience .
and the hour , i think , is come to give him hearing .
thou dost thy office fairly .
yet , forgive me , god , that i do brag thus .
go therefore , tell thy master : here i am .
i hope they will not come upon us now .
we are in god ’ s hand , brother , not in theirs .
it now draws toward night .
tut , i have the best armor of the world .
you have an excellent armor , but let my horse have his due .
it is the best horse of europe .
will it never be morning ?
my lord of orléans , and my lord high constable , you talk of horse and armor ?
you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .
what a long night is this !
i will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns .
the earth sings when he touches it .
the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes .
he ’ s of the color of the nutmeg .
and of the heat of the ginger .
it is a beast for perseus .
he is indeed a horse , and all other jades you may call beasts .
indeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .
it is the prince of palfreys .
his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch , and his countenance enforces homage .
it is a theme as fluent as the sea .
turn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all .
then did they imitate that which i composed to my courser , for my horse is my mistress .
you have good judgment in horsemanship .
i had rather have my horse to my mistress .
i had as lief have my mistress a jade .
i tell thee , constable , my mistress wears his own hair .
i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow to my mistress .
some of them will fall tomorrow , i hope .
and yet my sky shall not want .
that may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and ’ twere more honor some were away .
ev ' n as your horse bears your praises—who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted .
would i were able to load him with his desert !
will it never be day ?
i will not say so , for fear i should be faced out of my way .
i ’ ll go arm myself .
the dauphin longs for morning .
he longs to eat the english .
swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .
he is simply the most active gentleman of france .
doing is activity , and he will still be doing .
he never did harm that i heard of .
nor will do none tomorrow .
he will keep that good name still .
i know him to be valiant .
i was told that by one that knows him better than you .
marry , he told me so himself ; and he said he cared not who knew it .
it is no hidden virtue in him .
tis a hooded valor , and when it appears , it will bate .
ill will never said well .
tis not the first time you were overshot .
my lord high constable , the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
who hath measured the ground ?
alas , poor harry of england !
he longs not for the dawning as we do .
if the english had any apprehension , they would run away .
that island of england breeds very valiant creatures .
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .
ay , but these english are shrewdly out of beef .
then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight .
now is it time to arm .
come , shall we about it ?
it is now two o'clock .
but , let me see , by ten we shall have each a hundred englishmen .
oh , now , who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band
where is my gracious lord of canterbury ?
send for him , good uncle .
shall we call in th ' ambassador , my liege ?
not yet , my cousin .
god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it .
gloucester , ’ tis true that we are in great danger .
the greater therefore should our courage be .
good morrow , brother bedford .
god almighty , there is some soul of goodness in things evil , would men observingly distill it out .
for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers , which is both healthful and good husbandry .
thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself .
good morrow , old sir thomas erpingham .
a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france .
so the spirit is eased .
lend me thy cloak , sir thomas .
we shall , my liege .
shall i attend your grace ?
no , my good knight .
go with my brothers to my lords of england .
i and my bosom must debate awhile , and then i would no other company .
the lord in heaven bless thee , noble harry !
discuss unto me : art thou officer or art thou base , common , and popular ?
i am a gentleman of a company .
trail ’ st thou the puissant pike ?
as good a gentleman as the emperor .
then you are a better than the king .
i kiss his dirty shoe , and from heartstring i love the lovely bully .
art thou of cornish crew ?
no , i am a welshman .
know ’ st thou fluellen ?
tell him i ’ ll knock his leek about his pate upon saint davy ’ s day .
do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .
my name is pistol called .
it sorts well with your fierceness .
why , the enemy is loud .
you hear him all night .
i pray you and beseech you that you will .
though it appear a little out of fashion , there is much care and valor in this welshman .
brother john bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?
under what captain serve you ?
a good old commander and a most kind gentleman .
i pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?
even as men wracked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .
he hath not told his thought to the king ?
the violet smells to him as it doth to me .
by my troth , i will speak my conscience of the king .
i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is .
that ’ s more than we know .
if his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us .
tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head .
the king is not to answer it .
i do not desire he should answer for me , and yet i determine to fight lustily for him .
i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
if i live to see it , i will never trust his word after .
you ’ ll “ never trust his word after. ” come , ’ tis a foolish saying .
your reproof is something too round .
i should be angry with you if the time were convenient .
let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
how shall i know thee again ?
give me any gage of thine , and i will wear it in my bonnet .
then , if ever thou dar ’ st acknowledge it , i will make it my quarrel .
this will i also wear in my cap .
if ever i live to see it , i will challenge it .
thou dar ’ st as well be hanged .
well , i will do it , though i take thee in the king ’ s company .
of what your reverence shall incite us to .
therefore take heed how you impawn our person , how you awake our sleeping sword of war .
what infinite heart ’ s ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy ?
and what have kings that privates have not too , save ceremony , save general ceremony ?
and what art thou , thou idol ceremony ?
what kind of god art thou , that suffer ’ st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?
what are thy comings in ?
o ceremony , show me but thy worth !
what is thy soul of adoration ?
what drink ’ st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , but poisoned flattery ?
oh , be sick , great greatness , and bid thy ceremony give thee cure !
think ’ st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation ?
will it give place to flexure and low bending ?
canst thou , when thou command ’ st the beggar ’ s knee , command the health of it ?
no , thou proud dream , that play ’ st so subtly with a king ’ s repose .
my lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , seek through your camp to find you .
good old knight , collect them all together at my tent .
i ’ ll be before thee .
i shall do ’ t , my lord .
o god of battles , steel my soldiers ' hearts .
possess them not with fear .
take from them now the sense of reck'ning ere th ' opposèd numbers pluck their hearts from them .
and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard ’ s soul .
my brother gloucester ’ s voice.—ay , i know thy errand .
i will go with thee .
the day , my friends , and all things stay for me .
the sun doth gild our armor .
now , my lord constable ?
hark how our steeds for present service neigh .
what , will you have them weep our horses ' blood ?
how shall we then behold their natural tears ?
the english are embattled , you french peers .
to horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse .
what ’ s to say ?
why do you stay so long , my lords of france ?
yond island carrions , desperate of their bones , ill-favoredly become the morning field .
big mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps .
they have said their prayers , and they stay for death .
on , to the field !
i will the banner from a trumpet take and use it for my haste .
the sun is high , and we outwear the day .
the king himself is rode to view their battle .
of fighting men they have full threescore thousand .
there ’ s five to one .
besides , they all are fresh .
god ’ s arm strike with us !
god be wi ' you , princes all .
i ’ ll to my charge .
farewell , good salisbury , and good luck go with thee .
he is as full of valor as of kindness , princely in both .
what ’ s he that wishes so ?
no , my fair cousin .
god ’ s will , i pray thee wish not one man more .
but if it be a sin to covet honor , i am the most offending soul alive .
no , faith , my coz , wish not a man from england .
oh , do not wish one more !
his passport shall be made , and crowns for convoy put into his purse .
we would not die in that man ’ s company that fears his fellowship to die with us .
all things are ready if our minds be so .
perish the man whose mind is backward now !
thou dost not wish more help from england , coz ?
god be with you all .
for certainly thou art so near the gulf thou needs must be englutted .
who hath sent thee now ?
i pray thee , bear my former answer back .
bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
herald , save thou thy labor .
come thou no more for ransom , gentle herald .
i shall , king harry .
and so fare thee well .
thou never shalt hear herald anymore .
i fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom .
my lord , most humbly on my knee i beg the leading of the vaward .
take it , brave york .
now , soldiers , march away , and how thou pleasest , god , dispose the day .
he says his name is master fer .
he prays you to save his life .
tell him my fury shall abate , and i the crowns will take .
expound unto me , boy .
as i suck blood , i will some mercy show .
i did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart .
i must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp .
reproach and everlasting shame sits mocking in our plumes .
why , all our ranks are broke .
let ’ s stab ourselves .
be these the wretches that we played at dice for ?
is this the king we sent to for his ransom ?
shame , and eternal shame , nothing but shame !
disorder , that hath spoiled us , friend us now .
let us on heaps go offer up our lives .
the devil take order now !
i ’ ll to the throng .
let life be short , else shame will be too long .
yet keep the french the field .
the duke of york commends him to your majesty .
lives he , good uncle ?
thrice within this hour i saw him down , thrice up again and fighting .
from helmet to the spur , all blood he was .
and cries aloud , “ tarry , my cousin suffolk .
my soul shall thine keep company to heaven .
the french have reinforced their scattered men .
then every soldier kill his prisoners .
may i with right and conscience make this claim ?
go , my dread lord , to your great-grandsire ’ s tomb , from whom you claim .
awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats .
kill the poys and the luggage !
tis expressly against the law of arms .
oh , ’ tis a gallant king !
ay , he was porn at monmouth , captain gower .
why , i pray you , is not “ pig ” great ?
i think alexander the great was born in macedon .
his father was called philip of macedon , as i take it .
i think it is in macedon where alexander is porn .
there is a river in macedon , and there is also , moreover , a river at monmouth .
i speak but in the figures and comparisons of it .
i ’ ll tell you , there is good men porn at monmouth .
i was not angry since i came to france until this instant .
take a trumpet , herald .
ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill .
if they will fight with us , bid them come down , or void the field .
they do offend our sight .
go and tell them so .
here comes the herald of the french , my liege .
his eyes are humbler than they used to be .
know ’ st thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom ?
com ’ st thou again for ransom ?
praised be god , and not our strength , for it !
what is this castle called that stands hard by ?
then call we this the field of agincourt , fought on the day of crispin crispianus .
your majesty says very true .
and i do believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon saint tavy ’ s day .
i wear it for a memorable honor , for i am welsh , you know , good countryman .
thanks , good my countryman .
by jeshu , i am your majesty ’ s countryman , i care not who know it .
i will confess it to all the 'orld .
god keep me so.—our heralds go with him .
bring me just notice of the numbers dead on both our parts .
soldier , you must come to the king .
soldier , why wear ’ st thou that glove in thy cap ?
he is a craven and a villain else , an ’ t please your majesty , in my conscience .
it may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort , quite from the answer of his degree .
then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meet ’ st the fellow .
so i will , my liege , as i live .
who serv ’ st thou under ?
under captain gower , my liege .
gower is a good captain , and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars .
call him hither to me , soldier .
i will , my liege .
here , fluellen , wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap .
your grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects .
know ’ st thou gower ?
he is my dear friend , an please you .
pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .
my lord of warwick and my brother gloucester , follow fluellen closely at the heels .
i by bargain should wear it myself .
follow , and see there be no harm between them .
go you with me , uncle of exeter .
i warrant it is to knight you , captain .
sir , know you this glove ?
i know the glove is a glove .
i know this , and thus i challenge it .
do you think i ’ ll be forsworn ?
stand away , captain gower .
i will give treason his payment into plows , i warrant you .
he ’ s a friend of the duke alençon ’ s .
my liege , this was my glove ; here is the fellow of it .
twas i indeed thou promised ’ st to strike , and thou hast given me most bitter terms .
they know your grace hath cause and means and might ; so hath your highness .
how canst thou make me satisfaction ?
it was ourself thou didst abuse .
your majesty came not like yourself .
you appeared to me but as a common man .
therefore , i beseech your highness pardon me .
i will none of your money .
it is with a good will .
i can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes .
come , wherefore should you be so pashful ?
your shoes is not so good .
tis a good silling , i warrant you , or i will change it .
now , herald , are the dead numbered ?
here is the number of the slaughtered french .
what prisoners of good sort are taken , uncle ?
this note doth tell me of ten thousand french that in the field lie slain .
of princes in this number and nobles bearing banners , there lie dead one hundred twenty-six .
so that in these ten thousand they have lost , there are but sixteen hundred mercenaries .
the rest are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , and gentlemen of blood and quality .
of lusty earls : grandpré and roussi , faulconbridge and foix , beaumont and marle , vaudemont and lestrale .
where is the number of our english dead ?
take it , god , for it is none but thine .
yes , captain , but with this acknowledgement : that god fought for us .
yes , my conscience , he did us great good .
do we all holy rites .
so let him land , and solemnly see him set on to london .
then brook abridgment , and your eyes advance after your thoughts , straight back again to france .
saint davy ’ s day is past .
there is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things .
why , here he comes , swelling like a turkey-cock .
ha , art thou bedlam ?
i am qualmish at the smell of leek .
not for cadwallader and all his goats .
there is one goat for you .
base trojan , thou shalt die .
you say very true , scald knave , when god ’ s will is .
i will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals .
come , there is sauce for it .
it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .
yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question , too , and ambiguities .
by this leek , i will most horribly revenge .
will you have some more sauce to your leek ?
there is not enough leek to swear by .
thou dost see i eat .
much good do you , scald knave , heartily .
nay , pray you throw none away .
the skin is good for your broken coxcomb .
ay , leeks is good .
hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .
if i owe you anything , i will pay you in cudgels .
you shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels .
god be wi ' you and keep you and heal your pate .
all hell shall stir for this .
you are a counterfeit cowardly knave .
i have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice .
doth fortune play the huswife with me now ?
old i do wax , and from my weary limbs honor is cudgeled .
well , bawd i ’ ll turn , and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand .
to england will i steal , and there i ’ ll steal .
and patches will i get unto these cudgeled scars , and swear i got them in the gallia wars .
it follows , then , the cat must stay at home .
while that the armèd hand doth fight abroad , th ' advisèd head defends itself at home .
right joyous are we to behold your face , most worthy brother england .
so are you , princes english , every one .
to cry “ amen ” to that , thus we appear .
you english princes all , i do salute you .
my duty to you both , on equal love , great kings of france and england .
her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , unprunèd , dies .
her hedges , even-pleached , like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , put forth disordered twigs .
the king hath heard them , to the which as yet there is no answer made .
well then , the peace which you before so urged lies in his answer .
i have but with a cursitory eye o'erglanced the articles .
our gracious brother , i will go with them .
haply a woman ’ s voice may do some good , when articles too nicely urged be stood on .
yet leave our cousin katherine here with us .
she is our capital demand , comprised within the forerank of our articles .
your majesty shall mock at me .
i can not speak your england .
do you like me , kate ?
an angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .
i said so , dear katherine ; and i must not blush to affirm it .
the princess is the better englishwoman.—i ' faith , kate , my wooing is fit for thy understanding .
give me your answer , i ' faith , do ; and so clap hands and a bargain .
how say you , lady ?
i speak to thee plain soldier .
if thou canst love me for this , take me .
yet i love thee too .
if thou would have such a one , take me .
and what say ’ st thou then to my love ?
speak , my fair , and fairly , i pray thee .
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france ?
no , it is not possible you should love the enemy of france , kate .
i will have it all mine .
i can not tell wat is dat .
can any of your neighbors tell , kate ?
i ’ ll ask them .
what say ’ st thou , my fair flower de luce ?
i do not know dat .
no , ’ tis hereafter to know , but now to promise .
by mine honor , in true english , i love thee , kate .
now , beshrew my father ’ s ambition !
but , in faith , kate , the elder i wax , the better i shall appear .
and therefore tell me , most fair katherine , will you have me ?
come , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy english broken .
therefore , queen of all , katherine , break thy mind to me in broken english .
den it sall also content me .
upon that i kiss your hand , and i call you my queen .
then i will kiss your lips , kate .
madam my interpreter , what says she ?
dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of france—i can not tell wat is to kiss .
o kate , nice customs curtsy to great kings .
therefore , patiently and yielding .
my royal cousin , teach you our princess english ?
pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that .
it were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .
they are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .
then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .
this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer .
as love is , my lord , before it loves .
shall kate be my wife ?
i am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her .
so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .
we have consented to all terms of reason .
is ’ t so , my lords of england ?
now welcome , kate , and bear me witness all that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen .
god , the best maker of all marriages , combine your hearts in one , your realms in one .
god speak this “ amen ” !
and for their sake , in your fair minds let this acceptance take .
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin .
piece out our imperfections with your thoughts .
into a thousand parts divide one man , and make imaginary puissance .
therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness tell us the dauphin ’ s mind .
you can not revel into dukedoms there .
tennis balls , my liege .
we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us .
his present and your pains we thank you for .
so get you hence in peace .
this was a merry message .
we hope to make the sender blush at it .
therefore let every man now task his thought , that this fair action may on foot be brought .
now all the youth of england are on fire , and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies .
ere he take ship for france , and in southampton .
well met , corporal nym .
good morrow , lieutenant bardolph .
what , are ancient pistol and you friends yet ?
for my part , i care not .
let ’ t be so , good corporal nym .
that is my rest ; that is the rendezvous of it .
things must be as they may .
well , i can not tell .
here comes ancient pistol and his wife .
oh , well-a-day , lady !
pish for thee , iceland dog , thou prick-eared cur of iceland !
good corporal nym , show thy valor and put up your sword .
i am not barbason ; you can not conjure me .
i have an humor to knock you indifferently well .
o braggart vile and damnèd furious wight , the grave doth gape , and doting death is near .
an oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate .
thy spirits are most tall .
by my troth , he ’ ll yield the crow a pudding one of these days .
the king has killed his heart .
good husband , come home presently .
come , shall i make you two friends ?
let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on !
you ’ ll pay me the eight shillings i won of you at betting ?
base is the slave that pays .
that now i will have—that ’ s the humor of it .
by this sword , he that makes the first thrust , i ’ ll kill him .
by this sword , i will .
sword ” is an oath , and oaths must have their course .
in cash , most justly paid .
well , then , that ’ s the humor of ’ t .
as ever you come of women , come in quickly to sir john .
sweet men , come to him .
nym , thou hast spoke the right .
he passes some humors and careers .
they shall be apprehended by and by .
the king hath note of all that they intend , by interception which they dream not of .
now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .
no doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .
never was monarch better feared and loved than is your majesty .
we judge no less.—uncle of exeter , enlarge the man committed yesterday that railed against our person .
that ’ s mercy , but too much security .
oh , let us yet be merciful .
and now to our french causes .
who are the late commissioners ?
i one , my lord .
your highness bade me ask for it today .
so did you me , my liege .
and i , my royal sovereign .
i do confess my fault , and do submit me to your highness ' mercy .
to which we all appeal .
the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed .
why , so didst thou .
why , so didst thou .
come they of noble family ?
why , so didst thou .
why , so didst thou .
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of richard , earl of cambridge .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of henry , lord scroop of masham .
i arrest thee of high treason , by the name of thomas grey , knight , of northumberland .
my fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .
god quit you in his mercy .
we doubt not now but every rub is smoothèd on our way .
then forth , dear countrymen .
no king of england if not king of france .
for falstaff , he is dead , and we must earn therefore .
he ’ s in arthur ’ s bosom , if ever man went to arthur ’ s bosom .
i hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet .
they say he cried out of sack .
ay , that he did .
nay , that he did not .
a could never abide carnation .
twas a color he never liked .
he said once the devil would have him about women .
the king will be gone from southampton .
look to my chattels and my movables .
but how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?
it must be thought on .
the king is full of grace and fair regard .
and a true lover of the holy church .
and that ’ s but unwholesome food , they say .
touch her soft mouth , and march .
keep close , i thee command .
for england his approaches makes as fierce as waters to the sucking of a gulf .
oh peace , prince dauphin !
you are too much mistaken in this king .
well , ’ tis not so , my lord high constable .
but though we think it so , it is no matter .
in cases of defense ’ tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems .
ambassadors from harry king of england do crave admittance to your majesty .
we ’ ll give them present audience .
go , and bring them .
self-love , my liege , is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting .
for us , we will consider of this further .
tomorrow shall you bear our full intent back to our brother england .
for the dauphin , i stand here for him .
what to him from england ?
he ’ ll make your paris louvre shake for it , were it the mistress court of mighty europe .
tomorrow shall you know our mind at full .
you shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions .
a night is but small breath and little pause to answer matters of this consequence .
thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought .
play with your fancies and in them behold , upon the hempen tackle , shipboys climbing .
hear the shrill whistle , which doth order give to sounds confused .
work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege .
behold the ordnance on their carriages , with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur .
suppose th ' ambassador from the french comes back , tells harry that the king doth offer him
katherine his daughter and with her , to dowry , some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .
still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind .
now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you .
let us swear that you are worth your breeding , which i doubt not ,
we are blessèd in the change .
list his discourse of war , and you shall hear a fearful battle rendered you in music .
on , on , on , on , on !
to the breach , to the breach !
pray thee , corporal , stay .
the plainsong ” is most just , for humors do abound .
would i were in an alehouse in london !
i would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .
up to the breach , you dogs !
be merciful , great duke , to men of mold .
good bawcock , 'bate thy rage .
use lenity , sweet chuck .
your honor wins bad humors .
as young as i am , i have observed these three swashers .
they will steal anything and call it purchase .
i must leave them and seek some better service .
their villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore i must cast it up .
by cheshu , i think he will plow up all if there is not better directions .
it is captain macmorris , is it not ?
by cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world .
i will verify as much in his beard .
here he comes , and the scots captain , captain jamy , with him .
i say gudday , captain fluellen .
godden to your worship , good captain james .
how now , captain macmorris , have you quit the mines ?
have the pioneers given o'er ?
by chrish , la , ’ tish ill done .
by my hand i swear , and my father ’ s soul , the work ish ill done .
i would have blowed up the town , so chrish save me , la , in an hour .
look how he makes to caesar .
casca , be sudden , for we fear prevention —brutus , what shall be done ?
if this be known , cassius or caesar never shall turn back , for i will slay myself .
let him go and presently prefer his suit to caesar .
press near and second him .
casca , you are the first that rears your hand .
i could be well moved if i were as you .
if i could pray to move , prayers would move me .
the skies are painted with unnumbered sparks .
wilt thou lift up olympus ?
doth not brutus bootless kneel ?
speak , hands , for me !
run hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets .
go to the pulpit , brutus .
there is no harm intended to your person , nor to no roman else .
so tell them , publius .
and let no man abide this deed but we the doers .
fled to his house amazed .
men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run as it were doomsday .
why , he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death .
bid every noise be still .
who is it in the press that calls on me ?
i hear a tongue , shriller than all the music , cry “ caesar ! ” —speak .
caesar is turned to hear .
beware the ides of march .
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march .
let me see his face .
fellow , come from the throng .
what sayst thou to me now ?
beware the ides of march .
will you go see the order of the course ?
ay , every man away .
brutus shall lead , and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome .
a friend of antony ’ s .
thy master is a wise and valiant roman .
i never thought him worse .
i know that we shall have him well to friend .
but here comes antony.—welcome , mark antony .
dost thou lie so low ?
are all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , shrunk to this little measure ?
live a thousand years , i shall not find myself so apt to die .
o antony , beg not your death of us .
for your part , to you our swords have leaden points , mark antony .
your voice shall be as strong as any man ’ s in the disposing of new dignities .
i doubt not of your wisdom .
let each man render me his bloody hand .
mark antony— pardon me , caius cassius .
therefore i took your hands , but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on caesar .
you shall , mark antony .
brutus , a word with you .
it shall advantage more than do us wrong .
mark antony , here , take you caesar ’ s body .
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going , after my speech is ended .
i do desire no more .
prepare the body then , and follow us .
thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever livèd in the tide of times .
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood !
domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy .
i do , mark antony .
caesar did write for him to come to rome .
he did receive his letters and is coming .
he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome .
post back with speed , and tell him what hath chanced .
thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace .
then follow me and give me audience , friends .
cassius , go you into the other street and part the numbers .
those that will hear me speak , let 'em stay here .
i will hear brutus speak .
i will hear cassius and compare their reasons when severally we hear them renderèd .
the noble brutus is ascended .
be patient till the last .
romans , countrymen , and lovers !
hear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear .
believe me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe .
censure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge .
as caesar loved me , i weep for him .
as he was fortunate , i rejoice at it .
as he was valiant , i honor him .
but , as he was ambitious , i slew him .
who is here so base that would be a bondman ?
if any , speak—for him have i offended .
who is here so rude that would not be a roman ?
if any , speak—for him have i offended .
who is here so vile that will not love his country ?
if any , speak—for him have i offended .
i pause for a reply .
none , brutus , none .
then none have i offended .
i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus .
the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol .
his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .
bring him with triumph home unto his house !
i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony .
let me not hinder , cassius , your desires .
i ’ ll leave you .
cassius , be not deceived .
tell me , good brutus , can you see your face ?
caesar ’ s better parts shall be crowned in brutus !
we ’ ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .
my countrymen— peace , silence !
good countrymen , let me depart alone .
i do entreat you , not a man depart , save i alone , till antony have spoke .
let him go up into the public chair .
we ’ ll hear him.—noble antony , go up .
for brutus ' sake , i am beholding to you .
what does he say of brutus ?
he says for brutus ' sake he finds himself beholding to us all .
twere best he speak no harm of brutus here .
this caesar was a tyrant .
nay , that ’ s certain .
we are blest that rome is rid of him .
let us hear what antony can say .
you gentle romans— peace , ho !
friends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ears .
i come to bury caesar , not to praise him .
the evil that men do lives after them ; the good is oft interrèd with their bones .
so let it be with caesar .
the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious .
if it were so , it was a grievous fault , and grievously hath caesar answered it .
he was my friend , faithful and just to me .
but brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .
he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill .
did this in caesar seem ambitious ?
when that the poor have cried , caesar hath wept .
ambition should be made of sterner stuff .
yet brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke , but here i am to speak what i do know .
if thou consider rightly of the matter , caesar has had great wrong .
he would not take the crown .
therefore ’ tis certain he was not ambitious .
if it be found so , some will dear abide it .
his eyes are red as fire with weeping .
there ’ s not a nobler man in rome than antony .
but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world .
now lies he there , and none so poor to do him reverence .
i will not do them wrong .
but here ’ s a parchment with the seal of caesar .
we ’ ll hear the will .
read it , mark antony !
the will , the will !
we will hear caesar ’ s will .
it is not meet you know how caesar loved you .
you are not wood , you are not stones , but men .
we ’ ll hear it , antony .
you shall read us the will , caesar ’ s will .
i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it .
i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar .
they were villains , murderers .
you will compel me , then , to read the will ?
and will you give me leave ?
room for antony , most noble antony !
nay , press not so upon me .
if you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
you all do know this mantle .
i remember the first time ever caesar put it on .
twas on a summer ’ s evening in his tent , that day he overcame the nervii .
look , in this place ran cassius ' dagger through .
see what a rent the envious casca made .
for brutus , as you know , was caesar ’ s angel .
judge , o you gods , how dearly caesar loved him !
this was the most unkindest cut of all .
o , what a fall was there , my countrymen !
then i , and you , and all of us fell down , whilst bloody treason flourished over us .
oh , now you weep , and , i perceive , you feel the dint of pity .
kind souls , what , weep you when you but behold our caesar ’ s vesture wounded ?
look you here , here is himself , marred , as you see , with traitors .
they that have done this deed are honorable .
what private griefs they have , alas , i know not , that made them do it .
they are wise and honorable , and will , no doubt , with reasons answer you .
i come not , friends , to steal away your hearts .
i only speak right on .
we ’ ll burn the house of brutus .
come , seek the conspirators .
yet hear me , countrymen .
why , friends , you go to do you know not what .
wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves ?
alas , you know not .
i must tell you then .
you have forgot the will i told you of .
let ’ s stay and hear the will .
we ’ ll revenge his death .
he hath left them you and to your heirs forever—common pleasures , to walk abroad and recreate yourselves .
sir , octavius is already come to rome .
he and lepidus are at caesar ’ s house .
and thither will i straight to visit him .
he comes upon a wish .
fortune is merry , and in this mood will give us anything .
i heard him say , brutus and cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of rome .
belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them .
therefore , good brutus , be prepared to hear .
and be not jealous on me , gentle brutus .
i do fear , the people choose caesar for their king .
ay , do you fear it ?
then must i think you would not have it so .
i dreamt tonight that i did feast with caesar , and things unlucky charge my fantasy .
i have no will to wander forth of doors , yet something leads me forth .
are you a married man or a bachelor ?
am i a married man or a bachelor ?
that ’ s as much as to say they are fools that marry .
you ’ ll bear me a bang for that , i fear .
directly , i am going to caesar ’ s funeral .
as a friend or an enemy ?
briefly , i dwell by the capitol .
your name , sir , truly .
truly , my name is cinna .
he ’ s a conspirator .
i am not cinna the conspirator .
his name ’ s cinna .
pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going .
tear him , tear him !
come , brands , ho , firebrands .
to brutus ' , to cassius ' , burn all .
some to decius ' house and some to casca ’ s .
these many , then , shall die .
i do consent— prick him down , antony .
upon condition publius shall not live , who is your sister ’ s son , mark antony .
look , with a spot i damn him .
but , lepidus , go you to caesar ’ s house .
fetch the will hither , and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies .
what , shall i find you here ?
or here , or at the capitol .
this is a slight , unmeritable man , meet to be sent on errands .
is it fit , the threefold world divided , he should stand one of the three to share it ?
octavius , i have seen more days than you .
you may do your will , but he ’ s a tried and valiant soldier .
so is my horse , octavius , and for that i do appoint him store of provender .
give the word , ho , and stand .
he is at hand , and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master .
but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied .
he is not doubted.—a word , lucillius .
but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath used of old .
thou hast described a hot friend cooling .
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith .
but hollow men , like horses hot at hand , make gallant show and promise of their mettle .
they mean this night in sardis to be quartered .
the greater part , the horse in general , are come with cassius .
march gently on to meet him .
most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
judge me , you gods !
and when you do them— cassius , be content .
then in my tent , cassius , enlarge your griefs , and i will give you audience .
pindarus , bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground .
let lucius and titinius guard our door .
you wronged yourself to write in such a case .
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment .
i “ an itching palm ” !
the name of cassius honors this corruption , and chastisement doth therefore hide his head .
remember march , the ides of march remember .
did not great julius bleed for justice ' sake ?
what villain touched his body , that did stab , and not for justice ?
i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman .
brutus , bait not me .
i ’ ll not endure it .
you forget yourself to hedge me in .
i am a soldier , i , older in practice , abler than yourself to make conditions .
you are not , cassius .
i say you are not .
urge me no more , i shall forget myself .
have mind upon your health , tempt me no further .
hear me , for i will speak .
shall i be frighted when a madman stares ?
but wherefore do you hold me here so long ?
what is it that you would impart to me ?
well , honor is the subject of my story .
i was born free as caesar .
fret till your proud heart break .
go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble .
is it come to this ?
you say you are a better soldier .
make your vaunting true , and it shall please me well .
for mine own part , i shall be glad to learn of noble men .
you wrong me every way .
you wrong me , brutus .
when caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me .
you durst not so have tempted him .
for your life you durst not .
do not presume too much upon my love .
i may do that i shall be sorry for .
you have done that you should be sorry for .
i did send to you for gold to pay my legions , which you denied me .
was that done like cassius ?
should i have answered caius cassius so ?
he was but a fool that brought my answer back .
brutus hath rived my heart .
a friend should bear his friend ’ s infirmities , but brutus makes mine greater than they are .
i do not , till you practice them on me .
i do not like your faults .
a friendly eye could never see such faults .
a flatterer ’ s would not , though they do appear as huge as high olympus .
oh , i could weep my spirit from mine eyes .
be angry when you will , it shall have scope .
do what you will , dishonor shall be humor .
when i spoke that , i was ill-tempered too .
do you confess so much ?
what ’ s the matter ?
what ’ s the matter ?
for shame , you generals !
love , and be friends as two such men should be .
for i have seen more years , i ’ m sure , than ye .
bear with him , brutus .
i ’ ll know his humor when he knows his time .
what should the wars do with these jigging fools ?
away , away , be gone .
lucillius and titinius , bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight .
and come yourselves , and bring messala with you , immediately to us .
i did not think you could have been so angry .
o cassius , i am sick of many griefs .
o insupportable and touching loss !
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .
fill , lucius , till the wine o'erswell the cup .
i can not drink too much of brutus ' love .
now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities .
portia , art thou gone ?
no more , i pray you .
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .
therein our letters do not well agree .
mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions , cicero being one .
cicero is dead , and by that order of proscription .
nor nothing in your letters writ of her ?
hear you aught of her in yours ?
now , as you are a roman , tell me true .
then like a roman bear the truth i tell .
for certain she is dead , and by strange manner .
why , farewell , portia .
we must die , messala .
with meditating that she must die once , i have the patience to endure it now .
even so great men great losses should endure .
well , to our work alive .
what do you think of marching to philippi presently ?
i do not think it good .
this it is : 't is better that the enemy seek us .
hear me , good brother— under your pardon .
the enemy increaseth every day .
we , at the height , are ready to decline .
then , with your will , go on .
we ’ ll along ourselves , and meet them at philippi .
there is no more to say ?
early tomorrow will we rise and hence .
never come such division ’ tween our souls .
let it not , brutus .
tis true , this god did shake !
i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on caesar .
men at some time are masters of their fates .
the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars but in ourselves , that we are underlings .
brutus and caesar—what should be in that “ caesar ” ?
why should that name be sounded more than yours ?
write them together , yours is as fair a name .
sound them , it doth become the mouth as well .
good night , my lord .
good night , good brother .
good night , lord brutus .
what , thou speak ’ st drowsily ?
call claudio and some other of my men .
i ’ ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
i pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep .
it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius .
so please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .
look , lucius , here ’ s the book i sought for so .
i put it in the pocket of my gown .
i was sure your lordship did not give it me .
canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , and touch thy instrument a strain or two ?
ay , my lord , an ’ t please you .
it does , my boy .
i trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .
it is my duty , sir .
i should not urge thy duty past thy might .
i know young bloods look for a time of rest .
i have slept , my lord , already .
it was well done , and thou shalt sleep again .
i will not hold thee long .
if i do live , i will be good to thee .
this is a sleepy tune .
i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee .
and , good boy , good night .
let me see , let me see .
is not the leaf turned down where i left reading ?
here it is , i think .
i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition .
it comes upon me.—art thou any thing ?
speak to me what thou art .
thy evil spirit , brutus .
to tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi .
well , then i shall see thee again ?
why , i will see thee at philippi , then .
ill spirit , i would hold more talk with thee .
the strings , my lord , are false .
he thinks he still is at his instrument .
didst thou dream , lucius , that thou so criedst out ?
my lord , i do not know that i did cry .
yes , that thou didst .
didst thou see any thing ?
why did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?
did we , my lord ?
no , my lord , i saw nothing .
nor i , my lord .
go and commend me to my brother cassius .
bid him set on his powers betimes before , and we will follow .
it shall be done , my lord .
now , antony , our hopes are answerèd .
you said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions .
their battles are at hand .
they mean to warn us at philippi here , answering before we do demand of them .
tut , i am in their bosoms , and i know wherefore they do it .
but ’ tis not so .
the enemy comes on in gallant show .
their bloody sign of battle is hung out , and something to be done immediately .
octavius , lead your battle softly on , upon the left hand of the even field .
upon the right hand i .
why do you cross me in this exigent ?
they stand and would have parley .
we must out and talk .
mark antony , shall we give sign of battle ?
no , caesar , we will answer on their charge .
the generals would have some words .
is it so , countrymen ?
not that we love words better , as you do .
good words are better than bad strokes , octavius .
in your bad strokes , brutus , you give good words .
but for your words , they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless .
villains , you did not so when your vile daggers hacked one another in the sides of caesar .
flatterers ? —now , brutus , thank yourself .
when think you that the sword goes up again ?
caesar , thou canst not die by traitors ' hands unless thou bring ’ st them with thee .
i was not born to die on brutus ' sword .
a peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honor , joined with a masker and a reveler !
if you dare fight today , come to the field .
if not , when you have stomachs .
why , now , blow wind , swell billow , and swim bark !
the storm is up and all is on the hazard .
messala , this is my birthday , as this very day was cassius born .
give me thy hand , messala .
you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion .
now i change my mind , and partly credit things that do presage .
if we do lose this battle , then is this the very last time we shall speak together .
what are you then determinèd to do ?
age , thou art shamed !
rome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !
now is it rome indeed , and room enough , when there is in it but one only man .
that you do love me , i am nothing jealous .
what you would work me to , i have some aim .
how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter .
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus .
then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome ?
no , cassius , no .
think not , thou noble roman , that ever brutus will go bound to rome .
he bears too great a mind .
therefore our everlasting farewell take .
forever and forever farewell , cassius .
if we do meet again , why , we shall smile .
if not , why then this parting was well made .
forever and forever farewell , brutus .
if we do meet again , we ’ ll smile indeed .
if not , ’ tis true this parting was well made .
why then , lead on .
oh , that a man might know the end of this day ’ s business ere it come !
but it sufficeth that the day will end , and then the end is known.—come , ho !
ride , ride , messala , ride , and give these bills unto the legions on the other side .
ride , ride , messala .
myself have to mine own turned enemy .
fly further off , my lord , fly further off .
mark antony is in your tents , my lord .
fly , therefore , noble cassius , fly far off .
are those my tents where i perceive the fire ?
they are , my lord .
i will be here again , even with a thought .
go , pindarus , get higher on that hill .
my sight was ever thick .
regard titinius , and tell me what thou notest about the field .
this day i breathed first .
time is come round , and where i did begin , there shall i end .
my life is run his compass .
come down , behold no more .
come now , keep thine oath .
caesar , thou art revenged , even with the sword that killed thee .
yet would not so have been , durst i have done my will .
o cassius , far from this country pindarus shall run , where never roman shall take note of him .
these tidings will well comfort cassius .
where did you leave him ?
all disconsolate , with pindarus his bondman on this hill .
is not that he that lies upon the ground ?
he lies not like the living .
where art thou , pindarus ?
hie you , messala , and i will seek for pindarus the while .
why didst thou send me forth , brave cassius ?
did i not meet thy friends ?
and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me give it thee ?
didst thou not hear their shouts ?
alas , thou hast misconstrued everything !
but , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow .
thy brutus bid me give it thee , and i will do his bidding .
where , where , messala , doth his body lie ?
lo , yonder , and titinius mourning it .
titinius ' face is upward .
o julius caesar , thou art mighty yet !
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails .
are yet two romans living such as these ?
the last of all the romans , fare thee well !
i shall find time , cassius , i shall find time .
come , therefore , and to thasos send his body .
let us to the field .
labio and flavio , set our battles on .
tis three o'clock , and , romans , yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight .
who will go with me ?
i will proclaim my name about the field .
i am the son of marcus cato , ho !
a foe to tyrants , and my country ’ s friend .
i am the son of marcus cato , ho !
and i am brutus , marcus brutus , i !
brutus , my country ’ s friend .
o young and noble cato , art thou down ?
only i yield to die .
there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight .
kill brutus , and be honored in his death .
tell antony brutus is ta'en .
i ’ ll tell the news .
i dare assure thee that no enemy shall ever take alive the noble brutus .
the gods defend him from so great a shame !
the games are done and caesar is returning .
casca will tell us what the matter is .
come , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .
statilius showed the torchlight but , my lord , he came not back .
he is or ta'en or slain .
sit thee down , clitus .
what , i , my lord ?
no , not for all the world .
i ’ ll rather kill myself .
shall i do such a deed ?
come hither , good volumnius .
at sardis once , and this last night here in philippi fields .
i know my hour is come .
not so , my lord .
nay , i am sure it is , volumnius .
thou seest the world , volumnius , how it goes .
our enemies have beat us to the pit .
it is more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us .
good volumnius , thou know ’ st that we two went to school together .
that ’ s not an office for a friend , my lord .
fly , fly , my lord .
there is no tarrying here .
farewell to you.—and you.—and you , volumnius .
strato , thou hast been all this while asleep .
so fare you well at once , for brutus ' tongue hath almost ended his life ’ s history .
night hangs upon mine eyes .
my bones would rest , that have but labored to attain this hour .
fly , my lord , fly .
i prithee , strato , stay thou by thy lord .
thou art a fellow of a good respect .
thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it .
hold then my sword and turn away thy face while i do run upon it .
give me your hand first .
free from the bondage you are in , messala .
all that served brutus , i will entertain them .
fellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?
ay , if messala will prefer me to you .
do so , good messala .
how died my master , strato ?
i held the sword and he did run on it .
octavius , then take him to follow thee , that did the latest service to my master .
this was the noblest roman of them all .
all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar .
he only in a general honest thought and common good to all , made one of them .
within my tent his bones tonight shall lie most like a soldier , ordered honorably .
tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad .
why , you were with him , were you not ?
i should not then ask casca what had chanced .
what was the second noise for ?
why , for that too .
what was the last cry for ?
why , for that too .
was the crown offered him thrice ?
who offered him the crown ?
tell us the manner of it , gentle casca .
i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it .
and then he offered it the third time .
but soft , i pray you .
what , did caesar swoon ?
he fell down in the marketplace , and foamed at mouth , and was speechless .
he hath the falling sickness .
no , caesar hath it not .
but you and i and honest casca , we have the falling sickness .
i know not what you mean by that , but i am sure caesar fell down .
what said he when he came unto himself ?
if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .
and after that he came thus sad away ?
home , you idle creatures get you home !
why , sir , a carpenter .
where is thy leather apron and thy rule ?
what dost thou with thy best apparel on ?
but what trade art thou ?
what trade , thou knave ?
thou naughty knave , what trade ?
nay , i beseech you , sir , be not out with me .
yet , if you be out , sir , i can mend you .
what mean ’ st thou by that ?
mend ” me , thou saucy fellow ?
ay , he spoke greek .
but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
but , for mine own part , it was greek to me .
i could tell you more news too .
murellus and flavius , for pulling scarfs off caesar ’ s images , are put to silence .
there was more foolery yet , if i could remember it .
will you sup with me tonight , casca ?
no , i am promised forth .
will you dine with me tomorrow ?
ay , if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be !
he was quick mettle when he went to school .
for this time i will leave you .
tomorrow , if you please to speak with me , i will come home to you .
or , if you will , come home to me , and i will wait for you .
till then , think of the world .
well , brutus , thou art noble .
caesar doth bear me hard , but he loves brutus .
if i were brutus now and he were cassius , he should not humor me .
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon-day upon the marketplace , hooting and shrieking .
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet , let not men say , “ these are their reasons .
they are natural. ” for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon .
indeed , it is a strange-disposèd time .
but men may construe things after their fashion , clean from the purpose of the things themselves .
comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow ?
he doth , for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow .
good night then , casca .
this disturbèd sky is not to walk in .
casca , by your voice .
cassius , what night is this !
a very pleasing night to honest men .
who ever knew the heavens menace so ?
those that have known the earth so full of faults .
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ?
let it be who it is .
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish .
i know where i will wear this dagger then .
cassius from bondage will deliver cassius .
therein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong .
therein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat .
but life , being weary of these worldly bars , never lacks power to dismiss itself .
so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity .
and why should caesar be a tyrant then ?
i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep .
he were no lion were not romans hinds .
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws .
but , o grief , where hast thou led me ?
then i know my answer must be made .
you speak to casca , and to such a man that is no fleering telltale .
there ’ s a bargain made .
and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey ’ s porch .
i do know him by his gait .
no , it is casca , one incorporate to our attempts .
am i not stayed for , cinna ?
i am glad on ’ t .
what a fearful night is this !
there ’ s two or three of us have seen strange sights .
am i not stayed for ?
o cassius , if you could but win the noble brutus to our party— be you content .
all this done , repair to pompey ’ s porch , where you shall find us .
is decius brutus and trebonius there ?
all but metellus cimber , and he ’ s gone to seek you at your house .
well , i will hie , and so bestow these papers as you bade me .
that done , repair to pompey ’ s theatre .
come , casca , you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house .
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited .
called you , my lord ?
get me a taper in my study , lucius .
when it is lighted , come and call me here .
i will , my lord .
how that might change his nature , there ’ s the question .
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking .
why , sir , cobble you .
thou art a cobbler , art thou ?
truly , sir , all that i live by is with the awl .
when they are in great danger , i recover them .
as proper men as ever trod upon neat ’ s leather have gone upon my handiwork .
but wherefore art not in thy shop today ?
why dost thou lead these men about the streets ?
truly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work .
what conquest brings he home ?
what tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
th ' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power .
then , lest he may , prevent .
the taper burneth in your closet , sir .
get you to bed again .
is not tomorrow , boy , the ides of march ?
i know not , sir .
look in the calendar and bring me word .
sir , march is wasted fifteen days .
since cassius first did whet me against caesar , i have not slept .
o conspiracy , shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free ?
o , then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage ?
hide it in smiles and affability .
i think we are too bold upon your rest .
i have been up this hour , awake all night .
know i these men that come along with you ?
and this , metellus cimber .
what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night ?
shall i entreat a word ?
doth not the day break here ?
you shall confess that you are both deceived .
and let us swear our resolution .
no , not an oath .
so let high-sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery .
what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter ?
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous , old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs .
unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt .
i think he will stand very strong with us .
let us not leave him out .
no , by no means .
it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands .
o , name him not .
let us not break with him , for he will never follow anything that other men begin .
indeed he is not fit .
i think it is not meet mark antony , so well beloved of caesar , should outlive caesar .
we shall find of him a shrewd contriver .
let us be sacrificers but not butchers , caius .
oh , that we then could come by caesar ’ s spirit and not dismember caesar !
but , alas , caesar must bleed for it .
and , gentle friends , let ’ s kill him boldly but not wrathfully .
and that were much he should , for he is given to sports , to wildness and much company .
there is no fear in him .
the clock hath stricken three .
if he be so resolved , i can o'ersway him .
but when i tell him he hates flatterers , he says he does , being then most flatterèd .
for i can give his humor the true bent , and i will bring him to the capitol .
nay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .
caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard , who rated him for speaking well of pompey .
i wonder none of you have thought of him .
now , good metellus , go along by him .
he loves me well , and i have given him reasons .
send him but hither and i ’ ll fashion him .
the morning comes upon ’ s .
we ’ ll leave you , brutus .
and , friends , disperse yourselves .
but all remember what you have said , and show yourselves true romans .
good gentlemen , look fresh and merrily .
and so good morrow to you every one .
enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber .
therefore thou sleep ’ st so sound .
portia , what mean you ?
it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw , cold morning .
y ' have ungently , brutus , stole from my bed .
i urged you further , then you scratched your head and too impatiently stamped with your foot .
dear my lord , make me acquainted with your cause of grief .
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompey ’ s blood ?
go you down that way towards the capitol .
this way will i. disrobe the images if you do find them decked with ceremonies .
i ’ ll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets .
so do you too , where you perceive them thick .
i am not well in health , and that is all .
why , so i do .
good portia , go to bed .
and is it physical to walk unbracèd and suck up the humors of the dank morning ?
kneel not , gentle portia .
if this were true , then should i know this secret .
i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife .
i grant i am a woman , but withal a woman well-reputed , cato ’ s daughter .
think you i am no stronger than my sex , being so fathered and so husbanded ?
i will not disclose 'em .
i have made strong proof of my constancy , giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh .
can i bear that with patience , and not my husband ’ s secrets ?
o ye gods , render me worthy of this noble wife !
lucius , who ’ s that knocking ?
he is a sick man that would speak with you .
would you were not sick !
i am not sick if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honor .
such an exploit have i in hand , ligarius , had you a healthful ear to hear of it .
a piece of work that will make sick men whole .
but are not some whole that we must make sick ?
nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight .
thrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out , “ help , ho !
they murder caesar ! ” —who ’ s within ?
go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success .
i will , my lord .
what mean you , caesar ?
think you to walk forth ?
you shall not stir out of your house today .
the things that threatened me ne'er looked but on my back .
when they shall see the face of caesar , they are vanishèd .
caesar , i never stood on ceremonies , yet now they fright me .
a lioness hath whelpèd in the streets , and graves have yawned and yielded up their dead .
these things are beyond all use , and i do fear them .
what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods ?
yet caesar shall go forth , for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar .
when beggars die there are no comets seen .
the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .
cowards die many times before their deaths .
the valiant never taste of death but once .
they would not have you to stir forth today .
plucking the entrails of an offering forth , they could not find a heart within the beast .
the gods do this in shame of cowardice .
caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear .
no , caesar shall not .
we are two lions littered in one day , and i the elder and more terrible .
and caesar shall go forth .
alas , my lord , your wisdom is consumed in confidence .
do not go forth today .
call it my fear that keeps you in the house , and not your own .
mark antony shall say i am not well , and for thy humor i will stay at home .
here ’ s decius brutus .
he shall tell them so .
good morrow , worthy caesar .
i come to fetch you to the senate house .
shall caesar send a lie ?
have i in conquest stretched mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?
decius , go tell them caesar will not come .
the cause is in my will .
that is enough to satisfy the senate .
but for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i will let you know .
calphurnia here , my wife , stays me at home .
this dream is all amiss interpreted .
it was a vision fair and fortunate .
this by calphurnia ’ s dream is signified .
and this way have you well expounded it .
i have , when you have heard what i can say .
and know it now : the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar .
if you shall send them word you will not come , their minds may change .
how foolish do your fears seem now , calphurnia !
i am ashamèd i did yield to them .
give me my robe , for i will go .
and look , where publius is come to fetch me .
what is ’ t o'clock ?
caesar , ’ tis strucken eight .
i thank you for your pains and courtesy .
so to most noble caesar .
i am to blame to be thus waited for .
now , cinna.—now , metellus.—what , trebonius , i have an hour ’ s talk in store for you .
remember that you call on me today .
be near me , that i may remember you .
good friends , go in and taste some wine with me .
and we , like friends , will straightway go together .
when caesar says , “ do this , ” it is performed .
set on , and leave no ceremony out .
caesar , beware of brutus .
have an eye to cinna .
decius brutus loves thee not .
thou hast wronged caius ligarius .
there is but one mind in all these men , and it is bent against caesar .
if thou beest not immortal , look about you .
security gives way to conspiracy .
the mighty gods defend thee !
if thou read this , o caesar , thou mayst live .
if not , the fates with traitors do contrive .
i prithee , boy , run to the senate house .
stay not to answer me , but get thee gone .
i would have had thee there and here again ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there .
madam , what should i do ?
run to the capitol , and nothing else ?
and so return to you , and nothing else ?
yes , bring me word , boy , if thy lord look well , for he went sickly forth .
and take good note what caesar doth , what suitors press to him .
i hear none , madam .
sooth , madam , i hear nothing .
which way hast thou been ?
at mine own house , good lady .
what is ’ t o'clock ?
about the ninth hour , lady .
is caesar yet gone to the capitol ?
i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the capitol .
thou hast some suit to caesar , hast thou not ?
that i have , lady .
why , know ’ st thou any harm ’ s intended towards him ?
none that i know will be ; much that i fear may chance .
here the street is narrow .
ay , caesar , but not gone .
o caesar , read mine first , for mine ’ s a suit that touches caesar nearer .
read it , great caesar .
what touches us ourself shall be last served .
what , is the fellow mad ?
what ’ s the matter here ?
keep peace , upon your lives .
he dies that strikes again .
the messengers from our sister and the king .
i am scarce in breath , my lord .
thou art a strange fellow .
a tailor make a man ?
ay , a tailor , sir .
you beastly knave , know you no reverence ?
yes , sir , but anger hath a privilege .
smile you my speeches as i were a fool ?
why , art thou mad , old fellow ?
why dost thou call him “ knave ” ?
what ’ s his offense ?
his countenance likes me not .
no more perchance does mine , nor his , nor hers .
he can not flatter , he .
an honest mind and plain , he must speak truth .
an they will take it , so .
if not , he ’ s plain .
to go out of my dialect , which you discommend so much .
i know , sir , i am no flatterer .
i never gave him any .
none of these rogues and cowards but ajax is their fool .
call not your stocks for me .
i serve the king , on whose employment i was sent to you .
as i have life and honor , there shall he sit till noon .
till night , my lord , and all night too .
why , madam , if i were your father ’ s dog , you should not use me so .
sir , being his knave , i will .
this is a fellow of the selfsame color our sister speaks of.—come , bring away the stocks !
let me beseech your grace not to do so .
his fault is much , and the good king his master will check him for ’ t .
i ’ ll answer that .
i am sorry for thee , friend .
i ’ ll entreat for thee .
pray you do not , sir .
a good man ’ s fortune may grow out at heels .
the duke ’ s to blame in this .
obey you , love you , and most honor you .
sure , i shall never marry like my sisters , to love my father all .
but goes thy heart with this ?
ay , good my lord .
so young and so untender ?
so young , my lord , and true .
thy truth then be thy dower .
good my liege— peace , kent .
i heard myself proclaimed , and by the happy hollow of a tree escaped the hunt .
no port is free , no place that guard and most unusual vigilance does not attend my taking .
poor turlygod ! ” “ poor tom ! ” — that ’ s something yet .
tis strange that they should so depart from home , and not send back my messenger .
as i learned , the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove .
makest thou this shame thy pastime ?
look , he wears cruel garters .
it is both he and she : your son and daughter .
no , no , they would not .
they could not , would not do ’ t .
tis worse than murder to do upon respect such violent outrage .
my lord , when at their home i did commend your highness ' letters to them .
he raised the house with loud and coward cries .
your son and daughter found this trespass worth the shame which here it suffers .
fathers that wear rags do make their children blind .
but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind .
fortune , that arrant whore , ne'er turns the key to th ' poor .
o , how this mother swells up toward my heart !
with the earl , sir , here within .
made you no more offense but what you speak of ?
how chance the king comes with so small a train ?
but the great one that goes up the hill , let him draw thee after .
when a wise man gives thee better counsel , give me mine again .
i would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it .
and let the wise man fly .
where learned you this , fool ?
not i ' th ' stocks , fool .
deny to speak with me ?
the images of revolt and flying off .
vengeance , plague , death , confusion !
why , gloucester , gloucester , i ’ d speak with the duke of cornwall and his wife .
well , my good lord , i have informed them so .
dost thou understand me , man ?
ay , my good lord .
the king would speak with cornwall .
are they “ informed ” of this ?
the “ fiery ” duke ?
tell the hot duke that lear— no , but not yet .
maybe he is not well .
i would have all well betwixt you .
o me , my heart , my rising heart !
good morrow to you both .
i am glad to see your highness .
regan , i think you are .
belovèd regan , thy sister ’ s naught .
o regan , she hath tied sharp-toothed unkindness , like a vulture , here .
i pray you , sir , take patience .
say , how is that ?
i can not think my sister in the least would fail her obligation .
o sir , you are old .
nature in you stands on the very verge of his confine .
you should be ruled and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself .
therefore i pray you that to our sister you do make return .
say you have wronged her , sir .
return you to my sister .
fie , sir , fie !
you nimble lightnings , dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes !
infect her beauty , you fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun , to fall and blister !
so will you wish on me when the rash mood is on .
her eyes are fierce , but thine do comfort and not burn .
thy half o ' th ' kingdom hast thou not forgot , wherein i thee endowed .
good sir , to the purpose .
call burgundy.— cornwall and albany , with my two daughters ' dowers digest this third .
let pride , which she calls plainness , marry her .
let it fall rather , though the fork invade the region of my heart .
be kent unmannerly when lear is mad .
what wouldst thou do , old man ?
think ’ st thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows ?
to plainness honor ’ s bound when majesty falls to folly .
what trumpet ’ s that ?
i know ’ t—my sister ’ s .
this approves her letter that she would soon be here .
regan , i have good hope thou didst not know on ’ t.—who comes here ?
o regan , wilt thou take her by the hand ?
i set him there , sir , but his own disorders deserved much less advancement .
i pray you , father , being weak , seem so .
i am now from home , and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment .
return to her , and fifty men dismissed ?
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to this detested groom .
at your choice , sir .
now , i prithee , daughter , do not make me mad .
i will not trouble thee , my child .
we ’ ll no more meet , no more see one another .
thou art a boil , a plague-sore or embossèd carbuncle in my corrupted blood .
but i ’ ll not chide thee .
i do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot , nor tell tales of thee to high-judging jove .
be better at thy leisure .
i can stay with regan , i and my hundred knights .
not altogether so , sir .
i looked not for you yet , nor am provided for your fit welcome .
give ear , sir , to my sister .
i dare avouch it , sir .
how , in one house , should many people under two commands hold amity ?
tis hard ; almost impossible .
why not , my lord ?
if then they chanced to slack you , we could control them .
to no more will i give place or notice .
i gave you all— and in good time you gave it .
made you my guardians , my depositaries , but kept a reservation to be followed with such a number .
what , must i come to you with five and twenty , regan ?
and speak ’ t again , my lord .
not being the worst stands in some rank of praise .
hear me , my lord .
o , reason not the need !
but , for true need— you heavens , give me that patience , patience i need .
no , you unnatural hags ,
you think i ’ ll weep ?
no , i ’ ll not weep .
the old man and his people can not be well bestowed .
hath put himself from rest , and must needs taste his folly .
where is my lord of gloucester ?
followed the old man forth .
he calls to horse , but will i know not whither .
tis best to give him way .
for many miles about there ’ s scarce a bush .
o sir , to wilful men , the injuries that they themselves procure must be their schoolmasters .
he is attended with a desperate train .
and what they may incense him to , being apt to have his ear abused , wisdom bids fear .
shut up your doors , my lord .
come out o ' th ' storm .
who ’ s there , besides foul weather ?
one minded like the weather , most unquietly .
where ’ s the king ?
contending with the fretful elements .
strives in his little world of man to outscorn the to-and-fro–conflicting wind and rain .
but who is with him ?
none but the fool , who labors to outjest his heart-struck injuries .
i will talk further with you .
have you no more to say ?
you cataracts and hurricanoes , spout till you have drenched our steeples , drowned the cocks !
you sulfurous and thought-executing fires , vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts , singe my white head !
o nuncle , court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o ' door .
good nuncle , in , and ask thy daughters blessing .
here ’ s a night pities neither wise man nor fool .
nor rain , wind , thunder , fire are my daughters .
i tax not you , you elements , with unkindness .
why then , let fall your horrible pleasure .
here i stand , your slave— a poor , infirm , weak , and despised old man .
he that has a house to put ’ s head in has a good headpiece .
kent , on thy life , no more .
see better , lear , and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye .
now , by apollo— now , by apollo , king , thou swear ’ st thy gods in vain .
for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass .
no , i will be the pattern of all patience .
marry , here ’ s grace and a codpiece—that ’ s a wise man and a fool .
let the great gods that keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads find out their enemies now .
some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest .
my wits begin to turn.— come on , my boy .
true , my good boy.—come , bring us to this hovel .
i ’ ll speak a prophecy ere i go .
then comes the time , who lives to see ’ t , that going shall be used with feet .
this prophecy merlin shall make , for i live before his time .
alack , alack , edmund , i like not this unnatural dealing .
go to , say you nothing .
there ’ s a division betwixt the dukes .
tis dangerous to be spoken .
i have locked the letter in my closet .
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged home .
there ’ s part of a power already footed .
we must incline to the king .
i will look him and privily relieve him .
go you and maintain talk with the duke , that my charity be not of him perceived .
if he ask for me , i am ill and gone to bed .
though i die for it—as no less is threatened me—the king my old master must be relieved .
there is some strange thing toward , edmund .
pray you , be careful .
this courtesy , forbid thee , shall the duke instantly know , and of that letter too .
the younger rises when the old doth fall .
here is the place , my lord .
good my lord , enter .
the tyranny of the open night ’ s too rough for nature to endure .
good my lord , enter here .
i had rather break mine own .
good my lord , enter .
thou think ’ st ’ tis much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin .
so ’ tis to thee .
but where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt .
when the mind ’ s free , the body ’ s delicate .
the tempest in my mind doth from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there—filial ingratitude .
is it not as this mouth should tear this hand for lifting food to ’ t ?
but i will punish home .
no , i will weep no more .
in such a night to shut me out !
pour on , i will endure .
in such a night as this !
good my lord , enter here .
prithee , go in thyself .
this tempest will not give me leave to ponder on things would hurt me more .
but i ’ ll go in .
come not in here , nuncle .
here ’ s a spirit .
help me , help me !
a spirit , a spirit .
he says his name ’ s poor tom .
what art thou that dost grumble there i ' th ' straw ?
the foul fiend follows me !
through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind .
go to thy cold bed and warm thee .
didst thou give all to thy two daughters , and art thou come to this ?
oh , do-de , do-de , do-de .
bless thee from whirlwinds , star-blasting , and taking !
do poor tom some charity , whom the foul fiend vexes .
there could i have him now—and there—and there again—and there .
what , has his daughters brought him to this pass ? — couldst thou save nothing ?
wouldst thou give 'em all ?
nay , he reserved a blanket , else we had been all shamed .
he hath no daughters , sir .
nothing could have subdued nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters .
is it the fashion that discarded fathers should have thus little mercy on their flesh ?
twas this flesh begot those pelican daughters .
this cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen .
take heed o ' th ' foul fiend .
tom ’ s a- cold .
wine loved i deeply , dice dearly , and in woman outparamoured the turk .
thou art the thing itself .
prithee , nuncle , be contented .
tis a naughty night to swim in .
look , here comes a walking fire .
this is the foul fiend flibbertigibbet .
he begins at curfew and walks till the first cock .
and aroint thee , witch , aroint thee !
what is ’ t you seek ?
modo he ’ s called , and mahu .
poor tom ’ s a-cold .
my duty can not suffer to obey in all your daughters ' hard commands .
first let me talk with this philosopher.—
by jupiter , this shall not be revoked .
why , fare thee well , king .
here ’ s france and burgundy , my noble lord .
we first address towards you , who with this king hath rivaled for our daughter .
let me ask you one word in private .
his daughters seek his death .
ah , that good kent— he said it would be thus , poor banished man .
thou say ’ st the king grows mad .
i ’ ll tell thee , friend , i am almost mad myself .
i had a son , now outlawed from my blood .
he sought my life , but lately , very late .
i loved him , friend— no father his son dearer .
what a night ’ s this !
o , cry your mercy , sir.— tom ’ s a-cold .
come let ’ s in all .
this way , my lord .
i will have my revenge ere i depart his house .
how malicious is my fortune , that i must repent to be just !
go with me to the duchess .
if the matter of this paper be certain , you have mighty business in hand .
true or false , it hath made thee earl of gloucester .
i will lay trust upon thee , and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love .
here is better than the open air .
i will piece out the comfort with what addition i can .
i will not be long from you .
all the power of his wits have given way to his impatience .
the gods reward your kindness !
a king , a king !
to have a thousand with red burning spits come hissing in upon 'em !
the foul fiend bites my back .
the foul fiend haunts poor tom in the voice of a nightingale .
hoppedance cries in tom ’ s belly for two white herring .
croak not , black angel .
i have no food for thee .
i here take my oath before this honorable assembly , she kicked the poor king her father .
she can not deny it .
and here ’ s another , whose warped looks proclaim what store her heart is made on .
arms , arms , sword , fire , corruption in the place !
false justicer , why hast thou let her ’ scape ?
they ’ ll mar my counterfeiting .
the little dogs and all , tray , blanch , and sweetheart—see , they bark at me .
tom will throw his head at them.—avaunt , you curs !
tooth that poisons if it bite , mastiff , greyhound , mongrel grim ,
hound or spaniel , brach or him , bobtail tyke or trundle-tail— tom will make them weep and wail .
for with throwing thus my head , dogs leap the hatch , and all are fled .
be thy mouth or black or white , do-de , de-de .
come , march to wakes and fairs and market towns .
poor tom , thy horn is dry .
is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts ?
now , good my lord , lie here and rest awhile .
make no noise , make no noise .
draw the curtains—so , so , so .
we ’ ll go to supper i ' th ' morning .
so , so , so .
and i ’ ll go to bed at noon .
here , sir , but trouble him not .
good friend , i prithee , take him in thy arms .
there is a litter ready .
come , help to bear thy master .
come , come , away .
when we our betters see bearing our woes , we scarcely think our miseries our foes .
who alone suffers , suffers most i ' th ' mind , leaving free things and happy shows behind .
but then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship .
what will hap more tonight , safe ’ scape the king !
leave him to my displeasure.—edmund , keep you our sister company .
the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding .
advise the duke where you are going , to a most festinate preparation .
we are bound to the like .
our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.—farewell , dear sister .
where ’ s the king ?
my lord of gloucester hath conveyed him hence .
get horses for your mistress .
farewell , sweet lord , and sister .
go seek the traitor gloucester .
pinion him like a thief , bring him before us .
ingrateful fox , ’ tis he .
bind fast his corky arms .
good my friends , consider you are my guests .
do me no foul play , friends .
bind him , i say .
most royal majesty , i crave no more than hath your highness offered .
nor will you tender less .
sir , there she stands .
hard , hard.—o filthy traitor !
unmerciful lady as you are , i ’ m none .
so white , and such a traitor ?
naughty lady , these hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin will quicken and accuse thee .
with robbers ' hands my hospitable favors you should not ruffle thus .
come , sir , what letters had you late from france ?
be simple-answered , for we know the truth .
and what confederacy have you with the traitors late footed in the kingdom ?
to whose hands you have sent the lunatic king .
where hast thou sent the king ?
wast thou not charged at peril— wherefore to dover ? —let him first answer that .
i am tied to th ' stake , and i must stand the course .
wherefore to dover , sir ?
yet poor old heart , he holp the heavens to rain .
but i shall see the wingèd vengeance overtake such children .
he that will think to live till he be old , give me some help !
one side will mock another—th ' other too .
but better service have i never done you than now to bid you hold .
how now , you dog ?
if you did wear a beard upon your chin , i ’ d shake it on this quarrel .
nay then , come on , and take the chance of anger .
where is thy luster now ?
where ’ s my son edmund ?
thou call ’ st on him that hates thee .
go thrust him out at gates , and let him smell his way to dover .
i have received a hurt .
follow me , lady.— turn out that eyeless villain .
throw this slave upon the dunghill.—regan , i bleed apace .
i ’ ll never care what wickedness i do , if this man come to good .
let ’ s follow the old earl , and get the bedlam to lead him where he would .
his roguish madness allows itself to any thing .
i ’ ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to apply to his bleeding face .
the lamentable change is from the best ; the worst returns to laughter .
welcome , then , thou unsubstantial air that i embrace !
my father , poorly led ?
world , world , o world !
but that thy strange mutations make us hate thee , life would not yield to age .
i have been your tenant and your father ’ s tenant these fourscore years .
away , get thee away .
good friend , be gone .
alack , sir , you can not see your way .
i have no way , and therefore want no eyes .
i stumbled when i saw .
full oft ’ tis seen , our means secure us and our mere defects prove our commodities .
my son came then into my mind , and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him .
i have heard more since .
is that the naked fellow ?
alack , sir , he is mad .
tis the time ’ s plague when madmen lead the blind .
do as i bid thee .
or rather , do thy pleasure .
sirrah , naked fellow— poor tom ’ s a-cold .
know ’ st thou the way to dover ?
poor tom hath been scared out of his good wits .
so bless thee , master .
there is a cliff , whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confinèd deep .
from that place i shall no leading need .
poor tom shall lead thee .
i marvel our mild husband not met us on the way .
now , where ’ s your master ?
go to , go to .
better thou hadst not been born than not t ' have pleased me better .
love ’ s not love when it is mingled with regards that stands aloof from th ' entire point .
she is herself a dowry .
yours in the ranks of death .
oh , the difference of man and man !
to thee a woman ’ s services are due .
my fool usurps my body .
madam , here comes my lord .
i have been worth the whistle .
o goneril , you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face .
that nature , which contemns its origin can not be bordered certain in itself .
she that herself will sliver and disbranch from her material sap perforce must wither and come to deadly use .
wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile .
tigers , not daughters , what have you performed ?
could my good brother suffer you to do it— a man , a prince by him so benefited ?
where ’ s thy drum ?
thou changèd and self-covered thing , for shame !
howe'er thou art a fiend , a woman ’ s shape doth shield thee .
marry , your manhood , mew !
but oh , poor gloucester— lost he his other eye ?
both , both , my lord.— this letter , madam , craves a speedy answer .
one way i like this well .
come with my lady hither .
no , my good lord .
ay , my good lord .
tell me what more thou know ’ st .
why the king of france is so suddenly gone back know you the reason ?
who hath he left behind him general ?
the marshal of france , monsieur la far .
did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief ?
o , then it moved her ?
in brief , sorrow would be a rarity most beloved if all could so become it .
made she no verbal question ?
shame of ladies , sisters !
kent , father , sisters !
what , i ' th ' storm , i ' th ' night ?
then away she started to deal with grief alone .
you spoke not with her since ?
was this before the king returned ?
a sovereign shame so elbows him .
these things sting his mind so venomously that burning shame detains him from cordelia .
of albany ’ s and cornwall ’ s powers you heard not ?
well , sir , i ’ ll bring you to our master lear and leave you to attend him .
some dear cause will in concealment wrap me up awhile .
when i am known aright you shall not grieve lending me this acquaintance .
i pray you , go along with me .
alack , ’ tis he .
search every acre in the high-grown field , and bring him to our eye .
there is means , madam .
all blessed secrets , all you unpublished virtues of the earth , spring with my tears .
be aidant and remediate in the good man ’ s distress .
the british powers are marching hitherward .
our preparation stands in expectation of them .
o dear father , it is thy business that i go about .
therefore great france my mourning and importuned tears hath pitied .
no blown ambition doth our arms incite , but love—dear love ! —and our aged father ’ s right .
soon may i hear and see him .
but are my brother ’ s powers set forth ?
madam , with much ado .
your sister is the better soldier .
lord edmund spake not with your lord at home ?
what might import my sister ’ s letter to him ?
i know not , lady .
faith , he is posted hence on serious matter .
it was great ignorance , gloucester ’ s eyes being out , to let him live .
where he arrives he moves all hearts against us .
i must needs after him , madam , with my letter .
our troops set forth tomorrow .
since that respects and fortunes are his love , i shall not be his wife .
bid farewell to your sisters .
i may not , madam .
my lady charged my duty in this business .
why should she write to edmund ?
belike some things—i know not what .
madam , i had rather— i know your lady does not love her husband .
i am sure of that .
and at her late being here she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks to noble edmund .
i know you are of her bosom .
therefore i do advise you , take this note .
when shall we come to th ' top of that same hill ?
methinks the ground is even .
why then , your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes ' anguish .
so may it be indeed .
methinks thy voice is altered , and thou speak ’ st in better phrase and matter than thou didst .
you ’ re much deceived .
in nothing am i changed but in my garments .
methinks you ’ re better spoken .
here ’ s the place .
how fearful and dizzy ’ tis to cast one ’ s eyes so low !
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air show scarce so gross as beetles .
halfway down hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade !
and yon tall anchoring bark ,
the murmuring surge that on th ' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes can not be heard so high .
set me where you stand .
you are now within a foot of th ' extreme verge .
now fare you well , good sir .
away , and let me die .
ten masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell .
thy life ’ s a miracle .
but have i fall ' n , or no ?
from the dread summit of this chalky bourn .
the shrill-gorged lark so far can not be seen or heard .
twas yet some comfort when misery could beguile the tyrant ’ s rage and frustrate his proud will .
too well , too well .
this is above all strangeness .
upon the crown o ' th ' cliff , what thing was that which parted from you ?
as i stood here below , methought his eyes were two full moons .
he had a thousand noses , horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea .
that thing you speak of , i took it for a man .
bear free and patient thoughts .
i am the king himself .
look , look , a mouse !
peace , this piece of toasted cheese will do ’ t .
o , well flown , bird .
i ' th ' clout , i ' th ' clout .
goneril with a white beard ?
go to , they are not men o ' their words .
they told me i was everything .
the trick of that voice i do well remember .
is ’ t not the king ?
ay , every inch a king .
i pardon that man ’ s life .
the wren goes to ’ t , and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight .
to ’ t , luxury , pell-mell—for i lack soldiers .
down from the waist they are centaurs , though women all above .
there ’ s money for thee .
o , let me kiss that hand !
let me wipe it first .
i remember thine eyes well enough .
dost thou squiny at me ?
what , with the case of eyes ?
oh ho , are you there with me ?
no eyes in your head , nor no money in your purse ?
a man may see how this world goes with no eyes .
see how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief .
thou hast seen a farmer ’ s dog bark at a beggar ?
and the creature run from the cur ?
there thou mightst behold the great image of authority : a dog ’ s obeyed in office .
thou rascal beadle , hold thy bloody hand .
why dost thou lash that whore ?
thou hotly lust ’ st to use her in that kind for which thou whipp ’ st her .
the usurer hangs the cozener .
none does offend—none , i say , none .
i ’ ll able 'em .
if thou wilt weep my fortunes , take my eyes .
i know thee well enough .
thou know ’ st the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry .
i will preach to thee .
alack , alack the day !
when we are born , we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools .
it were a delicate stratagem to shoe a troop of horse with felt .
i ’ ll put ’ t in proof .
i am even the natural fool of fortune .
i am cut to th ' brains .
i will die bravely , like a smug bridegroom .
what , i will be jovial .
i am a king , my masters , know you that ?
you are a royal one , and we obey you .
then there ’ s life in ’ t .
a sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch , past speaking of in a king .
what ’ s your will ?
do you hear aught , sir , of a battle toward ?
everyone hears that that can distinguish sound .
but , by your favor , how near ’ s the other army ?
near and on speedy foot .
the main descry stands in the hourly thought .
i thank you , sir .
but yet , alas , stood i within his grace , i would prefer him to a better place .
so farewell to you both .
prescribe not us our duty .
time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides , who covers faults at last with shame derides .
come , my fair cordelia .
sister , it is not a little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both .
i think our father will hence tonight .
that ’ s most certain , and with you .
you see how full of changes his age is .
though that the queen on special cause is here , her army is moved on .
i thank you , sir .
you ever gentle gods , take my breath from me .
let not my worser spirit tempt me again to die before you please .
well pray you , father .
now , good sir , what are you ?
the bounty and the benison of heaven to boot and boot .
that eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh to raise my fortunes .
thou old unhappy traitor , briefly thyself remember .
now let thy friendly hand put strength enough to ’ t .
wherefore , bold peasant , darest thou support a published traitor ?
hence , lest that th ' infection of his fortune take like hold on thee .
chill not let go , zir , without vurther 'casion .
let go , slave , or thou diest !
chill pick your teeth , zir .
come , no matter vor your foins .
if ever thou wilt thrive , bury my body .
i know thee well—a serviceable villain , as duteous to the vices of thy mistress as badness would desire .
what , is he dead ?
let ’ s see these pockets .
the letters that he speaks of may be my friends .
i am only sorry he had no other death ’ s-man .
leave , gentle wax , and , manners , blame us not .
their papers is more lawful .
let our reciprocal vows be remembered .
far off methinks i hear the beaten drum .
come , father , i ’ ll bestow you with a friend .
o thou good kent , how shall i live and work to match thy goodness ?
my life will be too short , and every measure fail me .
to be acknowledged , madam , is o'erpaid .
all my reports go with the modest truth , nor more , nor clipped , but so .
i prithee , put them off .
my boon i make it that you know me not till time and i think meet .
then be ’ t so , my good lord.— how does the king ?
so please your majesty that we may wake the king ?
be by , good madam , when we do awake him .
i doubt not of his temperance .
please you , draw near.—louder the music there !
had you not been their father , these white flakes did challenge pity of them .
tis wonder that thy life and wits at once had not concluded all.—he wakes .
how does my royal lord ?
you do me wrong to take me out o ' th ' grave .
sir , do you know me ?
you are a spirit , i know .
i should ev ' n die with pity to see another thus .
i know not what to say .
i will not swear these are my hands .
would i were assured of my condition .
pray , do not mock me .
i am a very foolish fond old man , fourscore and upward , not an hour more nor less .
and to deal plainly i fear i am not in my perfect mind .
methinks i should know you , and know this man .
nor i know not where i did lodge last night .
and so i am , i am .
i pray , weep not .
if you have poison for me , i will drink it .
you have some cause ; they have not .
no cause , no cause .
in your own kingdom , sir .
be comforted , good madam .
the great rage , you see , is killed in him .
and yet it is danger to make him even o'er the time he has lost .
desire him to go in .
trouble him no more till further settling .
will ’ t please your highness walk ?
you must bear with me .
pray you now , forget and forgive .
i am old and foolish .
holds it true , sir , that the duke of cornwall was so slain ?
who is conductor of his people ?
as ’ tis said , the bastard son of gloucester .
they say edgar , his banished son , is with the earl of kent in germany .
tis time to look about .
the powers of the kingdom approach apace .
the arbitrament is like to be bloody .
fare you well , sir .
tis to be doubted , madam .
now , sweet lord , you know the goodness i intend upon you .
tell me but truly—but then speak the truth— do you not love my sister ?
i am doubtful that you have been conjunct and bosomed with her as far as we call hers .
no , by mine honor , madam .
tis the infirmity of his age .
yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself .
the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash .
such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent ’ s banishment .
there is further compliment of leave-taking between france and him .
pray you , let ’ s sit together .
we shall further think on ’ t .
we must do something , and i ' th ' heat .
i never shall endure her .
dear my lord , be not familiar with her .
fear me not.— she and the duke her husband !
sir , you speak nobly .
let ’ s then determine with the ancient of war on our proceedings .
i shall attend you presently at your tent .
sister , you ’ ll go with us ?
pray you , go with us .
stay till i have read the letter .
when time shall serve , let but the herald cry , and i ’ ll appear again .
why , fare thee well .
i will o'erlook thy paper .
we will greet the time .
which of them shall i take ?
neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive .
if ever i return to you again , i ’ ll bring you comfort .
grace go with you , sir .
king lear hath lost , he and his daughter ta'en .
and that ’ s true too .
some officers take them away .
good guard until their greater pleasures first be known that are to censure them .
no , no , no , no !
come , let ’ s away to prison .
we two alone will sing like birds i ' th ' cage .
when thou dost ask me blessing , i ’ ll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness .
upon such sacrifices , my cordelia , the gods themselves throw incense .
he that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven and fire us hence like foxes .
the good years shall devour them , flesh and fell , ere they shall make us weep .
we ’ ll see 'em starve first .
i ’ ll do ’ t , my lord .
about it , and write “ happy ” when thou ’ st done .
mark , i say , instantly , and carry it so as i have set it down .
i can not draw a cart , nor eat dried oats .
if it be man ’ s work , i ’ ll do ’ t .
the question of cordelia and her father requires a fitter place .
i hold you but a subject of this war , not as a brother .
that ’ s as we list to grace him .
in his own grace he doth exalt himself more than in your addition .
that were the most if he should husband you .
that eye that told you so looked but asquint .
mean you to enjoy him then ?
nor in thine , lord .
thou art armed , gloucester .
sick , oh , sick !
my sickness grows upon me .
convey her to my tent .
come hither , herald.—let the trumpet sound , — and read out this .
well then , legitimate edgar , i must have your land .
now , gods , stand up for bastards !
all this done upon the gad ? —edmund , how now ?
o , know , my name is lost .
yet am i noble as the adversary i come to cope withal .
what ’ s he that speaks for edmund , earl of gloucester ?
what sayst thou to him ?
behold : it is the privilege of mine honors , my oath , and my profession .
in wisdom i should ask thy name .
back do i toss these treasons to thy head , with the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—
this is practice , gloucester .
by th ' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer an unknown opposite .
the laws are mine , not thine .
who can arraign me for ’ t ?
ask me not what i know .
what you have charged me with , that have i done— and more , much more .
the time will bring it out .
tis past , and so am i .
i am no less in blood than thou art , edmund .
if more , the more thou ’ st wronged me .
my name is edgar , and thy father ’ s son .
the gods are just , and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us .
thou ’ st spoken right .
let sorrow split my heart if ever i did hate thee or thy father .
worthy prince , i know ’ t .
where have you hid yourself ?
how have you known the miseries of your father ?
list a brief tale , and when ’ tis told , oh , that my heart would burst !
the bloody proclamation to escape , that followed me so near—o our lives ' sweetness ,
never—o fault ! —revealed myself unto him until some half-hour past , when i was armed .
this speech of yours hath moved me , and shall perchance do good .
you look as you had something more to say .
if there be more , more woeful , hold it in .
for i am almost ready to dissolve , hearing of this .
twice then the trumpets sounded , and there i left him tranced .
help , help , o , help !
what means that bloody knife ?
tis hot , it smokes .
it came even from the heart of—oh , she ’ s dead !
your lady , sir , your lady .
and her sister by her is poisoned .
i was contracted to them both .
all three now marry in an instant .
i thought the king had more affected the duke of albany than cornwall .
it did always seem so to us .
his breeding , sir , hath been at my charge .
i have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now i am brazed to it .
do you smell a fault ?
i can not wish the fault undone , the issue of it being so proper .
oh , is this he ?
i am come to bid my king and master aye good night .
great thing of us forgot ! — speak , edmund , where ’ s the king ?
and where ’ s cordelia ? — seest thou this object , kent ?
the one the other poisoned for my sake , and after slew herself .
some good i mean to do despite of mine own nature .
nay , send in time !
run , run , o , run !
to who , my lord ? —who hath the office ?
send thy token of reprieve .
the captain— give it the captain .
haste thee for thy life .
the gods defend her ! —hear him hence awhile .
howl , howl , howl , howl !
oh , you are men of stones .
she ’ s gone forever .
i know when one is dead and when one lives .
she ’ s dead as earth .
if that her breath will mist or stain the stone , why then , she lives .
or image of that horror ?
if it be so , it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows that ever i have felt .
tis noble kent , your friend .
a plague upon you , murderers , traitors all !
i might have saved her .
now she ’ s gone for ever.— cordelia , cordelia , stay a little .
tis true , my lords , he did .
did i not , fellow ?
i am old now , and these same crosses spoil me .
where is your servant caius ?
he ’ s a good fellow , i can tell you that .
he ’ s dead and rotten .
no , my good lord .
i am the very man— i ’ ll see that straight .
that from your first of difference and decay have followed your sad steps .
you ’ re welcome hither .
all ’ s cheerless , dark , and deadly .
your eldest daughters have fordone themselves , and desperately are dead .
ay , so i think .
he knows not what he says , and vain it is that we present us to him .
edmund is dead , my lord .
for us , we will resign during the life of this old majesty to him our absolute power .
he faints ! —my lord , my lord !
o , let him pass .
oh , he is gone indeed .
the wonder is he hath endured so long .
our present business is to general woe .
why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter ?
i know no news , my lord .
what paper were you reading ?
what needed , then , that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket ?
the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself .
i beseech you , sir , pardon me .
it is a letter from my brother that i have not all o'er-read .
give me the letter , sir .
i shall offend , either to detain or give it .
the contents , as in part i understand them , are to blame .
i have a journey , sir , shortly to go .
i must not say no .
the weight of this sad time we must obey .
speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
come to me , that of this i may speak more .
had he a hand to write this , a heart and brain to breed it in ?
when came this to you ?
it was not brought me , my lord .
there ’ s the cunning of it .
i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet .
you know the character to be your brother ’ s ?
if the matter were good , my lord , i durst swear it were his .
but in respect of that , i would fain think it were not .
it is his hand , my lord , but i hope his heart is not in the contents .
has he never before sounded you in this business ?
his very opinion in the letter !
go , sirrah , seek him .
i ’ ll apprehend him .
i do not well know , my lord .
he can not be such a monster— nor is not , sure .
to his father , that so tenderly and entirely loves him .
edmund , seek him out , wind me into him , i pray you .
these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us .
love cools , friendship falls off , brothers divide , in cities
mutinies , in countries discord , in palaces treason , and the bond cracked ’ twixt son and father .
this villain of mine comes under the prediction—there ’ s son against father .
the king falls from bias of nature—there ’ s father against child .
we have seen the best of our time .
machinations , hollowness , treachery , and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves .
find out this villain , edmund .
it shall lose thee nothing .
do it carefully.—and the noble and true-hearted kent banished , his offense honesty !
fa , sol , la , mi .
how now , brother edmund ?
what serious contemplation are you in ?
how long have you been a sectary astronomical ?
when saw you my father last ?
why , the night gone by .
ay , two hours together .
parted you in good terms ?
found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance ?
some villain hath done me wrong .
that ’ s my fear .
i pray you , have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower .
there ’ s my key .
if you do stir abroad , go armed .
brother , i advise you to the best .
shall i hear from you anon ?
i do serve you in this business .
let me , if not by birth , have lands by wit .
all with me ’ s meet that i can fashion fit .
did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool ?
by day and night he wrongs me .
every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds .
i ’ ll not endure it .
his knights grow riotous , and himself upbraids us on every trifle .
when he returns from hunting , i will not speak with him .
if you come slack of former services , you shall do well .
the fault of it i ’ ll answer .
he ’ s coming , madam .
put on what weary negligence you please , you and your fellow servants .
idle old man that still would manage those authorities that he hath given away !
remember what i have said .
and let his knights have colder looks among you .
what grows of it , no matter .
i would breed from hence occasions , and i shall , that i may speak .
i ’ ll write straight to my sister to hold my very course .
go , prepare for dinner .
let me not stay a jot for dinner .
what wouldst thou with us ?
a very honest-hearted fellow , and as poor as the king .
if thou beest as poor for a subject as he ’ s for a king , thou'rt poor enough .
dost thou know me , fellow ?
what services canst thou do ?
that which ordinary men are fit for , i am qualified in .
and the best of me is diligence .
i have years on my back forty- eight .
where ’ s my knave , my fool ? —go you , and call my fool hither .
my services to your lordship .
i must love you and sue to know you better .
sir , i shall study deserving .
he hath been out nine years , and away he shall again .
attend the lords of france and burgundy , gloucester .
i shall , my lord .
you , you , sirrah , where ’ s my daughter ?
so please you— what says the fellow there ?
where ’ s my fool , ho ?
i think the world ’ s asleep .
where ’ s that mongrel ?
he says , my lord , your daughter is not well .
why came not the slave back to me when i called him .
sir , he answered me in the roundest manner he would not .
thou but rememberest me of mine own conception .
i will look further into ’ t .
but where ’ s my fool ?
i have not seen him this two days .
since my young lady ’ s going into france , sir , the fool hath much pined away .
i have noted it well .
go you and tell my daughter i would speak with her .
go you , call hither my fool .
o you sir , you , come you hither , sir .
who am i , sir ?
you slave , you cur !
i am none of these , my lord .
i ’ ll not be strucken , my lord .
now , my friendly knave , i thank thee .
let me hire him too.—here ’ s my coxcomb .
how now , my pretty knave ?
for taking one ’ s part that ’ s out of favor .
nay , an thou canst not smile as the wind sits , thou'lt catch cold shortly .
there , take my coxcomb .
if thou follow him , thou must needs wear my coxcomb.—how now , nuncle ?
would i had two coxcombs and two daughters .
if i gave them all my living , i ’ d keep my coxcombs myself .
beg another of thy daughters .
take heed , sirrah—the whip .
a pestilent gall to me !
sirrah , i ’ ll teach thee a speech .
this is nothing , fool .
then ’ tis like the breath of an unfee ’ d lawyer .
nothing can be made out of nothing .
dost thou know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet fool ?
that lord that counseled thee to give away thy land , come place him here by me .
do thou for him stand .
the sweet and bitter fool will presently appear— the one in motley here , the other found out there .
dost thou call me fool , boy ?
all thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with .
this is not altogether fool , my lord .
no , faith , lords and great men will not let me .
what two crowns shall they be ?
if i speak like myself in this , let him be whipped that first finds it so .
when were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah ?
i have used it , nuncle , ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers .
i would fain learn to lie .
an you lie , sirrah , we ’ ll have you whipped .
i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are .
i had rather be any kind o ' thing than a fool .
and yet i would not be thee , nuncle .
here comes one o ' the parings .
what makes that frontlet on ?
methinks you are too much of late i ' th ' frown .
he that keeps nor crust nor crumb , weary of all , shall want some .
but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel , breaking forth in rank and not-to-be-endurèd riots .
which else were shame , that then necessity will call discreet proceeding .
so out went the candle and we were left darkling .
does any here know me ?
why , this is not lear .
sure , ’ tis not so .
who is it that can tell me who i am ?
which they will make an obedient father .
this admiration , sir , is much o ' th ' savor of other your new pranks .
i do beseech you to understand my purposes aright .
as you are old and reverend , should be wise .
epicurism and lust make it more like a tavern or a brothel than a graced palace .
the shame itself doth speak for instant remedy .
call my train together.— degenerate bastard , i ’ ll not trouble thee .
yet have i left a daughter .
you strike my people , and your disordered rabble make servants of their betters .
woe that too late repents ! — is it your will ?
pray , sir , be patient .
it may be so , my lord .
hear , nature , hear , dear goddess , hear !
now gods that we adore , whereof comes this ?
thou shalt , i warrant thee .
do you mark that , my lord ?
come , sire , no more.—what , oswald , ho !
so the fool follows after .
this man hath had good counsel—a hundred knights !
well , you may fear too far .
safer than trust too far .
let me still take away the harms i fear , not fear still to be taken .
what he hath uttered i have writ my sister .
if she sustain him and his hundred knights when i have showed th ' unfitness— here , madam .
what , have you writ that letter to my sister ?
take you some company , and away to horse .
get you gone and hasten your return .
striving to better , oft we mar what ’ s well .
nay , then— well , well , th ' event .
i will not sleep , my lord , till i have delivered your letter .
ha , ha , ha !
shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly .
why , what canst thou tell , my boy ?
she will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab .
thou canst tell why one ’ s nose stands i ' th ' middle on ’ s face ?
i did her wrong— canst tell how an oyster makes his shell ?
but i can tell why a snail has a house .
i will forget my nature .
so kind a father ! —be my horses ready ?
thy asses are gone about 'em .
the reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason .
because they are not eight ?
thou wouldst make a good fool .
to take ’ t again perforce— monster ingratitude !
thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise .
o , let me not be mad , not mad , sweet heaven !
i would not be mad .
nay , i know not .
have you heard of no likely wars toward ’ twixt the two dukes of cornwall and albany ?
you may do then in time .
fare you well , sir .
the duke be here tonight ?
this weaves itself perforce into my business .
briefness and fortune , work ! — brother , a word .
descend , brother , i say .
o sir , fly this place .
intelligence is given where you are hid .
have you not spoken 'gainst the duke of cornwall aught ?
i hear my father coming .
in cunning i must draw my sword upon you .
now quit you well.— torches , torches !
now edmund , where ’ s the villain ?
look , sir , i bleed .
where is the villain , edmund ?
fled this way , sir , when by no means he could— pursue him , ho !
by no means ” what ?
not in this land shall he remain uncaught .
the noble duke my master , my worthy arch and patron , comes tonight .
and find i am alone felicitate in your dear highness ' love .
nothing will come of nothing .
unhappy that i am , i can not heave my heart into my mouth .
i love your majesty according to my bond , no more nor less .
how , how , cordelia ?
mend your speech a little , lest you may mar your fortunes .
he that conceals him , death .
he replied , “ thou unpossessing bastard !
would he deny his letter , said he ?
i never got him.— hark , the duke ’ s trumpets .
i know not why he comes .
all ports i ’ ll bar .
the villain shall not ’ scape .
the duke must grant me that .
how now , my noble friend ?
since i came hither , which i can call but now , i have heard strange news .
how dost , my lord ?
o madam , my old heart is cracked , it ’ s cracked .
o , lady , lady , shame would have it hid .
was he not companion with the riotous knights that tend upon my father ?
i know not , madam .
tis too bad , too bad .
yes , madam , he was of that consort .
no marvel then , though he were ill affected .
it was my duty , sir .
he did bewray his practice , and received this hurt you see striving to apprehend him .
ay , my good lord .
if he be taken , he shall never more be feared of doing harm .
natures of such deep trust we shall much need .
i shall serve you , sir , truly , however else .
you know not why we came to visit you— thus out of season , threading dark-eyed night .
the several messengers from hence attend dispatch .
i serve you , madam .
your graces are right welcome .
good dawning to thee , friend .
where may we set our horses ?
i ' th ' mire .
prithee , if thou lovest me , tell me .
why , then , i care not for thee .
if i had thee in lipsbury pinfold , i would make thee care for me .
why dost thou use me thus ?
fellow , i know thee .
what dost thou know me for ?
what a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me !
is it two days ago since i tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king ?
draw , you rogue , for though it be night yet the moon shines .
i ’ ll make a sop o ' th ' moonshine of you .
i have nothing to do with thee .
draw , you rogue , or i ’ ll so carbonado your shanks .
stand , you neat slave , strike !
the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day .
it will be rain tonight .
fly , good fleance , fly , fly , fly !
thou may ’ st revenge —o slave !
who did strike out the light ?
was ’ t not the way ?
there ’ s but one down .
we have lost best half of our affair .
well , let ’ s away and say how much is done .
at first and last , the hearty welcome .
ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host .
pronounce it for me , sir , to all our friends , for my heart speaks they are welcome .
see , they encounter thee with their hearts ' thanks .
here i ’ ll sit i ' th ' midst .
anon we ’ ll drink a measure the table round .
tis banquo ’ s then .
my lord , his throat is cut .
that i did for him .
if thou didst it , thou art the nonpareil .
most royal sir , fleance is ’ scaped .
then comes my fit again .
ay , my good lord .
there the grown serpent lies .
tomorrow we ’ ll hear ourselves again .
my royal lord , you do not give the cheer .
where hast thou been , sister ?
a sailor ’ s wife had chestnuts in her lap , and munched , and munched , and munched .
give me , ” quoth i .
aroint thee , witch ! ” the rump-fed runnion cries .
i ’ ll drain him dry as hay .
sleep shall neither night nor day hang upon his penthouse lid .
he shall live a man forbid .
weary sev'nnights nine times nine shall he dwindle , peak and pine .
may ’ t please your highness sit .
his absence , sir , lays blame upon his promise .
please ’ t your highness to grace us with your royal company ?
the table ’ s full .
here is a place reserved , sir .
what , my good lord ?
his highness is not well .
my lord is often thus and hath been from his youth .
pray you , keep seat .
if much you note him , you shall offend him and extend his passion .
feed and regard him not .
ay , and a bold one , that dare look on that which might appall the devil .
this is the very painting of your fear .
this is the air-drawn dagger which you said led you to duncan .
why do you make such faces ?
when all ’ s done , you look but on a stool .
if i stand here , i saw him .
but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools .
this is more strange than such a murder is .
my worthy lord , your noble friends do lack you .
our duties , and the pledge .
or be alive again , and dare me to the desert with thy sword .
if trembling i inhabit then , protest me the baby of a girl .
why so , being gone , why so , being gone , i am a man again .
you have displaced the mirth , broke the good meeting , with most admired disorder .
what sights , my lord ?
i pray you , speak not .
he grows worse and worse .
at once , good night .
a kind good night to all !
stones have been known to move , and trees to speak .
almost at odds with morning , which is which .
did you send to him , sir ?
i hear it by the way ; but i will send .
there ’ s not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee ’ d .
i will tomorrow— and betimes i will—to the weird sisters .
for mine own good , all causes shall give way .
come , we ’ ll to sleep .
my strange and self-abuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use .
we are yet but young in deed .
why , how now , hecate !
have i not reason , beldams as you are ?
get you gone , and at the pit of acheron meet me i ' th ' morning .
thither he will come to know his destiny .
your vessels and your spells provide , your charms and everything beside .
i am for the air .
this night i ’ ll spend unto a dismal and a fatal end .
great business must be wrought ere noon .
upon the corner of the moon there hangs a vap'rous drop profound .
i ’ ll catch it ere it come to ground .
he shall spurn fate , scorn death , and bear his hopes 'bove wisdom , grace , and fear .
and you all know , security is mortals ' chiefest enemy .
my little spirit , see , sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me .
only i say things have been strangely borne .
men must not walk too late .
all which we pine for now .
and this report hath so exasperated the king that he prepares for some attempt of war .
i ’ ll send my prayers with him .
though his bark can not be lost , yet it shall be tempest-tossed .
show me , show me .
a drum , a drum !
thrice the brinded cat hath mewed .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
cool it with a baboon ’ s blood , then the charm is firm and good .
i commend your pains , and every one shall share i ' th ' gains .
by the pricking of my thumbs , something wicked this way comes .
open , locks , whoever knocks .
how now , you secret , black , and midnight hags ?
what is ’ t you do ?
a deed without a name .
i conjure you by that which you profess— howe'er you come to know it—answer me .
say , if th ' hadst rather hear it from our mouths , or from our masters ' .
tell me , thou unknown power— he knows thy thought .
hear his speech but say thou nought .
beware the thane of fife .
whate'er thou art , for thy good caution , thanks .
thou hast harped my fear aright .
but one word more— he will not be commanded .
here ’ s another more potent than the first .
macbeth ! — had i three ears , i ’ d hear thee .
be bloody , bold , and resolute .
laugh to scorn the power of man , for none of woman born shall harm macbeth .
but yet i ’ ll make assurance double sure , and take a bond of fate .
listen but speak not to ’ t .
be lion-mettled , proud , and take no care who chafes , who frets , or where conspirers are .
macbeth shall never vanquished be until great birnam wood to high dunsinane hill shall come against him .
who can impress the forest , bid the tree unfix his earthbound root ?
yet my heart throbs to know one thing .
seek to know no more .
deny me this , and an eternal curse fall on you !
and what noise is this ?
show his eyes and grieve his heart .
come like shadows ; so depart !
thou art too like the spirit of banquo .
i ’ ll see no more .
what , is this so ?
come , sisters , cheer we up his sprites , and show the best of our delights .
let this pernicious hour stand aye accursèd in the calendar !
what ’ s your grace ’ s will ?
saw you the weird sisters ?
came they not by you ?
no , indeed , my lord .
i did hear the galloping of horse .
who was ’ t came by ?
tis two or three , my lord , that bring you word macduff is fled to england .
ay , my good lord .
time , thou anticipat ’ st my dread exploits .
no boasting like a fool .
this deed i ’ ll do before this purpose cool .
but no more sights ! —where are these gentlemen ?
come , bring me where they are .
what had he done to make him fly the land ?
you must have patience , madam .
when our actions do not , our fears do make us traitors .
you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear .
my dearest coz , i pray you school yourself .
i take my leave of you .
shall not be long but i ’ ll be here again .
fathered he is , and yet he ’ s fatherless .
i am so much a fool , should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort .
i take my leave at once .
sirrah , your father ’ s dead .
and what will you do now ?
as birds do , mother .
what , with worms and flies ?
with what i get , i mean , and so do they .
thou ’ dst never fear the net nor lime , the pitfall nor the gin .
my father is not dead , for all your saying .
yes , he is dead .
how wilt thou do for a father ?
nay , how will you do for a husband ?
why , i can buy me twenty at any market .
speak , if you can : what are you ?
hail to thee , thane of glamis !
lesser than macbeth and greater .
not so happy , yet much happier .
thou shalt get kings , though thou be none .
so all hail , macbeth and banquo !
then you ’ ll buy 'em to sell again .
was my father a traitor , mother ?
ay , that he was .
why , one that swears and lies .
and be all traitors that do so ?
every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged .
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?
why , the honest men .
if he were dead , you ’ d weep for him .
if you would not , it were a good sign that i should quickly have a new father .
poor prattler , how thou talk ’ st !
bless you , fair dame !
i am not to you known , though in your state of honor i am perfect .
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly .
if you will take a homely man ’ s advice , be not found here .
hence with your little ones .
i dare abide no longer .
i have done no harm .
i hope , in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him .
he ’ s a traitor .
thou liest , thou shag-haired villain !
he has killed me , mother .
run away , i pray you !
let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty .
what you have spoke , it may be so perchance .
this tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , was once thought honest .
you have loved him well .
he hath not touched you yet .
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge .
but i shall crave your pardon .
that which you are , my thoughts can not transpose .
angels are bright still , though the brightest fell .
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace , yet grace must still look so .
i pray you , let not my jealousies be your dishonors , but mine own safeties .
you may be rightly just , whatever i shall think .
bleed , bleed , poor country !
i speak not as in absolute fear of you .
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke .
it weeps , it bleeds , and each new day a gash is added to her wounds .
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top macbeth .
but there ’ s no bottom , none , in my voluptuousness .
better macbeth than such an one to reign .
boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny .
it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings .
but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours .
we have willing dames enough .
if such a one be fit to govern , speak .
such welcome and unwelcome things at once 't is hard to reconcile .
well , more anon.—comes the king forth , i pray you ?
ay , sir ; there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure .
i thank you , doctor .
what ’ s the disease he means ?
see , who comes here ?
my countryman , but yet i know him not .
my ever-gentle cousin , welcome hither .
stands scotland where it did ?
almost afraid to know itself .
oh , relation too nice and yet too true !
banquo and macbeth , all hail !
stay , you imperfect speakers , tell me more .
speak , i charge you .
the earth hath bubbles , as the water has , and these are of them .
were such things here as we do speak about ?
or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner ?
your children shall be kings .
and thane of cawdor too : went it not so ?
to the selfsame tune and words .
now is the time of help .
would i could answer this comfort with the like .
if it be mine , keep it not from me .
quickly let me have it .
your castle is surprised , your wife and babes savagely slaughtered .
wife , children , servants , all that could be found .
and i must be from thence !
let ’ s make us med'cines of our great revenge , to cure this deadly grief .
what , all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop ?
dispute it like a man .
i can not but remember such things were that were most precious to me .
did heaven look on , and would not take their part ?
sinful macduff , they were all struck for thee !
be this the whetstone of your sword .
let grief convert to anger .
oh , i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue !
but , gentle heavens , cut short all intermission .
front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself .
within my sword ’ s length set him ; if he ’ scape , heaven forgive him too .
come , go we to the king .
our power is ready ; our lack is nothing but our leave .
macbeth is ripe for shaking , and the powers above put on their instruments .
receive what cheer you may .
i have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report .
when was it she last walked ?
that , sir , which i will not report after her .
neither to you nor any one , having no witness to confirm my speech .
lo you , here she comes .
this is her very guise ; and , upon my life , fast asleep .
observe her , stand close .
how came she by that light ?
why , it stood by her .
she has light by her continually .
you see her eyes are open .
ay , but their sense is shut .
what is it she does now ?
look , how she rubs her hands .
it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands .
yet here ’ s a spot .
i will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .
the thane of fife had a wife .
you have known what you should not .
she has spoke what she should not , i am sure of that .
heaven knows what she has known .
here ’ s the smell of the blood still .
all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand .
oh , oh , oh !
what a sigh is there !
the heart is sorely charged .
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .
well , well , well .
pray god it be , sir .
this disease is beyond my practice .
yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds .
to bed , to bed .
there ’ s knocking at the gate .
will she go now to bed ?
god , god forgive us all !
good night , good doctor .
the english power is near , led on by malcolm , his uncle siward and the good macduff .
who knows if donalbain be with his brother ?
for certain , sir , he is not .
i have a file of all the gentry .
great dunsinane he strongly fortifies .
but , for certain , he can not buckle his distempered cause within the belt of rule .
make we our march towards birnam .
why do you dress me in borrowed robes ?
bring me no more reports .
till birnam wood remove to dunsinane i can not taint with fear .
what ’ s the boy malcolm ?
was he not born of woman ?
the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus : “ fear not , macbeth .
the mind i sway by and the heart i bear shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear .
the devil damn thee black , thou cream-faced loon !
where got ’ st thou that goose look ?
there is ten thousand— geese , villain ?
go , prick thy face and over-red thy fear , thou lily-livered boy .
those linen cheeks of thine are counselors to fear .
the english force , so please you .
i have lived long enough .
what ’ s your gracious pleasure ?
all is confirmed , my lord , which was reported .
i ’ ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked .
i ’ ll put it on .
therein the patient must minister to himself .
throw physic to the dogs ; i ’ ll none of it .
come , put mine armor on .
ay , my good lord .
your royal preparation makes us hear something .
cousins , i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe .
what wood is this before us ?
let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear ’ t before him .
thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us .
hang out our banners on the outward walls .
here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up .
it is the cry of women , my good lord .
i have almost forgot the taste of fears .
the queen , my lord , is dead .
she should have died hereafter .
out , out , brief candle !
it is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .
well , say , sir .
let me endure your wrath , if ’ t be not so .
within this three mile may you see it coming ; i say , a moving grove .
if thou speak ’ st false , upon the next tree shall thou hang alive till famine cling thee .
if thy speech be sooth , i care not if thou dost for me as much .
they have tied me to a stake .
i can not fly , but , bearlike , i must fight the course .
what ’ s he that was not born of woman ?
such a one am i to fear , or none .
thou 'lt be afraid to hear it .
no , though thou call ’ st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell .
my name ’ s macbeth .
the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear .
no , nor more fearful .
thou liest , abhorrèd tyrant .
that way the noise is .
tyrant , show thy face !
either thou , macbeth , or else my sword with an unbattered edge i sheathe again undeeded .
there thou shouldst be ; by this great clatter , one of the greatest note seems bruited .
this way , my lord .
the castle ’ s gently rendered .
enter , sir , the castle .
turn , hellhound , turn !
my voice is in my sword .
thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out !
as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed .
i ’ ll not fight with thee .
then yield thee , coward , and live to be the show and gaze o ' th ' time .
before my body i throw my warlike shield .
macduff is missing , and your noble son .
your son , my lord , has paid a soldier ’ s debt .
ay , and brought off the field .
your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth , for then it hath no end .
had he his hurts before ?
ay , on the front .
why then , god ’ s soldier be he !
had i as many sons as i have hairs , i would not wish them to a fairer death .
and so , his knell is knolled .
he ’ s worth more sorrow , and that i ’ ll spend for him .
he ’ s worth no more .
they say he parted well and paid his score .
and so , god be with him !
behold where stands the usurper ’ s cursèd head .
hail , king of scotland !
my thanes and kinsmen , henceforth be earls , the first that ever scotland in such an honor named .
look how our partner ’ s rapt .
worthy macbeth , we stay upon your leisure .
kind gentlemen , your pains are registered where every day i turn the leaf to read them .
let us toward the king .
my liege , they are not yet come back .
nothing in his life became him like the leaving it .
there ’ s no art to find the mind ’ s construction in the face .
so humbly take my leave .
when shall we three meet again ?
in thunder , lightning , or in rain ?
that will be ere the set of sun .
there to meet with macbeth .
the king comes here tonight .
thou 'rt mad to say it .
my dearest love , duncan comes here tonight .
tomorrow , as he purposes .
o , never shall sun that morrow see !
your face , my thane , is as a book where men may read strange matters .
bear welcome in your eye , your hand , your tongue .
look like th ' innocent flower , but be the serpent under ’ t .
leave all the rest to me .
this castle hath a pleasant seat .
the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses .
where they most breed and haunt , i have observed , the air is delicate .
see , see , our honored hostess !
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble , which still we thank as love .
fair and noble hostess , we are your guest tonight .
conduct me to mine host .
we love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him .
by your leave , hostess .
if it were done when ’ tis done , then ’ twere well it were done quickly .
why have you left the chamber ?
hath he asked for me ?
know you not he has ?
we will proceed no further in this business .
was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself ?
from this time such i account thy love .
art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valor as thou art in desire ?
what beast was ’ t , then , that made you break this enterprise to me ?
what not put upon his spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt of our great quell ?
bring forth men-children only , for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males .
away , and mock the time with fairest show .
false face must hide what the false heart doth know .
how goes the night , boy ?
i have not heard the clock .
and she goes down at twelve .
i take ’ t ’ tis later , sir .
hold , take my sword .
there ’ s husbandry in heaven ; their candles are all out .
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me , and yet i would not sleep .
merciful powers , restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature gives way to in repose .
what , sir , not yet at rest ?
the king ’ s a-bed .
he hath been in unusual pleasure , and sent forth great largess to your offices .
being unprepared , our will became the servant to defect , which else should free have wrought .
what bloody man is that ?
he can report , as seemeth by his plight , of the revolt the newest state .
this is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'gainst my captivity .
say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it .
doubtful it stood , as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art .
i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters : to you they have showed some truth .
i think not of them .
at your kind ’ st leisure .
if you shall cleave to my consent , when ’ tis , it shall make honor for you .
thanks , sir : the like to you !
is this a dagger which i see before me , the handle toward my hand ?
whiles i threat , he lives .
hear it not , duncan , for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell .
that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold .
what hath quenched them hath given me fire .
i have done the deed .
didst thou not hear a noise ?
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
who lies i ' th ' second chamber ?
a foolish thought , to say a sorry sight .
but wherefore could not i pronounce “ amen ” ?
i had most need of blessing , and “ amen ” stuck in my throat .
these deeds must not be thought after these ways .
so , it will make us mad .
methought i heard a voice cry , “ sleep no more !
still it cried , “ sleep no more ! ” to all the house .
go get some water , and wash this filthy witness from your hand .
why did you bring these daggers from the place ?
go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood .
the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures .
how is ’ t with me when every noise appals me ?
i hear a knocking at the south entry .
retire we to our chamber .
a little water clears us of this deed .
how easy is it , then !
your constancy hath left you unattended .
get on your nightgown , lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers .
be not lost so poorly in your thoughts .
wake duncan with thy knocking .
knock , knock , knock !
who ’ s there , in th ' other devil ’ s name ?
o , come in , equivocator .
knock , knock , knock !
faith , here ’ s an english tailor come hither for stealing out of a french hose .
here you may roast your goose .
but this place is too cold for hell .
i ’ ll devil-porter it no further .
i pray you , remember the porter .
was it so late , friend , ere you went to bed , that you do lie so late ?
what three things does drink especially provoke ?
lechery , sir , it provokes and unprovokes .
it provokes the desire , but it takes away the performance .
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night .
our knocking has awaked him .
good morrow , noble sir .
is the king stirring , worthy thane ?
he did command me to call timely on him .
i have almost slipped the hour .
i ’ ll bring you to him .
i know this is a joyful trouble to you , but yet ’ tis one .
the labor we delight in physics pain .
i ’ ll make so bold to call , for ’ tis my limited service .
goes the king hence today ?
the night has been unruly .
the obscure bird clamored the livelong night .
some say the earth was feverous and did shake .
my young remembrance can not parallel a fellow to it .
o horror , horror , horror !
tongue nor heart can not conceive nor name thee !
what ’ s the matter ?
confusion now hath made his masterpiece .
dismayed not this our captains , macbeth and banquo ?
yes , as sparrows eagles , or the hare the lion .
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds ; they smack of honor both .
so should he look that seems to speak things strange .
approach the chamber , and destroy your sight with a new gorgon .
do not bid me speak .
see , and then speak yourselves .
shake off this downy sleep , death ’ s counterfeit , and look on death itself !
up , up , and see the great doom ’ s image !
as from your graves rise up , and walk like sprites , to countenance this horror !
o banquo , banquo , our royal master ’ s murdered !
what , in our house ?
dear duff , i prithee , contradict thyself , and say it is not so .
renown and grace is dead .
the wine of life is drawn , and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of .
you are , and do not know ’ t .
your royal father ’ s murdered .
those of his chamber , as it seemed , had done ’ t .
their hands and faces were all badged with blood .
so were their daggers , which unwiped we found upon their pillows .
they stared , and were distracted .
no man ’ s life was to be trusted with them .
oh , yet i do repent me of my fury , that i did kill them .
who can be wise , amazed , temp'rate , and furious , loyal and neutral , in a moment ?
help me hence , ho !
fears and scruples shake us .
let ’ s briefly put on manly readiness , and meet i ' th ' hall together .
let ’ s not consort with them .
to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy .
i ’ ll to england .
our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer .
where we are , there ’ s daggers in men ’ s smiles .
the near in blood , the nearer bloody .
there ’ s warrant in that theft which steals itself when there ’ s no mercy left .
by th ' clock ’ tis day , and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp .
tis said they eat each other .
they did so , to th ' amazement of mine eyes that looked upon ’ t .
here comes the good macduff .
how goes the world , sir , now ?
why , see you not ?
those that macbeth hath slain .
thriftless ambition , that will raven up thine own lives ' means !
then ’ tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth .
he is already named and gone to scone to be invested .
where is duncan ’ s body ?
carried to colmekill , the sacred storehouse of his predecessors , and guardian of their bones .
no , cousin , i ’ ll to fife .
well , i will thither .
well , may you see things well done there .
adieu , lest our old robes sit easier than our new !
but hush , no more .
here ’ s our chief guest .
ay , my good lord .
is ’ t far you ride ?
as far , my lord , as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper .
my lord , i will not .
but of that tomorrow , when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly .
adieu , till your return at night .
ay , my good lord .
our time does call upon ’ s .
let every man be master of his time till seven at night .
to make society the sweeter welcome , we will keep ourself till suppertime alone .
while then , god be with you !
our fears in banquo stick deep , and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feared .
then , prophetlike , they hailed him father to a line of kings .
that now sweno , the norways ' king , craves composition .
i ’ ll see it done .
what he hath lost , noble macbeth hath won .
now go to the door and stay there till we call .
was it not yesterday we spoke together ?
it was , so please your highness .
well then , now have you considered of my speeches ?
i did so , and went further , which is now our point of second meeting .
do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go ?
we are men , my liege .
both of you know banquo was your enemy .
we shall , my lord , perform what you command us .
though our lives— your spirits shine through you .
we are resolved , my lord .
i ’ ll call upon you straight .
banquo , thy soul ’ s flight , if it find heaven , must find it out tonight .
is banquo gone from court ?
ay , madam , but returns again tonight .
say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words .
naught ’ s had , all ’ s spent , where our desire is got without content .
tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy .
how now , my lord !
what ’ s done is done .
we have scorched the snake , not killed it .
she ’ ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth .
come on , gentle my lord , sleek o'er your rugged looks .
so shall i , love , and so , i pray , be you .
thou know ’ st that banquo , and his fleance , lives .
there ’ s comfort yet ; they are assailable .
what ’ s to be done ?
why then , to thee , thou silver treasure house .
tell me once more what title thou dost bear .
let none presume to wear an undeservèd dignity .
how many then should cover that stand bare !
how much low peasantry would then be gleaned from the true seed of honor !
well , but to my choice .
too long a pause for that which you find there .
i will read it.— how much unlike art thou to portia !
who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves ” !
did i deserve no more than a fool ’ s head ?
are my deserts no better ?
the fire seven times tried this , seven times tried that judgment is , that did never choose amiss .
some there be that shadows kiss .
such have but a shadow ’ s bliss .
there be fools alive , iwis , silvered o'er—and so was this .
take what wife you will to bed , i will ever be your head .
i ’ ll keep my oath patiently to bear my wroth . ”
thus hath the candle singed the moth .
when they do choose , they have the wisdom by their wit to lose .
the ancient saying is no heresy .
hanging and wiving goes by destiny .
come , draw the curtain , nerissa .
yet i have not seen so likely an ambassador of love .
no more , i pray thee .
now , what news on the rialto ?
ha , what sayest thou ?
why , the end is he hath lost a ship .
i would it might prove the end of his losses .
what news among the merchants ?
you knew—none so well , none so well as you—of my daughter ’ s flight .
i , for my part , knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal .
she is damned for it .
that ’ s certain—if the devil may be her judge .
my own flesh and blood to rebel !
out upon it , old carrion !
rebels it at these years ?
i say my daughter is my flesh and blood .
but tell us , do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at sea or no ?
well , we will leave you then till dinnertime .
i must be one of these same dumb wise men , for gratiano never lets me speak .
i ’ ll grow a talker for this gear .
is that any thing now ?
gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all venice .
let him look to his bond .
he was wont to call me usurer ; let him look to his bond .
he was wont to lend money for a christian courtesy ; let him look to his bond .
why , i am sure , if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh .
what ’ s that good for ?
hath not a jew eyes ?
hath not a jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?
if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
if you poison us , do we not die ?
and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?
if we are like you in the rest , we will resemble you in that .
if a jew wrong a christian , what is his humility ?
we have been up and down to seek him .
here comes another of the tribe .
a third can not be matched unless the devil himself turn jew .
hast thou found my daughter ?
i often came where i did hear of her , but can not find her .
why , there , there , there , there !
i never felt it till now—two thousand ducats in that , and other precious , precious jewels .
i would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear !
would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin !
and i know not what ’ s spent in the search .
why thou , loss upon loss !
yes , other men have ill luck too .
antonio , as i heard in genoa— what , what , what ?
ill luck , ill luck ?
hath an argosy cast away coming from tripolis .
i thank god , i thank god !
is ’ t true , is ’ t true ?
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack .
i thank thee , good tubal .
good news , good news !
ha , ha , heard in genoa .
your daughter spent in genoa , as i heard , in one night fourscore ducats .
thou stickest a dagger in me .
i shall never see my gold again .
fourscore ducats at a sitting !
i am very glad of it .
i ’ ll plague him .
i ’ ll torture him .
i am glad of it .
one of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey .
thou torturest me , tubal .
i had it of leah when i was a bachelor .
i would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys .
but antonio is certainly undone .
nay , that ’ s true , that ’ s very true .
at our synagogue , tubal .
before you hazard , for in choosing wrong i lose your company .
there may as well be amity and life 'tween snow and fire , as treason and my love .
promise me life , and i ’ ll confess the truth .
well then , confess and live .
confess and love ” had been the very sum of my confession .
but let me to my fortune and the caskets .
i am locked in one of them .
if you do love me you will find me out.— nerissa and the rest , stand all aloof .
let music sound while he doth make his choice .
then if he lose he makes a swanlike end , fading in music .
he may win , and what is music then ?
live thou , i live .
with much , much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray .
ding , dong , bell .
therefore then , thou gaudy gold , hard food for midas , i will none of thee .
since this fortune falls to you , be content and seek no new .
fair lady , by your leave , i come by note to give and to receive .
you see me , lord bassanio , where i stand such as i am .
happier than this— she is not bred so dull but she can learn .
myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted .
but now i was the lord of this fair mansion , master of my servants , queen o'er myself .
i pray you , good bassanio , let me know it .
i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence .
i owe you much , and , like a willful youth , that which i owe is lost .
you know me well , and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance .
o , then be bold to say bassanio ’ s dead !
with all my heart , so thou canst get a wife .
i thank your lordship , you have got me one .
what , and stake down ?
what , and my old venetian friend salerio ?
so do i , my lord .
and i have reason for it .
signor antonio commends him to you .
ere i ope his letter , i pray you tell me how my good friend doth .
not sick , my lord , unless it be in mind , nor well , unless in mind .
his letter there will show you his estate .
there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the color from bassanio ’ s cheek .
o sweet portia , here are a few of the unpleasant ’ st words that ever blotted paper .
i was a gentleman , and then i told you true .
have all his ventures failed ?
what , not one hit ?
not one , my lord .
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble ?
what sum owes he the jew ?
for me , three thousand ducats .
pay him six thousand and deface the bond !
you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over .
when it is paid , bring your true friend along .
my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows .
bid your friends welcome , show a merry cheer .
but let me hear the letter of your friend .
sweet bassanio , my ships have all miscarried .
my estate is very low .
my bond to the jew is forfeit .
notwithstanding , use your pleasure .
since i have your good leave to go away , i will make haste .
jailer , look to him .
this is the fool that lent out money gratis .
jailer , look to him .
hear me yet , good shylock .
i pray thee , hear me speak .
i ’ ll have my bond .
i will not hear thee speak .
i ’ ll have my bond , and therefore speak no more .
i ’ ll have no speaking .
i will have my bond .
it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men .
i ’ ll follow him no more with bootless prayers .
his reason well i know .
i oft delivered from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me .
i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold .
madam , with all my heart .
i shall obey you in all fair commands .
so fare you well till we shall meet again .
fare you well , jessica .
now , balthazar , as i have ever found thee honest true , so let me find thee still .
sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages .
her name is portia , nothing undervalued to cato ’ s daughter , brutus ' portia .
i shall be there before thee .
madam , i go with all convenient speed .
come on , nerissa , i have work in hand that you yet know not of .
we ’ ll see our husbands before they think of us .
i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice .
why , shall we turn to men ?
fie , what a question ’ s that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter !
and therefore haste away , for we must measure twenty miles today .
therefore i promise ye i fear you .
i was always plain with you , and so now i speak my agitation of the matter .
therefore be o ' good cheer , for truly i think you are damned .
and what hope is that , i pray thee ?
that were a kind of bastard hope indeed .
so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother .
thus when i shun scylla your father , i fall into charybdis your mother .
well , you are gone both ways .
i shall be saved by my husband .
he hath made me a christian .
truly , the more to blame he .
we were christians eno ' before , e'en as many as could well live one by another .
this making christians will raise the price of hogs .
i ’ ll tell my husband , launcelot , what you say .
i shall grow jealous of you shortly , launcelot , if you thus get my wife into corners .
nay , you need not fear us , lorenzo .
launcelot and i are out .
it is much that the moor should be more than reason .
that is done , sir .
goodly lord , what a wit-snapper are you !
wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant ?
for the table , sir , it shall be served in .
for the meat , sir , it shall be covered .
o dear discretion , how his words are suited !
how cheerest thou , jessica ?
how dost thou like the lord bassanio ’ s wife ?
and if on earth he do not merit it , in reason he should never come to heaven .
even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife .
first let us go to dinner .
nay , let me praise you while i have a stomach .
no , pray thee , let it serve for table talk .
what , is antonio here ?
ready , so please your grace .
i am sorry for thee .
i have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify his rigorous course .
go , one , and call the jew into the court .
he is ready at the door .
he comes , my lord .
we all expect a gentle answer , jew .
if you deny it , let the danger light upon your charter and your city ’ s freedom .
i ’ ll not answer that but say it is my humour .
what , are you answered yet ?
this is no answer , thou unfeeling man , to excuse the current of thy cruelty .
i am not bound to please thee with my answers .
do all men kill the things they do not love ?
what , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ?
i would have my bond .
how shalt thou hope for mercy , rendering none ?
what judgment shall i dread , doing no wrong ?
shall i say to you , “ let them be free !
marry them to your heirs !
why sweat they under burdens ?
let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be seasoned with such viands ” ?
you will answer , “ the slaves are ours. ” so do i answer you .
the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought .
tis mine and i will have it .
if you deny me , fie upon your law— there is no force in the decrees of venice .
by my troth , nerissa , my little body is aweary of this great world .
it is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean .
good sentences , and well pronounced .
they would be better if well followed .
it is a good divine that follows his own instructions .
but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband .
is it not hard , nerissa , that i can not choose one nor refuse none ?
what , man , courage yet !
i am a tainted wether of the flock , meetest for death .
the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground , and so let me .
you can not better be employed , bassanio , than to live still and write mine epitaph .
came you from padua , from bellario ?
from both , my lord .
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .
not on thy sole , but on thy soul , harsh jew , thou makest thy knife keen .
but no metal can— no , not the hangman ’ s axe—bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy .
can no prayers pierce thee ?
no , none that thou hast wit enough to make .
repair thy wit , good youth , or it will fall to cureless ruin .
i stand here for law .
this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learnèd doctor to our court .
he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether you ’ ll admit him .
come you from old bellario ?
i did , my lord .
are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court ?
i am informèd thoroughly of the cause .
antonio and old shylock , both stand forth .
do you confess the bond ?
then must the jew be merciful .
on what compulsion must i ?
the quality of mercy is not strained .
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath .
it is twice blessed : it blesseth him that gives and him that takes .
tis mightiest in the mightiest .
it becomes the thronèd monarch better than his crown .
and earthly power doth then show likest god ’ s when mercy seasons justice .
my deeds upon my head .
i crave the law , the penalty , and forfeit of my bond .
is he not able to discharge the money ?
there is no power in venice can alter a decree establishèd .
i pray you , let me look upon the bond .
shylock , there ’ s thrice thy money offered thee .
an oath , an oath , i have an oath in heaven .
shall i lay perjury upon my soul ?
no , not for venice .
bid me tear the bond .
when it is paid according to the tenor .
it doth appear you are a worthy judge .
i charge you by the law , whereof you are a well-deserving pillar , proceed to judgment .
by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me .
i stay here on my bond .
most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment .
why then , thus it is : you must prepare your bosom for his knife .
o wise and upright judge !
how much more elder art thou than thy looks !
nearest his heart ” —those are the very words .
are there balance here to weigh the flesh ?
is it so nominated in the bond ?
it is not so expressed , but what of that ?
twere good you do so much for charity .
i can not find it .
tis not in the bond .
i am armed and well prepared.— give me your hand , bassanio .
repent but you that you shall lose your friend , and he repents not that he pays your debt .
antonio , i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself .
but life itself , my wife , and all the world are not with me esteemed above thy life .
i would lose all—ay , sacrifice them all here to this devil—to deliver you .
your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer .
i have a wife , whom i protest i love .
i would she were in heaven , so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew .
tis well you offer it behind her back .
these be the christian husbands .
the court awards it , and the law doth give it .
and you must cut this flesh from off his breast .
the law allows it , and the court awards it .
most learnèd judge , a sentence !
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood .
thyself shalt see the act .
for as thou urgest justice , be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest .
i take this offer then : pay the bond thrice and let the christian go .
the jew shall have all justice .
he shall have nothing but the penalty .
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh .
a second daniel ! —a daniel , jew !
now , infidel , i have you on the hip .
why doth the jew pause ?
give me my principal , and let me go .
i have it ready for thee .
your father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations .
i pray thee , overname them .
first , there is the neapolitan prince .
i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith .
then there is the county palatine .
god defend me from these two !
how say you by the french lord , monsieur le bon ?
he hath refused it in the open court .
he shall have merely justice and his bond .
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril , jew .
why then , the devil give him good of it !
i ’ ll stay no longer question .
the law hath yet another hold on you .
down , therefore , and beg mercy of the duke .
therefore thou must be hanged at the state ’ s charge .
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it .
for half thy wealth , it is antonio ’ s .
the other half comes to the general state , which humbleness may drive unto a fine .
ay , for the state , not for antonio .
nay , take my life and all .
you take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house .
you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live .
what mercy can you render him , antonio ?
a halter gratis , nothing else , for god ’ s sake .
he shall do this , or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronouncèd here .
art thou contented , jew ?
i pray you , give me leave to go from hence .
send the deed after me , and i will sign it .
get thee gone , but do it .
i must away this night toward padua , and it is meet i presently set forth .
and stand indebted , over and above , in love and service to you evermore .
he is well paid that is well satisfied .
and i , delivering you , am satisfied , and therein do account myself well paid .
my mind was never yet more mercenary .
i pray you , know me when we meet again .
i wish you well , and so i take my leave .
take some remembrance of us as a tribute , not as a fee .
this ring , good sir—alas , it is a trifle .
i will not shame myself to give you this .
i will have nothing else but only this .
and now methinks i have a mind to it .
there ’ s more depends on this than on the value .
the dearest ring in venice will i give you , and find it out by proclamation .
only for this , i pray you , pardon me .
i see , sir , you are liberal in offers .
you taught me first to beg , and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered .
good sir , this ring was given me by my wife .
that ’ scuse serves many men to save their gifts .
well , peace be with you .
my lord bassanio , let him have the ring .
come , you and i will thither presently .
and in the morning early will we both fly toward belmont .
inquire the jew ’ s house out .
give him this deed , and let him sign it .
we ’ ll away tonight , and be a day before our husbands home .
this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo .
furthermore , i pray you show my youth old shylock ’ s house .
thou know ’ st where i will tarry .
but , hark , i hear the footing of a man .
who comes so fast in silence of the night ?
your name , i pray you , friend ?
she doth stray about by holy crosses , where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours .
none but a holy hermit and her maid .
i pray you , is my master yet returned ?
wo , ha , ho !
did you see master lorenzo ?
tell him there ’ s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news .
my master will be here ere morning .
sweet soul , let ’ s in , and there expect their coming .
god made him and therefore let him pass for a man .
what say you then to falconbridge , the young baron of england ?
you know i say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor i him .
he is a proper man ’ s picture , but alas , who can converse with a dumb show ?
how oddly he is suited !
what think you of the scottish lord , his neighbor ?
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears .
soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony .
look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold .
come ho , and wake diana with a hymn !
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ' ear , and draw her home with music .
i am never merry when i hear sweet music .
the motions of his spirit are dull as night , and his affections dark as erebus .
let no such man be trusted .
that light we see is burning in my hall .
how far that little candle throws his beams !
so shines a good deed in a naughty world .
when the moon shone we did not see the candle .
so doth the greater glory dim the less .
it is your music , madam , of the house .
nothing is good , i see , without respect .
how many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection !
how the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked .
that is the voice , or i am much deceived , of portia .
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo— by the bad voice .
dear lady , welcome home .
this night methinks is but the daylight sick .
it looks a little paler .
tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid .
i thank you , madam .
give welcome to my friend .
this is the man , this is antonio , to whom i am so infinitely bound .
sir , you are very welcome to our house .
it must appear in other ways than words , therefore i scant this breathing courtesy .
a quarrel , ho , already ?
what ’ s the matter ?
gave it a judge ’ s clerk !
he will , an if he live to be a man .
ay , if a woman live to be a man .
i could not for my heart deny it him .
i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it .
now in faith , gratiano , you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief .
an ’ twere to me , i should be mad at it .
my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that begged it and indeed deserved it too .
and then the boy , his clerk , that took some pains in writing , he begged mine .
and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings .
what ring gave you my lord ?
not that , i hope , which you received of me .
if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it .
but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it .
nerissa teaches me what to believe .
i ’ ll die for ’ t but some woman had the ring .
what should i say , sweet lady ?
i was enforced to send it after him .
let not that doctor e'er come near my house !
know him i shall , i am well sure of it .
lie not a night from home .
i am th ' unhappy subject of these quarrels .
sir , grieve not you .
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself— in each eye , one .
swear by your double self , and there ’ s an oath of credit !
nay , but hear me .
pardon this fault , and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee .
by heaven , it is the same i gave the doctor !
i had it of him .
what , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?
speak not so grossly.—you are all amazed .
ay , but the clerk that never means to do it unless he live until he be a man .
sweet lady , you have given me life and living .
how like you the young german , the duke of saxony ’ s nephew ?
i will do any thing , nerissa , ere i ’ ll be married to a sponge .
you need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords .
and i pray god grant them a fair departure .
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you .
ay , and i ’ ll give them him without a fee .
fair ladies , you drop manna in the way of starvèd people .
it is almost morning , and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full .
let us go in , and charge us there upon interr'gatories , and we will answer all things faithfully .
i remember him well , and i remember him worthy of thy praise .
how now , what news ?
the four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave .
three thousand ducats , well .
ay , sir , for three months .
for three months , well .
for the which , as i told you , antonio shall be bound .
antonio shall become bound , well .
shall i know your answer ?
three thousand ducats for three months , and antonio bound .
antonio is a good man .
have you heard any imputation to the contrary ?
yet his means are in supposition .
he hath an argosy bound to tripolis , another to the indies .
but ships are but boards , sailors but men .
the man is notwithstanding sufficient .
in sooth , i know not why i am so sad .
it wearies me ; you say it wearies you .
and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad .
shylock , do you hear ?
tubal , a wealthy hebrew of my tribe , will furnish me .
how many months do you desire ?
ay , ay , three thousand ducats .
i do never use it .
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ?
oh , what a goodly outside falsehood hath !
three months from twelve , then .
the rate— well , shylock , shall we be beholding to you ?
well then , it now appears you need my help .
what should i say to you ?
should i not say , “ hath a dog money ?
why , look you how you storm !
this is kind i offer .
this kindness will i show .
i ’ ll seal to such a bond , and say there is much kindness in the jew .
you shall not seal to such a bond for me !
i ’ ll rather dwell in my necessity .
if he will take it , so .
and for my love i pray you wrong me not .
yes , shylock , i will seal unto this bond .
then meet me forthwith at the notary ’ s .
hie thee , gentle jew .
my ships come home a month before the day .
i would not change this hue except to steal your thoughts , my gentle queen .
even for that i thank you .
therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets to try my fortune .
but , alas the while !
come , bring me unto my chance .
first , forward to the temple .
after dinner your hazard shall be made .
certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this jew , my master .
budge not , ” says my conscience .
the fiend gives the more friendly counsel .
i will run , fiend .
master young man , you , i pray you , which is the way to master jew ’ s ?
master young gentleman , i pray you , which is the way to master jew ’ s ?
by god ’ s sonties , ’ twill be a hard way to hit .
can you tell me whether one launcelot that dwells with him , dwell with him or no ?
talk you of young master launcelot ?
no “ master , ” sir , but a poor man ’ s son .
your worship ’ s friend and launcelot , sir .
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .
why then , you are in love .
the boy was the very staff of my age , my very prop .
do i look like a cudgel or a hovel-post , a staff or a prop ?
do you know me , father ?
alack the day , i know you not , young gentleman .
do you not know me , father ?
alack , sir , i am sand-blind .
nay , indeed if you had your eyes , you might fail of the knowing me .
it is a wise father that knows his own child .
well , old man , i will tell you news of your son .
pray you , sir , stand up .
i am sure you are not launcelot , my boy .
pray you , let ’ s have no more fooling about it , but give me your blessing .
i am launcelot , your boy that was , your son that is , your child that shall be .
i can not think you are my son .
her name is margery , indeed .
i ’ ll be sworn , if thou be launcelot , thou art mine own flesh and blood .
it should seem then that dobbin ’ s tail grows backward .
lord , how art thou changed !
how dost thou and thy master agree ?
i have brought him a present .
my master ’ s a very jew .
i am famished in his service .
you may tell every finger i have with my ribs .
father , i am glad you are come .
give me your present to one master bassanio , who indeed gives rare new liveries .
wouldst thou aught with me ?
that is the very defect of the matter , sir .
thou hast obtained thy suit .
my best endeavours shall be done herein .
yonder , sir , he walks .
i have a suit to you .
you must not deny me .
i must go with you to belmont .
why , then you must .
but hear thee , gratiano .
signor bassanio , hear me .
well , we shall see your bearing .
nay , but i bar tonight .
you shall not gauge me by what we do tonight .
i am sorry thou wilt leave my father so .
and launcelot , soon at supper shalt thou see lorenzo , who is thy new master ’ s guest .
if a christian do not play the knave and get thee , i am much deceived .
these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit .
alack , what heinous sin is it in me to be ashamed to be my father ’ s child !
but though i am a daughter to his blood , i am not to his manners .
we have not made good preparation .
we have not spoke us yet of torchbearers .
tis vile , unless it may be quaintly ordered , and better in my mind not undertook .
tis now but four o'clock .
we have two hours to furnish us .
friend launcelot , what ’ s the news ?
love news , in faith ?
meet me and gratiano at gratiano ’ s lodging some hour hence .
tis good we do so .
was not that letter from fair jessica ?
your worth is very dear in my regard .
i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace th ' occasion to depart .
good signors both , when shall we laugh ?
my lord bassanio , since you have found antonio , we two will leave you .
i will not fail you .
i must needs tell thee all .
i do not bid thee call .
your worship was wont to tell me that i could do nothing without bidding .
i am bid forth to supper , jessica .
there are my keys.—but wherefore should i go ?
i am not bid for love .
i am right loath to go .
there is some ill a-brewing towards my rest , for i did dream of money bags tonight .
i beseech you , sir , go .
my young master doth expect your reproach .
and they have conspired together .
what , are there masques ?
by jacob ’ s staff , i swear , i have no mind of feasting forth tonight .
i will go before , sir.— mistress , look out at window , for all this .
what says that fool of hagar ’ s offspring , ha ?
his words were , “ farewell , mistress. ” nothing else .
drones hive not with me .
well , jessica , go in .
perhaps i will return immediately .
do as i bid you .
fast bind , fast find .
this is the penthouse under which lorenzo desired us to make stand .
his hour is almost past .
and it is marvel he outdwells his hour , for lovers ever run before the clock .
who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down ?
all things that are , are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed .
sweet friends , your patience for my long abode .
not i but my affairs have made you wait .
tell me for more certainty , albeit i ’ ll swear that i do know your tongue .
lorenzo , and thy love .
lorenzo certain , and my love indeed— for who love i so much ?
and now who knows but you , lorenzo , whether i am yours ?
heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art .
here , catch this casket .
it is worth the pains .
descend , for you must be my torchbearer .
what , must i hold a candle to my shames ?
i will make fast the doors and gild myself with some more ducats , and be with you straight .
now , by my hood , a gentle and no jew .
beshrew me but i love her heartily .
for she is wise , if i can judge of her .
and fair she is , if that mine eyes be true .
and true she is , as she hath proved herself .
and therefore , like herself—wise , fair and true— shall she be placèd in my constant soul .
what , art thou come ? —on , gentlemen , away !
our masquing mates by this time for us stay .
our friends all stay for you .
i have sent twenty out to seek for you .
i am glad on ’ t .
i desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight .
the one of them contains my picture , prince .
if you choose that , then i am yours withal .
some god direct my judgment !
i will survey th ' inscriptions back again .
what says this leaden casket ?
who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath. ” must give—for what ?
men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages .
a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross .
i ’ ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead .
what says the silver with her virgin hue ?
what if i strayed no further , but chose here ?
all the world desires her .
from the four corners of the earth they come to kiss this shrine , this mortal breathing saint .
one of these three contains her heavenly picture .
is ’ t like that lead contains her ?
twere damnation to think so base a thought .
it were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave .
or shall i think in silver she ’ s immured , being ten times undervalued to tried gold ?
never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold .
you look not well , signor antonio .
you have too much respect upon the world .
and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans .
i ’ ll tell thee more of this another time .
i ’ ll end my exhortation after dinner .
lies all within.—deliver me the key .
here do i choose , and thrive i as i may !
there , take it , prince .
o hell , what have we here ?
a carrion death , within whose empty eye there is a written scroll .
i ’ ll read the writing .
all that glisters is not gold— often have you heard that told .
many a man his life hath sold but my outside to behold .
gilded tombs do worms enfold .
i have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave .
a gentle riddance.—draw the curtains , go.— let all of his complexion choose me so .
why , man , i saw bassanio under sail .
with him is gratiano gone along .
and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not .
the villain jew with outcries raised the duke , who went with him to search bassanio ’ s ship .
the ship was under sail .
besides , antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship .
o my daughter , fled with a christian !
justice , find the girl !
let good antonio look he keep his day , or he shall pay for this .
you were best to tell antonio what you hear— yet do not suddenly , for it may grieve him .
i saw bassanio and antonio part .
bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return .
i think he only loves the world for him .
the prince of arragon hath ta'en his oath and comes to his election presently .
behold , there stand the caskets , noble prince .
if you choose that wherein i am contained , straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized .
but if you fail , without more speech , my lord , you must be gone from hence immediately .
to these injunctions every one doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self .
and so have i addressed me .
fortune now to my heart ’ s hope !
gold , silver , and base lead .
what says the golden chest ?
ha , let me see .
and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend ?
it is not friendly , ’ tis not maidenly .
it seems that you scorn me .
have you not set lysander , as in scorn , to follow me and praise my eyes and face ?
wherefore speaks he this to her he hates ?
this you should pity rather than despise .
i understand not what you mean by this .
if you have any pity , grace , or manners , you would not make me such an argument .
tis partly my own fault , which death or absence soon shall remedy .
my love , my life , my soul , fair helena !
thou canst compel no more than she entreat .
thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.— helen , i love thee .
by my life , i do .
i say i love thee more than he can do .
if thou say so , withdraw and prove it too .
lysander , whereto tends all this ?
why are you grown so rude ?
out , tawny tartar , out !
o hated potion , hence !
yes , sooth , and so do you .
demetrius , i will keep my word with thee .
i would i had your bond , for i perceive a weak bond holds you .
i ’ ll not trust your word .
although i hate her , i ’ ll not harm her so .
ay , by my life , and never did desire to see thee more .
therefore be out of hope , of question , of doubt .
be certain , nothing truer .
fine , i ' faith !
have you no modesty , no maiden shame , no touch of bashfulness ?
why so ? —ay , that way goes the game .
how low am i , thou painted maypole ?
good hermia , do not be so bitter with me .
for love i followed him .
you see how simple and how fond i am .
why , get you gone !
who is ’ t that hinders you ?
a foolish heart , that i leave here behind .
she shall not harm thee , helena .
she was a vixen when she went to school .
and though she be but little , she is fierce .
let me come to her .
what cheer , my love ? — demetrius and egeus , go along .
with duty and desire we follow you .
how now , my love ?
why is your cheek so pale ?
how chance the roses there do fade so fast ?
belike for want of rain , which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes .
but either it was different in blood—
for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her , thou shalt aby it .
now she holds me not .
nay , i ’ ll go with thee , cheek by jowl .
you , mistress , all this coil is long of you .
nay , go not back .
i am amazed and know not what to say .
believe me , king of shadows , i mistook .
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garment he had on ?
and so far blameless proves my enterprise , that i have 'nointed an athenian ’ s eyes .
and so far am i glad it so did sort , as this their jangling i esteem a sport .
thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight .
hie therefore , robin , overcast the night .
my fairy lord , this must be done with haste .
but we are spirits of another sort .
we may effect this business yet ere day .
up and down , up and down , i will lead them up and down .
i am feared in field and town .
goblin , lead them up and down .
where art thou , proud demetrius ?
thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ?
where dost thou hide thy head ?
yea , art thou there ?
he goes before me and still dares me on .
when i come where he calls , then he is gone .
and here will rest me .
nay , then , thou mock ’ st me .
thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see .
o weary night , o long and tedious night , abate thy hours .
two of both kinds make up four .
here she comes , cursed and sad .
cupid is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad .
here will i rest me till the break of day .
heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray !
on the ground sleep sound .
scratch my head , peaseblossom .
where ’ s monsieur cobweb ?
do not fret yourself too much in the action , monsieur .
and good monsieur , have a care the honey bag break not .
i would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag , signor .
where ’ s monsieur mustardseed ?
give me your neaf , monsieur mustardseed .
pray you , leave your courtesy , good monsieur .
what ’ s your will ?
nothing , good monsieur , but to help cavalery cobweb to scratch .
i must to the barber ’ s , monsieur , for methinks i am marvelous hairy about the face .
and i am such a tender ass , if my hair do but tickle me , i must scratch .
what , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ?
i have a reasonable good ear in music .
let ’ s have the tongs and the bones .
or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat .
truly , a peck of provender .
i could munch your good dry oats .
methinks i have a great desire to a bottle of hay .
good hay , sweet hay , hath no fellow .
i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel ’ s hoard and fetch thee new nuts .
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
but , i pray you , let none of your people stir me .
i have an exposition of sleep come upon me .
sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms .
oh , how i love thee !
how i dote on thee !
seest thou this sweet sight ?
her dotage now i do begin to pity .
and now i have the boy , i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes .
but first i will release the fairy queen .
now , my titania , wake you , my sweet queen .
how came these things to pass ?
oh , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now !
music such as charmeth sleep !
too old to be engaged to young .
so quick bright things come to confusion .
if then true lovers have been ever crossed , it stands as an edict in destiny .
therefore , hear me , hermia .
i have a widow aunt , a dowager of great revenue , and she hath no child .
from athens is her house remote seven leagues , and she respects me as her only son .
there , gentle hermia , may i marry thee .
and to that place the sharp athenian law can not pursue us .
fairy king , attend , and mark .
i do hear the morning lark .
then , my queen , in silence sad , trip we after the night ’ s shade .
go , one of you , find out the forester .
uncouple in the western valley .
dispatch , i say , and find the forester .
the skies , the fountains , every region near seemed all one mutual cry .
i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder .
i wonder of their being here together .
is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice ?
it is , my lord .
go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns .
begin these woodbirds but to couple now ?
i pray you all , stand up .
my lord , i shall reply amazèdly , half sleep , half waking .
but as yet , i swear , i can not truly say how i came here .
to her , my lord , was i betrothed ere i saw hermia .
fair lovers , you are fortunately met .
of this discourse we more will hear anon.— egeus , i will overbear your will .
away with us to athens .
three and three , we ’ ll hold a feast in great solemnity .
are you sure that we are awake ?
it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream .
and he did bid us follow to the temple .
why then , we are awake .
it shall be called “ bottom ’ s dream ” because it hath no bottom .
and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke .
peradventure , to make it the more gracious , i shall sing it at her death .
have you sent to bottom ’ s house ?
is he come home yet ?
he can not be heard of .
out of doubt he is transported .
if he come not , then the play is marred .
no , he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens .
yea , and the best person too .
and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice .
if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men .
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life .
he could not have ’ scaped sixpence a day .
an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus , i ’ ll be hanged .
he would have deserved it .
i will tell you everything , right as it fell out .
let us hear , sweet bottom .
not a word of me .
all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined .
get your apparel together , good strings to your beards , new ribbons to your pumps .
meet presently at the palace .
every man look o'er his part .
and most dear actors , eat no onions nor garlic , for we are to utter sweet breath .
tis strange , my theseus , that these lovers speak of .
i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys .
the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact .
here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth.— joy , gentle friends !
where is our usual manager of mirth ?
what revels are in hand ?
what masque , what music ?
how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight ?
look , here comes helena .
call you me “ fair ” ?
that “ fair ” again unsay .
tedious ” and “ brief ” ?
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow .
how shall we find the concord of this discord ?
for in all the play there is not one word apt , one player fitted .
for pyramus therein doth kill himself .
what are they that do play it ?
and we will hear it .
no , my noble lord .
it is not for you .
i will hear that play .
go , bring them in.—and take your places , ladies .
why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .
he says they can do nothing in this kind .
love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most , to my capacity .
so please your grace , the prologue is addressed .
if we offend , it is with our good will .
that you should think we come not to offend , but with good will .
consider then we come but in despite .
we do not come as minding to contest you , our true intent is .
all for your delight we are not here .
this fellow doth not stand upon points .
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt .
he knows not the stop .
a good moral , my lord : it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .
his speech was like a tangled chain .
i wonder if the lion be to speak .
no wonder , my lord .
would you desire lime and hair to speak better ?
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse , my lord .
pyramus draws near the wall .
jove shield thee well for this !
no thisbe do i see .
o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss !
cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !
the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .
now will i to the chink , to spy an i can hear my thisbe ’ s face .
my love thou art , my love , i think .
think what thou wilt , i am thy lover ’ s grace .
wilt thou at ninny ’ s tomb meet me straightway ?
tide life , tide death , i come without delay .
thus have i , wall , my part dischargèd so .
and , being done , thus wall away doth go .
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard .
the best in this kind are but shadows , and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them .
it must be your imagination then , and not theirs .
here come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .
a very gentle beast , of a good conscience .
this lion is a very fox , for his valor .
and a goose for his discretion .
not so , my lord .
for his valor can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .
leave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .
this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present .
the man should be put into the lanthorn .
how is it else the “ man i ' th ' moon ” ?
he dares not come there for the candle .
for you see , it is already in snuff .
i am aweary of this moon .
why , all these should be in the lanthorn , for all these are in the moon.—but silence !
this is old ninny ’ s tomb .
well shone , moon ! —truly , the moon shines with a good grace .
o , teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius ' heart .
i frown upon him , yet he loves me still .
oh , that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !
i give him curses , yet he gives me love .
oh , that my prayers could such affection move !
the more i hate , the more he follows me .
the more i love , the more he hateth me .
his folly , helena , is no fault of mine .
none , but your beauty .
would that fault were mine !
he no more shall see my face .
lysander and myself will fly this place .
before the time i did lysander see seemed athens as a paradise to me .
helen , to you our minds we will unfold .
and so the lion vanished .
sweet moon , i thank thee for thy sunny beams .
but mark , poor knight , what dreadful dole is here !
eyes , do you see ?
o fates , come , come , cut thread and thrum .
quail , crush , conclude , and quell !
o wherefore , nature , didst thou lions frame ?
thus die i , thus , thus , thus .
now die , die , die , die , die .
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .
methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus .
i hope she will be brief .
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .
and thus she means , videlicet— asleep , my love ?
what , dead , my dove ?
a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes .
these lily lips , this cherry nose , these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone , are gone .
his eyes were green as leeks .
o sisters three , come , come to me with hands as pale as milk .
lay them in gore , since you have shore with shears his thread of silk .
tongue , not a word .
come , blade , my breast imbrue .
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead .
ay , and wall too .
no epilogue , i pray you , for your play needs no excuse .
never excuse—for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed .
and so it is , truly , and very notably discharged .
but come , your bergomask .
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve .
sweet friends , to bed .
through the house give glimmering light , by the dead and drowsy fire .
first , rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note .
hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place .
if you pardon , we will mend .
else the puck a liar call .
so good night unto you all .
give me your hands if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends .
there my lysander and myself shall meet .
and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies .
we must starve our sight from lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight .
i will , my hermia .
as you on him , demetrius dote on you !
he will not know what all but he do know .
things base and vile , holding no quantity , love can transpose to form and dignity .
love looks not with the eyes but with the mind .
and therefore is winged cupid painted blind .
nor hath love ’ s mind of any judgment taste— wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste .
and therefore is love said to be a child , because in choice he is so oft beguiled .
then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her .
is all our company here ?
answer as i call you.—nick bottom , the weaver ?
name what part i am for and proceed .
you , nick bottom , are set down for pyramus .
i will condole in some measure.—to the rest.—yet my chief humor is for a tyrant .
i could play ercles rarely , or a part to tear a cat in to make all split .
a lover is more condoling .
francis flute , the bellows-mender ?
it is the lady that pyramus must love .
nay , faith , let me not play a woman .
i have a beard coming .
that ’ s all one .
you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .
an i may hide my face , let me play thisbe too !
you must play pyramus.—and flute , you thisbe .
robin starveling , the tailor ?
robin starveling , you must play thisbe ’ s mother.—tom snout , the tinker ?
have you the lion ’ s part written ?
pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study .
let me play the lion too .
and that were enough to hang us all .
that would hang us , every mother ’ s son .
therefore you must needs play pyramus .
well , i will undertake it .
what beard were i best to play it in ?
why , what you will .
four days will quickly steep themselves in night .
four nights will quickly dream away the time .
turn melancholy forth to funerals .
the pale companion is not for our pomp .
but i will wed thee in another key , with pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .
happy be theseus , our renownèd duke .
in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants .
i pray you , fail me not .
we will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .
at the duke ’ s oak we meet .
hold , or cut bowstrings .
i do wander everywhere swifter than the moon ’ s sphere .
and i serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green .
the cowslips tall her pensioners be .
in those freckles live their savors .
i must go seek some dewdrops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip ’ s ear .
farewell , thou lob of spirits .
i ’ ll be gone .
our queen and all our elves come here anon .
and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild .
but she perforce withholds the lovèd boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy .
thou speak ’ st aright .
i am that merry wanderer of the night .
but , room , fairy !
would that he were gone !
what , jealous oberon ? —fairies , skip hence .
i have forsworn his bed and company .
why art thou here , come from the farthest step of india ?
how canst thou thus for shame , titania , knowing i know thy love to theseus ?
and make him with fair ægles break his faith , with ariadne and antiopa ?
these are the forgeries of jealousy .
the fold stands empty in the drownèd field , and crows are fatted with the murrain flock .
and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate , from our dissension .
we are their parents and original .
do you amend it then .
why should titania cross her oberon ?
i do but beg a little changeling boy , to be my henchman .
set your heart at rest .
the fairyland buys not the child of me .
how long within this wood intend you stay ?
perchance till after theseus ' wedding day .
if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels , go with us .
if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts .
give me that boy and i will go with thee .
not for thy fairy kingdom.—fairies , away !
we shall chide downright , if i longer stay .
well , go thy way .
thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury.— my gentle puck , come hither .
yet marked i where the bolt of cupid fell .
it fell upon a little western flower , before milk-white , now purple with love ’ s wound .
and maidens call it “ love-in-idleness. ” fetch me that flower .
the herb i showed thee once .
fetch me this herb , and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league .
i ’ ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes .
i love thee not , therefore pursue me not .
where is lysander and fair hermia ?
the one i ’ ll stay , the other stayeth me .
thou told ’ st me they were stol ' n unto this wood .
and here am i , and wood within this wood , because i can not meet my hermia .
hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .
you draw me , you hard-hearted adamant .
but yet you draw not iron , for my heart is true as steel .
leave you your power to draw , and i shall have no power to follow you .
do i speak you fair ?
and even for that do i love you the more .
and , demetrius , the more you beat me , i will fawn on you .
use me but as your spaniel—spurn me , strike me , neglect me , lose me .
only give me leave , unworthy as i am , to follow you .
for i am sick when i do look on thee .
and i am sick when i look not on you .
your virtue is my privilege .
nor doth this wood lack worlds of company , for you in my respect are all the world .
then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me ?
the wildest hath not such a heart as you .
or if thou follow me , do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood .
ay , in the temple , in the town , the field you do me mischief .
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex .
we can not fight for love as men may do .
fare thee well , nymph .
ere he do leave this grove , thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love .
hast thou the flower there ?
ay , there it is .
i pray thee , give it me .
what ’ s the news with thee ?
what say you , hermia ?
demetrius is a worthy gentleman .
there sleeps titania sometime of the night , lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .
and there the snake throws her enameled skin , weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
and with the juice of this i ’ ll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies .
fear not , my lord .
your servant shall do so .
what thou seest when thou dost wake , do it for thy true love take .
wake when some vile thing is near .
be it so , lysander .
find you out a bed , for i upon this bank will rest my head .
one heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .
do not lie so near .
i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it .
then by your side no bed room me deny .
and , good night , sweet friend .
thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end !
amen , amen to that fair prayer , say i .
stay , though thou kill me , sweet demetrius .
i charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .
o , wilt thou darkling leave me ?
stay , on thy peril .
oh , i am out of breath in this fond chase .
the more my prayer , the lesser is my grace .
happy is hermia , wheresoe'er she lies , for she hath blessèd and attractive eyes .
how came her eyes so bright ?
if so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers .
therefore no marvel though demetrius do , as a monster , fly my presence thus .
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia ’ s sphery eyne ?
do not say so , lysander .
what though he love your hermia ?
i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent .
not hermia but helena i love .
things growing are not ripe until their season .
so i , being young , till now ripe not to reason .
perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness .
oh , that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused !
and here ’ s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .
peter quince— what sayest thou , bully bottom ?
there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never please .
first , pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies can not abide .
i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .
i have a device to make all well .
this will put them out of fear .
we will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .
no , make it two more .
let it be written in eight and eight .
will not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?
i fear it , i promise you .
for there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living .
therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .
for , you know , pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight .
but in this kind , wanting your father ’ s voice , the other must be held the worthier .
i would my father looked but with my eyes .
rather your eyes must with his judgment look .
i do entreat your grace to pardon me .
therefore , fair hermia , question your desires .
doth the moon shine that night we play our play ?
a calendar , a calendar !
find out moonshine , find out moonshine !
what say you , bottom ?
and let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe whisper .
if that may be then all is well .
come , sit down , every mother ’ s son , and rehearse your parts.—pyramus , you begin .
when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake.—and so everyone according to his cue .
speak , pyramus.—thisbe , stand forth .
ay , marry , must you .
ninus ' tomb , ” man .
why , you must not speak that yet .
you speak all your part at once , cues and all.—pyramus , enter .
it is “ never tire. ” oh .
i ’ ll follow you .
why do they run away ?
o bottom , thou art changed !
what do i see on thee ?
you see an ass head of your own , do you ?
bless thee , bottom , bless thee .
but i will not stir from this place , do what they can .
for indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ?
methinks , mistress , you should have little reason for that .
and yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays .
the more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends .
thou art as wise as thou art beautiful .
i am a spirit of no common rate .
be kind and courteous to this gentleman .
hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes .
feed him with apricoks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes .
nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .
i cry your worships ' mercy , heartily.—i beseech your worship ’ s name .
i shall desire you of more acquaintance , good master cobweb .
if i cut my finger , i shall make bold with you.— your name , honest gentleman ?
good master mustardseed , i know your patience well .
that same cowardly , giantlike ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house .
i promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .
i desire you of more acquaintance , good master mustardseed .
come , wait upon him .
lead him to my bower .
the moon methinks looks with a watery eye .
and when she weeps , weeps every little flower , lamenting some enforcèd chastity .
tie up my love ’ s tongue .
here comes my messenger.—how now , mad spirit ?
what night-rule now about this haunted grove ?
my mistress with a monster is in love .
i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there .
when in that moment so it came to pass , titania waked and straightway loved an ass .
this falls out better than i could devise .
oh , why rebuke you him that loves you so ?
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me .
would he have stolen away from sleeping hermia ?
it can not be but thou hast murdered him .
so should a murderer look , so dead , so grim .
so should the murdered look , and so should i , pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty .
what ’ s this to my lysander ?
ah , good demetrius , wilt thou give him me ?
hast thou slain him then ?
could not a worm , an adder , do so much ?
an adder did it , for with doubler tongue than thine , thou serpent , never adder stung .
i am not guilty of lysander ’ s blood .
nor is he dead , for aught that i can tell .
i pray thee , tell me then that he is well .
an if i could , what should i get therefore ?
relent , sweet hermia—and , lysander , yield thy crazèd title to my certain right .
you have her father ’ s love , demetrius .
and she is mine , and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius .
a privilege never to see me more .
and from thy hated presence part i so .
see me no more , whether he be dead or no .
here therefore for a while i will remain .
and laid the love juice on some true love ’ s sight .
flower of this purple dye , hit with cupid ’ s archery , sink in apple of his eye .
when thou wakest , if she be by , beg of her for remedy .
shall we their fond pageant see ?
lord , what fools these mortals be !
the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake .
then will two at once woo one .
why should you think that i should woo in scorn ?
look , when i vow , i weep .
you do advance your cunning more and more .
will you give her o'er ?
demetrius loves her , and he loves not you .
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment .
you are unkind , demetrius .
and yours of helena to me bequeath , whom i do love and will do till my death .
lysander , keep thy hermia .
helen , it is not so .
look , where thy love comes .
dark night , that from the eye his function takes , the ear more quick of apprehension makes .
thou art not by mine eye , lysander , found .
why should he stay , whom love doth press to go ?
what love could press lysander from my side ?
why seek ’ st thou me ?
could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so ?
you speak not as you think .
lo , she is one of this confederacy !
all schooldays ' friendship , childhood innocence ?
she can not love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self-endeared .
why , you speak truth .
but who dare tell her so ?
if i should speak , she would mock me into air .
o , she would laugh me out of myself , press me to death with wit .
therefore let benedick , like covered fire , consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .
it were a better death than die with mocks , which is as bad as die with tickling .
one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking .
o , do not do your cousin such a wrong !
he is the only man of italy , always excepted my dear claudio .
indeed , he hath an excellent good name .
his excellence did earn it , ere he had it .
when are you married , madam ?
why , every day , tomorrow .
i do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go i toward aragon .
i ’ ll bring you thither , my lord , if you ’ ll vouchsafe me .
gallants , i am not as i have been .
so say i. methinks you are sadder .
i hope he be in love .
there ’ s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love .
if he be sad , he wants money .
what , sigh for the toothache ?
yet say i , he is in love .
if he be not in love with some woman , there is no believing old signs .
he brushes his hat o ' mornings .
hath any man seen him at the barber ’ s ?
nay , he rubs himself with civet .
can you smell him out by that ?
you embrace your charge too willingly .
her mother hath many times told me so .
you have it full , benedick .
truly , the lady fathers herself.—be happy , lady , for you are like an honorable father .
i wonder that you will still be talking , signor benedick .
what , my dear lady disdain !
that ’ s as much as to say , the sweet youth ’ s in love .
the greatest note of it is his melancholy .
and when was he wont to wash his face ?
yea , or to paint himself ?
for the which i hear what they say of him .
conclude , conclude , he is in love .
nay , but i know who loves him .
she shall be buried with her face upwards .
yet is this no charm for the toothache.—old signior , walk aside with me .
my lord and brother , god save you .
if your leisure served , i would speak with you .
yet count claudio may hear , for what i would speak of concerns him .
what ’ s the matter ?
i know not that , when he knows what i know .
if there be any impediment , i pray you discover it .
you may think i love you not .
let that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that i now will manifest .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
even she : leonato ’ s hero , your hero , every man ’ s hero .
the word is too good to paint out her wickedness .
i could say she were worse .
think you of a worse title , and i will fit her to it .
wonder not till further warrant .
if you love her then , tomorrow wed her .
but it would better fit your honor to change your mind .
i will not think it .
and as i wooed for thee to obtain her , i will join with thee to disgrace her .
bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .
o plague right well prevented !
so will you say when you have seen the sequel .
are you good men and true ?
come hither , neighbor seacole .
god hath blessed you with a good name .
to be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune , but to write and read comes by nature .
both which , master constable— you have .
i knew it would be your answer .
how if he will not stand ?
if he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the prince ’ s subjects .
we know what belongs to a watch .
how if they will not ?
why , then , let them alone till they are sober .
if we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him ?
you , constable , are to present the prince ’ s own person .
if you meet the prince in the night , you may stay him .
nay , by ' r lady , that i think he can not .
by ' r lady , i think it be so .
an there be any matter of weight chances , call up me .
well , masters , we hear our charge .
let us go sit here upon the church bench till two , and then all to bed .
one word more , honest neighbors .
adieu , be vigitant , i beseech you .
mass , and my elbow itched , i thought there would a scab follow .
i will owe thee an answer for that .
and now forward with thy tale .
therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats .
is it possible that any villainy should be so dear ?
thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich .
for when rich villains have need of poor ones , poor ones may make what price they will .
that shows thou art unconfirmed .
yes , it is apparel .
yes , the fashion is the fashion .
tush , i may as well say the fool ’ s the fool .
didst thou not hear somebody ?
no , ’ twas the vane on the house .
then is courtesy a turncoat .
but it is certain i am loved of all ladies , only you excepted .
a dear happiness to women .
they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor .
i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .
scratching could not make it worse an ’ twere such a face as yours were .
well , you are a rare parrot-teacher .
a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours .
i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer .
you always end with a jade ’ s trick .
i know you of old .
i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .
and thought they margaret was hero ?
we charge you , in the prince ’ s name , stand !
call up the right master constable .
we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .
and one deformed is one of them .
i know him ; he wears a lock .
masters , masters— warrant you .
masters , never speak , we charge you , let us obey you go with us .
a commodity in question , i warrant you.—come , we ’ ll obey you .
good ursula , wake my cousin beatrice and desire her to rise .
and bid her come hither .
troth , i think your other rebato were better .
no , pray thee , good meg , i ’ ll wear this .
by my troth , ’ s not so good , and i warrant your cousin will say so .
my cousin ’ s a fool , and thou art another .
i ’ ll wear none but this .
i saw the duchess of milan ’ s gown that they praise so .
oh , that exceeds , they say .
god give me joy to wear it , for my heart is exceeding heavy .
twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man .
is not marriage honorable in a beggar ?
is not your lord honorable without marriage ?
good morrow , sweet hero .
do you speak in the sick tune ?
i am out of all other tune , methinks .
do you sing it , and i ’ ll dance it .
these gloves the count sent me , they are an excellent perfume .
i am stuffed , cousin .
even since you left it .
doth not my wit become me rarely ?
it is not seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap .
by my troth , i am sick .
i meant plain holy thistle .
you may think perchance that i think you are in love .
yet benedick was such another , and now is he become a man .
help to dress me , good coz , good meg , good ursula .
what would you with me , honest neighbor ?
marry , this it is , sir .
yes , in truth it is , sir .
what is it , my good friends ?
goodman verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter .
it pleases your worship to say so , but we are the poor duke ’ s officers .
all thy tediousness on me , ah ?
take their examination yourself and bring it me .
i am now in great haste , as it may appear unto you .
my lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .
go , good partner , go , get you to francis seacole .
bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail .
we will spare for no wit , i warrant you .
here ’ s that shall drive some of them to a noncome .
if you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn .
i am not of many words , but i thank you .
please it your grace lead on ?
benedick , didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato ?
i noted her not , but i looked on her .
is she not a modest young lady ?
do you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ?
or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ?
no , i pray thee speak in sober judgment .
thou thinkest i am in sport .
i pray thee tell me truly how thou lik ’ st her .
lady , you come hither to be married to this count ?
know you any , hero ?
know you any , count ?
i dare make his answer , none .
o , what men dare do !
what men daily do , not knowing what they do !
why , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !
as freely , son , as god did give her me .
and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?
nothing , unless you render her again .
sweet prince , you learn me noble thankfulness.— there , leonato , take her back again .
she ’ s but the sign and semblance of her honor .
behold how like a maid she blushes here !
oh , what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal !
comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue ?
she knows the heat of a luxurious bed .
her blush is guiltiness , not modesty .
what do you mean , my lord ?
and seemed i ever otherwise to you ?
out on thee , seeming !
is my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?
sweet prince , why speak not you ?
i stand dishonored , that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale .
are these things spoken , or do i but dream ?
sir , they are spoken , and these things are true .
this looks not like a nuptial .
leonato , stand i here ?
is this the prince ’ s brother ?
is this face hero ’ s ?
are our eyes our own ?
all this is so , but what of this , my lord ?
i charge thee do so , as thou art my child .
oh , god defend me !
how am i beset ! — what kind of catechizing call you this ?
to make you answer truly to your name .
who can blot that name with any just reproach ?
marry , that can hero !
hero itself can blot out hero ’ s virtue .
what man was he talked with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one ?
now , if you are a maid , answer to this .
i talked with no man at that hour , my lord .
why , how now , cousin !
come , let us go .
these things , come thus to light , smother her spirits up .
dead , i think.—help , uncle ! — hero , why , hero !
death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wished for .
how now , cousin hero !
yea , wherefore should she not ?
why , doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her ?
grieved i i had but one ?
chid i for that at frugal nature ’ s frame ?
o , one too much by thee !
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?
sir , sir , be patient .
for my part , i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say .
oh , on my soul , my cousin is belied !
lady , were you her bedfellow last night ?
no , truly not , although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .
friar , it can not be .
there is some strange misprision in the princes .
pause awhile , and let my counsel sway you in this case .
your daughter here the princes left for dead .
let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed .
what shall become of this ?
so will it fare with claudio .
signior leonato , let the friar advise you .
would you buy her , that you enquire after her ?
but speak you this with a sad brow ?
come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?
in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on .
i can see yet without spectacles , and i see no such matter .
but i hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you ?
i would scarce trust myself , though i had sworn the contrary , if hero would be my wife .
is ’ t come to this ?
in faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ?
look , don pedro is returned to seek you .
presently away , for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.— come , lady , die to live .
this wedding day perhaps is but prolonged .
lady beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
yea , and i will weep a while longer .
i will not desire that .
surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged .
ah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !
is there any way to show such friendship ?
a very even way , but no such friend .
may a man do it ?
it is a man ’ s office , but not yours .
i do love nothing in the world so well as you .
as strange as the thing i know not .
i am sorry for my cousin .
by my sword , beatrice , thou lovest me .
with no sauce that can be devised to it .
i protest i love thee .
why then , god forgive me .
what offense , sweet beatrice ?
you have stayed me in a happy hour .
i was about to protest i loved you .
and do it with all thy heart .
i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .
come , bid me do anything for thee .
not for the wide world .
you kill me to deny it .
i am gone , though i am here .
there is no love in you .
nay , i pray you let me go .
beatrice— in faith , i will go .
we ’ ll be friends first .
you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .
is he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonored my kinswoman ?
oh , that i were a man !
i would eat his heart in the marketplace .
hear me , beatrice— talk with a man out at a window !
nay , but beatrice— sweet hero , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .
surely , a princely testimony , a goodly count , count comfect , a sweet gallant , surely !
oh , that i were a man for his sake !
or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake !
he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it .
i can not be a man with wishing , therefore i will die a woman with grieving .
by this hand , i love thee .
use it for my love some other way than swearing by it .
enough , i am engaged .
i will kiss your hand , and so i leave you .
by this hand , claudio shall render me a dear account .
marry , that am i and my partner .
let them come before master constable .
yea , marry , let them come before me .
what ’ s your name , friend ?
pray , write down , “ borachio. ” —yours , sirrah ?
i am a gentleman , sir , and my name is conrade .
write down “ master gentleman conrade. ” —masters , do you serve god ?
yea , sir , we hope .
how answer you for yourselves ?
marry , sir , we say we are none .
sir , i say to you it is thought you are false knaves .
sir , i say to you we are none .
well , stand aside.—'fore god , they are both in a ale .
have you writ down that they are none ?
master constable , you go not the way to examine .
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers .
yea , marry , that ’ s the eftest way.—let the watch come forth .
this man said , sir , that don john , the prince ’ s brother , was a villain .
write down prince john a villain .
i do not like thy look , i promise thee .
marry , that he had received a thousand ducats of don john for accusing the lady hero wrongfully .
flat burglary as ever was committed .
yea , by mass , that it is .
prince john is this morning secretly stolen away .
god ’ s my life , where ’ s the sexton ?
let him write down the prince ’ s officer “ coxcomb. ” come , bind them.—thou naughty varlet !
you are an ass , you are an ass !
dost thou not suspect my place ?
dost thou not suspect my years ?
therefore give me no counsel .
i pray thee , peace .
yet bend not all the harm upon yourself .
make those that do offend you suffer too .
there thou speak ’ st reason .
nay , i will do so .
here comes the prince and claudio hastily .
good e'en , good e'en .
good day to both of you .
hear you , my lords— we have some haste , leonato .
i would your grace would constrain me to tell .
amen , if you love her , for the lady is very well worthy .
you speak this to fetch me in , my lord .
by my troth , i speak my thought .
some haste , my lord !
well , fare you well , my lord .
are you so hasty now ?
well , all is one .
nay , do not quarrel with us , good old man .
if he could right himself with quarreling , some of us would lie low .
marry , thou dost wrong me , thou dissembler , thou .
nay , never lay thy hand upon thy sword .
marry , beshrew my hand if it should give your age such cause of fear .
in faith , my hand meant nothing to my sword .
tush , tush , man , never fleer and jest at me .
i say thou hast belied mine innocent child .
thine , claudio , thine , i say .
you say not right , old man .
i will not have to do with you .
canst thou so daff me ?
thou hast killed my child .
if thou kill ’ st me , boy , thou shalt kill a man .
he shall kill two of us , and men indeed , but that ’ s no matter .
let him kill one first .
win me and wear me !
let him answer me.— come , follow me , boy .
but brother anthony— come , ’ tis no matter .
let me deal in this .
gentlemen both , we will not wake your patience .
my lord , my lord— i will not hear you .
come , brother ; away !
and shall , or some of us will smart for it .
see , see , here comes the man we went to seek .
now , signior , what news ?
you are almost come to part almost a fray .
we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth .
what think ’ st thou ?
had we fought , i doubt we should have been too young for them .
in a false quarrel there is no true valor .
as i am an honest man , he looks pale.—art thou sick , or angry ?
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care .
sir , i shall meet your wit in the career , an you charge it against me .
i pray you , choose another subject .
i think he be angry indeed .
if he be , he knows how to turn his girdle .
shall i speak a word in your ear ?
god bless me from a challenge !
do me right , or i will protest your cowardice .
you have killed a sweet lady , and her death shall fall heavy on you .
let me hear from you .
what , a feast , a feast ?
i ' faith , i thank him .
i ’ ll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit he other day .
i said thou hadst a fine wit .
yea , that she did .
the old man ’ s daughter told us all .
and , moreover , god saw him when he was hid in the garden .
but when shall we set the savage bull ’ s horns on the sensible benedick ’ s head ?
yea , and text underneath : “ here dwells benedick the married man ” ?
fare you well , boy .
i will leave you now to your gossip-like humor .
i must discontinue your company .
your brother the bastard is fled from messina .
you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady .
for my lord lackbeard there , he and i shall meet , and till then peace be with him .
in most profound earnest , and , i ’ ll warrant you , for the love of beatrice .
what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit !
but soft you , let me be .
pluck up , my heart , and be sad .
did he not say my brother was fled ?
if justice can not tame you , she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance .
nay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .
two of my brother ’ s men bound !
officers , what offense have these men done ?
i have deceived even your very eyes .
the lady is dead upon mine and my master ’ s false accusation .
i have drunk poison whiles he uttered it .
yea , and paid me richly for the practice of it .
he is composed and framed of treachery , and fled he is upon this villainy .
sweet hero , now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i loved it first .
here , here comes master signior leonato , and the sexton too .
which of these is he ?
if you would know your wronger , look on me .
art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed mine innocent child ?
yea , even i alone .
no , not so , villain , thou beliest thyself .
i know not how to pray your patience , yet i must speak .
give her the right you should have given her cousin , and so dies my revenge .
that i love her , i feel .
that she is worthy , i know .
and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .
that a woman conceived me , i thank her .
that she brought me up , i likewise give her most humble thanks .
i shall see thee , ere i die , look pale with love .
with anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord , not with love .
your overkindness doth wring tears from me .
i do embrace your offer ; and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio .
tomorrow then i will expect your coming .
tonight i take my leave .
i thank thee for thy care and honest pains .
your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth , and i praise god for you .
i wish your worship well .
god restore you to health !
we look for you tomorrow .
tonight i ’ ll mourn with hero .
to have no man come over me !
a most manly wit , margaret , it will not hurt a woman .
and so , i pray thee , call beatrice .
well , i will call beatrice to you , who i think hath legs .
sweet beatrice , wouldst thou come when i called thee ?
yea , signior , and depart when you bid me .
oh , stay but till then !
only foul words , and thereupon i will kiss thee .
therefore i will depart unkissed .
thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense , so forcible is thy wit .
but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me ?
i do suffer love indeed , for i love thee against my will .
in spite of your heart , i think .
and how long is that , think you ?
question : why , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum .
so much for praising myself , who , i myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy .
an now tell me , how doth your cousin ?
serve god , love me , and mend .
madam , you must come to your uncle .
will you go hear this news , signior ?
is this the monument of leonato ?
it is , my lord .
done to death by slanderous tongues was the hero that here lies .
death , in guerdon of her wrongs , gives her fame which never dies .
so the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame .
hang thou there upon the tomb , praising her when i am dumb .
now , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn .
now , unto thy bones good night !
yearly will i do this rite .
did i not tell you she was innocent ?
so are the prince and claudio , who accused her upon the error that you heard debated .
well , i am glad that all things sort so well .
and so am i , being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it .
the prince and claudio promised by this hour to visit me.—you know your office , brother .
you must be father to your brother ’ s daughter , and give her to young claudio .
to do what , signior ?
that eye my daughter lent her ; ’ tis most true .
and i do with an eye of love requite her .
the sight whereof i think you had from me , from claudio and the prince .
but what ’ s your will ?
your answer , sir , is enigmatical .
here comes the prince and claudio .
good morrow to this fair assembly .
good morrow , prince ; good morrow , claudio .
are you yet determined today to marry with my brother ’ s daughter ?
i ’ ll hold my mind were she an ethiope .
well , as time shall try .
well , you temporize with the hours .
call her forth , brother .
here ’ s the friar ready .
i think he thinks upon the savage bull .
tush , fear not , man .
which is the lady i must seize upon ?
this same is she , and i do give you her .
no , that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her .
she died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .
soft and fair , friar.—which is beatrice ?
do not you love me ?
why no , no more than reason .
why then , your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived .
do not you love me ?
troth , no , no more than reason .
they swore that you were almost sick for me .
they swore that you were well-nigh dead for me .
then you do not love me ?
no , truly , but in friendly recompense .
come , cousin , i am sure you love the gentleman .
here ’ s our own hands against our hearts .
come , i will have thee , but , by this light , i take thee for pity .
i will stop your mouth .
how dost thou , benedick , the married man ?
dost thou think i care for a satire or an epigram ?
first , of my word !
therefore play , music.—prince , thou art sad .
get thee a wife , get thee a wife .
to the tuition of god .
from my house , if i had it— the sixth of july .
my liege , your highness now may do me good .
my love is thine to teach .
hath leonato any son , my lord ?
no child but hero ; she ’ s his only heir .
dost thou affect her , claudio ?
was ’ t not to this end that thou began ’ st to twist so fine a story ?
but lest my liking might too sudden seem , i would have salved it with a longer treatise .
what need the bridge much broader than the flood ?
in practice let us put it presently .
hath he provided this music ?
he is very busy about it .
but , brother , i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .
hath the fellow any wit that told you this ?
i will send for him , and question him yourself .
he is very near by this .
he was not three leagues off when i left him .
how many gentlemen have you lost in this action ?
but few of any sort , and none of name .
a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers .
i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young florentine called claudio .
he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it .
no , no , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself .
go you and tell her of it .
cousins , you know what you have to do.—o , i cry you mercy , friend .
go you with me and i will use your skill.— good cousin , have a care this busy time .
what the goodyear , my lord , why are you thus out of measure sad ?
therefore the sadness is without limit .
i can not hide what i am .
yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment .
it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest .
in the meantime , let me be that i am , and seek not to alter me .
can you make no use of your discontent ?
i make all use of it , for i use it only .
what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ?
marry , it is your brother ’ s right hand .
marry , on hero , the daughter and heir of leonato .
how came you to this ?
come , come , let us thither .
this may prove food to my displeasure .
if i can cross him any way , i bless myself every way .
you are both sure , and will assist me ?
to the death , my lord .
let us to the great supper .
we ’ ll wait upon your lordship .
was not count john here at supper ?
how tartly that gentleman looks !
i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after .
he is of a very melancholy disposition .
he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick .
in faith , she ’ s too curst .
you may light on a husband that hath no beard .
what should i do with him ?
well then , go you into hell ?
not till god make men of some other metal than earth .
would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust ?
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ?
no , uncle , i ’ ll none .
cousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly .
i have a good eye , uncle .
i can see a church by daylight .
the revelers are entering , brother .
lady , will you walk a bout with your friend ?
and when please you to say so ?
when i like your favor , for god defend the lute should be like the case !
my visor is philemon ’ s roof ; within the house is jove .
speak low if you speak love .
well , i would you did like me .
i say my prayers aloud .
at a word , i am not .
i know you by the waggling of your head .
to tell you true , i counterfeit him .
you could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man .
here ’ s his dry hand up and down .
you are he , you are he .
at a word , i am not .
come , come , do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit ?
go to , mum , you are he .
graces will appear , and there ’ s an end .
will you not tell me who told you so ?
no , you shall pardon me .
nor will you not tell me who you are ?
that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry tales !
well this was signor benedick that said so .
i am sure you know him well enough .
not i , believe me .
did he never make you laugh ?
there are no faces truer than those that are so washed .
how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping !
there was none such in the army of any sort .
what is he that you ask for , niece ?
my cousin means signor benedick of padua .
oh , he ’ s returned , and as pleasant as ever he was .
i pray you , what is he ?
i am sure he is in the fleet .
i would he had boarded me .
when i know the gentleman , i ’ ll tell him what you say .
we must follow the leaders .
nay , if they lead to any ill , i will leave them at the next turning .
signor , you are very near my brother in his love .
he is enamored on hero .
i pray you , dissuade him from her .
how know you he loves her ?
i heard him swear his affection .
so did i too , and he swore he would marry her tonight .
come , let us to the banquet .
thus answer i in the name of benedick , but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio .
tis certain so , the prince woos for himself .
friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love .
therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues .
farewell , therefore , hero .
come , will you go with me ?
i wish him joy of her .
why , that ’ s spoken like an honest drover ; so they sell bullocks .
but did you think the prince would have served you thus ?
i pray you , leave me .
ho , now you strike like the blind man .
twas the boy that stole your meat , and you ’ ll beat the post .
if it will not be , i ’ ll leave you .
alas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges .
but that my lady beatrice should know me , and not know me !
the prince ’ s fool !
ha , it may be i go under that title because i am merry .
yea , but so i am apt to do myself wrong .
i am not so reputed !
well , i ’ ll be revenged as i may .
now , signior , where ’ s the count ?
troth , my lord , i have played the part of lady fame .
i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .
what ’ s his fault ?
wilt thou make a trust a transgression ?
the transgression is in the stealer .
the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you .
the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .
she speaks poniards , and every word stabs .
come , talk not of her .
look , here she comes .
will your grace command me any service to the world ’ s end ?
i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on .
marry , once before he won it of me with false dice .
therefore your grace may well say i have lost it .
you have put him down , lady , you have put him down .
why , how now , count , wherefore are you sad ?
not sad , my lord .
i have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained .
name the day of marriage , and god give thee joy .
count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes .
his grace hath made the match , and all grace say “ amen ” to it .
speak , count , ’ tis your cue .
i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .
in faith , lady , you have a merry heart .
i thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care .
my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .
and so she doth , cousin .
thus goes everyone to the world but i , and i am sunburnt .
i would rather have one of your father ’ s getting .
hath your grace ne'er a brother like you ?
your father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them .
will you have me , lady ?
no , my lord , unless i might have another for working days .
your grace is too costly to wear every day .
but i beseech your grace pardon me .
i was born to speak all mirth and no matter .
niece , will you look to those things i told you of ?
i cry you mercy , uncle.—by your grace ’ s pardon .
by my troth , a pleasant-spirited lady .
there ’ s little of the melancholy element in her , my lord .
she can not endure to hear tell of a husband .
oh , by no means .
she mocks all her wooers out of suit .
she were an excellent wife for benedict .
o lord , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad .
county claudio , when mean you to go to church ?
my lord , i am for you , though it cost me ten nights ' watchings .
and i , my lord .
and you too , gentle hero ?
i will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .
and benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that i know .
go in with me , and i will tell you my drift .
he hath done good service , lady , in these wars .
you had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it .
and a good soldier too , lady .
a lord to a lord , a man to a man , stuffed with all honorable virtues .
he is no less than a stuffed man .
but for the stuffing—well , we are all mortal .
you must not , sir , mistake my niece .
there is a kind of merry war betwixt signor benedick and her .
they never meet but there ’ s a skirmish of wit between them .
he hath every month a new sworn brother .
the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato .
yea , my lord , but i can cross it .
any bar , any cross , any impediment will be med'cinable to me .
i am sick in displeasure to him , and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine .
how canst thou cross this marriage ?
not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .
what life is in that to be the death of this marriage ?
the poison of that lies in you to temper .
what proof shall i make of that ?
proof enough to misuse the prince , to vex claudio , to undo hero , and kill leonato .
look you for any other issue ?
only to despite them , i will endeavor anything .
go then , find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone .
tell them that you know that hero loves me .
they will scarcely believe this without trial .
be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .
i will presently go learn their day of marriage .
in my chamber window lies a book .
bring it hither to me in the orchard .
i am here already , sir .
i know that , but i would have thee hence and here again .
i can not tell ; i think not .
the prince and monsieur love !
i will hide me in the arbor .
come , shall we hear this music ?
yea , my good lord .
come , balthasar , we ’ ll hear that song again .
o , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice to slander music anymore than once .
i pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .
strange that sheeps ' guts should hale souls out of men ’ s bodies ?
by my troth , a good song .
and an ill singer , my lord .
yea , marry , dost thou hear , balthasar ?
the best i can , my lord .
what was it you told me of today , that your niece beatrice was in love with signor benedick ?
sits.—i did never think that lady would have loved any man .
may be she doth but counterfeit .
there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it .
why , what effects of passion shows she ?
what effects , my lord ?
she will sit you—you heard my daughter tell you how .
how , how i pray you ?
i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .
i would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against benedick .
hath she made her affection known to benedick ?
no , and swears she never will .
that ’ s her torment .
tis true indeed , so your daughter says .
my daughter tells us all .
now you talk of a sheet of paper , i remember a pretty jest your daughter told .
it were good that benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .
he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .
an he should , it were an alms to hang him .
she ’ s an excellent sweet lady , and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous .
and she is exceeding wise .
i am sorry for her , as i have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .
i would she had bestowed this dotage on me .
i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself .
i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say .
were it good , think you ?
he is a very proper man .
before god , and in my mind , very wise .
he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .
i see , lady , the gentleman is not in your books .
but i pray you , who is his companion ?
he is most in the company of the right noble claudio .
o lord , he will hang upon him like a disease !
god help the noble claudio !
if he have caught the benedick , it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured .
i will hold friends with you , lady .
you will never run mad , niece .
no , not till a hot january .
if he do fear god , he must necessarily keep peace .
if he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
well , i am sorry for your niece .
shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love ?
against my will , i am sent to bid you come in to dinner .
fair beatrice , i thank you for your pains .
i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me .
if it had been painful , i would not have come .
you take pleasure then in the message ?
you have no stomach , signior .
if i do not love her , i am a jew .
good margaret , run thee to the parlor .
there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio .
there will she hide her to listen our propose .
bear thee well in it and leave us alone .
i ’ ll make her come , i warrant you , presently .
my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice .
fear you not my part of the dialogue .
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely ?
so says the prince and my new-trothèd lord .
and did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?
doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon ?
what ’ s the matter , lieutenant ?
i ’ ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .
dost thou prate , rogue ?
i pray you , sir , hold your hand .
let me go , sir , or i ’ ll knock you o'er the mazzard .
come , come , you ’ re drunk .
who ’ s that which rings the bell ? —diablo , ho !
fie , fie , lieutenant , you ’ ll be ashamed for ever .
what is the matter here ?
hold , for your lives !
the general speaks to you .
for christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl .
silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle from her propriety .
on thy love , i charge thee .
swords out , and tilting one at other ’ s breasts in opposition bloody .
worthy montano , you were wont be civil .
give me answer to it .
worthy othello , i am hurt to danger .
iago , who began ’ t ?
touch me not so near .
i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio .
yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him .
more of this matter can not i report .
i ’ ll make thee an example .
what ’ s the matter , dear ?
all ’ s well , sweeting , come away to bed.— myself will be your surgeon .
what , are you hurt , lieutenant ?
ay , past all surgery .
what tell ’ st thou me of robbing ?
you ’ ll have your nephews neigh to you .
you ’ ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .
what profane wretch art thou ?
i know thee , roderigo .
sir , i will answer any thing .
reputation , reputation , reputation !
my reputation , iago , my reputation !
as i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound .
there is more sense in that than in reputation .
you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .
what , man , there are ways to recover the general again .
sue to him again and he ’ s yours .
and discourse fustian with one ’ s own shadow ?
what was he that you followed with your sword ?
what had he done to you ?
i remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly .
a quarrel , but nothing wherefore .
that we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !
why , but you are now well enough .
how came you thus recovered ?
one unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .
come , you are too severe a moraler .
but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .
i will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me i am a drunkard .
had i as many mouths as hydra , such an answer would stop them all .
to be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !
every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .
come , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used .
exclaim no more against it .
and , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you .
i have well approved it , sir .
you or any man living may be drunk at a time , man .
i tell you what you shall do .
our general ’ s wife is now the general .
confess yourself freely to her , importune her help to put you in your place again .
i protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .
i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me .
you are in the right .
good night , lieutenant , i must to the watch .
good night , honest iago .
and what ’ s he then that says i play the villain ?
for ’ tis most easy th ' inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit .
she ’ s framed as fruitful as the free elements .
how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course , directly to his good ?
and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor .
and so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to venice .
how poor are they that have not patience !
what wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
thou know ’ st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , and wit depends on dilatory time .
does ’ t not go well ?
in troth , ’ tis morning .
pleasure and action make the hours seem short .
retire thee , go where thou art billeted .
nay , get thee gone .
two things are to be done : my wife must move for cassio to her mistress .
i ’ ll set her on .
ay , that ’ s the way .
masters , play here , i will content your pains .
are these , i pray you , wind instruments ?
ay , marry , are they , sir .
oh , thereby hangs a tail .
whereby hangs a tale , sir ?
well , sir , we will not .
if you have any music that may not be heard , to ’ t again .
but , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .
we have none such , sir .
then put up your pipes in your bag , for i ’ ll away .
go , vanish into air , away !
dost thou hear , my honest friend ?
prithee , keep up thy quillets .
she is stirring , sir .
if she will stir hither , i shall seem to notify unto her .
in happy time , iago .
you have not been abed , then ?
my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access .
i humbly thank you for ’ t .
good morrow , good lieutenant .
i am sorry for your displeasure , but all will sure be well .
the general and his wife are talking of it , and she speaks for you stoutly .
i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely .
i am much bound to you .
these letters give , iago , to the pilot , and by him do my duties to the senate .
that done , i will be walking on the works , repair there to me .
well , my good lord , i ’ ll do ’ t .
this fortification , gentlemen , shall we see ’ t ?
we ’ ll wait upon your lordship .
be thou assured , good cassio , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf .
you do love my lord .
my lord shall never rest , i ’ ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience .
but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke .
strike on the tinder , ho !
give me a taper , call up all my people !
this accident is not unlike my dream , belief of it oppresses me already .
light , i say , light !
farewell , for i must leave you .
therefore be merry , cassio , for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away .
madam , here comes my lord .
madam , i ’ ll take my leave .
why , stay and hear me speak .
i am very ill at ease , unfit for mine own purposes .
well , do your discretion .
nothing , my lord , or if—i know not what .
was not that cassio parted from my wife ?
i do believe ’ twas he .
how now , my lord ?
i have been talking with a suitor here , a man that languishes in your displeasure .
who is ’ t you mean ?
why , your lieutenant , cassio .
good my lord , if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take .
i prithee , call him back .
good love , call him back .
not now , sweet desdemona .
but shall ’ t be shortly ?
the sooner , sweet , for you .
shall ’ t be tonight at supper ?
why , then , tomorrow night , or tuesday morn .
on tuesday noon , or night , or wednesday morn .
i prithee name the time , but let it not exceed three days .
trust me , i could do much— prithee , no more .
let him come when he will , i will deny thee nothing .
i will deny thee nothing !
whereon i do beseech thee , grant me this , to leave me but a little to myself .
i ’ ll come to thee straight .
perdition catch my soul but i do love thee !
my noble lord— what dost thou say , iago ?
did michael cassio , when you wooed my lady , know of your love ?
he did , from first to last .
why of thy thought , iago ?
i did not think he had been acquainted with her .
discern ’ st thou aught in that ?
honest , ay , honest .
my lord , for aught i know .
i heard thee say even now thou lik ’ st not that when cassio left my wife .
if thou dost love me show me thy thought .
my lord , you know i love you .
for michael cassio , i dare be sworn , i think , that he is honest .
men should be what they seem , or those that be not , would they might seem none !
certain , men should be what they seem .
why then i think cassio ’ s an honest man .
nay , yet there ’ s more in this .
good name in man and woman , dear my lord , is the immediate jewel of their souls .
who steals my purse steals trash .
tis something , nothing : 't was mine , ’ tis his , and has been slave to thousands .
i ’ ll know thy thoughts .
oh , beware , my lord , of jealousy !
it is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on .
good heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy !
why , why is this ?
to be once in doubt is to be resolved .
where virtue is , these are more virtuous .
therefore , as i am bound , receive it from me .
i speak not yet of proof .
i know our country disposition well .
in venice they do let god see the pranks they dare not show their husbands .
why , go to then .
but i am much to blame .
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you .
i am bound to thee forever .
i see this hath a little dashed your spirits .
not a jot , not a jot .
trust me , i fear it has .
i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love .
but i do see you ’ re moved .
cassio ’ s my worthy friend— my lord , i see you ’ re moved .
no , not much moved .
if more thou dost perceive , let me know more .
set on thy wife to observe .
my lord , i take my leave .
note if your lady strain his entertainment
it is too true an evil .
and what ’ s to come of my despisèd time is naught but bitterness .
are they married , think you ?
truly , i think they are .
oh , heaven , how got she out ?
oh , treason of the blood !
fathers , from hence trust not your daughters ' minds by what you see them act .
is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused ?
have you not read , roderigo , of some such thing ?
yes , sir , i have indeed .
i think i can discover him , if you please to get good guard and go along with me .
with any strong or vehement importunity .
much will be seen in that .
i once more take my leave .
oh , curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites !
yet ’ tis the plague to great ones , prerogatived are they less than the base .
tis destiny unshunnable , like death .
even then this forkèd plague is fated to us when we do quicken .
if she be false , heaven mocked itself .
i ’ ll not believe ’ t .
how now , my dear othello ?
your dinner , and the generous islanders by you invited , do attend your presence .
why do you speak so faintly ?
i have a pain upon my forehead , here .
why that ’ s with watching , ’ twill away again .
let me but bind it hard , within this hour it will be well .
come , i ’ ll go in with you .
i am very sorry that you are not well .
my wayward husband hath a hundred times
i ’ ll have the work ta'en out and give ’ t iago .
what he will do with it heaven knows , not i. i nothing but to please his fantasy .
what do you here alone ?
i have a thing for you .
it is a common thing— ha ?
to have a foolish wife .
oh , is that all ?
what will you give me now for the same handkerchief ?
why , that the moor first gave to desdemona , that which so often you did bid me steal .
hast stolen it from her ?
look , here it is .
a good wench , give it me .
what will you do with ’ t , that you have been so earnest to have me filch it ?
why , what is that to you ?
if it be not for some purpose of import , give ’ t me again .
poor lady , she ’ ll run mad when she shall lack it .
the moor already changes with my poison .
look , where he comes .
i swear ’ tis better to be much abused than but to know ’ t a little .
how now , my lord !
what sense had i in her stol ' n hours of lust ?
i saw ’ t not , thought it not , it harmed not me .
i slept the next night well , fed well , was free and merry .
i found not cassio ’ s kisses on her lips .
i am sorry to hear this .
oh , now forever farewell the tranquil mind !
farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars that makes ambition virtue !
and o you mortal engines , whose rude throats the immortal jove ’ s dead clamors counterfeit , farewell !
othello ’ s occupation ’ s gone .
is ’ t possible , my lord ?
is ’ t come to this ?
oh , heaven forgive me !
have you a soul or sense ?
god buy you , take mine office .
take note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe .
i should be wise , for honesty ’ s a fool and loses that it works for .
by the world , i think my wife be honest and think she is not .
i think that thou art just and think thou art not .
i ’ ll have some proof .
i see , sir , you are eaten up with passion .
i do repent me that i put it to you .
nay , and i will .
and may , but how ?
how satisfied , my lord ?
would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , behold her topped ?
it were a tedious difficulty , i think , to bring them to that prospect .
give me a living reason she ’ s disloyal .
i do not like the office .
i lay with cassio lately and , being troubled with a raging tooth , i could not sleep .
nay , this was but his dream .
tis a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly .
i ’ ll tear her all to pieces !
oh , that the slave had forty thousand lives !
one is too poor , too weak for my revenge .
now do i see ’ tis true .
swell , bosom , with thy fraught , for ’ tis of aspics ' tongues !
let him command , and to obey shall be in me remorse , what bloody business ever .
within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio ’ s not alive .
oh , damn her , damn her !
come , go with me apart .
i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil .
now art thou my lieutenant .
i am your own for ever .
at every house i ’ ll call .
i will deserve your pains .
to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie .
can anything be made of this ?
can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?
seek him , bid him come hither .
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .
where should i lose that handkerchief , emilia ?
i know not , madam .
believe me , i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes .
i think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him .
hot , hot , and moist .
this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty , fasting , and prayer ,
tis a good hand , a frank one .
the hearts of old gave hands , but our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .
i can not speak of this .
come now , your promise .
i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you .
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me .
that which i gave you .
i have it not about me .
no , indeed , my lord .
that ’ s a fault .
i did so , and take heed on ’ t , make it a darling like your precious eye .
there ’ s magic in the web of it .
most veritable , therefore look to ’ t well .
then would to heaven that i had never seen ’ t !
why do you speak so startingly and rash ?
speak , is ’ t out o ' th ' way ?
it is not lost , but what and if it were ?
i say , it is not lost .
pray you , let cassio be received again .
fetch me the handkerchief—my mind misgives .
come , come , you ’ ll never meet a more sufficient man .
is not this man jealous ?
i ne'er saw this before .
they are all but stomachs , and we all but food .
to eat us hungerly , and when they are full , they belch us .
look you , cassio and my husband !
there is no other way .
tis she must do ’ t , and , lo , the happiness !
you must awhile be patient .
what i can do i will , and more i will than for myself i dare .
there ’ s matter in ’ t indeed , if he be angry .
i prithee , do so .
i never gave him cause .
but jealous souls will not be answered so .
they are not ever jealous for the cause , but jealous for they ’ re jealous .
it is a monster begot upon itself , born on itself .
heaven keep the monster from othello ’ s mind !
i will go seek him.—cassio , walk hereabout .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
save you , friend cassio !
what make you from home ?
how is ’ t with you , my most fair bianca ?
indeed , sweet love , i was coming to your house .
and i was going to your lodging , cassio .
what , keep a week away ?
and lovers ' absent hours more tedious than the dial eightscore times !
o cassio , whence came this ?
is ’ t come to this ?
why , whose is it ?
i like the work well .
ere it be demanded , as like enough it will , i would have it copied .
take it and do ’ t , and leave me for this time .
why , i pray you ?
not that i love you not .
but that you do not love me .
tis but a little way that i can bring you , for i attend here .
but i ’ ll see you soon .
nine or ten times i had thought t ' have yerked him here under the ribs .
tis better as it is .
let him do his spite .
my services which i have done the signiory shall out-tongue his complaints .
what , to kiss in private ?
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ?
naked in bed , iago , and not mean harm !
it is hypocrisy against the devil .
so they do nothing , ’ tis a venial slip .
but if i give my wife a handkerchief— what then ?
she is protectress of her honor too .
but for the handkerchief— by heaven , i would most gladly have forgot it .
ay , what of that ?
that ’ s not so good now .
what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ?
he hath , my lord , but be you well assured no more than he ’ ll unswear .
why , that he did—i know not what he did .
with her , on her , what you will .
lie with her—that ’ s fulsome .
noses , ears , and lips .
confess ! —handkerchief ! —oh , devil ! — work on , my medicine , work !
what ’ s the matter ?
this is his second fit .
rub him about the temples .
if not , he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness .
do you withdraw yourself a little while ,
when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you .
how is it , general ?
have you not hurt your head ?
would you would bear your fortune like a man !
a hornèd man ’ s a monster and a beast .
no , let me know , and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be .
oh , thou art wise !
whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief— a passion most resulting such a man— cassio came hither .
i shifted him away and laid good ’ scuses upon your ecstasy ,
bade him anon return and here speak with me , the which he promised .
i say , but mark his gesture .
dost thou hear , iago ?
he , when he hears of her , can not refrain from the excess of laughter .
as he shall smile , othello shall go mad .
look how he laughs already !
i never knew woman love man so .
alas , poor rogue , i think indeed she loves me .
now he denies it faintly , and laughs it out .
do you hear , cassio ?
now he importunes him to tell it o'er .
go to , well said , well said .
she gives it out that you shall marry her .
ha , ha , ha !
prithee bear some charity to my wit .
do not think it so unwholesome .
ha , ha , ha !
so , so , so , so !
now he begins the story .
she was here even now .
she haunts me in every place .
ha , ha , ha !
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .
look , where she comes .
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?
i was a fine fool to take it .
i must take out the work ?
this is some minx ’ s token , and i must take out the work ?
how now , my sweet bianca !
how now , how now ?
by heaven , that should be my handkerchief !
if you ’ ll come to supper tonight , you may .
if you will not , come when you are next prepared for .
after her , after her .
i must , she ’ ll rail in the street else .
yes , i intend so .
did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?
and did you see the handkerchief ?
and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife !
she gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .
i would have him nine years a-killing .
nay , you must forget that .
ay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .
nay , that ’ s not your way .
so delicate with her needle , an admirable musician .
oh , she will sing the savageness out of a bear !
of so high and plenteous wit and invention !
she ’ s the worse for all this .
oh , a thousand thousand times—and then of so gentle a condition !
nay , that ’ s certain .
o iago , the pity of it , iago !
i will chop her into messes !
oh , ’ tis foul in her .
get me some poison , iago , this night .
do it not with poison .
strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .
good , good , the justice of it pleases !
and for cassio , let me be his undertaker .
you shall hear more by midnight .
those are the raisèd father and his friends .
you were best go in .
not i , i must be found .
my parts , my title , and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly .
by janus , i think no .
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant ?
the goodness of the night upon you , friends !
the duke does greet you , general , and he requires your haste-post-haste appearance , even on the instant .
what ’ s the matter , think you ?
something from cyprus as i may divine .
it is a business of some heat .
you have been hotly called for .
tis well i am found by you .
i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you .
what trumpet is that same ?
i warrant something from venice .
see , your wife ’ s with him .
save you , worthy general !
the duke and senators of venice greet you .
and what ’ s the news , good cousin lodovico ?
i am very glad to see you , signior .
are you sure of that ?
he did not call , he ’ s busy in the paper .
is there division ’ twixt my lord and cassio ?
i would do much t ' atone them , for the love i bear to cassio .
what , is he angry ?
trust me , i am glad on ’ t .
i am glad to see you mad .
why , sweet othello— i have not deserved this .
my lord , this would not be believed in venice , though i should swear i saw ’ t .
make her amends , she weeps .
oh , devil , devil !
i will not stay to offend you .
truly , an obedient lady .
i do beseech your lordship , call her back .
what would you with her , sir ?
who , i , my lord ?
ay , you did wish that i would make her turn .
sir , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on , and turn again .
and she can weep , sir , weep .
cassio shall have my place .
and , sir , tonight i do entreat that we may sup together .
you are welcome , sir , to cyprus .
is this the noble moor whom our full senate call all in all sufficient ?
is he not light of brain ?
he ’ s that he is .
i may not breathe my censure what he might be .
if what he might he is not , i would to heaven he were !
faith , that was not so well .
yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst !
or did the letters work upon his blood and new-create his fault ?
it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known .
do but go after and mark how he continues .
i am sorry that i am deceived in him .
you have seen nothing then ?
nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .
yes , you have seen cassio and she together .
but then i saw no harm , and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them .
what , did they never whisper ?
nor send you out o ' th ' way ?
to fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?
i durst , my lord , to wager she is honest , lay down my soul at stake .
she says enough , yet she ’ s a simple bawd that can not say as much .
and yet she ’ ll kneel and pray , i have seen her do ’ t .
my lord , what is your will ?
pray , chuck , come hither .
let me see your eyes .
what horrible fancy ’ s this ?
i understand a fury in your words , but not the words .
therefore be double damned , swear thou art honest !
heaven doth truly know it .
heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .
to whom , my lord ?
ah , desdemona , away , away , away !
am i the motive of these tears , my lord ?
if you have lost him , why , i have lost him too .
yet could i bear that too , well , very well .
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in !
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest .
oh , ay , as summer flies are in the shambles , that quicken even with blowing .
alas , what ignorant sin have i committed ?
was this fair paper , this most goodly book , made to write “ whore ” upon ?
by heaven , you do me wrong !
are you not a strumpet ?
no , as i am a christian .
what , not a whore ?
no , as i shall be saved .
oh , heaven forgive us !
you , you , ay , you !
we have done our course .
there ’ s money for your pains .
i pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel .
alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
how do you , madam ?
ancient , what makes he here ?
faith , he tonight hath boarded a land carrack .
if it prove lawful prize , he ’ s made for ever .
here comes another troop to seek for you .
general , be advised , he comes to bad intent .
signior , it is the moor .
down with him , thief !
do not talk to me , emilia .
here ’ s a change indeed !
tis meet i should be used so , very meet .
how have i been behaved that he might stick the small ’ st opinion on my least misuse ?
what is your pleasure , madam ?
how is ’ t with you ?
those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks .
he might have chid me so , for , in good faith , i am a child to chiding .
what is the matter , lady ?
am i that name , iago ?
what name , fair lady ?
such as she says my lord did say i was .
i am sure i am none such .
do not weep , do not weep .
would it not make one weep ?
it is my wretched fortune .
beshrew him for ’ t !
how comes this trick upon him ?
nay , heaven doth know .
i will be hanged else !
fie , there is no such man .
if any such there be , heaven pardon him !
why should he call her “ whore ” ?
the moor ’ s abused by some most villainous knave , some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
oh , fie upon them !
alas iago , what shall i do to win my lord again ?
good friend , go to him .
for , by this light of heaven , i know not how i lost him .
and ever will—though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement—love him dearly , comfort forswear me !
unkindness may do much , and his unkindness may defeat my life , but never taint my love .
i can not say “ whore , ” it does abhor me now i speak the word .
the business of the state does him offence , and he does chide with you .
if ’ twere no other— 't is but so , i warrant .
hark , how these instruments summon to supper .
the messengers of venice stays the meat .
go in , and weep not .
all things shall be well .
i do not find that thou deal ’ st justly with me .
will you hear me , roderigo ?
i have heard too much , and your words and performances are no kin together .
you charge me most unjustly .
the jewels you have had from me to deliver desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress .
very well , ” “ go to ” !
i can not go to , man , nor ’ tis not very well .
nay , i think it is scurvy , and begin to find myself fopped in it .
i tell you ’ tis not very well .
i will make myself known to desdemona .
if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation .
if not , assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you .
ay , and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing .
give me thy hand , roderigo .
i grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment .
well , what is it ?
is it within reason and compass ?
sir , there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello ’ s place .
why , then othello and desdemona return again to venice .
how do you mean , removing of him ?
why , by making him uncapable of othello ’ s place : knocking out his brains .
and that you would have me to do !
ay , if you dare do yourself a profit and a right .
he sups tonight with a harlotry , and thither will i go to him .
he knows not yet of his honorable fortune .
i will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us .
it is now high suppertime , and the night grows to waste .
i will hear further reason for this .
and you shall be satisfied .
i do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .
i humbly thank your ladyship .
your honor is most welcome .
will you walk , sir ? —o desdemona— my lord ?
get you to bed on th ' instant , i will be returned forthwith .
dismiss your attendant there , look ’ t be done .
i will , my lord .
he looks gentler than he did .
therefore , good emilia , give me my nightly wearing , and adieu .
we must not now displease him .
would you had never seen him !
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .
good father , how foolish are our minds !
if i do die before thee , prithee , shroud me in one of these same sheets .
that song tonight will not go from my mind .
shall i go fetch your nightgown ?
no , unpin me here .
this lodovico is a proper man .
i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip .
it ’ s the wind .
mine eyes do itch , doth that bode weeping ?
tis neither here nor there .
i have heard it said so .
oh , these men , these men !
there be some such , no question .
come , sir , i am for you .
good signior , you shall more command with years than with your weapons .
o thou foul thief , where hast thou stowed my daughter ?
damned as thou art , thou hast enchanted her !
if he do resist , subdue him at his peril !
whither will you that i go to answer this your charge ?
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
why , would not you ?
no , by this heavenly light !
nor i neither , by this heavenly light .
i might do ’ t as well i ' th ' dark .
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?
the world ’ s a huge thing .
it is a great price for a small vice .
in troth , i think thou wouldst not .
in troth , i think i should , and undo ’ t when i had done .
but for the whole world ?
why , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ?
i should venture purgatory for ’ t .
beshrew me , if i would do such a wrong for the whole world .
i do not think there is any such woman .
but i do think it is their husbands ' faults if wives do fall .
say that they slack their duties
why , we have galls , and though we have some grace , yet have we some revenge .
let husbands know their wives have sense like them .
they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour , as husbands have .
and doth affection breed it ?
is ’ t frailty that thus errs ?
and have not we affections , desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
good night , good night .
heaven me such uses send , not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !
here , stand behind this bulk , straight will he come .
i ’ ll be at thy elbow .
it makes us , or it mars us .
here , at thy hand .
be bold , and take thy stand .
i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons .
tis but a man gone .
i know his gait , ’ tis he.—villain , thou diest !
oh , i am slain !
i am maimed for ever .
oh , villain that i am !
oh , help , ho !
minion , your dear lies dead , and your unblest fate hies .
for , of my heart , those charms , thine eyes , are blotted .
thy bed , lust-stained , shall with lust ’ s blood be spotted .
tis some mischance , the cry is very direful .
tis heavy night , these may be counterfeits .
let ’ s think ’ t unsafe to come in to the cry without more help .
then shall i bleed to death .
here ’ s one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .
whose noise is this that ones on murder ?
do not you hear a cry ?
for heaven ’ s sake , help me !
the same indeed , a very valiant fellow .
oh , i am spoiled , undone by villains !
oh , me , lieutenant !
what villains have done this ?
i think that one of them is hereabout , and can not make away .
that ’ s one of them .
kill men i ' th ' dark !
where be these bloody thieves ?
are you of good or evil ?
as you shall prove us , praise us .
here ’ s cassio hurt by villains .
how is ’ t , brother !
my leg is cut in two .
light , gentlemen , i ’ ll bind it with my shirt .
what is the matter , ho ?
who is ’ t that cried ?
who is ’ t that cried ?
oh , my dear cassio !
o cassio , cassio , cassio !
cassio , may you suspect who they should be that have thus mangled you ?
i am sorry to find you thus .
i have been to seek you .
o cassio , cassio , cassio !
know we this face or no ?
i am glad to see you .
how do you , cassio ? —oh , a chair , a chair !
he , he , ’ tis he .
oh , that ’ s well said—the chair !
some good man bear him carefully from hence .
what malice was between you ?
none in the world , nor do i know the man .
i pray you , look upon her .
do you see , gentlemen ?
nay , guiltiness will speak , though tongues were out of use .
alas , what is the matter ?
what is the matter , husband ?
cassio hath here been set on in the dark by roderigo and fellows that are ’ scaped .
he ’ s almost slain , and roderigo dead .
this is the fruits of whoring .
prithee , emilia , go know of cassio where he supped tonight.—
he supped at my house , but i therefore shake not .
oh , did he so ?
i charge you , go with me .
oh , fie upon thee , strumpet !
this is the night that either makes me or fordoes me quite .
tis true , most worthy signior .
the duke ’ s in council and your noble self , i am sure , is sent for .
in this time of the night ?
mine ’ s not an idle cause .
for if such actions may have passage free , bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .
let me not name it to you , you chaste stars , it is the cause .
yet she must die , else she ’ ll betray more men .
put out the light , and then put out the light .
when i have plucked thy rose i can not give it vital growth again , it must needs wither .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
alack , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
well , do it , and be brief .
i would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit .
no , heavens forfend , i would not kill thy soul !
then heaven have mercy on me !
amen , with all my heart .
if you say , i hope you will not kill me .
why i should fear i know not , since guiltiness i know not .
but yet i feel i fear .
they are loves i bear to you .
ay , and for that thou diest .
that death ’ s unnatural that kills for loving .
alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
some bloody passion shakes your very frame .
these are portents , but yet i hope , i hope they do not point on me .
what ’ s the matter ?
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee , thou gav ’ st to cassio .
no , by my life and soul !
send for the man and ask him .
thou art on thy deathbed .
ay—but not yet to die !
oh , heaven have mercy on me !
i say “ amen . ”
and have you mercy too !
i never gave him token .
by heaven , i saw my handkerchief in ’ s hand .
that he hath usèd thee .
he will not say so .
no , his mouth is stopped .
honest iago hath ta'en order for ’ t .
what , is he dead ?
had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all .
alas , he is betrayed and i undone .
oh , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !
kill me tomorrow—let me live tonight !
nay , if you strive— but half an hour !
but while i say one prayer !
what noise is this ? —not dead ?
what ’ s the matter with thee now ?
but now , my lord .
cassio , my lord , hath killed a young venetian called roderigo .
no , cassio is not killed .
then murder ’ s out of tune , and sweet revenge grows harsh .
oh , falsely , falsely murdered !
alas , what cry is that ?
out and alas , that was my lady ’ s voice .
help , ho , help !
o lady , speak again !
o sweet mistress , speak !
a guiltless death i die .
oh , who hath done this deed ?
commend me to my kind lord .
why , how should she be murdered ?
you heard her say herself it was not i .
i must needs report the truth .
she ’ s like a liar gone to burning hell .
twas i that killed her .
oh , the more angel she , and you the blacker devil !
she turned to folly , and she was a whore .
thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .
she was false as water .
oh , she was heavenly true !
cassio did top her , ask thy husband else .
thy husband knew it all .
that she was false to wedlock ?
ay , ’ twas he that told me on her first .
an honest man he is , and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds .
what needs this iterance , woman ?
o mistress , villainy hath made mocks with love !
my husband say that she was false !
i say “ thy husband ” —dost understand the word ?
my friend , thy husband , honest , honest iago .
if he say so , may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day !
he lies to th ' heart .
she was too fond of her most filthy bargain .
this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her .
peace , you were best .
thou hast done a deed— i care not for thy sword , i ’ ll make thee known
the moor hath killed my mistress !
oh , are you come , iago ?
you have done well , that men must lay their murders on your neck .
but did you ever tell him she was false ?
you told a lie , an odious , damnèd lie .
upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie .
did you say with cassio ?
go to , charm your tongue .
my mistress here lies murdered in her bed— oh , heavens forfend !
there ’ s no composition in this news that gives them credit .
indeed , they are disproportioned .
my letters say a hundred and seven galleys .
and mine a hundred and forty .
and mine , two hundred .
nay , it is possible enough to judgment .
a messenger from the galleys .
and your reports have set the murder on .
i thought so then , i ’ ll kill myself for grief .
oh , villainy , villainy !
what , are you mad ?
i charge you , get you home .
good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak .
tis proper i obey him , but not now .
perchance , iago , i will ne'er go home .
oh , she was foul ! — i scarce did know you , uncle .
zounds , hold your peace .
be wise , and get you home .
your sword upon a woman ?
that handkerchief thou speak ’ st of i found by fortune and did give my husband .
no , alas , i found it and i did give ’ t my husband .
by heaven , i do not , i do not , gentlemen.— o murderous coxcomb !
are there no stones in heaven but what serve for the thunder ? —precious villain !
sure he hath killed his wife .
oh , lay me by my mistress ' side .
he ’ s gone , but his wife ’ s killed .
let him not pass , but kill him rather .
but why should honor outlive honesty ?
what did thy song bode , lady ?
hark , canst thou hear me ?
i will play the swan .
oh , here it is .
uncle , i must come forth .
behold , i have a weapon .
but , oh , vain boast !
who can control his fate ?
be not afraid , though you do see me weaponed .
do you go back dismayed ?
where should othello go ? — now , how dost thou look now ?
o ill-starred wench , pale as thy smock !
cold , cold , my girl , even like thy chastity .
o cursed , cursed slave !
whip me , ye devils , from the possession of this heavenly sight !
where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?
that ’ s he that was othello .
sblood , but you ’ ll not hear me !
thou told ’ st me thou didst hold him in thy hate .
despise me if i do not .
i look down towards his feet , but that ’ s a fable .
if that thou be ’ st a devil , i can not kill thee .
wrench his sword from him .
i bleed , sir , but not killed .
i am not sorry neither .
i ’ d have thee live , for in my sense ’ tis happiness to die .
this wretch hath part confessed his villainy .
did you and he consent in cassio ’ s death ?
dear general , i never gave you cause .
i do believe it , and i ask your pardon .
will you , i pray , demand that demi-devil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?
what you know , you know .
from this time forth i never will speak word .
what , not to pray ?
well , thou dost best .
the one of them imports the death of cassio to be undertook by roderigo .
most heathenish and most gross !
how came you , cassio , by that handkerchief that was my wife ’ s ?
your power and your command is taken off and cassio rules in cyprus .
nothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice .
then must you speak of one that loved not wisely , but too well .
of one not easily jealous , but being wrought , perplexed in the extreme .
of one whose hand , like the base indian , threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe .
all that is spoke is marred .
this did i fear , but thought he had no weapon , for he was great of heart .
how say you by this change ?
this can not be , by no assay of reason .
tis a pageant , to keep us in false gaze .
ay , so i thought .
how many , as you guess ?
and now they do re-stem their backward course , bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus .
tis certain then for cyprus .
marcus luccicos , is not he in town ?
he ’ s now in florence .
write from us to him .
here comes brabantio and the valiant moor .
good your grace , pardon me .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
humbly i thank your grace .
we are very sorry for ’ t .
nothing , but this is so .
the very head and front of my offending hath this extent , no more .
a maiden never bold , of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself .
but , othello , speak .
or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth ?
and let her speak of me before her father .
you best know the place .
these things to hear would desdemona seriously incline .
she wished she had not heard it , yet she wished that heaven had made her such a man .
upon this hint i spake .
she loved me for the dangers i had passed , and i loved her that she did pity them .
this only is the witchcraft i have used .
i think this tale would win my daughter too .
i pray you , hear her speak .
do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience ?
my noble father , i do perceive here a divided duty .
to you i am bound for life and education .
you are the lord of duty .
i am hitherto your daughter .
please it your grace , on to the state affairs .
i had rather to adopt a child than get it.— come hither , moor .
for thy escape would teach me tyranny , to hang clogs on them.—i have done , my lord .
i humbly beseech you , proceed to th ' affairs of state .
the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus .
why , at her father ’ s .
i ’ ll not have it so .
what would you , desdemona ?
let me go with him .
let her have your voice .
be it as you shall privately determine , either for her stay or going .
th ' affair cries haste and speed must answer it .
at nine i ' th ' morning here we ’ ll meet again .
wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he .
mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership .
why , there ’ s no remedy .
tis the curse of service .
now sir , be judge yourself , whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor .
i would not follow him then .
o sir , content you .
i follow him to serve my turn upon him .
we can not all be masters , nor all masters can not be truly followed .
whip me such honest knaves .
these fellows have some soul ,
look to her , moor , if thou hast eyes to see .
she has deceived her father , and may thee .
my life upon her faith ! —honest iago , my desdemona must i leave to thee .
i prithee , let thy wife attend on her , and bring them after in the best advantage .
we must obey the time .
what say ’ st thou , noble heart ?
what will i do , think ’ st thou ?
why , go to bed , and sleep .
i will incontinently drown myself .
if thou dost i shall never love thee after .
why , thou silly gentleman !
tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus .
our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners .
but we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts .
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .
come , be a man .
drown cats and blind puppies !
i could never better stead thee than now .
put money in thy purse .
these moors are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money .
she must change for youth .
therefore , put money in thy purse .
if thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .
make all the money thou canst .
a pox of drowning thyself !
tis clean out of the way .
thou art sure of me .
i have told thee often , and i re-tell thee again and again , i hate the moor .
let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .
traverse , go , provide thy money .
we will have more of this tomorrow .
where shall we meet i ' th ' morning ?
i ’ ll be with thee betimes .
no more of drowning , do you hear ?
put money enough in your purse .
i ’ ll sell all my land .
thus do i ever make my fool my purse .
cassio ’ s a proper man .
to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery .
what from the cape can you discern at sea ?
it is a high-wrought flood .
methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , a fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements .
what shall we hear of this ?
a segregation of the turkish fleet .
i never did like molestation view on the enchafèd flood .
if that the turkish fleet be not ensheltered and embayed , they are drowned .
it is impossible they bear it out .
news , lads , our wars are done !
the desperate tempest hath so banged the turks , that their designment halts .
a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet .
michael cassio , lieutenant to the warlike moor othello , is come on shore .
the moor himself at sea and is in full commission here for cyprus .
i am glad on ’ t .
for they were parted with foul and violent tempest .
pray heavens he be , for i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier .
come , let ’ s do so .
for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance .
thanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor .
i pray you sir , go forth and give us truth who ’ tis that is arrived .
but good lieutenant , is your general wived ?
tis one iago , ancient to the general .
oh , behold , the riches of the ship is come on shore !
you men of cyprus , let her have your knees .
i thank you , valiant cassio .
what tidings can you tell me of my lord ?
he is not yet arrived .
nor know i aught but that he ’ s well and will be shortly here .
oh , but i fear .
the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship— but , hark !
i am not what i am .
what , ho , brabantio !
look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
i find it still , when i have leave to sleep .
you have little cause to say so .
come on , come on .
oh , fie upon thee , slanderer !
nay , it is true , or else i am a turk .
you rise to play and go to bed to work .
no , let me not .
what wouldst thou write of me , if thou should ’ st praise me ?
i am not merry , but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise .
come , how wouldst thou praise me ?
how if fair and foolish ?
thou praisest the worst best .
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer .
oh , most lame and impotent conclusion !
do not learn of him , emilia , though he be thy husband .
how say you , cassio ?
is he not a most profane and liberal counselor ?
he speaks home , madam .
you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .
let ’ s meet him and receive him .
lo , where he comes !
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me .
oh , my soul ’ s joy !
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase , even as our days do grow .
amen to that , sweet powers !
i can not speak enough of this content .
it stops me here , it is too much of joy .
come , let us to the castle .
our wars are done , the turks are drowned .
bring thou the master to the citadel .
do thou meet me presently at the harbor.—come hither .
the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard .
first , i must tell thee this : desdemona is directly in love with him .
why , ’ tis not possible .
lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .
all which the moor is defective in .
i can not believe that in her .
she ’ s full of most blessed condition .
the wine she drinks is made of grapes .
if she had been blessed , she would never have loved the moor .
they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .
but , sir , be you ruled by me .
i have brought you from venice .
watch you tonight for the command , i ’ ll lay ’ t upon you .
i ’ ll not be far from you .
sir , he ’ s rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you .
provoke him that he may .
i will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity .
meet me by and by at the citadel .
i must fetch his necessaries ashore .
for besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .
so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .
bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello !
we must to the watch .
our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona—who let us not therefore blame .
what is the reason of this terrible summons ?
what is the matter there ?
signior , is all your family within ?
why , wherefore ask you this ?
zounds , sir , you ’ re robbed !
for shame , put on your gown .
your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul .
even now , now , very now , an old black ram is tupping your white ewe .
what , have you lost your wits ?
most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?
i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors .
in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee .
indeed she ’ s a most fresh and delicate creature .
what an eye she has !
an inviting eye , and yet methinks right modest .
and when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?
well , happiness to their sheets !
not tonight , good iago .
i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking .
i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .
oh , they are our friends .
i ’ ll drink for you .
what , man , ’ tis a night of revels !
i pray you call them in .
i ’ ll do ’ t , but it dislikes me .
if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .
fore heaven , they have given me a rouse already .
good faith , a little one , not past a pint , as i am a soldier .
fore heaven , an excellent song .
i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting .
your dane , your german , and your swag-bellied hollander—drink , ho ! —are nothing to your english .
is your englishman so expert in his drinking ?
why , he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your almain .
to the health of our general !
i am for it , lieutenant , and i ’ ll do you justice .
why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .
will you hear ’ t again ?
no , for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things .
it ’ s true , good lieutenant .
and so do i too , lieutenant .
ay , but ( by your leave ) not before me .
the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient .
do not think , gentlemen , i am drunk .
i am not drunk now .
i can stand well enough , and i speak well enough .
why , very well then .
you must not think then that i am drunk .
but is he often thus ?
tis evermore the prologue to his sleep .
he ’ ll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle .
it were well the general were put in mind of it .
it were an honest action to say so to the moor .
now have i done a good day ’ s work .
you peers , continue this united league .
and with my hand i seal my true heart ’ s love .
and i as i love hastings with my heart .
you have been factious one against the other.— wife , love lord hastings .
dorset , embrace him.—hastings , love lord marquess .
this interchange of love , i here protest , upon my part shall be inviolable .
a pleasing cordial , princely buckingham , is this thy vow unto my sickly heart .
and in good time , here comes sir richard ratcliffe and the duke .
good morrow to my sovereign king and queen , and , princely peers , a happy time of day .
happy indeed , as we have spent the day .
a blessèd labor , my most sovereign lord .
a holy day shall this be kept hereafter .
i would to god all strifes were well compounded .
my sovereign lord , i do beseech your highness to take our brother clarence to your grace .
why , madam , have i offered love for this , to be so flouted in this royal presence ?
who knows not that the gentle duke is dead ?
who knows not he is dead !
all-seeing heaven , what a world is this !
look i so pale , lord dorset , as the rest ?
but he , poor man , by your first order died , and that a wingèd mercury did bear .
some tardy cripple bear the countermand , that came too lag to see him burièd .
my soul is full of sorrow .
i will not rise unless your highness hear me .
then say at once what is it thou requests .
we know thy charge , brakenbury , and will obey .
we are the queen ’ s abjects and must obey.— brother , farewell .
i know it pleaseth neither of us well .
well , your imprisonment shall not be long .
i will deliver you or else lie for you .
go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return .
good time of day unto my gracious lord .
as much unto my good lord chamberlain .
well are you welcome to the open air .
how hath your lordship brooked imprisonment ?
my brother killed no man ; his fault was thought , and yet his punishment was bitter death .
who sued to me for him ?
this is the fruits of rashness .
o , they did urge it still unto the king .
come , lords , will you go to comfort edward with our company ?
we wait upon your grace .
good grandam , tell us , is our father dead ?
my pretty cousins , you mistake me both .
then , you conclude , my grandam , he is dead .
the king mine uncle is to blame for it .
god will revenge it , whom i will importune with earnest prayers , all to that effect .
peace , children , peace .
the king doth love you well .
incapable and shallow innocents , you can not guess who caused your father ’ s death .
think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ?
i can not think it .
hark , what noise is this ?
i ’ ll join with black despair against my soul and to myself become an enemy .
why grow the branches when the root is gone ?
why wither not the leaves that want their sap ?
if you will live , lament .
ah , for my husband , for my dear lord edward !
ah , for our father , for our dear lord clarence !
alas for both , both mine , edward and clarence !
what stay had i but edward ?
and he ’ s gone .
what stay had we but clarence ?
and he ’ s gone .
was never widow had so dear a loss .
were never orphans had so dear a loss .
was never mother had so dear a loss .
alas , i am the mother of these griefs .
madam , bethink you , like a careful mother , of the young prince your son .
in him your comfort lives .
humbly on my knee i crave your blessing .
though we have spent our harvest of this king , we are to reap the harvest of his son .
why “ with some little train , ” my lord of buckingham ?
and so in me , and so , i think , in all .
therefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince .
good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
i promise you i scarcely know myself .
hear you the news abroad ?
yes , that the king is dead .
give you good morrow , sir .
doth this news hold of good king edward ’ s death ?
ay , sir , it is too true , god help the while .
then , masters , look to see a troublous world .
no , no , by god ’ s good grace , his son shall reign .
woe to the land that ’ s governed by a child .
with patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
more pity that the eagle should be mewed while kites and buzzards prey at liberty .
tis very grievous to be thought upon .
where is he , in his bed ?
go you before , and i will follow you .
so stood the state when henry the sixth was crowned in paris but at nine months old .
come , come , we fear the worst .
untimely storms make men expect a dearth .
before the days of change , still is it so .
but leave it all to god .
marry , we were sent for to the justices .
tomorrow or next day they will be here .
i long with all my heart to see the prince .
i hope he is much grown since last i saw him .
ay , mother , but i would not have it so .
why , my young cousin ?
it is good to grow .
and so no doubt he is , my gracious madam .
i hope he is , but yet let mothers doubt .
how , my pretty york ?
i prithee let me hear it .
marry , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old .
twas full two years ere i could get a tooth .
grandam , this would have been a biting jest .
i prithee , pretty york , who told thee this ?
why , she was dead ere thou wast born .
if ’ twere not she , i can not tell who told me .
go to , you are too shrewd .
good madam , be not angry with the child .
such news , my lord , as grieves me to report .
well , madam , and in health .
what is thy news then ?
the mighty dukes , gloucester and buckingham .
the sum of all i can , i have disclosed .
why , or for what , the nobles were committed is all unknown to me , my gracious lord .
i see the ruin of my house .
welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre .
the weary way hath made you melancholy .
no , uncle , but our crosses on the way have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy .
i want more uncles here to welcome me .
those uncles which you want were dangerous .
your grace attended to their sugared words but looked not on the poison of their hearts .
god keep you from them , and from such false friends .
god keep me from false friends , but they were none .
my lord , the mayor of london comes to greet you .
god bless your grace with health and happy days .
and in good time here comes the sweating lord .
what , will our mother come ?
not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin .
weigh it but with the grossness of this age , you break not sanctuary in seizing him .
oft have i heard of sanctuary men , but sanctuary children , ne'er till now .
i go , my lord .
good lords , make all the speedy haste you may .
say , uncle gloucester , if our brother come , where shall we sojourn till our coronation ?
where it seems best unto your royal self .
i do not like the tower , of any place.— did julius caesar build that place , my lord ?
he did , my gracious lord , begin that place , which , since , succeeding ages have re-edified .
is it upon record , or else reported successively from age to age , he built it ?
upon record , my gracious lord .
what say you , uncle ?
death makes no conquest of this conqueror , for now he lives in fame , though not in life .
for then i ’ ll marry warwick ’ s youngest daughter .
what though i killed her husband and her father ?
but yet i run before my horse to market .
clarence still breathes ; edward still lives and reigns .
when they are gone , then must i count my gains .
what , my gracious lord ?
richard of york , how fares our loving brother ?
well , my dread lord—so must i call you now .
how fares our cousin , noble lord of york ?
i thank you , gentle uncle .
o , my lord , you said that idle weeds are fast in growth .
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far .
he hath , my lord .
and therefore is he idle ?
o , my fair cousin , i must not say so .
then is he more beholding to you than i .
he may command me as my sovereign , but you have power in me as in a kinsman .
i pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
my dagger , little cousin ?
a greater gift than that i ’ ll give my cousin .
o , that ’ s the sword to it .
ay , gentle cousin , were it light enough .
o , then i see you will part but with light gifts .
in weightier things you ’ ll say a beggar nay .
it is too heavy for your grace to wear .
i weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
uncle , your grace knows how to bear with him .
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower .
why , what should you fear ?
marry , my uncle clarence ' angry ghost .
my grandam told me he was murdered there .
i fear no uncles dead .
nor none that live , i hope .
an if they live , i hope i need not fear .
no doubt , no doubt .
o , ’ tis a parlous boy , bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable .
he is all the mother ’ s , from the top to toe .
well , let them rest.—come hither , catesby .
what think ’ st thou then of stanley ?
he will do all in all as hastings doth .
if thou dost find him tractable to us , encourage him and show him all our reasons .
commend me to lord william .
my good lords both , with all the heed i can .
shall we hear from you , catesby , ere we sleep ?
you shall , my lord .
at crosby place , there shall you find us both .
i ’ ll claim that promise at your grace ’ s hands .
and look to have it yielded with all kindness .
come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form .
one from the lord stanley .
upon the stroke of four .
can not my lord stanley sleep these tedious nights ?
so it appears by that i have to say .
first , he commends him to your noble self .
tell him his fears are shallow , without instance .
and for his dreams , i wonder he ’ s so simple to trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers .
many good morrows to my noble lord .
what news , what news in this our tott'ring state ?
how “ wear the garland ” ?
dost thou mean the crown ?
ay , my good lord .
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ?
indeed , i am no mourner for that news , because they have been still my adversaries .
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind .
the princes both make high account of you— i know they do , and i have well deserved it .
fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?
my lord , good morrow .
think you but that i know our state secure , i would be so triumphant as i am ?
pray god , i say , i prove a needless coward !
what , shall we toward the tower ?
wot you what , my lord ?
today the lords you talked of are beheaded .
but come , my lord , let ’ s away .
i ’ ll talk with this good fellow .
how goes the world with thee ?
the better that your lordship please to ask .
god hold it , to your honor ’ s good content !
there , drink that for me .
well met , my lord .
i am glad to see your honor .
i thank thee , good sir john , with all my heart .
i am in your debt for your last exercise .
come the next sabbath , and i will content you .
your friends at pomfret , they do need the priest ; your honor hath no shriving work in hand .
what , go you toward the tower ?
i shall return before your lordship thence .
nay , like enough , for i stay dinner there .
i ’ ll wait upon your lordship .
the limit of your lives is out .
o thou bloody prison , fatal and ominous to noble peers !
o , remember , god , to hear her prayer for them , as now for us !
the hour of death is expiate .
in god ’ s name , speak .
when is the royal day ?
is all things ready for the royal time ?
it is , and wants but nomination .
tomorrow , then , i judge a happy day .
who knows the lord protector ’ s mind herein ?
who is most inward with the noble duke ?
your grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
i know he loves me well .
in happy time here comes the duke himself .
my noble lords and cousins all , good morrow .
than my lord hastings no man might be bolder .
cousin of buckingham , a word with you .
i ’ ll go with you .
we have not yet set down this day of triumph .
where is my lord the duke of gloucester ?
i have sent for these strawberries .
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning .
there ’ s some conceit or other likes him well when that he bids good morrow with such spirit .
i pray god he be not , i say .
then be your eyes the witness of their evil .
if they have done this deed , my noble lord— if ?
thou protector of this damnèd strumpet , talk ’ st thou to me of “ ifs ” ?
thou art a traitor— off with his head .
woe , woe for england !
stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm , and i did scorn it and disdain to fly .
o , now i need the priest that spake to me !
o margaret , margaret , now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings ' wretched head .
he longs to see your head .
o momentary grace of mortal men , which we more hunt for than the grace of god !
come , come , dispatch .
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead .
but what , is catesby gone ?
catesby , o'erlook the walls .
what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds ?
lord mayor , the reason we have sent— look back !
god and our innocence defend and guard us !
they are friends , ratcliffe and lovell .
here is the head of that ignoble traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected hastings .
so dear i loved the man that i must weep .
what , think you we are turks or infidels ?
i never looked for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore .
and to that end we wished your lordship here t ' avoid the censures of the carping world .
and so , my lord , adieu .
i go ; and towards three or four o'clock look for the news that the guildhall affords .
go , lovell , with all speed to doctor shaw .
here ’ s a good world the while .
who is so gross that can not see this palpable device ?
now , by the holy mother of our lord , the citizens are mum , say not a word .
touched you the bastardy of edward ’ s children ?
his answer was , the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder .
will not the mayor then and his brethren come ?
the mayor is here at hand .
and be not easily won to our requests .
go , go , up to the leads .
i think the duke will not be spoke withal .
now , catesby , what says your lord to my request ?
he doth entreat your grace , my noble lord , to visit him tomorrow or next day .
return , good catesby , to the gracious duke .
i ’ ll signify so much unto him straight .
ah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an edward !
happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grave the sovereignty thereof .
but sure i fear we shall not win him to it .
marry , god defend his grace should say us nay !
now , catesby , what says his grace ?
he fears , my lord , you mean no good to him .
sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him .
see where his grace stands , ’ tween two clergymen .
my lord , there needs no such apology .
you have , my lord .
sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , behold this pattern of thy butcheries .
o earth , which this blood drink ’ st revenge his death !
refuse not , mighty lord , this proffered love .
o , make them joyful .
alas , why would you heap this care on me ?
i am unfit for state and majesty .
zounds , i ’ ll entreat no more .
o , do not swear , my lord of buckingham !
if you deny them , all the land will rue it .
will you enforce me to a world of cares ?
we see it and will say it .
in saying so , you shall but say the truth .
then i salute you with this royal title : long live richard , england ’ s worthy king !
tomorrow will it please you to be crowned ?
even when you please , since you will have it so .
my niece plantagenet led in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester ?
we ’ ll enter all together .
right well , dear madam .
by your patience , i may not suffer you to visit them .
the king hath strictly charged the contrary .
i mean , the lord protector .
the lord protect him from that kingly title !
hath he set bounds between their love and me ?
who shall bar me from them ?
i am their father ’ s mother .
their aunt i am in law , in love their mother .
then bring me to their sights .
i ’ ll bear thy blame and take thy office from thee , on my peril .
no , madam , no .
i may not leave it so .
i am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
thy mother ’ s name is ominous to children .
you shall have letters from me to my son in your behalf , to meet you on the way .
be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay .
o ill-dispersing wind of misery !
and i in all unwillingness will go .
to feed my humor , wish thyself no harm .
no more than from my soul i mourn for yours .
farewell , thou woeful welcomer of glory .
rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow for tender princes , use my babies well .
so foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell .
lady , you know no rules of charity , which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .
villain , thou know ’ st not law of god nor man .
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .
but i know none , and therefore am no beast .
more wonderful , when angels are so angry .
fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself .
fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself .
by such despair i should accuse myself .
thus high , by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated .
but shall we wear these glories for a day , or shall they last and we rejoice in them ?
still live they , and forever let them last .
ah , buckingham , now do i play the touch , to try if thou be current gold indeed .
young edward lives ; think now what i would speak .
say on , my loving lord .
o bitter consequence that edward still should live “ true noble prince ” !
cousin , thou wast not wont to be so dull .
your grace may do your pleasure .
tut , tut , thou art all ice ; thy kindness freezes .
say , have i thy consent that they shall die ?
give me some little breath , some pause , dear lord , before i positively speak in this .
i will resolve you herein presently .
know ’ st thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death ?
his name , my lord , is tyrrel .
i partly know the man .
well , be it so .
how now , lord stanley , what ’ s the news ?
rumor it abroad that anne my wife is very grievous sick .
inquire me out some mean poor gentleman , whom i will marry straight to clarence ' daughter .
look how thou dream ’ st !
i say again , give out that anne my queen is sick and like to die .
james tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
dar ’ st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine ?
why then , thou hast it .
tyrrel , i mean those bastards in the tower .
thou sing ’ st sweet music .
hark , come hither , tyrrel .
go , by this token .
rise , and lend thine ear .
there is no more but so .
say it is done , and i will love thee and prefer thee for it .
i will dispatch it straight .
my lord , i have considered in my mind the late request that you did sound me in .
well , let that rest .
dorset is fled to richmond .
i hear the news , my lord .
stanley , he is your wife ’ s son .
well , look unto it .
stanley , look to your wife .
if she convey letters to richmond , you shall answer it .
what says your highness to my just request ?
my lord , your promise for the earldom— richmond !
my lord— ay , what ’ s o'clock ?
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me .
well , but what ’ s o'clock ?
upon the stroke of ten .
well , let it strike .
because that , like a jack , thou keep ’ st the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation .
i am not in the giving vein today .
why then , resolve me whether you will or no .
thou troublest me ; i am not in the vein .
repays he my deep service with such deep contempt ?
made i him king for this ?
o , let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock , while my fearful head is on !
their lips were four red roses on a stalk , and in their summer beauty kissed each other .
kind tyrrel , am i happy in thy news ?
but did ’ st thou see them dead ?
i did , my lord .
and buried , gentle tyrrel ?
come to me , tyrrel , soon at after-supper , when thou shalt tell the process of their death .
meantime , but think how i may do thee good , and be inheritor of thy desire .
i humbly take my leave .
good or bad news , that thou com ’ st in so bluntly ?
bad news , my lord .
ely with richmond troubles me more near than buckingham and his rash-levied strength .
say that i slew them not .
then say they were not slain .
but dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee .
i did not kill your husband .
why then , he is alive .
in thy foul throat thou liest .
i was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue , that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .
thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind , that never dream ’ st on aught but butcheries .
didst thou not kill this king ?
dost grant me , hedgehog ?
then , god grant me too thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed .
o , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
the better for the king of heaven that hath him .
he is in heaven , where thou shalt never come .
here in these confines slyly have i lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies .
withdraw thee , wretched margaret .
ah , my poor princes !
hover about her ; say that right for right hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night .
so many miseries have crazed my voice that my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute .
edward plantagenet , why art thou dead ?
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ?
give mine the benefit of seigniory , and let my griefs frown on the upper hand .
o harry ’ s wife , triumph not in my woes !
god witness with me , i have wept for thine .
where is thy husband now ?
where are thy two sons ?
thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow ?
these english woes will make me smile in france .
o , thou well-skilled in curses , stay awhile , and teach me how to curse mine enemies .
bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse .
revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
o , quicken them with thine !
thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine .
why should calamity be full of words ?
if so , then be not tongue-tied .
tell me , thou villain-slave , where are my children ?
where is gentle rivers , vaughan , grey ?
let not the heavens hear these telltale women rail on the lord ’ s anointed .
ay , i thank god , my father , and yourself .
then patiently hear my impatience .
madam , i have a touch of your condition , which can not brook the accent of reproof .
o , let me speak !
do then , but i ’ ll not hear .
i will be mild and gentle in my words .
and brief , good mother , for i am in haste .
i have stayed for thee , god knows , in torment and in agony .
and came i not at last to comfort you ?
what comfortable hour canst thou name , that ever graced me in thy company ?
