girt even in death with iron armour and long spears
it ’ s obviously not a supervisor you want but a mint-master to supply you with cash
nothing to do with me
in our timber-yard is some qiang wood from the iron-net mountain across the sea , said the young man
he got up again and demanded to be dressed so that he could go to his grandmother and then to the other mansion
chou chin , cup in hand , thanked the villagers and drained his cup
she ordered a feast to be served to them outside
he said it was to be kept for mr wei
bring that small cedar table over here , directed the lady dowager
she ordered the attendants , in future don ’ t let lin zhixiao ’ s wife into the garden
they had no sooner washed their faces and sat down to drink tea when the gateman came in
can i buy some incense here ?
when baoyu spoke highly of the goose feet and duck tongues served a couple of days before by madam you , she produced some of her own , pickled with distiller ’ s grain , for him to try
let me know and i ’ ll tell the old lady first thing in the morning
at that time , all the men of both jia mansions were in the hall except for baoyu , who had slipped off to join the old lady on the pretext of indisposition , and jia huan who was seldom presented to guests
the prior excused himself and went out
as their minds were made up , they kowtowed to the two abbesses and then to lady wang by way of farewell
as both of them liked dicing because it was fast , they had got two fellows to dice with them on the kang in the outer room where a few other men were playing cards at a big table , while in the inner room a less uncouth party were in the middle of a game of dominoes
confucius and yang hu looked alike but had different names ; lin xiangru and sima xiangru had the same name but looked different
sorry , we didn ’ t know , said the women with a smile
i suppose we have no other choice
we used to have window gauze in four or five colours , i remember
yuanyang chuckled before giving them the old lady ’ s message
your highness is far−sighted , said wang mien
then they read her verse to the melody linjiangxian :
this is our private affair , gentlemen , replied lung san
so heedless of his people 's suffering
because the vulgar herd are afraid of death they tell cautionary tales about the wrath that heaven visits on fools who are not content with their lot or senselessly cut short their lives by indulging in lust or running amok , making away with themselves for no good reason
here ’ s your pledge , i ’ m returning it
then at last baoyu could withdraw
i hope you will write a letter of introduction for me , sir , when the time comes
some of my friends here admire your poetry , sir ; and one day we shall make bold to call on you
we won ’ t stay long ,
but sit down while i prepare a meal for you
our old lady ’ s in a bad temper
since the old lady liked her rough-and-ready ways and her ability to make people laugh , she gave her the nickname numskull and when she felt bored would make fun of her , letting her behave in any way she liked
i kill just one pig a day , and only make ten cents per pig
why do not you call more often ?
she turned to aunt xue
jia lian came in , clasped the corpse and wept without stop
as pledge i gave my belt of splendid sheen ,
when your mistress comes i ’ ll tell her the whole story
lu ascertained the date of your nephew 's birthday when you entertained him to a feast here ; and on his return home i cast both their horoscopes to see whether they could marry or not
you should have let one of the younger girls do this , miss , she said
stop talking such nonsense just after the new year
there ’ s a sameness about all these tales , complained the old lady
in desperation , pinger ran out of the room to find a knife with which to kill herself , but the serving-women and maids outside hastily stopped her and tried to dissuade her
is this the way an elder brother should behave ?
i shall never forget your great kindness , said fan chin
having entered the room , she told him with a smile :
the maid went on with a sigh , it ’ s all right to be fond of cousins , but still there ’ s a limit
the two of them proceeded together to the lou house
we ’ re sure he will do all right
he walked up to the officer
but when later she heard that xifeng was sending her to work for baoyu , she was more eager for this than baoyu himself
xueyan , forgetting herself , blurted out , why , then , our young lady ’ s dying for no reason !
baoyu at once informed the lady dowager , and a doctor was sent to examine her
being in her cups , she pointed at the wall separating the two brothers ’ houses and loosed off a flood of abuse
as they were crying out in consternation , miaoyu 's attendants arrived in search of her
if that 's the case , there 's something i would like to tell you ; but if she has not decided yet i dare not speak out of turn
after dabbling for a while he asked for a towel
pinger and the two others proceeded then to the lady dowager 's apartments where all the girls from the graden were assembled
back in his room he had barely sat down when a maid announced :
he spat in disgust and swore at pinger again
this pleased jia zhen so much that he directed that henceforward baozhu should be addressed as miss , as if she were a daughter of the house
what can one make out of the lawsuits here ?
isn ’ t this a firecracker ?
greatly shocked , ma hurried upstairs to see the sick man ; but he found him at his last gasp , unable to raise his head
a man unjust in deed who would engage ?
rage and disappointment had made her mad !
she says that just before she was born her mother dreamed that she had a length of brocade with coloured designs of the lucky swastika
that is why great personages have always favoured me
second sister ordered two dishes and made him drink a goblet of wine as he squatted by the kang while she questioned him about the jia family
some of his attendants and boatmen were cut down ; while the rest , to escape being put to the sword , jumped overboard and were drowned
such thoughtfulness in little things is good
i ’ ll tell you what to do
lai da went out to pass on this warning , and thereafter the servants were more circumspect
she asked if her carriage was ready
if he were some purse-proud , fivolous official i ’ d be dishonouring your high principles , brother , and i myself would disdain to do such a thing
the following day chu hsien−fu went to the hall to thank his father and mother−in−law and feasted with them
returning with the silver , the servant announced : master tang is here , sir
the central administration was made up of two main sections : the chief government offices such as the inner chancery , the six ministries , the censorate , the office of transmission , the han lin academy , the imperial college ; and offices to serve the imperial house , such as the imperial physicians ' office
now that you are on good terms with that mr chang , you need not be afraid of going short
the next day when he got up , some servants reported that the watermelons and mooncakes for the festival were ready for distribution
we must eat first
how did they get that name ?
what brings you to an outlying region like this ?
ting−hsi hastily ordered the maids to revive her with ginger water ; but when she came to she sobbed and screamed , rolled on the ground and tore her hair
number so once we hit on the right pawnshop , we ’ ll find whoever pawned it and then we can redeem it
he did in fact go out to eavesdrop and heard sheyue ask softly , how did you recover it ?
after paying their respects to the lady dowager , then to ha zheng and lady wang , they all gave way to weeping
finding each other 's company congenial , they soon became good friends
should heart and mind be tested too ,
so they loosed their kites , then dispersed , daiyu going back to her own apartments to rest
then i found a tumbledown temple in the fields to the northeast
so it seems to me a very difficult job
but when tu bade his boy make a search , it appeared they had only five coppers left
it is useless to keep it a secret , sir
the priest chuckled , i myself don ’ t know where we are or who i am
if , however , you are brilliant enough to pass the examinations , you immediately reflect credit upon your whole family
so , thanks to your honour 's goodness , even i came in for some praise !
i am going to the palace today , said chen
the whole : o'er the five peaks the young god wends his way
wang ren for his part was convinced that his sister must have sizable savings , so that even after the raid they could hardly be short of silver
it was her i was thinking of
she doesn ’ t need a foster-mother like you to muck her up !
with your condescension and respect for genius , you must be the best patrons nobles of the kingdoms of wei and chi in the third century bc , they both had over three thousand protégés this mr yang has ever encountered in his life ; yet he has twice avoided you , as if he were afraid of meeting you
before she could fathom his meaning he went on , yesterday i took an oath because of this , and today you provoke me again
but stranger still was the birth later of a son who came into the world with a piece of clear , brilliantly coloured jade in his mouth
and a worse one for deceiving me
don ’ t look so pleased , replied jia lian mockingly
xifeng was strolling along enjoying this sight when a man appeared without warning from behind an artificial rockery and accosted her with , greetings , sister-in-law !
do not let anyone bully him
when presently it was announced that all was ready she started up the hill , leaning on some maids ’ shoulders
how come i didn ’ t know it was given to your mistress ?
it ’ s all the doing of the old man of the moon
xiren put a hand to her mouth to hide her laughter , so amused that she could not speak
never , day or night , did i neglect my duties
when the other women saw how determined she was , they all volunteered to join her
as for that wretch pinger , i thought she was a good girl how could she turn out so sly ?
li wan proposed , as i ’ m a poor hand at versifying , let me just do the first three lines
true to his word , pan proposed the match to mr cheng , compared the young couple 's horoscopes and only asked kuang for twelve taels to buy trinkets and four costumes for the bride
that 's what you must do
i have met him
they found two chambers , smaller than the main hall but most tastefully furnished
i ’ ll get jia lian to write an announcement to hang up by the road baoyu took that day , offering a reward of ten thousand taels to anyone who picked up the jade and returns it , and five thousand to anyone who tells us who has it so that we can get it back
how can he ward off evil and exorcise devils ?
to the petals and there it swings
outside the ornamental gate pages were waiting beside a blue lacquered carriage with kingfisher-blue curtains , into which lady xing and her niece entered
surely there are chief stewards ’ wives to take him in ?
that reminds me , said lady wang
when jingui saw that she was not to be bullied , she tried to pick fault with her in various ways ; but being unable to find any chinks in her armour , she finally had to come to terms with her
what use is that ?
he may believe in the saying that the flowers at home aren ’ t as sweet as flowers growing wild ; but if he thinks that , he ’ s making a big mistake
i have long wished to make your acquaintance , sir , but lacked the opportunity , he said
i was nearly scared to death too last night by the other !
your aunt ’ s eyesight isn ’ t good ; she can help us both with our cards
is your worthy father a servant of the state ?
i was just talking about natural reactions
ifs cold out there
as soon as they ’ d gone i took a peep at it , but couldn ’ t guess what it was
well , if this is the wish of the gods , what must be must be
her name , before she married , was jia min
he ordered this man to put on a long white gown and a tall black paper hat , and to smear his face with lime , for this was how the local devil was supposed to look
show this she forced herself to get up
let 's raise some money between us and lend it to mr chou , so that he can go in for the examination
but i have to leave home for a time on business
then he called to the boatman : bring in his luggage
well , it ’ s my fault for coming
i want you to bring me the pouch which is by the pillow on the bed in the inner room
yucun turned to see flames leaping skyward and the sun blotted out by smoke and dust
after a moment ’ s reflection the lady dowager agreed to this
you know that lake at the foot of this hill and concave crystal lodge by the inlet there ?
so in the garden she was also called adou or fried pea
a roll of silk my form ; my thunderous crash
first thing tomorrow i shall proceed to my post , respectfully accept the seal of office , and then straightway give you fifty silver taels to spread over for several months for your club ’ s refreshments
the others exclaimed in delight after each line
the only objection is that too many poems have been written about it in the past
if it had been any other maid , i would have felt a few taels of silver would be enough ; but jinchuan was with me for some time and was just like a daughter to me
guests staying here ca not manage with one servant only to cook and shop , remarked the abbot woodenly
how could you write such rubbish ?
baoyu , taking jia lian 's hand , sobbed bitterly ; and jia lian too wailed again
and sure enough , when zhixiao came back and looked where he suggested , we found the thing at once
i never thought i ’ d be able to be there when she breathed her last
as he looked rather embarrassed , after sitting there for a while aunt xue got up
however , he did not move but burst into tears
this startled all five of them
qingwen went off with the money , slamming the portière behind her
i roam the primeval void
i ’ d be too scared to get a wink of sleep
very well , replied the magistrate
he locked his door and went with the priest to a tea−house in the old city
jia qin seems to be shaping well
this said , he took a stone from his sleeve and aimed it at baoyu 's heart
an old scholar at leisure
the two scholars were also so overwhelmed with awe that their hair was standing on end
presently wenxiang arrived and some pages ushered him through the inner gate
when the women had left to see to this , xiren went back inside to look for a plate on which to put the gifts for xiangyun ; but the plate she wanted was missing from the carved cabinet
it 's news to me that anyone in trouble should feel in the mood for feasts and operas
the magistrate put his seal on the documents , then told the runners on duty to fetch wan to the hall
that fellow had all his facts right , though !
he turned to bow to her saying , do not worry , sister-in-law
what an ado there would be if you had another bad relapse like that time when you lost your jade !
who would have thought this house would put up with them ?
after stealing and selling it all on the journey , you bring this trumped up charge to clear yourselves !
i ’ ll make it up later if your funds run out
with me in happy red court , we shall be close together and beautifully quiet
as she asked after the old lady and her aunts and cousins , she took in baoyu ’ s costume
lie down , she said , leaving her seat
flushing crimson the two boys demanded indignantly , what have you caught us at ?
but the sight of second sister robbed hu junrong of his senses
future candidates , knowing that there is an easy way to high position , will look down on real scholarship and correct behaviour
how is it that in all these stories , when such things happen , no one has any inkling of it except the girl herself and one trusted maid ?
wan and feng went ashore to stretch their legs , and watched the evening mist scatter as the moon cast its bright reflection in the water
i will peep through a crack , offered xiren , to see if it 's somebody we should let in
apparently mr niu here and your husband are both called niu pu−yi , said hsiang to mrs niu
i ’ d no idea what her illness was till i overheard my mother telling her mother-in-law , and the name meant nothing to me
some servants told her , crab-meat
when yen had read it he said , i understand
better find the other man ’ s family , was aunt xue ’ s counter-proposal
more likely , as the seventh month is the season for melons and fruit and every family is making an autumn sacrifice at its graves , she ’ s felt moved to sacrifice privately in her own quarters , according to the precept in the book of rites that in autumn and spring one should offer the food in season
my old bones are aching , she told aunt xue and aunt li
and she hasn ’ t eaten anything all day
he ’ s set his mind on inviting you to a feast
you can assign anyone you think fit to stay here so as to keep an eye on it
by changing the metre and adding a slightly awkward second line , however , i feel you have made it somewhat flat
he ’ s bound later on to run after women like the very devil
so jia lian had to move to his study in the outer compound , while xifeng and pinger joined lady wang in daily sacrifice to the goddess of smallpox
he found daiyu looking more pathetically frail than ever , although she insisted that her health was much better
the abbot was fainting with fear !
that ’ s not true , he remonstrated
yucun , though he understood barely half of this , nodded and mar-
jia zhen knew he was on bad terms with lady xing , who thoroughly disapproved of him and often complained about him
but some gentlemen of your family found out , and said i would stolen the trees
she asked the two women what new stories they had
tang san agreed to this
xiren ’ s only comment was , you were rather too hasty
lady wang ordered a feast of welcome at which jia zheng 's sons and grandsons poured him wine ; and though xifeng was the wife of a nephew , since she was running the household she joined baochai and the others in passing the wine
feeling reassured , baoyu went to the door and asked :
she would often sit moodily frowning or sighing over nothing or , for no apparent reason , would give way to tong spells of weeping
if a wall starts tottering , everyone gives it a shove
the other day she came herself to report to you
it would be fun to play a drinking game
that 's why both she and baochan are under guard there
yen , however , pretended not to see what he was doing
in wuho , however , this was the talk of the town
nodding she said , all right then
he found beiming having a game of chess with chuyao and squabbling over a move
with a cry of terror , his legs gave way and he fell down
there ’ s no time to be lost
chiung−chih said nothing , but alighted and walked straight into the hall , where she sat herself down
the colour of flowers ?
the next day it was after noon before jia lian arrived
this year is not propitious , said fan chin
and the next day when the lady dowager asked why her eyes were so red and swollen
when at last the feast ended and they prepared to leave , they suddenly discovered that xiangyun was missing
each time they come they reel all this off , as if offering the old lady some rare treasure
but he still insisted on having the money
what is there to say ?
that 's where you were wrong !
your best bet is to go to the big mansion
in swaying dance , now swift , now slow
i am sure you will pass high on the list this year , said mr chi , when he came to see him off
just then a serving-woman hurried in
they ’ re quite different when you compare them
why should a smart young man like master liu suddenly do such a foolish thing , going off with a taoist priest ?
this touched baoyu 's heart , yet also struck him as proof that daiyu had less consideration for him than zijuan
the three girls went to green lattice nunnery
when i was still in chiangnan your fame reached my ears , and now i have come to consult you
the people of wuho are blinded by profit and power when yu yu−ta had buried his parents , he told his younger brother he meant to go back to nanking to thank tu shaoching and look for a teaching post since his money was finished
although you ’ ve repented and mended your ways , you ’ ve already made father , son and cousins guilty of incest ; so how can providence allow you to live at peace ?
proceeding to xichun 's quarters the nuns asked caiping , where is your young lady ?
go easy , warned both the lady dowager and aunt xue
but i ’ ve been so engrossed in talking , a long time ’ s slipped by and i must be getting back now
xifeng stepped forward to whisper , miss baochai is sitting in the inner room ; so don ’ t talk foolishly
she turned back and went in again at once
i hope you will forgive me , sir , for being so remiss
how dare you stall , you little bastard !
if he goes to the examination hall , we will be the spirits of those he has wronged !
looking downwards , they saw a crystal stream cascading as white as snow and stone steps going down through the mist to a pool
as they were feasting , a servant came in with a note writen on fine sungchiang paper folded in the manner of an invitation card
her ladyship 's waiting for you
let 's go back and have a look
ouguan had the fantastic notion that as she used to play young men and diguan young ladies , and as they were often cast as husband and wife , although it was make-believe they should act the part every day as if they were really in love
he carried her to the kang , where he showered kisses on her and fumbled with her clothes , pouring out incoherent endearments
i asked for you in the seal shop , and learned that you had moved here
i am he , replied wang mien , and this is my humble house
that 's no way to talk
it ’ s not as if you were taking a bribe to let a thief escape !
demanded tanchun and daiyu
only a little fruit , what does it matter ?
or go and rave if you must to those petty-minded creatures who are so quick to take offence , and who know how to manage you
there she was indeed informed of her promotion and told to go and kowtow to lady wang , but not to trouble the lady dowager
then getting up slowly he ordered , none of those who came with me are to move
the next day ting−hsi bought more offerings and paper coins with his travelling money , and went back to his brother 's grave
if a mao month happened to fall in a yin year , there would be a double clash and that would undermine her strength , just as in the case of good wood if it ’ s carved too intricately
still playing the innocent ?
how many inmates has it ?
as the garden happened then to be ready for inspection , he had called on his son for inscriptions in order to test him
dusk had fallen by the time he came back , slightly tipsy , and as he lurched into his courtyard he noticed someone lying on a couch there
he brought a bowl of tea from the tea−house for ma , then sat down with him
he could have ladled out a bowl of water anywhere and wept over it to work off his feelings
so much the better
then bowls of strong tea were brought him one after another
i have no son
they ’ d invited a troupe of amateur actors , among them a certain liu xianglian who liked to play the young hero ’ s part in operas
he didn ’ t think you would be back so soon
and therefore instead of entering she turned away , wiping her tears
as this development looked serious and caiping feared she would be held to blame , she quietly went and reported it to madam you
seeing the tear-stains on her face he asked , who ’ s been offending you again , cousin ?
my father knew nothing about it
he looked round but could see no writing-brush or ink , and for fear of being disturbed he read rapidly on
they went inside and looked at three rooms , then came out and sat down again with the abbot to ask the price
he ’ s making great progress , not only in his form
i just feel these clothes i am wearing are not very good , not up to that peacock-feather cape the old lady gave me that year
it overlooked a tiny courtyard planted with several plum trees , a few twigs of which were already in blossom , since the last three or four days had been warm
if i tell an amusing one he ’ ll say i ’ m no good at studying , only able to gab , and blame me all the more
she sent a maid to see what he was doing and ask him over
presently their boats moored at kaoyao wharf
during the morning , the passenger removed a plank from the back of the cabin and caught sight of niu pu
i should think he might possibly be there
on her return to the room she found that lady wang had called and qiaojie was weeping in her arms
after dinner , because it was dark , madam you suggested that they send two men-servants to see qin zhong home , and maids went out with these orders
it ’ s only the possibility of some unforeseen expenses that makes me anxious , for then we ’ d really be in serious trouble
you are a married woman now , said mrs lu and the nurse
is he any relation of yours ?
these two , being in the inner court , did not have to be locked
for suddenly it comes and suddenly goes ,
wait till the lamps are lit , then ask the clerk in charge of this case to come here
the pleasure grounds were named the grand view garden
miss xichun is at home , longing to see you
upstairs he found pin−niang studying chess moves
in this hamper are the pastries you asked for
bending over the depth to listen ,
this reminded the lady dowager of something , and she ordered an old woman to take her instructions to the servants in the garden
why did not you receive dr yu yesterday ?
zhang hua on reflection thought this a good idea
i went up to peking last year , and this year came back to nanking
the board of punishments sanctioned this and after receiving the money issued an order for xue pan 's release
take good care of yourselves
he promised to look after him
then it will be all right
he is quite different from the common run , declared tu
haven ’ t they been kept ?
you should have sent them all to bed
do not forget , that 's all
nursing her grief , the old lady rose to leave the palace and go home by sedan-chair
after two more cups of wine the bawd was tipsy
to think you have been all these years in this business , but you are still so green that in a case like this you want to inform !
the man after his long wait was already somewhat apprehensive , and now he saw jia lian come out in a towering rage
not daring to refuse , the abbot took the gourd , found the old woman on the slope , and handed the gourd to her
that 's why i have come to talk it over with you
his mother hurried out to stop his mouth
making a casual gesture of greeting to the company , he plumped himself down in the seat of honour
going on to read the exegesis he saw that the original , which had been crossed out , started , now it is common for people not to be bent on study
why let this upset you ?
he was just about to go in again when a monk and a taoist priest drew near , laughing and gibbering like two maniacs
some looked familiar , others were combinations of various radicals and numerals
why are you taking my hen ?
one thing i ca not make out , though , is his coolness towards xiren nowadays as well
i ’ m ashamed to speak of it , madam
aware that she had given herself away , wuer blushed furiously
then , seated in his sedan-chair , he heard the men in front shouting angrily and asked them what had happened
good riddance to bad rubbish !
vast number pang palace ,
at once baoyu went to tell the lady dowager , who instructed some trustworthy men to accompany him
i ’ ve never asked you to amuse me either
wait till we have set up the club before laying down rules , said li wan
then she reflected that , good as baoyu was to her , there was still a certain distance between them
to know whether it boded well or not , read the next chapter
the sight stirred her , but whether with joy or with grief she did not know as she stared at them blankly
i couldn ’ t help laughing and told her , even if the two young ladies had bellies as big as a buddha , they couldn ’ t eat five hundred cash worth
he was an official in kiangsi who surrendered to prince ning , whispered wu
if everyone was like you and would not give us a cent , we would have to live on air
i have not much else , she continued
i had the impression that it was about the vanity of all things
are you leaving tomorrow ?
wouldn ’ t that be pleasanter for everyone ?
i am used to it
if there 's anything you want , she said , 'lust let me know
how lively we were in the old days in the garden !
though i edited a collection of essays in chiahsing this year and received several dozen taels as remuneration , i spent the whole sum on behalf of a friend
prince heng loved martial arts , the fair sex too…
shen chiung−chih is taken under arrest to yangchow after the middle of the fourth month in nanking , the chinhuai river becomes quite lovely
i ’ ll pay you well for it tomorrow
so you like wine too ?
however , with jia qiang mediating between them , he was forced to write another i o u for fifty taels of silver
when he passed our gate and saw our jiaoxing buying thread , he supposed that shiyin had moved his household here
mrs lin told pinger , i brought her here first thing this morning
why should she put herself to all that trouble ?
countered baoyu as soon as he saw who it was
if i were so fond of silver , i should not have declined it as i did
'' i do not suppose they are much good , they are just made to order
never mind that , put in chi wei−hsiao
we must have some sort of order
at this the old woman held her peace
very nicely reasoned , indeed !
i ’ m not destined for such good fortune
daiyu , engrossed in reading when she arrived , got up to offer her a seat
the drinking lasts till the moon rises over the plum trees ,
if you do yourself such serious harm you ’ ll fall ill do remember that
~the most troublesome are the old lady 's maids , said xifeng
a fine lot you are , cried pinger
that ’ s not their worst trouble , though
madam you made lady xing , lady wang and her mother take the places of honour , while she sat at a side table with xifeng and baoyu
he turned with a smile to ask her :
as xichun knew her ways , instead of pressing her to stay she saw her to the door
she took yuanyang ’ s hand to lead her out , but the girl coloured and shrank back
one ’ s lin daiyu her mother was the old lady ’ s daughter
again the others exclaimed , that fine word rampaged ’ shows skill , and the turn in the narrative is natural too
the ninth mr hsu told a servant to bring in a gift box containing two hundred taels and give it to mr chen
the child has her grandmother here , demurred lady wang
when she grows up to marriageable age , she ’ s bound to be sent back to the lin family
and she had wrapped up some peony petals in her handkerchief to serve as a pillow
then you can go off and amuse yourself somewhere else till you think she ’ ll have gone
chin tzu−fu and pao ting−hsi also conducted the musicians from the hall and the thirty−six young dancers to the two libraries at the back
he paced the room frantic as an ant on a hot griddle , but there was no sight or sound of anyone
having filled this for daiyu , she offered baoyu the green jade beaker that she normally drank from herself
they filled the streets , and some of them sat on the ground to beg
i can ’ t toast myself here all the time , replied qingwen smiling
at that the whole company laughed
i ’ m such a fool , i was so carried away by their arrival , i never thought of that
when he 's in a saving mood he treasures the least scrap of thread , but at other times he does not mind squandering millions
not too difficult , said xifeng after some thought
baoyu ’ s unexpected visit and the apparent intimacy between maid and master opened their eyes to the true situation , leaving them much reassured
by this time , moreover , brigade general miao had died in gaol , and the announcement of wan 's appointment to the patent office had arrived
in that case we certainly won ’ t give him a wife
well , if they won ’ t join in , why don ’ t the two of us write a poem together ?
because jia zhen was out —though he could have done nothing even if at home — jiao da was fairly letting himself go
i paid no attention , of course
your mother was lord she ’ s concubine , tanchun ’ s mother lord zheng ’ s concubine , and by rights you two should have the same status
i do not feel like it because my present rooms are not as light as those in the garden
this silenced xifeng and she giggled
as even she shows you special consideration , i shall have to explain this to you
when i tell him the real facts , he refuses to believe me
i ’ m certainly out of luck today , madam you laughed , finding so many of you girls in a bad temper
you play too well , sir , said chen
is this enough for a feast or theatricals ?
whether miaoyu lived on in shame after being kidnapped , or whether she resisted and was killed we can not venture to say , not knowing the sequel
soon after the chamberlain had left the imperial edict arrived and was put into force by the officers in charge , who confiscated certain things , returning the rest
wax candles set the sumptuous feast aglow
in the fields just north of our village there stands a small shrine , she said
the lady dowager had been waiting anxiously in the corridor outside the great hail with lady xing , lady wang , madam you , li wan , xifeng and the jia girls , as well as aunt xue
of it on the pole , he waved frantically
so he is your uncle !
then up came an irate matron to drag her away
smiling all over his face , he drew closer to whisper :
she just dropped in for a chat
asking a steward named yen from the yang family to accompany him , he went once more to the capital
you have lost several days over this case , said dr yu
this gentleman often comes to our house , he said , so there ’ s no need for all the maids to hide
how dare you confer the title of mistress on her
after they had paid their respects to the duke and greeted the other guests , everyone sat down to talk
baochai who had heard all this did not say a word , although inwardly she was lamenting
so when they met they could only express their concern in the most superficial way
soon she was out of sight
thus i despaired , my face with sad tears marred ,
that would simply set tongues wagging
yingchun ’ s subject , the abacus , is in constant commotion ; tanchun ’ s kite is something which drifts away with the wind ; xichun ’ s temple lamp is even more lonely and neglected
at this point zijuan came out too and stood in the doorway , and doctor wang , addressing her , continued :
baoyu was so absorbed by his thoughts that when daiyu flicked his eyes with her handkerchief , he gave a sudden start
a big fellow like him calling a boy like you father — isn ’ t that shameless ?
she ’ s one of those who keep watch at night at the south gate of the garden , mrs lin answered
what a dreadful thing -- all those monsters in the garden !
so madam you ordered the meal to be served at once
but if baoyu is really so infatuated , it ’ s going to be difficult !
her skirt of kingfisher-blue crepe was patterned with flowers
soon the feast was ready
and do not wait until the mourning is over to find a wife for ting−hsi—this is important
yet when they look around i ’ ve turned to ash
after all , you ’ re not an old woman or a child
you all make so much of him !
judging by this , mr wei will probably soon become a great official
it shows there are plenty of good ready-made scenes and images from olden days down to the present , but stupid fools can ’ t trot
but by autumn he was worse again and had to keep to his bed
they had been drinking a fair amount as they talked , and now pu mo−ching said : gentlemen , i have a problem for you
practically the whole north side of the street is taken up by their houses , the ning mansion on the east and the rong mansion adjoining it on the west
i can ’ t lay my hands on it at a moment ’ s notice
madam you , now in the garden , had come across xiren , baoqin and xiangyun exchanging stories and jokes with two nuns from the ksitigarbha nunnery
about ten miles outside the city lives a man called shih men−ching , who decided to sell his younger brother 's widow to a man called huang chiang−fu
just leave it to me
zijuan waited for him to answer , but not a word could he utter
wo not you have a game with mr tsou ?
what more is there to say ?
having cursed them roundly he told the chief steward lai da , bring me the roster of servants and check their names ; then write an announcement for them all to read
this is probably about one tael , she remarked
we all have mothers , do not we ?
we are not heavy drinkers , replied lou feng
in fact , because his greatgrandfather had served as a minister , his grandfather as a hanlin , and his father as a prefect , his family had acquired true distinction
the jade he ’ s talking about can ’ t be the right one
if i see such a sight i sha not have lived in vain !
we mustn ’ t talk to him
now there was word from the capital that a request for the reinstatement of former officials had been sanctioned , and he was busily pulling strings to find some opening
i have not been able to afford it yet
remember she ’ s your nephew ’ s wife
on all matters , indeed , they were in complete accord
to know what happened later , read the next chapter
the prince helped him up and urged him not to worry , then informed him of the terms of the new decree
she swept aside the portière and went out
i ’ ve already lost three of you , i don ’ t want to lose one more
well then , how can i charge you interest ?
no , i stayed with chang chin−chai
jia rong went back to tell his parents this , after which he sent for lai sheng to instruct him to prepare the two days ’ feast
the girl 's worry : will the bawd always beat and scold her ?
he passed the palace examination in the third year of cheng te , and is now magistrate of ningpo
so things went on for some time
dr yu could not help being sad
just leave her alone
what more could i do ?
this is why i think you deserve to be called 'precious jade
don ’ t scold the locust while pointing at the mulberry ’
after a while she came back to tell them gaily , i said there was no need to go
but you must not imagine i am someone who enjoys riches and rank and ca not endure poverty
only a good−for−nothing would let his grandfather support him
i myself don ’ t want a cent
as it is , i make six or seven silver cents a day ; and when i have eaten my fill , if i want to strum my lyre or do some writing , there 's nobody to stop me
kneeling to pinger she told her all that she and fangguan had done
as i ’ m lower in status you can lay it on even thicker !
but when will you be wanting us ?
yes , madam , he does
then she inquired why baoyu had not come to greet her
that he was flustered made him blunder along more awkwardly than ever , without looking where he was going
of course she must know
they found another man sitting with tu , and after exchanging greetings they urged the stranger to take the seat of honour
she called angrily , jumping with fright , then hastily mopped her face with a handkerchief
this has not been done before and ca not be too stereotyped
although the sachet had not been finished , the embroidery on it was very fine and she had put a lot of work into it , so he was annoyed to see it spoilt for no reason
she might have remained there in a quandary had not someone come up behind her all of a sudden and given her a shove in the back
the next day at dawn , the maids in the different houses lit the lamps , their mistresses washed and dressed , and the masters made ready too
do you know this man ?
one of them answered , in the shop we did hear a great hubbub outside about some taoist priest , who with just a few words persuaded a young man to go away with him
the lady dowager ’ s gate is closed , and the second master is in the hall looking over the things which have arrived from jinling , so you can ’ t get out that way
a servant had gone on ahead to announce their arrival
you must look after your health , madam , urged mrs wang
aren ’ t you ashamed talking like that ?
well , it has a name , but i ca not think what melody goes with it
that was like burying the living with the dead and showed your cousin ’ s filial piety
call me early tomorrow morning , he ordered his maids
just bring it here ; that ’ s simplest
you ’ d better rest now
what family doesn ’ t have a few tiffs and squabbles ?
presently jia zhen came to report that lots had been drawn before the shrine for the operas , and the first was to be the white serpent
if anyone had told them that a magistrate might respect a man for his character or make friends with him because he was a good scholar , the people of that county would have laughed their mouths crooked
this reminds me of mr liu in the reign of hung wu
that reminds me , when you went to see aunt xue did you broach that business ?
so they laughed and chatted till the plays came to an end , when the wine was taken away and rice brought in
my mother ’ s beating me again
truth will always prevail , they assured him
why are things so different now from in the past ?
kao was obviously running shao−ching down just now , said chih heng−shall
it ’ s still stored with us because no one has ventured to buy it
mr cao chuckled , they call you void , and you really are devoid of sense !
when baochai returned with the clothes a little later she found baoyu sitting in tears beside his mother
one reflection led to another until , after repeated ruminations , he wished he were some insensible , stupid object , able to escape all earthy entanglements and be free from such wretchedness despite the --
beat him to death !
i have never heard of guardian-angel pills
the old lady came partly to see how you are and partly because there ’ s some important business which she ’ d like to discuss with you in our place
he fell in love at first sight and sent to ask for her hand ; but she was already engaged to the son of the former inspector of changan
i wanted to save your face , retorted xifeng
then she slipped over to see xiren and find out whether it was true that fangguan had given wuer the rose flavoured juice
suspecting at first that this was another dream , he propped himself up to look at her more closely
what are you two plolling behind my back ?
as his wife was comforting him they heard shouts and blows outside , and a fierce−looking fellow burst in accusing old kuang 's elder son of taking over his pitch in the market
why act like this ?
at first he could not sleep ; but once he had calmed himself he dozed off and slept soundly all night , not waking until dawn
he ordered them to be invited in
then , realizing the impossibility of banning any reference to osmanthus , she decided to give the flower a new name ; and recalling the story of the osmanthus and the moon goddess , number she changed the name of the flower to moon-goddess flower ’ to add to her own dignity in this way
do not say any more about thanks
what is this , after all , but a bowl of milk ?
if you were still living , she sobbed , i should not care if a hundred others died
the players assented and left
an old taoist priest was sitting in the courtyard mending his clothes ; but he could only gesticulate in answer to her questions , because he was deaf and dumb
you ’ d better go outside if you want us to get up
little did i think we would meet today like this
why play such dirty tricks here ?
i should like some tea
not wanting to alarm her pinger said , she 's a little better ; since you are here , madam , please step in and see for yourself
no wonder you feel upset , sir
an image in the mirror , snow melting away
it was through the school , too , that you met mr xue who ’ s helped us this last year or so to the tune of seventy or eighty taels of silver at least
how dare you make such a row here ?
i didn ’ t have anything special in mind , just wanted to show how i appreciate your kindness to me , aunt , he said with a smirk
there were three examinations at anching
all the others received pouches , silver , handkerchiefs and fans
they should either both be set free or both bound up , as the three of them were together
their ladyships are in high spirits today , daiyu remarked
the concubine was so angry that she darted forward and slapped fangguan on both cheeks
so you are master zhen , immortal one !
just say i ’ ve smashed it
if you overeat you will have a stomach-ache
i will go inside to see her
magistrate tung immediately asked to be excused and went to the office to draw lots
baoyu had never been a good student , and now as he entertained such perverse ideas how could he produce any good poems or essays ?
i put it away , she said
xing dequan although lady xing ’ s brother had totally different interests , being a credulous fool who spent money like water and found all his pleasure in drinking , gambling and debauchery
they don ’ t understand that some things aren ’ t allowed
a stem bearing one flower is the lan orchid , and a stem bearing several flowers is the hui orchid , xiangling told them
then for about a tael of silver he pawned the new silk gown he had made for his visit to the yamen , and decided to look up chi wei−hsiao before doing anything else
she wept and stormed while pinger and xiren restrained her and tried to calm her
when she struck him then sighed and wept without a word , he too was reduced to tears
you can fetch it first thing tomorrow
as regards ability and craftiness , she took after xifeng
bring him that peacock-feather cape taken out yesterday , the old lady ordered yuanyang
master bao wants to give his jade back to the monk
jia yun went into the study and took a seat
but , rich as he was , he was timid
the other eight approved of this idea
let me have a look
lady wang and the other womenfolk had assembled in the hall of glorious felicity to meet him , but first he went to the old lady 's apartments to pay her his respects and report to her all that had happened since his departure
lin zhixiao is outside with something to report , sir
come on now , lung san !
fan chin kowtowed again in thanks , then stood to one side of the road as the examiner 's chair was carried swiftly off
now what had kept xifeng away ?
that won ’ t do , mother
and now that i ’ m serving you , miss baochai has even less to do with me
said lung san , rising
thereupon they started addressing her as the young mistress , and none of the household objected
but i fear from the ghost in the parents ' sign that your father 's health may be affected too
yon must rest properly , not let your thoughts wander
xue pan picked up his cup and tossed it off
it 's all very well for these big things to have yin and yang , but what about mosquitoes , fleas and midges ?
asked by invitation , you do not
are you out of your mind again ?
is your business good in nanking ?
it is only a temporary blockage , however , less serious than the other types
the obituary tablet and notice were inscribed : obsequies of lady qin , spouse of the house of ha , granted a rank by imperial decree off the celestial court
since your relative became the village head , said mr hsun to shen hsiang−fu , he 's been in luck
then she turned to calm baoyu
instead of answering he asked , where is the wrapper ?
i ’ ve had such a fright , she cried laughing
over fresh tea let us talk on and on
we can study together , but we may not be travelling the same road , ' he thought
did you see sister xiren ?
as soon as the servant had left , a native of soochow who was a brewer here sent a messenger to invite them both to his brewery for a bath
the old lady 's grief set the three of them crying too
then ma carefully selected a few volumes of essays from his bookcase and wrapped them up with the clothes
there remained only two maids eager to please baoyu
while she was still speaking her cousin ’ s wife lifted the portiere and burst in , smirking
but apparently it was no use my hoping for that
the idea expressed in this poem is the commonplace one that in human life riches , rank , success and fame are external things
baoyu used to be so devoted to our young lady , why doesn ’ t he come out ?
is not such a person a toady ?
you ' ve been with your godfather for several days and must have got pots of money from the rong mansion
but disregarding appearances , she set her whole heart on enticing xue ke , to carry out baochan 's plan
but to know what happened next , you must read the following chapter
they ’ re all girls , aren ’ t they ?
he was longing , too , for news of zhineng
did you hear master bao talk with someone in his sleep ?
there was no end to their noisy talk and laughter
they have some sense , these country folk , eh ?
the plaintiff has requested that yang be compelled to pay up ; but since he is a salaried licentiate we can not proceed , and he must be deprived of his rank before he can be condemned
seeing that she was toying with the handkerchief to which her pouch was fastened , he felt his waist as if groping for his own pouch
buried in snow the broken golden hairpin
when you have chosen a good day you can come and tell the old lady and elder mistress , then take her over and be done with it
they went back together to wenshang county , where chou chin paid his respects to the magistrate and the local examiner , and officials sent in their cards and called to congratulate him
a few days after this , kuang chao−jen went to the city to thank magistrate li , who now treated him as an equal , entertained him to a meal and offered to be his patron
the greybeard grabbing for a cake is mocked
on her return to her own quarters , she called in xiren to interrogate her
you got that from the line write on plantain leaves and green is the writing
a short one too
leaving jia qiong , jia cen , jia lin and jia qiang to keep the guests company , jia zhen sent to invite someone from the department of astrology to choose auspicious days
the way was long , and wrapped in gloom did seem ,
as hsun mei was leaving the examination school , he saw mei chiu standing by the door and could not resist asking : when did you study with vice−president chou , mr mei ?
that ’ s easily checked on , said pinger
the pleasure−goers buy water−rat fireworks too , which project from the water and look like pear trees in blossom when let off
since fourth brother feng has come , let 's stop riding and go to my rooms for a drink , suggested chin
they were offered seats and pinger handed round tea
as the coffin had been prepared many years ago , and kept ever since in the temple , the funeral was easily managed
after this she went on to write down the following lines composed by herself and others :
even if one of them asked for her , the old lady would never let her go
but i did not have enough money , so i asked a go−between to borrow twenty taels of silver for me from senior licentiate yen at three per cent monthly interest
never mind who they are , stormed baoyu tearfully
these four will take charge of the dinner-sets and wine vessels , and likewise make good any loss
you ’ re talking nonsense too , child
you must help me , brother !
how old are you ?
you ’ re right , nanny , agreed baoyu again
why should she be so cocky ?
jia huan stood in even greater awe of xifeng than of lady wang
they also played a game of chess and read some passages from a book together before xiangling took her leave
baochai pointed a finger at her
it ’ s snowing outside , sir , and the first watch has sounded
where have they gone ?
go out through the back gate and invite dr chang over , he ordered
while saying this baochai had been examining the work in xiren 's hand
what an impressive order !
for birthdays in the past we ’ ve always sent our presents separately , which is stereotyped and rather formal
baochai had answered gravely , you shouldn ’ t ask me that , mother
put it away , said daiyu , then talked a little longer with xiren until the latter left
there ’ s something shifty about young master yun , observed xiren
with a cry of dismay , he ran to the door and saw that the village was on fire
controlling his impatience he slowly withdrew
tu shao−ching went to the inner chambers to ask his wife if she knew anything about this wine , but she did not
i didn ’ t get it too clear , madam
i thought it was the runner from the yamen
this was reported to the emperor , and imperial physicians were summoned
they have neither learned a trade nor studied ; they just live on the old man
remember what yen tze wrote , wei−hsiao , said tu
did not i tell you the other day that there were signs of good fortune on your face , and a high official would soon come into your life ?
she threw down the scissors to brush away her tears
now all these kites were airborne except baoyu ’ s beauty , making him so frantic that sweat poured down his face
our mistress doesn ’ t use cosmetics , so please make do with these of mine if you don ’ t think them dirty , madam , she said with a smile
our poor clan is such a large one that after all these years we have relatives everywhere
when the book is published , sir , he said , i shall let you have fifty copies
and finding her in a good mood she reported :
the scholars wu tsu−hsiang the long and glorious tradition of classical realist literature in china was carried forward in the middle of the eighteenth century by two outstanding novelists — tsao hsueh− chin , author of the dream of the red chamber , and wu ching−tzu , author of the scholars
he bowed to tu and sat down
so i tricked him into giving me his casket which is downstairs now in the shop
this is not half so much fun
that ’ s splendid , said baoyu
how dare you , mingyan !
before the porch hung a placard gilded with the nine-dragon design , and the inscription stars shine on the assistant , which had been written by the late emperor himself
xiangyun , who noticed him slip away , supposed that he was sulking because he had tossed less successfully than the rest
they had never seen such goings-on before and were too frightened to speak
leaving the market , they walked down the main road for over a mile until they met a woodcutter carrying faggots
that is why confucius said : amake few false statements and do little you may regret , then all will be well
who ever heard of gentlemen waiting to go with the ladies ?
you ’ re badly off , i know that perfectly well ; so why should you spend money on me for nothing ?
'what are you doing here ?
by now jia dairu had arrived with jia daixiu , jia chi , jia xiao , jia dun , jia she , jia zheng , jia cong , jia bin , jia heng , jia guang , jia chen , jia qiong , jia lin , jia qiang , jia chang , jia ling , jia yun , jia qin , jia zhen , jia ping , jia zao , jia heng , jia fen , jia fang , jia lan , jia jun and jia zhi
and where ’ s that bald-headed , crotchety abbess of yours ?
he too was a native of jinling of noble ancestry and related to the ha family , with whom he had been on close terms
i came to this house as the bride of a great-grandson , and now i have great-granddaughters-in-law myself
these three things are all presents from the prince of beijing
when will you let me hear you ?
i was dead to all around me
today i went to the yamen to find out what cousin pan 's sentence is , and i heard that two censors have accused cousin zhen of corrupting young nobles by getting them to gamble that is not so serious
presently a white−bearded old man strolled over with his hands behind his back to watch the game
he heard the guards outside shouting
some of the big families here have sent to discuss it , prefect chu told them
having glanced through these , tu shen−ching set them aside
i know , replied miaoyu smiling
at sight of him she glared
why should the silly child keep changing ?
here i am back safe and sound !
on either pillar was this couplet :
pu−yi is my unworthy name
i find climbing mountains or visiting lakes too strenuous
he was wearing a ragged head−cloth , a tattered gown , and shoes with the soles flapping loose
knows how many generations or aeons , sure enough he found mourning-the-red studio , where mr cao xueqin was reading an ancient history
since the actresses have moved into the garden , they ’ ve been living separately , but they ’ re still just as greedy
now i ’ ve got this bad name for nothing and i ’ m dying
sounds like miss baochai , said sheyue
your highnesses will have to ask my nephew jia lian
she kept passing his room , coughing deliberately ; and though well aware that he was inside , she would make a point of asking who was there
when the stewards had received the old nurses ’ instructions , acting as grooms they helped baoyu to mount slowly into the saddle
since the emperor knows him , he is sure to come first on the list
that'numberl help you to manage your own affairs in future and make some friends
that must be baochan or jingui , he thought
did you hear that ?
why do it here , attracting attention ?
we do not need gold or silver , just an ordinary dinner service
since aunt xue had enlisted jia zheng 's help and he had appealed to the magistrate , if the court was asked to punish these officials he might find himself involved
the mossy stones may be slippery , warned lady wang
the lady dowager saw from his robes of the sixth official rank that this was one of the imperial physicians
do not show her yet , said li wan
the last couple of days i ’ ve been thinking of sending for her , answered lady wang
that day , however , while the girls were waiting upon the old lady and lady wang at breakfast , a letter arrived from jia zheng
your excellency must have had a tiring journey
xifeng ’ s eyes smarted again at this
the seats at this were unoccupied , however , as they were waiting on the tables of the lady dowager and lady wang
the girl , frightened out of her wits , burst into tears and knocked her head on the ground as she begged for mercy
the first page had a painting of two withered trees on which hung a jade belt , while at the foot of a snowdrift lay a broken golden hairpin
you saw how wretched yingchun looked yesterday , and heard all that she said
in silence then she turned to trim the lamp
i have never been through such a scene before
so i may as well call in all those loans
that was kind of her
this doctor must have second sight : there ’ s no need for us to tell him anything
if this were false it could only fool one or two people
you forgot to ask me ; it 's i who should fine you people , said xiangyun laughingly
small bridges spanned the brooks
of course a few other relatives attended , but since you did not go you did not know that
the magistrate was thoroughly frightened
sobbing bitterly , she seemed through her tears to see the lady dowager standing before her
did you think i ’ d send you on this errand ?
sheyue , who had been thinking of suicide , was equally relieved by his recovery
if he finds rose petals cloying , take him these
you mustn ’ t mind me butting in , son-in-law , she said
she ’ s a sponger who sucks up to people and goes down on her knees to madam lian for things to pawn
lai da ’ s mother rose to her feet in mock indignation
we carried her back just now in a dead faint , but presently she came to and cried a little
then we can devise an efficacious prescription and submit it to the discretion of his lordship
pin−niang gave a peal of laughter
if you do , i ’ ll really respect you
baoyu was now wearing only a green satin jacket above a pair of blood-red trousers , and qiuwen noticing that these were trousers which qingwen had made for him heaved a sigh
in the afternoon dr yu arrived , to be ushered in by chuang , chih , ma and tu
have you paid your duty calls ?
but who is it that loves them ?
you were quite right
are you the mr chi who judged the operatic contest ?
we can ’ t milk you like this
most of the garden ’ s inmates were innocent , ingenuous girls who laughed and romped all day long without any inhibitions , quite unaware of his feelings
this is clearly a case of enervation caused by too little water and too much wood
next time you get an invitation , miss , i hope you will take me along
bashfully , at the word of command , i take up my pen ;
but it ’ s so seldom i get a free day , why shouldn ’ t i have some fun ?
do have a look
she must be having a hard time of it with her mistress such a martinet , a worse terror even than her
tired out after their recent exertions , they went to bed unusually early and after an uneventful night returned to the court at dawn
at any rate i would take it kindly of you
among the townsfolk , however , some outstanding figures emerged
qin zhong objected that she would be too busy to welcome visitors and might think them a nuisance
the next day , accordingly , wang hui sent men to move hsun mei 's luggage to his house in sticky rice lane , and they stayed together
i was offered the post of instructor when i was growing old ; but since it involved making reports to the superintendent and humbling myself to him i felt it would be too much for my self−respect , and excused myself on grounds of ill health
daiyu realized then that she was indeed rather tired , and after some hesitation she walked slowly back to bamboo lodge on her maid 's arm
the next day when jia lan went to offer his thanks at court , he learned that zhen baoyu had also passed and so they ranked as classmatesyoung zhen , told of baoyu 's mysterious disappearance , expressed his sympathy
i beg your honour to decide between us !
a lovely young lady like you , from such a fine family too , is bound to make a good match and enjoy a life of luxury and splendour
do not mention it any more
i never said i ’ d stay out here all day
back in the hall , intendant hsiang asked : when is your father to be buried ?
just before virgin 's pool a storm sprang up , and tang shih ordered the boat to moor at once
admiration at the fine landscapes , trees and figures carved on them , as well as the seals and inscriptions
this means that the author 's own views must accord with objective reality
xifeng was tempted to tell him about the job of supervising tree-planting which they had in mind for him , but was afraid he might take it the wrong way and imagine she was offering it in return for a few aromatics
low vermilion railings beyond the bamboo grove surrounded a bed of peonies still in bud
without stopping for an explanation , he ordered his two men to strip niu pu of all his clothes , even his cap , shoes and socks
so she handed them a length of silk and two small gold medallions inscribed with the wish that the owner would win first place in the palace examination
i ca not help worrying , because the elder mistress lets things slide and the master 's afraid of being ostentatious
the old lady and lady wang were delighted with this explanation
he then left to tell the servants to make preparations
though it can not speak
and now qinger told zhang hua , as you were engaged to the girl first , if you demand her the court will have to give her to you
baochai ignored him , secretly telling xiren to give him a sedative and talk him round little by little
the zhens are different from other families , observed the lady dowager
don ’ t mix them up !
the lady dowager chuckled
madam you asked lady xing and lady wang , would you prefer to eat here or in the garden ?
so she was so lovely and chaste , he reflected , torn by remorse
i have thought of another
she received this message with a smile and the comment :
this path will take you there
she searched the whole room , but there was no trace of it
her tutor was paid as highly as if he were teaching a boy , and he supervised her studies just as strictly
sixth master sat down on a bench , pulling both girls with him — one on each side
it to requite debts of breeze and moonlight
so i knew that though qingwen ’ s gone her name would still be on your lips
as their host could not prevail on him to stay , baoyu had no choice but to go back with him
she told a maid to burn incense and sat quietly for a while , then looked up the treatises on draughts by kong rong , number wang jixin and others
you are his favourite ; see if you ca not talk him round
did you ask where he lives ?
asked tanchun with a smile
weeping and choking , her face streaked with tears and sweat , she looked most fearfully frail
when baoyu entered the lady dowager ’ s room , he was relieved to find her playing cards there with his mother as if nothing were amiss
in the next year or two i expect to pass the palace examination , and after that , of course , i will need a lot of money ; so for the time being i must hold on to what i have
but why should that be ?
passing through the gate , baoyu observed that all the maids and matrons in the court were beaming
so unseasonable blossom must be an evil omen
li wan and tanchun rose early to attend her until she left , then went back to the hail
well , take that couplet in the poem on the northern borderland :
in gauze cap and official gown , he was wearing flowers and had red silk over his shoulders
what 's all this crying during the festival ?
as it will soon be growing dark , he told us to come home first
jia qin picked it up and read it
i was fortunate , said mei chiu
then having given the monk five cents for incense , he made his servant carry all the left−overs back to the city
overjoyed , he immediately heated six or seven pots more , obtaining from them six or seven more ingots
she was rather vexed herself too because the game was so dull
xifeng , before she even started to speak , gesticulated with both hands and doubled up with laughter
the next day i called at the yamen , and although his honour had just returned from the county school and had a great deal of business to attend to , he immediately set it all aside and invited me in
let 's wait a little , answered yu with a smile
after zhang cai ’ s wife had finished her business and returned the tally , the other was sent with it to get wall-paper
she was wondering whether or not to go back when the sound of talk and laughter inside -- she distinguished the voices of baoyu and baochai -- upset her even more
lady wang told xifeng to take all the gifts to the old lady for her inspection , and to get xiren to let baoyu know as well
just look at this household !
we ’ ve more important things to see to
distraught by this news siqi thought , even if there ’ s a scandal we ought to die together
put in baochai quickly
jia zhen now disposed of this rent in kind as follows : part was kept for the ancestral sacrifice ; part delivered by jia rong to the other mansion ; part kept for family use ; and the rest divided into different shares and placed on the terrace of the main hail , where the younger men of the clan were summoned to collect them
he begged on his knees
what really matters , the messenger can tell you
four smart attendants in silk and brocade , each wearing new shoes , served tea punctiliously ; and when their master bade them prepare a meal , they assented together before they left the room
at this there was general laughter
she was meaning to visit the girls when xichun sent a maid to invite her over
at this point xifeng came in and paid her respects to both her seniors in turn
is there anyone in the county who does not know him ?
are you dressed like a gentleman of means with a responsible post ?
just work it out for yourself !
she then turned to jia rong and said , take uncle bao to rejoin the others while i stay here a little longer
this sounded to baoyu like a reflection on him
no , that won ’ t do
this is not a regular sacrifice , she said
what a thing to say !
we can always come and ask for more when it 's finished
pity this child of a wealthy noble house
you do not take medicine at random like that
xifeng tossed it off
you should be pleased by his appointment instead of worrying like this
four or five days later kuang ta came home early , bringing a pot of wine and a chicken which he ordered his wife to boil to welcome his brother home
cousin xifeng really is growing rather thoughtless
whatever he 's like , he 's your brother-in-law , she said
if she doesn ’ t know any better , you should have told her
an old man like you need not stand upon ceremony , they said
and now baoyu walked over to make her a deep bow
after more curses he swaggered to his sedan−chair , followed by the servants and luggage
all we ’ ve heard is that my brother has been arrested by the county yamen for killing a man outside
when they had reached chao 's house and sat down in the hall , feng asked chao to unfasten the chains on wan 's neck
xiaoyan and sier , who had been awaiting this order , immediately called for the gate to be unlocked and went off to the different apartments
just then someone in the yard started bellowing , i have always said those nuns , bawds , go-betweens and the like are no good !
does not he want the money then ?
let me send to aunt xue for some , proposed lady wang
we have so many people here , if we don ’ t make an example of one of them the bigger offenders will get quite out of hand
she went dejectedly back to her room and lay down to think it oven
people said he had no manners and should know better ; but later didn ’ t he tell us in confidence , you know , sisters , it ’ s not that i had no sense of respect , but those monks are so dirty i was afraid you ’ d find their stench overpowering
it was thoughtful of you to send over to ask how she was the other day
the two of them went together then to the lady dowager ’ s quarters
why stir up more trouble ?
still , it 's natural , you know , for her to see things rather differently
from it alighted an old man in a square cap , white gauze gown and red silk slippers , who had the red nose of a heavy drinker , and a long , silky , silvery beard
i forgot just now to suggest that you should make up some riddles in his presence
i heard some talk of that , put in chih , but never knew the details
xiren and the others told him to go out to meet them and pay his respects , for though deranged he could still get about as usual
ducks in red rue studio foretells the future
ni is looking for his sixth brother
as she tossed and turned someone called softly through the window :
this done , he took a seat in the temple annex and called jia zhen and jia lian in to ask about family affairs
in all the different young masters ’ and mistresses ’ households , which nurse or nanny doesn ’ t get certain perks
after the death of the duke of rongguo , his elder son jia daishan succeeded to the title and married a daughter of marquis shi of jinling , by whom he had two sons , jia she and jia zheng
her chance came at noon one day when aunt xue , baochai and daiyu were eating water-melons in lady wang 's apartments
instead she told fenger who was standing near by to take word of this at once to their lady ships
if there would been a scandal , not only would he be dismissed -- our ancestors might even be deprived of their titles !
you have thought it all out !
she seems to fit this description of qingwen ,
two rugs were spread at the foot of the slope under the fragrant osmanthus trees for the serving-women and the younger maids , who were urged to eat and drink as much as they liked and not to come unless called
how can men commit a murder and go scot-free ?
i was just going to tell you something , said the old lady
though she did not say so outright , her attitude was so clear that her parents could not accept the offer for her
would you like to meet him ?
baoyu pressed them to stay , but mrs lin had already led her party off to finish making their rounds
my mother has been dead now for more than three years
so many inlaws and nurses chipping in for your birthday , yet you ’ re still not satisfied
he asked pointing inside
the old lady nodded
and if this experiment fails , we can think of something else
yinger hastily reported this to her mother
he examined it and it was certainly solid
i was serving at the bar
presently jia zheng returned , as he still had misgivings about the old lady
so saying , she too stepped forward without thinking and reached out her hand to wipe his perspiring face
braving the cold it blossoms for the east wind
if it ’ s an immortal ’ s gate , that won ’ t be easy to enter !
well , whispered pinger
squat down there until we come back and don ’ t make a sound
thinking it wisest to make herself scarce , she told hupo :
so that ’ s who he is !
we came to congratulate the old gentleman on his birthday , remarked lady xing and lady wang
he diagnosed baoyu ’ s upset as a slight one , a mild case of indigestion and a chill which sweating would put right
then a lucky day was chosen for the new tutor to take up his duties
if you think it good , you must drink another cup , madam
a few days ago a son was born to mr hu , explained the abbess
well , she lives in bamboo lodge and she 's always crying
i have long heard of your fame
baoyu had skipped through these , noting here and there a well-written paragraph or argument or certain digressions , amusing anecdotes or poignant sentiments
it goes without saying they ’ ll appear rather delicate
i shall report this to the mistresses , so look out for a thrashing !
true understanding need not be sought far away
when did he pass away ?
as these messengers left baochai exclaimed joyfully , can it be our xue ke and his sister ?
the medicine was brought and decocted , and xiren drank it
yet silver and gold they prize
mrs zhou demurred , the other day she scolded wang shanbao ’ s wife and boxed her ears for being too officious
when they looked at my arm , it was not even bruised
so you ’ d better not go in
very well then , he said to baoyu , smiling
all you understand is eating , drinking and whoring
when jia zhen and all the young men had dined , the party broke up ; and there is no need to describe the entertainment they offered all their kinsmen the next day
no , when the first emperor ascended the throne , he merely relied on the geomancers to choose an auspicious burial ground for his line
huan answered , the tutor has some business today , so he ’ s given us one day ’ s holiday
i gave my age as thirty
however , two doses of medicine failed to cure her - she raved more wildly than ever
one of them replied , i have long known of your brother lord she 's unseemly conduct , and master zhen of that mansion was even more profligate
whispered zijuan , her tears falling like rain
i need money right away
when she was five or six he had engaged a tutor to teach her the four books and the five classics , so that by the time she was twelve she could expound the classics and read essays , having thoroughly mastered the works of wang shou−hsi
i ’ m just feeling slightly better ; i don ’ t want to lose my temper
because even if someone promised to take a message , he might not deliver it
why are you sighing ?
this reference to cakes is a classical allusion
of course he was delighted to be sent for
he steeped a bowl of rice in hot tea , added some diced pheasant and hastily swallowed this down
after he had collected the other passengers ' fares they set out , and soon the boat reached swallow cliff
some pages were going to fetch them when huan stepped forward and caught hold of his father 's gown , then fell on his knees
would she make up something against you ?
thanks to the generosity of your masters above as well as your parents below , you were able to study like a young gentleman , cossetted by maids and nurses as if you were a phoenix
think i was freezing to death here ?
let those carts in at once !
yellow in the face with a red beard , dressed in green
pointing at two dishes in a hamper yuanyang remarked :
whenever this geomancer found a site , the others who checked on it would prove it was no good
in the absence of news of miaoyu he kept brooding
swaying a little , baoyu called over his shoulder , she has a better time of it than our old lady
what are the symponis of this illness of yours , miss ?
i am an ignorant villager , said wang mien , and did not recognize your highness
he 's often used them
limp and out of breath , his heart misgave him
after sprinting a dozen miles without taking breath , he put the old man down
in regulated verse ’ it ’ s just a matter of opening , developing , changing and concluding ; and the developing and changing couplets in the middle should be antithetical
oh well , each one 's romance is fated by heaven
the tender youth had never seen bastinadoes before ; so , frightened out of his wits , he said whatever the magistrate wanted to hear , not daring to contradict him
i am keeping watch over this fairy plant , and no mortals are allowed to loiter here
did you hear of the death of concubine zhao whom you met here ?
i have never fed anyone
his learning is profound
the others commented with a smile , this is really in a tragic vein
you won ’ t like what i ’ m going to say , but your father isn ’ t strict enough with you , and the old lady always shields you
the illusory land of great void is the blessed land of truth
once you get into that habit you ’ ll never cure yourself of it
that 's why i came
it isn ’ t all that important
and melilotus leaves i took to stem
when people called her 'concubine ' she swore at them and insisted on being called amadam
but because he was too honest , sir , nobody liked him and he offended some people
xue pan , hearing this , gradually got over his rage
try to remember , or just go and ask them
you have to wait for the snow to melt in spring and run down the mountain before men and beasts can find water
and we don ’ t know yet how to raise two hundred to redeem it
what i told you that day was what i heard from hongyu
after an exchange of amenities lady wang sent to invite zhen baoyu in too , having heard that he was the image of he~ baoyu
your cousin daiyu , on the other hand , was narrow-minded and hyper-sensitive ; that 's why she did not live long
xiaohong , in fact , had been quite taken in
now , fourth brother , said chin when they rose from the table , you must show us what you can do
then you haven ’ t heard of the beating lord she gave master lian ?
is it serious , nanny ?
then he added , what a pity you ’ ve dirtied your new clothes too
you won ’ t catch cold , and sitting quietly by yourself you won ’ t be distracted either
having greeted xifeng in her usual teasing fashion , madam you led baoyu to a seat in the drawing room
the two sisters put down their sewing at this to chase him playfully and pummel him
the next day he packed up and crossed the yangtse
what do you think ?
and as she took a seat , tanchun and baoqin got up and asked to be excused
yuanyang saw that this was done , then asked the matrons whether the boxes of titbits to go with the wine were ready yet or not
hurry up and plead with her !
we would know it , but that 's no proof in a court of law
you can kill him or slice him to pieces just as you please !
back in his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed
his host saw him out
he felt even more touched
wouldn ’ t that be the smart thing to do ?
and there are two more jars of lichees which miss baochai wants sent to master bao
just let it be
she could be seen in the distance wearing a big cape with a grey squirrel-fur hood , seated in a small bamboo sedan-chair sheltered by a black silk umbrella , and surrounded by her maids , each holding an umbrella
then the auspicious hour arrived and they went in two sedan−chairs , preceded by lanterns , to the bride 's home
you may think eggs are easily come by , knowing nothing about conditions outside in the market
they exclaimed in surprise
his father and mother sat facing each other on the kang talking , while on a row of chairs below sat yingchun , tanchun , xichun and jia huan , all of whom except yingchun rose to their feet at his entrance
to tell the truth , i ’ m clumsy
its back door overlooked the river
unless a man could write paku essays , he was not considered a scholar
then xifeng called for clean bowls and chose dishes for baoyu
jia rong agreed at once to pass on this message
what does it matter ?
if you fell into his clutches then , that would be worse
it ’ s not me they ’ re thinking of , laughed his father
a thousand woodland birds begin to stir ,
if there would been just one worth keeping , i would have someone to help me now
before long the doctor arrived and felt her pulses
i heard you were ill , said mrs lin
seeing fangguan blowing on the soup , she hurried in
why are you so angry ?
we had better go back to yicheng and prepare for a long journey
jia rong , being young and not involved , is to be released
xifeng took the jade from the old lady and went in with xiren to show it to baoyu , who had just woken from a nap
he was the one wearing the jade , so he ’ s the one you should ask instead of me
scholars should base their careers on success in the examinations
when did you get here , mother ?
i am only afraid after he 's joined the government and become chief examiner , he will miss genuine talent when he marks the candidates ' papers
on it was inscribed in large characters happy land of
i am afraid my relatives may object , said mr
that would never do
but it 's true , put in lady wang
their family may be transferred to the capital
but this small room is even better furnished than that big one , with all these fine things -- whatever they are called -- in it
i can use my own discretion in other matters , she replied , but i can ’ t obey you in this
when he had prostrated himself and burnt a magic formula to invoke the oracle , he asked wang hui and hsun mei to support the brush
those two are all right , rejoined sheyue
xue ke gave a start
yes , said yen ta−yu
yet now she will wear furs and be a fine lady
as the maids had gone to fetch tea and there was no one else present , jia lian kept darting smiling glances at second sister , who lowered her head to hide a smile but did not respond , and he dared not make any further advances
xifeng smiled at this blunt way of talking
then she urged second sister to put on her jewels and they went out hand in hand to mount the carriage , in which they sat side by side
zhen to share out her belongings
asked the lady dowager anxiously
the old woman was hard of hearing
then along came brother liu in the nick of time to drive the brigands away , rescue our goods and save our lives into the bargain
so if i were you i ’ d appeal to madam lian
then in her concern she burned out and made lai wang 's wife summon all the serving-women to assign them different tasks
baoyu , by nature restless , hankered after a stroll in the garden
pieh and feng were so terrified that their feet seemed nailed to the ground
buy a few cakes first , and i will tell you when i have eaten
but there is a masculine beauty too , which is seldom recognized
on the evening of the third day an oil lamp was lit on his table , and the room was crowded with relatives
so you can see all that happens to us is predestined , and it 's no use worrying
going in sheepishly , he fell on his knees before the lady dowager
so your mistress is allowed to cheat , but i ’ m not allowed to bribe you , teased madam you
to revert now to baoyu
yes , after all , it ’ s the old who are the most experienced , observed xifeng
everyone praises your aunt xifeng , he said , but to my mind she can ’ t stand comparison with your second aunt
it ’ s easy for you to jabber away on the kang , gouer retorted
i am only a slave , though , so what can i say ?
don ’ t be afraid ; i ’ ll protect you , he promised her
let ’ s all fish to try our luck , proposed baoyu
you mustn ’ t spend any more on me , protested granny liu
bailiff wu of the manor in black mountain village has arrived , sir , he reported
aren ’ t you afraid of catching cold ?
baochai drew her fan from her sleeve and ran after them over the grass
he ’ s come here several times to ask for it back , and when he fails to get it he points at me and scolds , don ’ t put on those ladified airs with me !
since all your maids ’ things are here , there ’ s no need to search , replied xifeng with a smile
as soon as he saw the memorial he asked what official post ha jing had held , and the board of ceremony reported that he had been a palace graduate , whose ancestor ’ s noble title had passed on to his son jia zhen
once they knew they had been tricked , they darted wildly out
i want to go to take the prefectural examination
so for a fortnight daiyu ate daily less , till her appetite had so diminished that she could not even swallow a mouthful of congee
fangguan ’ s too fussy , said qingwen
li wan was on the point of explaining , but madam you stopped her
she , however , now went to madam you ’ s sitting-room , the floor of which was covered with a red carpet where stood a large gilded cloisonne brazier , its three legs in the form of elephant trunks
i hear you are from the yangtse valley , sir , said hsiao
lai wang ’ s wife relies on her mistress ’ power
just then xifeng came in to pay her respects , and lady wang wanted a detailed account of the party -- -the other guests , the operas and the feast
what are you afraid of ?
i longed to travel far , yet with no bourn ,
i have long hoped to meet you , said yang
then tanchun and the others went back
then i will send her horoscope over , you get someone to choose an auspicious day , and the thing will be done
then came a large sedan-chair in which was seated an official in a black gauze cap and red robe
as she was speaking jia rong ’ s wife , having finished her toilet , came in to pay her respects
and since chen was another man who prized one copper as highly as his life , the two of them hit it off well together
i do not think the subject and rhymes should be decided by one per-son , yingchun demurred
why deny it when we have proof ?
i consider our families well matched and think this should be a good marriage for tanchun
whenever magistrates and prefects pass by , they go in to pay their respects
i have come to say goodbye to her
baoyu knelt down and first asked after their ladyships ’ health , then inquired after jia lian ’ s health
the young man , who was tired , entered a roadside inn to rest
there were such famous beauties as wang qiang , xi shi , fan su , xiaoman and jiang xian
tomorrow you can ask him
so why have these people come ?
liu xiangiian ’ s eyes flashed with anger
how can you abuse her like this ?
the days were so long that after lunch masters and servants alike were exhausted
keqing led the party to an inner room , where baoyu noticed a fine painting of the scholar working by torchlightnumber without even seeing who the artist was , he took a dislike to the picture
butcher hu was coming to offer his congratulations
countered yingchun with a smile
afterwards they sipped tea and chatted or amused themselves as they pleased
what has that letter got to do with you ?
yet he was annoyed with me because of this and since then has cold-shouldered me
do you have a fever ?
in fact , i think this hall is too big and would prefer to have a single feast in your library ; so that the four of us can talk comfortably at the same table
whatever is the fellow driving at in this essay ?
seeing that they were determined and not to be dissuaded , she could not help feeling a pang of pity and sent for gifts for them as well as for the abbesses
she has no parents , poor thing , no one to care for her
this will prevent any scandals here and save us money too
he called for zixiao
this academic discussion has a bearing on our business , replied baochai
and nothing is left behind
this was the rong mansion
even li bai copied from yellow crane pavilion ~ when he wrote his phoenix tower
meanwhile refreshments had been served
you know that monster always talks nonsense , she said
the double ninth festiyal is near
then baoyu tried again
since they robbed us yesterday they must have taken the opposite direction
the rest were loud in their praise and jia zheng nodded
go in , uncle wang , and announce that the third mr tsang is here , he said
we come from the same district as your master , said the brothers
mrs zhou walked into the adjoining room and found xichun laughing and chatting with zhineng , a young nun from the water moon convent
he simply lay down quietly on his bed , leaving the three girls to chat in the outer room
she sent off your bad luck for you
because of you i got kicked and beaten
then , borrowing a small boat from a neighbour , the old man had all his purchases put aboard and rowed to where yang chih−chung lived
they were chatting together when a young maid came in and whispered to hupo
so whom is your honour going to arrest ?
at first , they dared not venture out at night , so that birds and beasts ran wild ; then , even in the daytime , they would only go there in groups and armed with weapons
who can we get to help us out ?
after they had agreed to do this , he went to enlist the help of other colleagues
i can ’ t go on shamming illness indefinitely
quite a coincidence that , they commented , these two cases one after the other
having no interest in other provinces , he was eager to find his native place and soon discovered one cabinet labelled first register of twelve beauties of jinling
they looked at each other ’ s poem
she asked , more puzzled than ever
do not worry , sir , li rejoined
if she does it again we ’ ll punish her for both
commissioner zhao rose to his feet
we ’ ve consulted oracles too , and they all say we shall find it in a pawnshop
its bright splendour lights up the painted balustrade
speechless , they could only sob
she ’ s the only one here fit to be compared to a hibiscus
the lady dowager prays to heaven
colleagues must stand by each other
this is something auspicious and good ; there ’ s no monster here
when i came in and looked for zhou rui 's wife she was nowhere to be found , and a little girl told me she would been driven out for doing something wrong
lord zheng , you must wait prudently for a further decree
after paying their respects they returned home , instructed their cook to prepare a feast for the next day , and sent an invitation to the compiler saying that they wished to celebrate his home−coming
we ’ re too hard up to gad about
thus jia lian , going home that evening , found the place uncannily quiet
whatever sum ’ s given , who would dare to complain ?
baoyu first drank half the cup , as no one was watching , then passed the rest to fangguan , who drained the cup
three years ago when i thought about this question too , she was my first choice
very good , was li gui ’ s answer
if i do , you must not let her know
she took it for granted that her husband had completed his studies and would soon pass the metropolitan and palace examinations ; yet , even after they had been married for nearly two weeks , he still paid not the slightest attention to the essays which filled her room
it ’ s no use play-acting
lady wang who had taken to the boy answered readily , i would like to act as go-between myself
but i haven ’ t dirtied the bed
as soon as you get up your headache will stop !
it 's kind of you to put up with it and let her have her own way
the old man swore
this took the wind out of her sails
caiyun explained , this seems to be all we have
please take your seats at table , gentlemen , he said
but if we wait till these are no longer problems , baoyu ’ s father will be gone , and what shall we do if his illness gets steadily worse ?
later your father came to dine with us
but we ’ ve plenty of troublesome business here , and now that her ladyship ’ s growing old she sometimes forgets things
either but if you are afraid you will be lowering yourself , i wo not presume to lend it
i will say goodbye to you , uncle , and go back to my boat
baoyu caught hold of her hand then and asked softly :
he 's sure to come back this way
one day she had just gone in when she heard an old woman at purple caltrop isle raising a rumpus
now fangguan came in with a small glass bottle about five inches high
aunt xue murmured agreement , then added , i wonder if you ’ re not , perhaps , rather partial to the wife for your younger son , madam ?
with his catapult at his belt and his sword in his hand , hsiao charged fearlessly at the head of his men , cutting down all the tribesmen in his path
he then followed the matrons out again
yuanyang felt no fear but wondered , who is she ?
when yang heard how they spoke , he felt even greater admiration for them and exchanged some courtesies with chu hsien−fu
there was nothing ostentatious about her costume , which was none too new
~granny , she said with an effort
yes , mother , said wang mien
this has been so from time immemorial
how can you carry on in this crazy way ?
what i do is none of your business
gentle and demure , she looked very approachable
will you do some copying too ?
still , since we belong to the same village , i wo not say any more
she knew lady wang must be referring to him
baoqin cut in gleefully :
in future she 's to have the same treatment as concubine zhao , only her share is to come from my allowance , not from the general fund
gradually all the other guests left too , only kuo tieh−pi and lai the taoist priest staying behind to spend the night in chu−ko 's room
if i am hurt i wo not blame you but mr chin
now is the time too use them
of course they can
who do you think you are , ting yen−chih ?
as xiangyun said this she unwrapped her handkerchief from which she took a ring and passed it to xiren , who was loud in her thanks
these last few months i have saved a dozen strings of cash
your patron , mr tang , was a pupil of my grandfather ; so i feel very close to you
how can you compare with her ?
my brother-in-law lin ruhai , who was salt commissioner of yangzhou then , engaged him as a tutor for his daughter
i shall resign in a couple of days and leave here
on my return from court i happened to be passing this way , so i decided to call on your father , little thinking that he was already no more
but fan chin brushed past them into the house to look at the official announcement , already hung up , which read : this is to announce that the master of your honourable mansion , fan chin , has passed the provincial examination in kwangtung , coming seventh in the list
today she sent me back ahead to have a look , and i ’ m to go out of the city at the fifth watch tomorrow to meet her
his wife , holding back her tears , went to tell the lady dowager that yuanchun was ill and they were to call to pay their respects to her
he also set a table there with incense−burners , candlesticks and pennons to call back the spirit
as she said this a maid came from lady wang to summon xifeng , who took her leave of li wan
i lost my mother when i was a child , and was lucky to have a few peaceful years here with you , auntie
she asked her age as well as the hour , day and month of her birth , and wanted to know all about her family
do not tell me he 's in charge !
seeing miaoyu turning away , she guessed that bao yong must have offended her
there 's no time like the present
who is there now to speak so sweet and low ?
at the start , his subordinates were apprehensive and tried in all manner of ways to ingratiate themselves with him
he desisted then , demanding with a smile , will you talk that way any more ?
and jingui , besotted by her infatuation , indulged in the wildest fantasies which blinded her to his real attitude to her
though my heart aches , i haven ’ t many tears to shed
i do not want to spoil my reputation by giving the impression that i am out for profit ; yet if i put your name down after mine , people will think that you finance the publication and that i am working for money
too excited to sleep soundly , baoyu got up the next day as soon as it was light to draw the curtains
yucun turned and saw that it was zhang rugui , a native of this place and his former colleague who had also been dismissed from his post for the same reason as himself , and had returned home to yangzhou
however , i am all too conscious that my essays are unsatisfactory
xiangyun chuckled , it would be thirteen !
when the boatman had paid him for the water chestnuts , he rowed away
besides , however good she may be , she ’ s lower in status than i am
after admiring this they read baochai 's poem :
go back to bed now
asked dr yu , going out to receive them
when baoyu stepped into the garden , it struck him as a scene of desolation
if you ’ re too honest and don ’ t know any tricks , your father and mother-in-law will think you a simpleton and the household won ’ t respect you
but now you are growing up
he ordered , then turned to zhou rui
the big bamboos were now in constant use
i propose we call her queen of the bamboos
no , she hasn ’ t been over there recently — she ’ s only just left her bed
pinger holding it on her palm found it light , pinky white and fragrant , delightful in every respect
fearful that granny lin might tire xifeng out with her loquacity , pinger tugged at her sleeve and said , you mentioned her ladyship whom you have not seen yet
i doubt if your family could produce anything half as good , and that ’ s not boasting either
i put it by the tiller
and not only that , she didn ’ t treat me as warmly as she used to
roaring with laughter the rest said , how side-splitting !
what was your reply , sir ?
____________________ in ad he was sent by the han emperor to the western regions , and spent thirty years in what is now sinkiang
we are not interested in becoming rich or noble
as she was speaking they heard a clattering as if some things had fallen to the ground , and the next minute qingwen appeared
he ordered his servant−boy
just think how busy he must be !
that would be set in kweichow
if you were to be upset again and fall ill , how could your sons bear it ?
so your cousin ke has come back , making it possible for me to come over
jia lian , beaming , rushed to embrace her , pouring out an incoherent flood of endearments
he thought , the relationship between these two has changed , they now seem ten times better friends than the others
you ca not open your mouth without raving !
then the girl knew she was trapped
i ca not make enough to feed or clothe myself properly , sir , he replied
yes , it must be her !
i have prepared a scroll here , and anyone who would like to contribute can sign it
how could he possibly guess that the lou brothers had championed his cause ?
mr lou was in complete charge of all financial transactions , and my father never questioned him
of course , it is foolish to judge men by their success or failure , said prefect chu
sheyue remarked , no wonder the old lady keeps warning us , there mustn ’ t be too many mirrors in children ’ s rooms
then he took a boat back to the south , and returned to his teaching
fan chin 's mother ran out and called after him , just frighten him a little !
i will call when i am in the mood , miaoyu promised her
jia zheng shook his head
in that flurry who ’ d know what happened afterwards ?
these apt generalizations give us the main theme of the scholars in a nutshell
you have over two hundred taels , brother , left from that sum for buying silk
if you ’ ll really do that i ’ ll let bygones be bygones
the other was empty , ready for their favourite dishes
daiyu ’ s just out of bed and yingchun ’ s ill again
first go and get me some water

so he has two sons and a grandson
then sheyue gave her water to rinse her mouth and poured her half a bowl of tea
i shall have to teach you a lesson
he sent me on ahead to see how you are , madam , and to beg you to stay till the whole business is finished
she wanted to keep it in readiness for whenever i might need money in a hurry
a day was quickly chosen on which jia lian and daiyu took their leave of everyone and , accompanied by attendants , set sail for yangzhou

he slipped out of bed , took the lamp , and went over to have a look
at once all looked round
the two ladies rose protesting laughingly , please take seats , gentlemen
chiung−chih had the seat of honour , mrs tu the place of hostess , and mrs yao a seat at one side , while tu sat by the window
don ’ t make me say things you ’ ll be sorry for !
go and get qiuling to fetch my handkerchief from my room , she ordered
constant to ten thousand boughs ,
what if i do this ?
in general i am against a hard-and-fast rhyme pattern , replied baochai
laughing up her sleeve , zijuan went out to do this and heard a clamour of voices in the garden
all the men in wuho are accustomed to sleeping with these big−footed maids
that was true twenty years ago , retorted chien

now that i have found you , i am sure we shall be able to pull this off
even in the yamen they do not know , he reported
what ’ s really the matter ?

the trouble with them is that they don ’ t study hard

he will be only too pleased to come

and then he heard daiyu address baoqin as younger sister ’ without mentioning her name , as if they were real sisters
when he received his fee , he would buy what he needed to eat and give what was left to any poor man he happened to meet , not keeping a cent himself

after all , the master acted too hastily and was guilty of two offences by marrying during state mourning and family mourning
how can we control her ?
as our house was searched , to list any valuables would be reprehensible
however , those rebels were crafty
you leave that alone !
but although commissioner chou had had this man driven out , he still read his paper
while they were drinking , kuang told him all that had happened ; but after expressing his admiration ching steered the conversation round to pan number three
he 's two years younger than i am , and has passed the district examination too
the whole business is over !
since we are related , we invite him to several feasts each year , but he never offers us so much as a cup of wine
he bade the servant take this to the library , then went in with tu shao−ching
where can he be from ?
a prompt avowal will save us trouble and win you our gratitude

he made him change out of mourning , then took him to meet the prince
here with a person like you , gold , pearls , jade and jewels must all count as vulgar

we told the old lady , and she says there may be some left-over materials in the downstairs store-room at the back , which we can have if we can find them
and taking out his purse he gave yang twenty cents of silver

he made himself useful in tu 's household for anothertwo months , until the end of the seventh month when the weather began to grow cooler
she was the only one in a shabby cape , all hunched up with cold , poor thing !
i shall never forgive him as long as i live !
and in case of doubt , i can consult you
when he reached shilitun a doctor was sent for , but unfortunately that place has no good doctors
this was a tall order , but xichun had to agree
you must look elsewhere for your father
one of the sons of their house called lan has passed the examination ; so that prediction of yours has come true
just look at the dowries lady wang and i brought and compare them with yours
a true gentleman of the old school !
and even today a fragrance clings to her gown
then after crying bitterly once more before the coffin he left
in two weeks i shall come to fetch them , bringing the payment from magistrate shih
you with your avid eyes and itching palms , you ’ re the bane of our lives and a disgrace to us all i ’ ll carve you up !
just then a gust of wind sprang up , dashing fallen leaves against the window paper
so was not it simpler for me to bring them here myself ?
she nodded in assent , and this was at once reported to jia rong , who went back to inform his father
the three sessions were over
before chi could question him further , the boy brought in a visiting card
i ’ m too young to know the right way to talk ; but you , dear as an elder sister to me , can teach me
how did she come to hear of it ?
i have kept you all busy for a whole day , and being a monk i ca not offer you a proper feast but merely some wine and a few vegetable dishes
they found the old man wearing a new felt cap , a padded gown of thick blue cloth , and warm shoes
how much money can those young fellows ’ parents give them to throw away like this ?
mind you show it to your mother before you go out , the lady dowager charged him with a smile
with this , he shed tears
i was not prepared for this
asked mrs zhou stepping forward
she told the maids to close the cases at once , and pinger and fenger made haste to help daishu and the rest put the things away
as the saying goes , no one grows fat on just one mouthful
so next time you know where to find her
the day came to fetch the bride , and not being the type to make a scene however wronged she felt , she let herself be carried off in the sedan-chair , deferring her decision till her arrival
that offering was for diguan , who died
i would rate her chances of recovery at three out of ten
sneered concubine zhao at this point
he declared to his wife
why are you wearing so much ?
who can be sure that in future they won ’ t equal me today ?
she picked them up , reread them twice , then sighed :
once there was an old gentleman whose son had already reached high position , who still insisted on taking the examination himself
the others simply picked out one or two titbits which took their fancy , but granny liu had never tasted anything of the sort before
if you carry on like this with them , you will get another scolding
now baoyu had been so struck by xiaohong the previous day that he would have liked to have her wait on him , but he feared this might upset xiren and the others ; besides , there was no saying how the girl would turn out
we hope you will honour us by taking part in the sacrifice , sir , said chih
why look at those , miss ?
if he hasn ’ t had a change of heart , i ’ ll kowtow farewell to you , ma , and you can count me as dead , for wherever he goes i ’ ll go too , content even if we have to beg for food

this is mr kuo tieh−shan , replied wu
starting today , i shall leave you in charge of the shop and all the business — you will do the buying in , selling and giving credit
but ting shoved him over first , and he rolled to the foot of the bridge where he started howling and cursing
later this incident was used as a classical allusion to describe love between men
i have only one line rather a crude one , too but i wouldn ’ t know how to go on from there
your brother is no good ; but you must go on showing him the same respect that you would me
pay your respects to your uncle , miss , prompted the nurse
wang mien had genius
that 's how it is
tanchun was the first to finish
pinger called out , nanny li , what are you doing ?
the messenger kowtowed and presented the announcement , on which was written : the provincial governor of kiangsi reports that an officer is needed for the prefecture of nanchang
for having heard daiyu crying and vomiting and baoyu threatening to smash his jade , they did not want to be held responsible should any serious trouble come of it
lai da ’ s wife came in just then followed by the wives of zhou rui and lin zhixiao to make their reports
but my maid is so silly she asked that woman about it , and of course that put her back up
when i called on aunt xue just now , i ran into a very handsome young woman whom i didn ’ t think belonged to our household and wondered who she could be
no , they have all gone ashore
you must have hidden it , miss , she said playfully
i daresay she has set her heart on one of the young masters , most likely baoyu or possibly my son
butcher hu was not up to appearing in public , but he bustled about between the kitchen and his daughter 's room , helping to measure the white cloth or weigh meat
the report of the post-mortem which they sent to the prefecture omitted to mention that the blow on the temple cracked the skull , making a gash one-third of an inch deep , and that there was another bruise in the small of his back
we left on the twenty-eighth of the third month and only got back the day before yesterday
no matter whether it was xiangling or baochan , someone must have bought it for her
qingwen ’ s the prettiest among the maids , xifeng replied
so they went inside to have their tea
you do look ahead , do not you ?
this is none of my business

but your pieces there are all dead , so what have i to fear ?
yoo invited cheng to join them in the hall , and the old man saw servant after servant passing the door to the kitchen
it may be big , but what makes you think your son can move in ?
he came to luxuriant woods and bamboo groves set among hills and interlaced by streams , with a temple half hidden among the foliage
in the hope of soothing her he said , your unfilial sons have brought this trouble upon our family , alarrning you , madam
in my humble opinion , it would be better to send tien to their valley to reason with the miao chieftain and persuade him to hand feng back , so that no more need be said
daiyu called after him
by now chou chin had stopped crying
i knew you would not be able to leave yesterday , replied li wan with a smile
relinquishing her resentment zuuan is

three or four days later the captain invited pao wenching to a meal at which chi wei−hsiao , who had come first in the examination , accompanied them
no thank you , daiyu chuckled
sorry to have troubled you for nothing these days , she said
soon it was time to sleep
we have several hanging in our study
both put down the bucket in surprise and hurried in
that 's all right , countered xifeng quickly amid general laughter
aunt xue wiped her tears with her handkerchief
after you returned they came twice to call on you—did not you know ?
she decided to sound her out and questioned her
or has someone put her up to this to get yingchun to knuckle under first , and after that xichun and me ?
tsang liao−chai had prepared a good meal , and he invited tu very respectfully to be seated and poured him wine , after which they chatted at random
so that ’ s how it is , said the doctor
the game went on and this time huan was caught holding the flower
yuanchun praised all these verses , then remarked with a smile , cousin baochai ’ s and cousin daiyu ’ s are specially good
sit down and drink a cup , then tell us about it
today the second master heard outside that uncle was travelling here posthaste , and was only two hundred li or so away when he died on the road !

still , she ’ s cousin pan ’ s concubine too , so how could she then it occurred to him , jingui has never shown the least sense of propriety
the people led a wretched life , and the contradictions in society were sharply reflected in the conflict within the ruling class itself
the trouble your aunt had getting rid of the xi as !
but it was too late then to pay my respects
there was also a set of jade ornaments for a man ’ s belt and a bundle containing a man ’ s sandals and socks

the zhangs have no son , and a property worth millions ; but they won ’ t agree to a match until they can find a young man from a rich and noble house who is himself outstanding
and why should a mere licentiate put on airs ?
so now baoyu was reflecting
this news reassured aunt xue that her son would be released and her daughter ’ s wedding could be carried through , although she could see that baochai looked rather unwilling
he had not~lived up to the old lady 's expectations
then a man there told me : 'this official is not your son
may i know your name and where you come from ?
no , he still isn ’ t up to that , madam
he is between fifty and sixty , wearing a square cap and a silk gown
this cottage was built on the bank of a stream by a hill
if he still refuses , we can discredit him without spoiling our own reputation
do not speak of it !
he prescribed one pill each time an attack comes on
we ’ d better not make it public , in that case , until aunt xue has decided
daiyu made no reply and to keep her awake — for he feared sleep might give her indigestion — baoyu played a new trick
baoyu , back in his room , heaved sigh after sigh but baochai , knowing the reason for this , ignored him
when he threatened her with a knife , she stretched out her neck and challenged him to kill her
you would not know if a thief came in the night , he said
she scrapped a few things too , taking me and xifeng as her main targets
i heard you coughing half the time
asked the stranger when they had bowed to each other
and where could the girls get hold of it ?

suppose i won ’ t let you go ?
but once you stopped him , he found out about his medicine
jia lian went off to work out the accounts for xifeng 's funeral
in a big family like ours , outsiders think our wealthy young ladies must be very happy
since you are related to the duke 's family , when will you become an official ?
most of the people here , from the old lady down to those in the garden , are very partial to crabs
that reminds me : i noticed one day that wuer , the daughter of mrs liu in the kitchen , was the image of qingwen , and i decided to take her on
she told me , too , not to mention this to her grand-aunt
she was going to order the attendants to seize the abbess , when she saw they had disappeared !
i can speak frankly to you , shao−ching , he said
the old woman wanted to go to the garden to say goodbye to baoyu , the young ladies and lady wang , but yuanyang prevented her
you sent him goodies but he didn ’ t eat them
the dead may have no
li wan and the others read :
half a month later another despatch arrived , this time with a clear description : the malefactor yu yu−chung is a senior licentiate of wuho , of medium height , with a white face and thin beard , in his fifties
why should he be arrested ?
we ’ ve met baoyu several times
then the hay−vendor left
although we have met by chance , we are both scholars
now do you know who i am ?
you reckoned on three hundred taels , but i am afraid it will cost you five hundred to finish the job
i ’ ve given her my heart
if you think , uncle bao , i could grind your ink or wash the inkstone for you , let ’ s try to fix it as soon as possible
i hope you wo not take this amiss
i told him to keep them for others
how could my heart be wrested from its end ?
waking in west pavilion , no trace of man
there are classical sources too
in one year he must make about a thousand taels of silver
meanwhile the lady dowager was gleefully telling everyone who came in that another family had a baoyu just like their own
she threw herself at concubine zhao and dared her to slap her again
jia rui had been orphaned early and left in the charge of his grandfather jia dairu , a strict disciplinarian who allowed him no freedom for fear he drink or gamble outside and neglect his studies

the gate of the nunnery was still locked
but in silence , smiling coldly , they all went away
when butcher hu had finished his noodles and left , the abbot took the silver and set off for the city
running distractedly in , he was relieved to see her sitting there sobbing
since all the lucrative jobs had been taken by others , i was sitting there in the capital with nothing to do , spending my own money
hongyu stood at the gate watching till he was out of sight before finally turning back
what would be a suitable name for this spot ?
what is the pear garden list ?
pinger drew closer to whisper , since her period last month she ’ s been having fluxions off and on non-stop
otherwise both your families will be ruined
i am happy to have the honour of meeting you
it won ’ t do to neglect them
as for baoyu , he could see that while saying what was right and proper baochai was also trying to put him at his ease
after old chin had served tea , he led the envoy to wang mien 's house , and pushed open the door
at once baner set up a clamour for some meat , but his grandmother slapped him and told him to keep away
when they had drunk the tea and exchanged the usual compliments , lou feng pointed to the announcement

over my illness there are so many family affairs to see to i ’ ve naturally no time for such things i ’ ve even given up doing what ’ s most urgent
although she kept this a secret , everyone could see from her pallor and loss of weight that she was not taking proper care of herself
'why did not you tell me earlier ?
here ’ s the only other one i have , she said
what fine sights and monuments had she seen on the way ?
what about flowers and grass , or bricks and tiles ?
ask the young ladies to call that child back
have halls of jade ,
i am nothing but an ignoramus , replied chu hsien−fu
a minister of the state of chi in the sixth century bc
but since you ’ re the go-between , madam , will you find us someone to take charge of the betrothal ceremony ?
where the phoenix alights
the more he drank , the hungrier he grew—the poor man suffered torments
in your testimony at the first trial you said you witnessed the fight , said the magistrate sternly
two generations ago , the head of the seventh branch passed first in the palace examination , and his son was prefect of kanchow in kiangsi
this was just what baoyu had been hoping for
in any case , her husband 's illness had proved to be consumption , so that he was in no immediate danger
it ’ s not as if you were an outsider
i simply guessed at what the oracle meant
i would become a monk if you died , baoyu declared
jia jing , jia she and jia zheng each received two new books of his majesty ’ s own composition , two cases of rare ink-sticks , four goblets , two of gold and two of silver , and lengths of satin identical with those described above
why is not cousin lin here ?
peasants from all around contributed to the upkeep of this temple , and only one monk lived there
i ’ ve had a change of heart and mean to turn over a new leaf , but i must find someone congenial before i ’ ll marry
the mistresses have been away for a few days only , yet we ’ ve heard of nothing but squabbles of all sorts in every household before one ’ s over the next one crops up
as wang mien watched , he thought , the ancients said , 'in a beautiful scene a man feels he is part of a picture
he was really out that day , said pu
his secretaries and attendants bit their lips or fingers in dismay and hastily withdrew as they heard him raging at baoyu again
once more the runners raised a warning shout
xiren answered for him , of course he would like it
with tears too he replied , your subject , poor and obscure , little dreamed that our flock of common pigeons and crows would ever be blessed with a phoenix
baoyu has his first taste of love
niu leapt to his feet
fame and profit are vanity
are you niu yu−fu ?
like ancient kings austere who sought their mate ,
still they paid no attention

after discussing it we can write to report this to uncle lian so that we wo not be held responsible
she asked him , coming out
we have been out here enjoying ourselves every day recently
when jia zheng had written this out , the secretaries said , the third line has a classical flavour and is vigorous too — excellent
who knows my misery ?
in fact , for years i ’ ve been thinking that a family like ours should invest in some real estate — sacrificial land , manor houses or burial sites
they can profit by your edifying conversation
lianhua went back then in a huff to tell siqi all that had been said , embroidering her account too
excuse me if i do not see you out , said wan , giving a casual salute as he went back inside
i pointed out , what ’ s the good of fat mutton if it ’ s too hot to eat ?
seeing baoyu ahead of him , the boy stopped short
he ’ s asking twenty thousand taels for all four

the elder of his two sons , jia fu , died at the age of eight or nine leaving the younger , jia jing , to inherit the title
they recognized him as the servant of mr lu , a compiler of the han lin academy who came from their district
evidently he 's not to be tempted by wealth or rank , much less by mention of his wife and daughter
then jia lian called for wine , saying , i ’ ll have a couple of drinks with elder cousin
how can i mark this first meeting ?
acting on the sly is no good
i told her quietly , 'granny lin wants to leave , so as to reach the city gate before it 's closed
yes , she 's stopped taking medicine today , replied cuimo
peifeng reported this to madam you , who had shares sent over to the different households
according to them , apart from all these jias here in the city there are plenty of others in the provinces too , and not long ago a number of their servants were put in clink
being close enough now to hear this remark , he could hardly come any further
do you mind sitting here for a minute , miss , while i take a turn outside ?
i do not really know how much she had left
how dare you answer back , you scoundrel !
why take on like this ?
yes , every year when they write home they say how exceedingly good you are to them , madam
take these keepsakes to remind you of me , she said
she did her best to please lady xing , aware that aunt xue was so easygoing there would be no problem there
wan and the buyer came in from the other cabin , they could not help laughing to see her in such a state
a roar of laughter went up , and jia huan told the eunuch that the answer was a head-rest and an animal-head tile
because the abbot was to say masses for his mother , fan chin was impatient of any delay
which is the one-tael mark ?
when she heard angry voices she knew that nanny li was on the rampage again , working off on baoyu ’ s maids her annoyance over her gambling losses today
no more fist-fights for me
the horse came back with another horse , and the old man 's neighbours congratulated him
though she ’ d been unfairly treated and left , if we couldn ’ t find any other way to help her , we should at least go to see her to repay her former kindness
i don ’ t trust you with it , he chortled
in all the years i ’ ve served you , madam , you ’ ve never laid a finger upon me , she said
now cousin baochai has gone home , even xiangling can ’ t come here any more ; and on top of that , yingchun has left us to get married
you have a distinguished visitor today , pin−niang , they said
she asked them the reason
i am on my way to tienchang , to visit the mr tu whose grandfather was a number one scholar
and round the foot of this hill , as the magistrate 's chair advanced , came a little cowherd riding back to front on a water buffalo
but can you tell me where that jade of his came from , and what the inscription on it is ?
the man 's clothes were so threadbare that a few more holes had appeared since he went into the cell
you are partial , madam , disclaimed aunt xue with a smile
you sit down and chat with us
now then , do not talk like that , nephew , said pu cheng
you ’ re lively here , she remarked , starting your horseplay so early in the morning
and the man who wanted to move the grave shall be executed like a parricide , by being sliced into pieces
we ’ ve been like real sisters since we were small and were only having a joke among ourselves
ho mei−chih carried out the dishes and his wife the wine
at that , niu pu−yi , an old secretary , suggested , if he is from wenshang county , why not look through the records of the dozen or so who have already passed the prefectural examination ?
she is beyond saving
i like plantains best so i will call myself the stranger under the plantain
the grandfather leads his grandchildren
like ancient sages were to cauldrons brought ''
don ’ t you think it would be better , madam , to lose no time in arranging their marriages ?
wait till we have had some tea , said hu
so don ’ t you go calling her a simpleton
that way , don ’ t i get more of your food than by eating here ?
how eager you two gentlemen are to do good !
they ’ d have something to fall back on , and there would be no break in the sacrifices
hua−shih , you should be able to give fifty taels too , he urged
qingwen , when he looked round for her , was nowhere to be seen
of course it is , agreed xifeng
it 's true that his grandfather held some official posts , but their family has come down in the world
she broke down and sobbed
the chieftain and feng chun−jui escaped by a small track to another miao settlement
i went to bed early , that ’ s why i woke early
she 's showing me the way
there 's no need to go in
he slipped over to the window and looked out
i owe a great deal to you , brother !
why didn ’ t you say so before ?
if you must drive him out , said the two neighbours when they found they could not talk her round , at least give him some money so that he can start a business
but no more of their discussion about baoyu ’ s marriage
just then , abbess daliao of scattering flowers temple arrived
it is not time yet
if she ’ s in a bad way , of course she can ’ t talk , said xiangyun
if you ever do such a thing again , we shall tell your father when he comes home and he ’ ll give you another beating
or maybe , because she bears sister baoqin some grudge , she ’ s playing this dirty trick to get me into hot water and give me a bad name — that ’ s possible too
after the lantern festival i shall come with the lou gentlemen to new market , and we shall call at your sister 's house , he told him

if you want to know what this meant , read the next chapter

if you continue in this way , these two lines won ’ t stand out so well and the poem may seem padded and forced
he had come with the others today to see his friend , never expecting to find mrs liu there too
the other three swarmed round as well , weeping and wailing , tearing at her and butting her , so that she was surrounded on all sides
why come and ask me for old lady and my other elders
if you ’ ll tell me , miss , we ’ ll keep it in mind and recommend it to others with the same trouble
the small boy replied , uncle wang has gone to wang market , seven miles away

shut up , you bitch !
are there not holy mountains where you could cultivate truth ?
hupo agreed to this , and yuanyang went out
jia rong , twenty , state scholar of jiangning district , jiangning prefecture , jiangnan
ching took the man aside and asked him the reason
and all feng did was smile : he would not confess
i haven ’ t said a word against you , madam , retorted xifeng laughingly , but now you ’ re trying to put the blame on me
you simply must not refuse !
what more do you want ?
so the people here knew that learning was an honourable thing
his protégés said , the second young master is composing his carefully
i ca not expect her to look after me , but only hope she ends up like yingchun - yes , that would please me
she really is silly , she told baoyu
my memory 's not what it was , and if i keep forgetting what to say it will make a bad impression on my father
while the boatman made his boat fast to the boy 's and was weighing out the water chestnuts , the brothers asked from the window : where do you live ?
it 's about this business of my son taking the examination , sir
tradition had it that the earth god kept his eyes closed all the year round , opening them only on this evening
we ’ ll do as you say , they agreed
at this signal the other eunuchs said , her highness is coming !
she always knows how to cope
his name was wangmien , and he lived in a village in chuchi county in chekiang
liu chi had nothing to do with it !
this order made jia zheng 's household exchange consternated glances , while the runners gleefully rubbed their hands , eager to ransack the place
during her funeral we saw all the mistresses except you
so from then on yinger was assigned to wait on baoyu with some younger maids
what a poor return for my kindness !
so qingwen put down the handkerchiefs and left , puzzling her head all the way back over this gift
ma chun−shang was tall
the moment he was back in his lodgings , chuang took off his cap
i want you to go and borrow one of miss lin ’ s
of course you ’ re right , madam , answered lady wang
at breakfast time the man who usually took the lead , shen hsiang−fu , walked in , followed by seven or eight others
the girl spoke so concisely and prettily that jia yun wanted to ask her name
as they grow up they start getting ideas and cause trouble
in your honourable company there 's an actor called qiguan who 's known all over the country , but i have never had a chance to see him
now jia zhen and jia lian went up to the lady dowager ’ s couch and , as it was low , knelt down , jia zhen holding her cup and jia lian , behind him , the wine-pot
the two story-tellers as well were in fits of mirth
baoyu saw sense in this and called in one of the old nannies
she whispered to yindie
you would better make haste to get together the clothes and things you need
soon the tally was returned and the amount entered
flowers strew the ground , the affrighted birds have flown
so many visitors all day long must have tired you ; do have a rest now
of course there will be no charge
celestial spheres my witness be on high ,
one containing the word 'fragrance '
it was so well done and quickly done that the magistrate was impressed
quietly loiter about the mountain path ;
after the family meal , shiyin had another table laid in his study and strolled over in the moonlight to the temple to invite yucun over
go along then , she said
as they walked along it they saw that the willows , now turning green , seemed hung with golden threads
how do you — a merchant of our gabelle — come to be so drunk and disorderly in the street ?
even if i do not see any clothes , maybe the mistress will think me so trustworthy that she gives me two taels of silver a month from her own allowance too
he reflected , the ancients said , 'one who has attained the way makes no show of it ; one who makes a show of it has not attained the way
the rest need not be enumerated here
she invited the two girls into a side room , where baochai sat on a couch and daiyu on miaoyu ’ s hassock , while the nun herself fanned the stove and when the water boiled brewed some fresh tea
his mind made up , he slipped out to look for zijuan
a censor brings a charge against
then she turned with a smile to tanchun
i do not mind not giving him the jade , he replied , but i must see him once more
all right then , said madam you
it seems pointless to make such a fuss over a fan
the two girls chatted with them as if nothing had happened until xiaohong saw xifeng beckoning from the slope
touched on the raw xiren lowered her head for a while , at a loss for an answer
no more of this
she often thinks of you and would like to come , but she ca not get away
then suddenly recalling the inscription for the painting of a mat and flowers , he glanced at xiren and tears started to his eyes
travelling by day and resting by night , kuo tieh−shan came to the province of shensi
when will you young gentlemen be setting out ?
fancy meeting you here !
yuanyang and the other maids could not suppress smiles either as they showed the gifts one by one to the old lady
our two apartments ’ accounts are so muddled , put in zijuan gaily , i can ’ t even remember the day , the month or the year when these things were left here
we must decide on forfeits for mistakes like that from now on
after a short silence she said , i suppose i should get that old woman to give me some acupuncture treatment too
his father , who had passed the military examination in the capital during the same year in which prefect hsiang passed the civil one , was now at home waiting to take up a post as a second captain
as soon as tang received this order , he summoned the clerk of the prefectural garrison , and had him shut up in the library
they also bought white cloth and asked a tailor to make mourning clothes as quickly as he could
frailer the girl within than any flower
magistrate tang is kind and benevolent , said yen
don ’ t treat it so lightly !
she flushed crimson and hardly knew whether to go on or not
xifeng smiled sarcastically at madam you
reed snow cottage is out of luck today , all messed up by xiangyun
at that she gave a great cry of despair and , taking him in her arms , started weeping and wailing
another small door in the inner room opened on to the back garden with its large pear-tree , broad-leafed plantain and two tiny side courts
maids were sent on ahead to see that all was ready ; and because the concubine zhao had excused herself on the grounds of an indisposition , there was only the concubine zhou to help the serving-women and maids raise the portiére and set out the back-rests and cushions
i entrusted baoyu to you thinking you had some sense
moreover , now that it was growing warmer , it was pleasant in the garden and they decided not to move till autumn
our household ’ s so big , it ’ s a mixed lot , xifeng answered
baochai ’ s boy cousin looks and behaves quite differently from xue pan , more as if he were her real brother
little did i know that baoyu was a spirit who had come to earth to undergo certain trials , and who managed to fool the old lady for nineteen years !
to the moon , past and present are one ;
early one spring morning when baochai awoke , parted her bed-curtains and got up , she found it rather chilly
it must be our bad luck that ’ s brought the second mistress to this pass or may be someone ’ s horoscope clashes with hers
no one else would do for her
when they reached fan chin 's house , butcher hu shouted : the master is back !
before she could finish the others , knowing that she was poking fun at xichun , asked , and then what ?
madam you agreed to this
this strange couple clamoured to see his masters , but would not give their names
having made this apportionment she told jia zheng , you spoke of debts outside ; well , they must be cleared
he was not his usual cheerful and talkative self , however , for he lay down , still wearing the cape , on the kang
my name is kuo , and i am a native of hukuang on my way to chengtu
for you are as fair as a flower
wuer ran forward to call her
i shall , so there !
but my benefactor is some distance away , and i need five hundred taels to repay him for his kindness
their host welcomed them and they sat down in the hall
the spirit must have returned to heaven , said chen hofu
as huan and lan had recently written several poems in company , they no longer lacked confidence
thus cui yingying and su xiaoxiao were immortals with earthly desires , while song yu and sima xiangru were writers of genius whose works were wicked
they then carried her back to her room where pinger and fenger gave way to a storm of weeping
one day whiskers mao received a letter from home
i told you to call to ask after her , not to go in
but at this point xiangyun and baoyu disappeared
after kowtowing three times he said , i can never repay the mother who gave birth to me
i shall take the chance today to break my fast
the next day wu shu came to tu 's house , and after breakfasting they went to palace pool
they crowded forward to intervene , expostulating and warning the fellow off
re was feeling listless one day when cuimo brought him a letter on fancy note-paper
it 's better not to cross mr chang 's path
what is the meaning of this ?
we are collecting the proceeds of our gambling to welcome you home
if not , then the executioner , who must stand by when the grave is opened , shall cut off that dog of a geomancer 's head
she wondered how best to avert such a dreadful calamity
do get me a whole lot more , and i will make you another pair of slippers
this belongs to the future , said shiyin with a smile
then baoyu realized with delight that they were announcing his father ’ s promotion to be vice-minister
the girl herself is agreeable and never seemed to be against the match , but those two old creatures have grander ideas for their daughter
her fragrant spirit is lost in the infinite none knows whither it has fled
an old magistrate takes a bribe
the two maids were just able to catch her as she was collapsing and carry her inside ; then qiuwen left zijuan and xueyan to attend to her
however , now that he 's married what does it matter ?
in the hope of distracting her he kept up this idle chatter for a while
but to know who this man was , you must read the next chapter
on her way back the maid met qiuwen
after all , they told lady wang , it ’ s because your house is a virtuous one and you yourself do so many good deeds that these young girls have been influenced in this way
no , no , i would better not go
apart from the sections just mentioned , wu ching−tzu 's style is characterized by his ability to express the profoundest ideas in the simplest language , to select from all the phenomena of life what is most significant , and to go to the heart of every problem he tackles
yucun accepted the silver and clothes with no more than perfunctory thanks , then said no more of the matter but went on feasting and talking
the weather turns warm so early now in nanking , observed hsu , the plum blossom comes out before the tenth month is over
then kuo crawled out of the pit
so i crept behind you , and after you came out i hid where you ’ d been hiding
while i was standing at the gate , lied niu pu , i saw the assistant magistrate from our county pass by
that may be true , said chu hsin
you ’ re quite right , said the lady dowager
the next morning qingwen woke sheyue before it was light
besides , if you bury yourself in this village , who will recognize your talents ?
just go ahead and trounce them , she concluded
both refused to take back their money -- - both wanted the girl
this made the old lady weep still more bitterly
the country has been at peace for so long that local government has become a mere empty show , he said
his parents were in the inner room
do not trouble to pour any more
i know , i know !
besides , being old and experienced she could see how delighted the old lady was and how eagerly the young people were listening
the whole party waited until he had walked on before going their different ways
one tea-spoon in a bowl of water is delicious
the prior invited them into a room on the ground floor of another building , where four large dishes were served
don ’ t stand on ceremony , anyone , said the old lady when all was ready
through a moon gate to the right they reached a long , whitewashed wall , and passed through a small door at one end of it to a covered walk
in this world , things don ’ t always turn out the way you want
did you hear this extraordinary business about jinchuan suddenly drowning herself in the well ?
jia zheng , looking closely at him , saw that this was not the same monk as last time
xiaoyan and sier , who had felt dizzy too , had already gone to bed
clasping him to her she wept bitterly
now the mayor takes his seat
in consternation jia [ ian promptly withdrew
the other house does seem to be in difficulties , sir , remarked his son
the customary fasts and sacrifices were observed , the death announced and the funeral rites carried out ; and niu pu helped to entertain the guests
would he kill my parents if i refuse ?
one of her maids whom i met told me she ’ s in paddy-sweet cottage , so i was on my way there when i came across you
it 's no joke adopting a son
on being told that it was the third watch , she observed :
angry as i was , i dared not quarrel with him ; i just gave pinger a couple of slaps and asked her why she should want to murder me
don ’ t be angry , madam
evoking the grief of separation , its pain ,
as baochai was a new bride and baoyu was crazed , neither objected to being taken over ; for although baochai knew how things stood and at heart blamed her mother for this injudicious match , it was too late now to protest
other tasks may be beyond me , but i ’ ve every confidence when it comes to copying sutras
you ’ ve guessed right , ma
however young and flighty i may be , i wouldn ’ t want such trash
before she could finish the old lady spat in her face
that would be fine !
she returned his greetings and they sat down to talk
he was invited into a small library in front of the shrine
that ’ s what ’ s so odd
not knowing what to make of this , xifeng called the messenger in
that ’ s the first thing
jia zheng , having been appointed this year an examiner of provincial education , chose the twentieth of the eighth month to start his journey
the proverb says , amagistrates can ruin families
if we leave it to a few of our household to search , they could search their whole lives long without finding it
fetch a red card , wei−hsiao , said tu
do you think someone living in the provincial governor 's yamen will be impressed by duck and pork ?
they all tried to comfort her
to know what followed , read the next chapter
smashing their noses and slashing their lips , he cut off their retreat
when did you come ?
it 's all right if you are both willing
invite him into the hall , he ordered the gate−keeper
they chatted and joked till evening , when music sounded and chi wei−hsiao was led to the bridal chamber
baoyu seized this chance to urge zhen baoyu to go in and the latter accordingly went ahead , accompanied by the others to lady wang 's apartments
i assume there must be some reason
if i hear of such goings-on i ’ ll have something to say
i came to see the old lady enshrined !
but this gambling night after night leads to drinking and unlocking the gates to buy this , that and the other or send to look for someone
imperceptibly , his spirits rose again as he gazed at the hibiscus , sighing
besides , it 's too hot for ceremonial dress
he 's been going through his stock , giving some things away , selling others cheap , and presenting the more valuable stuff to relatives and friends
just now several moslems got an old man to bring me fifty catties of beef and to plead with me saying that if i stop the sale of beef they will be forced out of business ; and begging me to be more lenient
i certainly don ’ t want her to leave us , and i certainly won ’ t let her
it has nothing to do with her
with your talents and reputation , and living as you do in such a fine place as this , you ought to take a beautiful concubine who also possesses literary gifts
he 's a man named yu yu−ta from wuho county , a senior licentiate who is well up in the examination subjects
about a month later yang sent another letter to chuan , urging him to come at once ; and on the receipt of this chuan put together a few things and took a boat to huchow
quite so , madam , agreed lady xing
some time after this , the lady dowager asked aunt xue over for a consultation
in no mood to check what they were doing he entered his mother 's room , where one and all were in tears
let 's be frank and put all our cards on the table : a few dozen taels are not going to settle anything
the date fixed is the day after tomorrow , so i have come to notify you
so at coming of age ceremonies , marriages , funerals or sacrifices in big families and in the halls of the local gentry , nothing was discussed but promotions , transfers and recalls in the official world
what do you think he did ?
for five silver cents they had a vegetarian meal in a mohammedan eating−house
are bound to stump the flower
the correction , though a little flat , will pass muster
it couldn ’ t be , he objected
the hail was thronged with nurses and maids in attendance
then jia zheng and the others made obeisance too
as she was talking they heard melodious fluting
chin was thrown into a panic
but to revert to baoyu : he had expected nothing more than a perfunctory check-up , little dreaming that his mother would come down on them like a thunderbolt , taking them to task for things they had said in secret — which she had got word for word
well , our family should be safe , ha she observed
well , let us hear what shao−ching has to say , suggested mr chih
she seemed elegant and quick-witted with an air of distinction
there 's the famous twelve pavilions , replied ting−hsi
you must not be touchy or imagine i look down on you , because this is between friends
xifeng accepted this task
i am honoured to be your colleague , said wan
but you ’ ve never even kowtowed to us each year
though you can ’ t handle affairs yet , you should learn from your elder cousins
all men long to be immortals
the discerning beauty his true worth foretold ;
but since you know about it now , i will bypass uncle and beg you , aunt , to show me some kindness
when daiyu assented faintly she gave the bowl back to xueyan to hold while she helped the patient sit up
that ’ s why she said she had none , not wanting to boast about it
jia lian could not presume to rest at home and had no time to remonstrate with xifeng
laughing at the idea she went on , i know what : i can arrange a match for her
clasping his hand tightly he said :
so jia zhen told his son , go with your uncle , and mind you go too to pay your respects to the old lady , master and mistresses of the other house
the next day her brother came and asked the lady dowager ’ s permission to take her home for a rest
when he sends to fetch her back we won ’ t let her go , not even if he sends a hundred times !
you must be blind not to know your master , cried xinglian
you are talking more and more nonsensically
the four of them were still at loggerheads when a summons to dinner arrived and they went through the dusk to the lady dowager ’ s quarters where lady wang , li wan , xifeng and the three jia girls had already assembled
now baoyu had always been deplorably eccentric
our sons should study too ; but if they ’ re a bit more intelligent than average and look all right , they can hardly fail to get some official post
told that he was asleep she was turning to leave when xiren said with a smile :
how good it will be to meet again next winter after you have soared up to dizzy heights
the matrons on duty at the gate burst out laughing
meanwhile aunt xue had tea and other good things ready for them
second sister pretended that this was the first time she had met them , then stood there with lowered head while the lady dowager looked her up and down
that mistress of yours brought in thieves to rob our family , he swore
wan hsueh−chai shall hear about this !
they laughed at that , and went on drinking
i ’ ve read of many talented beauties in ancient history , she said , whose lives were sometimes enviable , sometimes tragic
what brings you back ?
mortals mistake carnal appetite for love , and
just then a gust of wind carried them the strains of distant music
she was therefore sure baoyu would be in good hands
you may just as well go tomorrow
he is an unassuming , generous man who takes after his grandfather
nobody else can remember all the clothes and trinkets the old lady has , but yuanyang remembers
first , he had embezzled large sums of money ; secondly , he had hushed up several murders ; thirdly , he had used the official seal of the county yamen and the vermilion brush for fraudulent purposes ; fourthly , he had forged several official seals ; fifthly , he had kidnapped women ; sixthly , by usury he had driven people to suicide ; seventhly , he had bribed the school officers and found substitutes for candidates for the examinations
why carry on at him like that ?
if the runner had haled huan−cheng before the magistrate again , the youth would not have escaped a beating and the girl would have been sent back to the chu family
they gazed at the green , fresh mountains across the river , and the boats plying to and fro—they could see each sail quite clearly
he had paid scant attention to baoyu ’ s jade before and now took a good look , a careful scrutiny disclosing the inscription warding off evil
after digesting~all this information the old woman remarked , fancy , in town it ’ s not only the people who have class , the birds are high-class too
amid general laughter his mother had to sip some wine
next the magistrate asked wu liang , you were drinking with xue pan , weren ’ t you ?
chin lived on the ground floor of a house at the back
crows asleep by the well are wet with dew from the plane tree ,
that 's why i asked ~other to hold the wedding -but to do it quietly
i shouldn ’ t have waited till now
as long as your heart is pure , buddha himself will come to the sacrifice
besides , most breeze-and-moonlight tales deal with secret assignations and elopements , and have never really expressed the true love between a young man and a girl
my name is yu , and i live in unicorn sash village
now it happened that a few of the jia family pages who were friendly with the young patient called to see how he was
why don ’ t you sleep instead of talking such nonsense ?
the little mouse laughed
seeing that baoyu was tipsy , she asked him what had happened and he told her in detail
if you weren ’ t a beauty , i ’ d trample you to bits !
several of the royal consorts have presented offerings of this kind in our convent
when we don ’ t want it there ’ s plenty ; when we do there ’ s none , she exclaimed in exasperation
for the last dozen years i have been in peking , said hsu
the figure on the couch sat up
so you take that line too ?
i can tell you , that would be harder than climbing up to heaven
when jia huan saw them set off to take the examination he was furious
ordered jia zheng sternly
in a dream , rosy clouds bar the way to mount luofu ,
then he set out with the order from his superiors to take grain to the huai valley
with that she got down from her chair to walk coolly in , and the runners let her pass
thus the examination system not only corrupted scholars , but had a bad influence on society as a whole
our fingers washed , the reek of its oil will remain ;
when xiren comes back , you can talk it over with her and cook up some excuse for dismissing the girl
baochai 's warning against fooling about outside and his mother 's charge that his careless talk had caused baoyu 's flogging made him stamp with rage
when they started discussing his marriage zhen baoyu had taken his leave , and baoyu escorted him back to the outer study where jia zheng had returned
without stopping to change her clothes , she went over happily to see her mother
you may be sure she does it to make a show of poverty , because she knows they ’ re spending too much and making inroads into their capital , and she wants to cut down on expenditure
you have already got one
oh , they have their merits too , just as those with smooth tongues have faults
even if she could not talk , her golden unicorn could
now i am going back , i do not know who will plot against me again !
to bring you back again
she had asked mrs lai to take him into service in the rong mansion
it always irritates me to hear people praise a handsome man by declaring he looks like a woman
to the best of my recollection , said pao while the steward was drinking , the old lady in your family must be seventy this year
he sent me here to watch out for you and let him know as soon as i saw you coming , madam
maybe i shall , for the winter solstice has passed and i ’ m no worse
meanwhile the two commanders had reached chair mountain with the main force , but did not know whether hsiao had crossed it or not
yes , this really is very strange , madam
but would such an intelligent man really go off with the priest ?
as he went in , xiren emerged from the inner room
luckily for them , the assistants had taken quickly to their heels ; so none of them lost their lives
going back inside , they discovered daiyu just about to sit down on a chair , panting for breath
miaoyu was wearing a nun 's cap , a pale grey plain silk tunic under a long , sleeveless checked jacket with dark silk borders , a yellow silk sash and a white skirt with dark designs
these are coarse creatures steeped in fleshly lust
daiyu had not intended to make a special trip to thank baochai that could wait until next they met
the other day i was walking under a plum tree when a bee brushed past my face , and just as i flapped it away that aunt of yours spotted me
what 's happened , dear sister-in-law ?
justify their immorality by calling themselves romantics and passing it off lightly
if the mistresses ask about it and i ’ m able to cover up for them , they ’ ll be in luck ; if i can ’ t , there ’ s no more i can do
so he enrolled as a student
they forced me to drink half a goblet
now that baoyu has recovered , he said to his wife , '~how are we to raise the reward ?
the bawd went out and saw it was pen huei , abbess of long life nunnery , who had come to collect the monthly offerings
but if things go on this way i really can ’ t cope
and when lady xing and lady wang followed suit , aunt xue and aunt li had to drink up too
the next day before setting off on her journey , tanchun came to say goodbye to baoyu who was , of course , most reluctant to see her go
once over this a choice of paths lay before them ; but their attention was caught by an airy house of smooth brick with spotless tiles and an ornamental wall on one of the lesser slopes of the main hill
and now there ’ s this fellow bao er !
one of the secretaries was instructed to make out an invitation , and the following day servants were sent with a carriage and sedan-chair to fetch miaoyu
now just have a good rest while we go to see the old lady
i have not seen you for a long time , said tu
it is more fitting for us to call on him first
you do not want to buy it
recently , moreover , since they hoped she would get a job in the garden they had let the matter drop , assuming that after a few years when she was released from service she would choose someone else outside
from your explanation it seems one needn ’ t bother with these rules , provided the line is fresh and original
xiangyun , li wen and li qi invited her to take the best seat at their table , but she declined
when xiangling , ordered to sleep with her , demurred , she accused her of thinking her bed too dirty or of being too lazy to wait on her mistress at night
the next morning , after calling on jia she and jia zheng , jia lian went to the ning mansion
bending over daiyu , zijuan asked her softly , do you want some water , miss ?
on the fifteenth you can go out with our nephew to watch the lanterns , and on the seventeenth or eighteenth we will call a boat and go with you to mr yang 's house
an old man like you should be thinking of doing good deeds , instead of cheating people all the time
we ’ ll soon cure him of this nonsense
but jia huan had not a cent , having already squandered his mother 's savings , and was unable to help anyone else
that 's how i acquired some borneo camphor and musk
hurry up , sir , said the page
even at that post in the provinces , sir , scrupulous as you are yourself , i suspect that those grasping servants of yours damaged your reputation ; so you had better watch out
she had brought back a whole library of books , and lost no time in tidying her bedroom and setting out her things
on that day , drummers played outside the yamen as the two masters of ceremony ushered in the bridegroom
we are nanking−born and nanking−bred , they replied , and some of us are over seventy or eighty
by the third day the patients were lying at death 's door and the whole household despaired
but do you know who the girl is ?
old chin , holding a small white lantern in his hand , saw him to the end of the village and , shedding tears , bade him goodbye
going in some mystification to lady wang ’ s reception hall , they found it crowded with people
how heartless he is !
because i did not understand a word
today we have a female entertainer too
i suppose it ’ s your cousin ’ s illness that ’ s worrying you ?
ma chun−shang walked on till he came to a huge gate on which was written in letters of gold : the monastery of pure compassion , founded by imperial decree
besides , she ’ d no idea you were ill she must have come to talk to sheyue about something else and , happening to find you in bed , said she ’ d come to ask after you
as he left he pulled he san out too
the two of them drank till dusk , when sheep−horn lanterns were hung from the hundreds of trees , some high some low
his landlady , mrs tung , came out leaning on a stick
but when he reached the house and saw four attendants in red and black caps in the doorway holding whips , he was too frightened to go in
they cried out merrily , we ’ ve gate-crashed to offer our congratulations
why should i go on to make fun of myself ?
who knows what dirty old woman has been using them ?
est are to be confiscated according to regulations
daishu , who had not yet left , came over to greet her
that ’ s what i ’ ve done , but you may not approve
the first of the third month is the mistress ’ birthday ; the ninth is cousin jia lian ’ s
they had just started their meal when the old lady sent for xiluan and sijie to join them
my son is only an ignorant boy , he said to the student , while you , sir , are a respectable scholar
with that he told the servants to take wu jinxiao away and entertain him well
please wait here , mr kuo , while wu shu and i fetch the letter
i am not being modest
they were still at it after midnight when they heard a clamour from the inner apartments
does xiren know this ?
tu read : a despatch from governor li regarding the recommendation of men of talent
we do not need such a large junk , said feng
only daiyu teased , drag her off , quick !
a handsome young man answered from the crowd , and when he came forward the examiner asked him : are you related to mei chiu who was here just now ?
he then led the two young maids behind a rockery
and even if your ladyship didn ’ t slap our faces for coming , your stewards might take us for tramps
i was just a little too anxious for him to grow up quickly
but what 's to be done about madam 's illness ?
ching lan−chiang bowed deeply to express his admiration ; but the two old men did not trouble to ask their names
of course i do
i ordered all the maids to keep quiet , said xifeng
why haven ’ t i seen her all this time ?
mr tung was the first to speak
lord she , once he had the fans , asked master lian , how did he succeed where you failed ?
a hen-pecked young profligate takes
though caught out at last by her mistress ,
baoyu hung around for a while before going back to the garden , and as soon as he had gone the old lady said :
spring departs with the flowing water and fallen blossom , far , far away as heaven from the world of men
there ’ s no need to dose her with medicine
he has merely to mention the matter and , if you will pardon me for saying so , you will find yourself like a rat in scalding water !
recently , no doubt , he has frequently asked your advice
why have you come ?
i ’ ll recommend someone to take charge for you
it 's his birthday today and all our friends will be there
if your daughter does get a good post , seems to me she ’ ll be wanting our help even more often , and only if we give it will she do all right
do not jeer at me as rootless ,
and the men i showed it to said you had done a very careful job , in addition to being so fast
finding the one who should fulfill their fate
but i found you ’ d gone to bed early , and as baochai told me you weren ’ t feeling too well i didn ’ t like to bother you
qin zhong took advantage of the fact that nowadays xue pan had virtually stopped coming even to roll-call to make eyes at sweetie and secretly signal to him
she had better give directions for him to move in there too
but as for this ginseng , madam , although it ’ s of the best quality and costs more than thirty taels of silver an ounce now , it ’ s too old
you don ’ t understand , tanchun told her
then either you or qiuling could be the mistress — wouldn ’ t you like that better ?
she ’ s even prettier than you
in a couple of days i shall make a full report , and that will take the wind out of your sails
how could a family like theirs be ruined ?
demanded hsiao , staying his hand
that evening an attendant announced : someone has come from mr hsun 's family
my criminal incompetence deserved punishment by a thousand deaths , but instead the court with gracious clemency sent me to this border region
her eye falling on lady wang beside her , she cried , so you ’ re all deceiving me , putting on a show of being dutiful but plotting against me in secret
the officer also left without a word
but of course , if you want to be an official and at the same time enjoy dr chao 's happiness , that 's asking too much !
a few days later , in the palace , the emperor consulted the prime minister
still , i don ’ t think that xiang for sweetness in your name is right , i ’ d like to change it for another word , if you agree
and then his lordship came out and confirmed this
two days later tu returned the call , and the three men went out to greet him
he ’ s lived so long as an ascetic , we can already consider him an immortal
proud recluse , with what hermit are you taking refuge ?
xiangling answered with a conciliatory smile , a iya , madam !
although they prescribed various medicines , his condition only grew worse
shen chiung−chih , who lived in one of the houses at palace pool , went out with her landlord 's wife to burn incense too
sheyue and qiuwen had stopped and averted their faces
the runner 's first action on reaching home was to hide the certificate and make out a bill covering the money huan−cheng had borrowed from him as well as his board and lodging and court expenses
they were all afraid i was done for after that ducking and chill , but i recovered
i ’ m not feeling too well , i may not be up to going over tomorrow , he said , clapping his hands
you know , aunt and cousin xifeng , how it is in our family and that i ’ m not fibbing
all the officials came to see him off , and having taken his leave of them he once more hired a carriage and drove out of changyi gate
and the special meal your highness is conferring on jia baoyu is ready now
at sight of it baoyu became lost in thought
the worthiest man nanking has produced , past or present , is tai po , who founded the kingdom of wu
pinger was reduced to tears too
it 's up to you to choose , madam , said lady wang
then xiren released baoyu , who said with a smile , you people think more of the jade than you do of me !
the first half of this made sense to yinger , not the last
she had been meaning to raise a great ballyhoo over her daughter 's corpse , then appeal to the court for justice , little thinking that the others would inform the authorities first
a small token of my devotion
the nuns nudged the maid
jia qin was a romantic
come on , quick , madam you cried
these three were the ring-leaders
when wang heard this , he shed tears
meanwhile they were looking at the plum-blossom bough
a pine in a lonely valley
no , he had not drearned last night either
he took the examinations for more than thirty years but never even passed the lowest , because he ca not talk sense
it 's prime minister lou , of course
no , i have not trained him for the stage
since ma had read enough history to know that the capital had been moved south during the sung dynasty , he was able to calculate that this man must be over three hundred years old
she just blushed and went away
commissionerfan wanted to leave yesterday , replied mr hu
after all , women are so kindhearted , she 's bound to excuse my presumption
it ’ s because i was driven to it by poverty that i thought up this shameless scheme
the only sun now in the capital was a police commissioner named sun shaozu , not yet thirty
dairu stood up as jia zheng entered the classroom and greeted him
they were not joking this time , i assure you
you may still be able to fool others , but you ca not fool me
men laugh at my folly in burying fallen flowers ,
even after the lady dowager 's sedan-chair had gone a considerable distance , these attendants were still mounting their carriages at the gate , where a babel of voices was heard :
hastily asking one of the younger maids for some paper , she set about loosening her clothes
mercy , kind master , spare me !
stay where you are
since tai po was such a great sage , we all feel it is only fitting that the master of sacrifice should be a man of spotless character
a reeking wind swept down the fields of wheat ,
how can you say such a thing , sister , not leaving me a leg to stand on ?
then tea and refreshments were served
this is too kind of you , sir !
the other yearns in vain ;
but it is better to have nothing to do with forbidden books
you are right , of course
whenever they get a whole root they cut it into two or three pieces and graft other rootlets on to these to be sold , with others , as if they were whole roots ; so the size is nothing to go by
good sister , wait for me !
would you be so impertinent to the second mistress ?
daiyu shook her head with a sigh
when baoyu said that was right , his father read on :
they invited him into the hall and greetings were exchanged
true , there wasn ’ t much coming and going outside their gates , but over the wall i caught glimpses of most imposing halls and pavilions , while the trees and rockeries of the gardens behind had a flourishing , opulent look
though i ’ ve money , i can ’ t spend it as i want
she had three or four slave girls and nurses to wait on her , as well as two maids called tsai−ping and shuang−hung , both of whom were exceedingly pretty too
shiyin , hearing this clearly , wondered what it meant
together : a lonely boat moored by a chain
it 's all right now !
why do not you protest ?
but if heaven takes pity on me and lets my children live to see times like those under emperor hung wu , i shall die content
you stupid creature to frighten me so , cried daiyu
with a laugh , prefect wang rejoined : it shows that the old saying 'three years of good government—one hundred thousand taels of silver ' is not always true
he rounded on beiming
when it snows , i ’ ll excuse myself on the pretext of illness , so as to save you trouble , while xifeng and i reap all the benefit
quite apart from the girl 's looks where would you find another with such ladylike manners , so polite and yet so firm and principled ?
what do you know of this fellow chang ?
chin told his steward to go to the back of the study and see who was shouting
not everyone is a termagant like you
baoyu tossed and turned for another hour or two , not falling asleep till the fifth watch
after the customary greetings , mr tsung declared that while with the prince of chao he had written poems with the seven famous scholars of the capital ; whereupon tu remarked that two of them were his uncles
that ’ s all right , chuckled zhan
just give me that small one , she said hastily
yuner had no choice but to take her pipa and sing :
he had a rather sallow complexion and eyebrows which rose obliquely , like a portrait of the god of war
after deducting taxes and expenses , we should still net a profit of several hundred percent
last time i went home i had an embroidered dress made for mother too
tanchun boxed mrs wang ’ s ears
the milky way is twinkling ,
she wept and sobbed at home but no one took any notice , till they found she would disappeared
with another glance at baoqin , xiangyun said , she ’ s the only one here fit to wear this cape
pinger and xiren had paired off together too , and were indicating the numbers they guessed with their fingers , which set their bracelets tinkling
just then zijuan heard daiyu coughing as if she had got up
with that she retired angrily to her room
but she also had a daughter two years younger whose infant name was baochai , a beautiful , dainty girl of great natural refinement
what 's happened now , fourth brother feng ?
this elder sister of yours is a very good daughter-in-law , not like my elder son ’ s wife who ’ s so afraid of her husband she only makes a show of compliance to me
good sisters , let me off , she begged
what can this mean ?
in less than half a year , when my money comes in , i ’ ll redeem them and return them
it 's only right for me to help you
lost in admiration of everything about him , he asked the fairies ’ names
what is your personal name ?
no , what you want to do is to send someone to frighten him into giving you several hundred taels and letting you have the girl for your wife without payment
what nonsense you do talk , you stupid thing
if a relative of one from our household died , how much was given ?
with that she went off in her carriage
though the sun 's set , the ground is still hot
just leave it to me , replied xifeng , rather puzzled
we can ’ t afford that !
xue pan was overjoyed and passed on this message to his mother , who promptly set to work with baochai , xiangling and two old nurses to prepare his things
now that sobbing and wailing assailed him wherever he turned , his mind became more unhinged and when others wept he joined in
a young girl , to while away time ,
so i am an only child like you , and i thought that would make for an affinity between us
that to what purpose did i linger still ?
he has no sense of shame , and neither have you !
he crept out to try the gate and found it securely closed
if i had not told them , retorted the boatman , they would have smashed up my boat , the savages !
today you two gentlemen have come neither to take advantage of me , nor because you suspect me
xue pan had already been there for some time with a number of singing-boys , jiang yuhan , an actor who played female roles , and yuner , a courtesan from brocade fragrance court
when they entered the room , teng bowed to wang
that ’ s why i ’ ve had no time to call on you
he had charged straight in
there were two hundred sampans at the shore , and out from the bank sprang two hundred savage−looking men
he started by carrying a little merchandise only , but later he sold licences and was able to trade on a big scale
a wretched crank they call the stone idiot had twenty old fans as it happened , but though so poor that he ’ d hardly a bite to eat , he ’ d sooner die than part with them
sir , said chih heng−shan , if the ground is dry and warm and free from wind and ants , you can bury your parents safely
after two months here i can see that master bao , with his disposition and scholarship , will go far
after chanting this he burned the silk and poured a libation of tea , still reluctant to leave the place
do not you worry about me
we ’ re all cousins alike , so when they offend anybody i ought to apologize
ifyou wear clothes like that , what can the scholars wear ?
after all you gentlemen left for the capital , he told them , my father looked after the graves and did so well that he was able to buy some nearby fields
i shouldn ’ t do such a thing , of course , but as i ’ ve already got a bad name — why not ?
it ’ s too good for the rest of us
you don ’ t have to help out here
why not come and stay with me ?
lots of people are getting married
xifeng promptly sent for the actresses and gave orders for tables to be brought and a red carpet spread
you ’ ve met your match now
as she started out he said with a smile , wherever you go , i ’ ll go with you
you would better be on your guard !
but baoyu would not take no for an answer and at last she yielded to his importunity
this worthless young master set in charge
that doesn ’ t follow , put in yucun , grown suddenly grave
when he came out of the rocky grotto that day after a séance , he saw you reading in the bookshop ; and when the shopkeeper asked you your name , you told him you were the mr ma who had edited that volume of essays
he paced up and down , hands clasped behind his back , unable to hit on any way out
yet when they sent to make inquiries , it seemed nothing was amiss
they ’ re inlaid not with jade but with the finest marble carved with landscapes , figures , pavilions , flowers and birds
miaoyu commented , another stanza , but how mournful !
that will save the money in her chest the trouble of beckoning twice
then one of the women continued , one year , old mr wang sent his son to take the examination in the capital
at the end of the courtyard were five great halls , the largest of which held tai po 's shrine , with a table before it bearing incense urns and candlesticks
it 's you bitches who have hounded him to his death
____________________ a native of the state of chi in the sixth century bc
i ’ m going home to rest
from these two incidents , viewed dispassionately , i saw how obliging he is towards us girls he knows how to make himself agreeable to us
another thing , continued lady wang
after asking her for a written statement , the magistrate decreed that the matter should be decided by the clan
is baoyu the king of heaven ?
the two vessels were lying alongside , and although on different boats they were very close , so the young man petted her till she smiled and climbed into his cabin , and they had a night of love
xifeng did not know what had happened , and the others were mystified too until hupo explained :
she burst into tears
then with final thanks granny liu took her leave and withdrew with yuanyang to the maids ’ room
granny liu , who knew pinger 's status from her last visit , scrambled off the kang to greet her
then he presented the letter to baoyu
that ’ s the finishing touch , they cried , chuckling
i just came to see what you ’ re doing
and seeing that there was not much left , he gave the whole bottle to fangguan who took it away
you think you ’ re as rich as a mint-master
i do not know whether your excellency belongs to the same chou family
all was strangely quiet in lady wang 's apartments , where she sat in the inner chamber shedding tears all by herself
look , the only green things left are those bamboos
when i got tired of waiting i went on my own to pay my respects to the old lady , and i was just going to see lady wang
both of you should pay a forfeit
it ’ s kind of you to think of them , remarked lady wang
have we really passed it ?
smiling , baoyu told them what he had just eaten
since you have brought this up , madam , i would like to ask your advice about something that 's been worrying me for a long time
the young gentlemen have arrived , said chou chi−fu
though we live in the country , we have big money-bags there too who own thousands of acres of land and hundreds of cattle , not to mention pots of silver
but our friend dr chao is such a famous poet that all the high officials call on him ; and when people see a sedan−chair with yellow umbrellas at his gate one day and seven or eight runners in red and black caps they ca not help standing in awe of him
the senior eunuchs and ladies-in-waiting were also entertained by members of the staff of both mansions , leaving only three or four young eunuchs in attendance
her ladyship knowing doesn ’ t matter much , xifeng observed
wang teh gave a sarcastic laugh
i haven ’ t the heart to cut down their attendants , and i doubt if the old lady would agree to it either
if we meet too often we wo not enjoy it , predicted tanchun
i did not talk like an idiot , dad , protested chen ssu−yuan
they exchanged greetings and sat down
has miss lin ever talked such disgusting nonsense ?
to earth 's extremities i sought my bride ,
what 's wrong with having a bit of fun now that they are married ?
but there seemed to be a mill-stone round her neck and her legs were as limp , her steps as faltering , as if treading on cotton-wool
then you can come aboard
in the ning mansion
but now that i have some money , why should i ask you to spend any more on me ?
the jia family of the rong mansion
this matter is urgent
a few maids were emptying on to the floor some sacks of dates , pumpkins and other farm produce
if wafted by winds or pressed upon by clouds , it is thrown into agitation and traces of it may escape
we ’ ll see if you can go on being so cheeky then
go ahead with whatever you have to say , prompted tu
a true confucian is born in changshu county
the bystanders and neighbours could hardly suppress their laughter
a little thing like this might throw other people into a fearful flurry , but i know you ’ d have no trouble handling bigger things than this , madam
and hsiao made a mental note of this
he and fan chin made way for each other ceremoniously , and once inside the house bowed to each other as equals and sat down in the places of guest and host
zhan ziliang paints excellent pavilions in the meticulous style and cheng rixing does superb beauties
this is too much of an honour , he said
let ’ s amuse ourselves outside
chou chin and fan chin lead miserable lives before passing the examinations , but once they pass they feel as if transported to heaven
— that ’ s why she dislikes her
he 's not here today , is he ?
are you two from hao village ?
disclosure of a secret
trust you to think up such a phrase
now what ’ s the girl up to ?
why should he be such a miser ?
now that he 's gone , we shall have to beg our way home
the renegades qing bu and peng yue were doomed to be slaughtered ;
you must have seen a good deal , uncle , in the seventy years of your life
if the horse is here , the rider can ’ t be far off
let us turn back now to zhou rui 's godson he san
what other petition have you ?
there ’ s nothing to be afraid of
he is the gentleman who wants to marry
the two women stood up , beaming , to thank her profusely and make a show of declining ; but on xiren 's insistence they accepted the tip
for all you ’ re so handsome , you ’ re nothing but a fire-cracker without powder — good only for show
and though madam you came over every day she dealt only with routine matters , careful not to overstep her authority
yet to riches and rank each aspires ;
he cried , gnashing his teeth
but it has never yet been put to the test
jia lian went ahead to the old lady 's place and whispered to jia zheng that all the preparations had been made
he was just about to leave , when two men came in to appeal to him , and he ordered them to approach for questioning
because of this , she wouldn ’ t touch any breakfast
the emperor ordered ping chih to return to peking , the two commanders were to wait at their posts for promotion , and hsiao 's appointment as a lieutenant was confirmed
i am going to my shop
the girl 's sorrow : her husband falls mortally ill
when lady wang sent to ask for baochai , arid baoyu knew that the monk was outside , he hurried all alone to the front crying out , where is my master ?
if i wish you harm , may heaven and earth destroy me too , she sobbed
i told them i belonged to the west mansion and broke out , but those fellows would not let me go
if anyone is unkind to her , she must say so and not treat us as strangers
her eyes brimmed with tears again
her boots were of green leather
i have already spent a few taels , and must keep a few more for my journey to hangchow
baoyu stamped his foot and sighed
is the answer flower ’ ?
xichun told her all that had happened the night before and showed her the ingots found among ruhua ’ s things
it should not take more than a couple of days to mend them , and i shall ask you only for the midday meal
that same instant up come two stewards ' wives from the feng family
how farsighted and circumspect pinger is !
tang shih joined them at table
the two stewards whose indents she tossed back withdrew very sheepishly
it had to be kept a secret , and i was just beginning to feel better , able to get out of bed
zijuan nodded and said to jia lian , the gentleman is absolutely right
luckily there was still a bit of cow bezoar left , and it ’ s ready now
yuanyang went back to report this to the old lady , who in elation sent her back to urge aunt xue to explain the situation to baochai so that she would not feel unfairly treated
if the blossoming of the crab-apples was a good omen , he shouldn ’ t have lost the jade
she came over dizzy and after a fit of coughing spat out a mouthful of blood
it wasn ’ t because they had offended me
why is xiuyan engaged to my younger cousin before my brother ’ s engaged ?
then manao was sent by the lady dowager to ask :
there are even inscriptions on the jade , isn ’ t that extraordinary ?
yet instead of trying to keep her away she blatantly brings her here to carry on in that shocking way , not caring if people laugh
that was my misfortune , replied jia yun with a smile
your honour will naturally be invited
wuer decided to share the gift with fangguan ; so she wrapped up half of it in a piece of paper and as it was now growing dark , with few people about , slipped through the flowers and willows to find her friend
i ’ ve sent to find out what ’ s up
closely connected as we are , it was my duty to attend to your mother 's funeral , said mr chang
they asked in surprise
i must be off to see to some business
on no account protest for feat i lose face
even in her own quarters she ’ s turned down two or three requests
that 's a large printing centre
he stamped frantically in anger
throw him out , quick !
but although she lay down her thoughts turned to the crab-apple trees
then in his own hand he drew up a moving appeal on white silk , signed it with his own name and sealed it with the tungkuan county seal
this is made of peacock feathers and gold thread , she observed after examining it carefully
if your son disciplines his son , it is for the honour of our ancestors , he pleaded
the clear notes woke the echoes all around , and the birds alighted in the boughs to listen
dear cousin , do make me another sachet tomorrow
don ’ t you know who this miss pinger is ?
she brought out another plate for fangguan , adding , wait , i ’ ll brew you some good tea
we ’ re never told the details of their intimate family life or daily meals
after a few moves , ma realized that this was no common player
welcome guests who were treated with favour they announced ; but those who were cold-shouldered they turned away , even if they were relatives , fobbing them off with excuses
tossing it into her lap , he turned to go
jia zheng went out and saw it was jiao da
it really is egg—plant , they assured her
i shall be delighted to participate in such an important ceremony , replied tsang
what ’ s there left for me to live for ?
choking with anger daiyu burst into tears
if you have any trouble , uncle , he said , do not be afraid to tell me
otherwise people might say we ’ d drunk monkey ’ s piss
we mustn ’ t ever mention it again
let 's all give our ideas for general discussion
this would be only right and proper
that ’ s why , in my dilemma , i told you that fib to see how you felt about it
set out too was a crimson gauze screen in a carved purple-sandalwood frame embroidered with flowers and calligraphy
i wonder where it comes from
by the third watch when all was still , armed with daggers and narcotic incense they climbed on to the high wall and saw from the distance that there were still lights in green lattice nunnery
after a second 's thought he said , since moving out of the garden because of my illness , i have been living in the hack and have not been allowed to come here for months
did no one ask where you were going ?
he greeted niu yu−fu and asked : what brings you here , great−uncle ?
his eyes were red with weeping
and on both sides below the steps , tall vermilion candles blazed like golden dragons
she ’ s by way of being your honour ’ s benefactress
i ’ m better today , remarked daiyu
busy as you are every day , madam , do you still have time to do needlework ?
they took their places at both ends of the hall and the courtyard
now you are dead i come to bury you ;
that evening , in strict confidence , they sent mrs song off on this errand
then daiyu told a maid to fetch her favourite chair from the window for lady wang
you ’ re using the same image again , objected daiyu , but went on :
they made a clean breast of things , both admitting to sleeping with the assistant , and the assistant joined in the quarrel too
we ’ re afraid it ’ s epilepsy , was the reply
or xi shi 's mournful spirit fair as jade
vain are all these idle tears ,
what do you say to that ?
li wan made some lucky throws and captured several of the old lady ’ s pieces , at which yuanyang inwardly chuckled
the assistant magistrate says that mr wan has one really intimate friend and that if you mention that you are on good terms with that man , he will have complete confidence in you and trust you with everything
as each of them has two maids , that makes one string less
if you ’ ve no consideration for his mother , at least have some for lady wang
yen worshipped heaven and earth and the ancestors , then sat down to a feast with his new wife opposite him and the nurse and child sitting at one side of the table
now the time had come for the wake
her wanton coquetting had deprived them of speech
then the two of them began to lay their plans
just before you went over to the other house you told me to have them pasted above the door , yet now you ask where they are
then sheyue threw nineteen and it was xiangling ’ s turn
slightly reassured he pleaded , sister , why should you threaten me too ?
sheyue quickly passed it to him and while he wrapped the cape up turned to wink at xiren
in this passage the sage explained how his learning and understanding improved with the years ; that is why he specified clearly his attainments at fifteen , thirty , forty , fifty , sixty and seventy , to show different stages of development
i went to your honourable house yesterday , replied lu , and came on here today
there were about a dozen serving−women with them , who changed their dresses too
with a cuff , he knocked pin−niang over
depend on it , this is the reason
even if she wanted to , it ’ s not in her power
after grieving awhile he reflected :
hsiao went to his bedside to ask after his health , and described all that had happened since he joined the army
nowadays we ca not count on others help~ng us out , replied jia lian
you must consider yourself above the rest to disobey me like this
scholars like myself who reach officialdom through proper channels are imperial tutors whose pupils are the sons of nobles
one of my works published the year before last has already been reprinted three times
why ask me if i ’ ll have her ?
when they had breakfasted , mr wei brought out the wine and added ten catties of new wine to it , then ordered the servants to light plenty of charcoal and pile it when it was red by the cassia trees , setting the jar of wine on top
ca not you take a joke ?
but let us return to baochai who reached home to find her mother doing her hair
even your sister knows it was you
but before he could answer a young maid came out , and he and hongyu hurried towards the house , walking side by side , not keeping their distance from each other
i ’ ve forgotten to bring my pouch of betel-nuts , he said
qin ye was a poor official , but the whole jia household , high and low alike , thought so much of riches and rank that in the interest of his son ’ s career he had to pinch and scrape to get together twenty-four taels of silver as a handsome entrance gift
the next day aunt xue invited zhang dehui to a meal in the study at which xue pan presided , and standing in the back corridor she urged zhang very earnestly through the window to take good care of her son
i lost no time in summoning the bailiff and sent word to zhang ’ s mother too
the others had been surprised by beiming ’ s report
who ’ s been asking the servants for money ?
as second master ’ s personal attendant , you must know the whole story
this is all there is left , so he ’ s given it you with the bottle , fangguan explained
besides , that part is just by the ancestral temple
they heard another commotion , and jia zheng was wondering what to do when a wailing went up inside , master bao is dying !
she exclaimed , what is it ?
when madam you sent a servant for the third time to fetch her she said to keqing , take good care of yourself
far better come to us
the door opened and out stepped pinger with a large copper basin which she told fenger to fill with water and take in
'if you do well elsewhere , so much the better , he said
when doctor wang found such a company assembled , he paid his respects to the lady dowager before taking baoyu ’ s hand to feel his pulse , while zijuan had to stand there with lowered head , to the doctor ’ s astonishment
baoyu made no answer but found the path and walked on
when ma chun−shang had asked after the tombs , he brought the conversation around to the casket
this said , he darted off to catch up with the chair
he said his boss , wan hsueh−chai , has two boatloads of salt which will be sent off in the next couple of days , and he hopes we will travel with them and keep an eye on them
my late husband had a little property , said the widow
in three or four days , after reporting to my superior , i shall set out on a surveying trip
mu nai , at his side , could not understand what had upset him
xinger fell on his knees to kowtow
then he noticed how each time his nephew opened his mouth it was your worship this , and your worship that
there ’ s no need for that if you ’ ve already made the proposal
i ’ ll go and have a look
presently baoyu and baochai threw dice with the same number
she burst out crying
i also reprimanded the servants several times , and lately they ’ ve behaved better
and before it was light he called a servant−boy , and secretly bade him send in two of the stewards in charge of rents
feng questioned him closely and learned that the night before , when everyone else was sleeping , he had leaned out of the cabin to watch the girl in the sampan
if you can get someone he 's afraid of to slap him in the face and say , 'it 's all a joke
so the matter was settled and old pu went home
then although so eager to hear more , she confided , dear child , i am glad you are so understanding -- that 's exactly how i fed
xiren , who had overheard them , now hurried in
tea had been served three times and they now took off their outer gowns and sat down to discuss the transfer
if nothing is done , they can make things hot for him
let none disturb these chequered shades ,
the scholars , looking round the pavilion , saw that it had windows on all four sides and was surrounded by water
she therefore came over the day before the wake , when she recalled the old lady 's goodness to her , then thought of her own wretched fate
if your boy wants it , make haste and write out a statement of his antecedents
i had a husband-and-wife orchid , she told him
i promise not to
three days later a mourning service was held and further masses were performed while waiting for jia zhen
so you knew we ’ d lost some things recently , remarked baoyu with a smile
i thought you were ill , child , the old lady exclaimed
baoyu appeared very willing
in future i promise to do better
baoyu noticed that her eyes were red from weeping
who has planted this flower before the frost under the moonlight ?
what a good girl !
i know you are good at drinking games , madam , chuckled aunt xue
our dynasty lives up to this prediction
suddenly granny liu recalled having heard that rich folk had in their houses some kind of full-length mirror
accordingly , the first thing the next day , jia rong went back to the city to see old mrs you and tell her his father ’ s proposal
in our family except for madam lian who ’ s too busy with household affairs and , besides , can ’ t write all the ladies are going to write copies , some more , some less
if you dare kick feng in the groin , you will deserve your reputation
after my second sister 's marriage , though , all the girls died or were married off
now tell me this
her deafness made baoyu frantic
i ’ ve never heard of such an orchid , douguan protested
however , xiren , keeping quiet , heard it clearly
you can be together every day , but it ’ s rarely i have a chance to visit you ; yet you pay no attention to poor little me
lady wang said soothingly , you ’ ve already married this oaf , so it can ’ t be helped
meanwhile qin zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that nobody was about to go in search of zhineng
according to ming dynasty regulations , a special seat was set in the room of a successful candidate , who sat down while attendants bowed to him
still , at least the sentiment suits the scene
won ’ t you wait in the other room for a while ?
having got what she required from them she hastily made caiming list these things , then handed them over to the serving-women
now i hear he ’ s out and you ’ re not going over there today ; besides , this early autumn weather is neither too hot nor too cold ; so i ’ d like to go and pay my meet
she means to return all yours to you as well
quite a good effort
we always live quietly behind closed doors—why do you need me at home ?
could your memory have played you a trick ?
attendants promptly brought him a longan decoction and after sipping a couple of mouthfuls he got up to adjust his clothes
if he gets into trouble , i ’ m afraid we ’ ll be involved
take this to zijuan , she instructed her
three pairs of screws were brought ; but all that remained of them was eighteen fragments scattered all over the floor
here in our cave we have few fruits or nuts ; we must go foraging
let me just put it in a nutshell for you
the rest agreed , all right
today we may as well let ourselves go , continued the old lady
all admitted that such a thing was even rarer
i will , promised mrs wang , reassured by this
have you always been in the zhen family or only worked there for a few years ?
how much will it be ?
pointing to the flower basket on the rock she fumed :
please excuse me , she said
baoyu stepped forward and knelt to do as he was told , but his mother instantly stopped him
he has just gone to sleep after taking his medicine
then xiangling curtseyed her thanks , and xiren went off with the soiled skirt
besides , both the elder uncle who 's dead and the second uncle who 's alive should be grateful for what you are doing
he was just going to ask for water to wash when a sedan−chair stopped at the gate
jia zheng knelt down and kowtowed
he ’ s in a bad mood these days mind he doesn ’ t beat you
you have done so many secret acts of kindness
pointing an accusing finger at her she swore
you ’ d better look out , she warned
she pretended that she was , but in fact stayed awake all night
after they had greeted each other , daiyu , who was also there , asked baoyu where he had been
he asked baoyu many questio~number as the two young men saw him out , then left in his carriage
with a smile this girl announced :
he found xiren leaning in the doorway of the entrance hail
when the woman had stepped outside she called :
tell me , what 's the relationship between you and baoyu ?
asked li wan and xifeng
in happy red court
in that case , joked xichun , when the old lady becomes guanyin you ’ ll be her dragon maid
as long as i ’ ve someone like her , i don ’ t have to worry about going short of anything even if my daughters-in-law or my grandsons ’ wives forget it
do you expect silver coins to come rolling in of themselves ?
then the whole troop , escorting baoyu on all sides , galloped off
though i still have my son lian , he always listens to his second uncle , and now that we have to live on him naturally lian and his wife will take their side
the hall itself , ablaze with candles and lamps , was so brilliant with silk hangings and embroidered curtains that the ancestral tablets , ranged in their places , were hard to make out distinctly
this speech effectively silenced the young man 's scruples
a gift of local products makes
her pink satin breeches were lined with fox fur
now lin ruhai had taught his daughter the virtue of moderation and the harm caused to the digestive system by drinking tea directly after a meal
i know nothing of this affair
you strolled here by accident
but he rushed back to stop her , begging , dear cousin , spare it !
i do not suppose you will come to serious harm , sir , in this lawsuit , he said
she shook the container , took out a slip , and smiled when she saw what it was
he asked then where he could get hold of an incense-burner
the two brothers were wearing official robes and the go−betweens auspicious dress
you haven ’ t yet drunk the bridal cup but already you ’ re doing her hair
but if our old ancestress gives too much for baoyu , it wo not be good for the boy and may even spoil his luck
i do not intend to use it
balked at every turn , yen did not know how to save his face
this man had a dingy beard , high cheekbones , sallow complexion and piercing eyes
aunt xue was most grateful and gave them news of xue pan
not seeing daiyu that morning , baoyu went to look for her and found her curled up on her kang
xue pan , jia zhen , jia lian , jia rong and some other close relatives of the rong and ning households were entertained in the outer hall
you were laughing at us not long ago , chin told feng
daiyu made no answer to this
filled with misgivings , cheng began to be hungry
why , miss , what is it ?
as soon as the visitors had gone lady wang asked xifeng what she proposed to do now
then they took off their official robes and sat down , while tea was served
may i ask how many sons you have , and whether your wife is in good health ?
he can get someone else to make him a better one
by now the show had ended , and pao ting−hsi took his leave
don ’ t overdo your praise
but in my humble opinion , now that he and the young ladies are no longer children and , what 's more , miss lin and miss bao are not members of the family , cousins of different sexes should live apart
ghosts from outside don ’ t come in unless they ’ re invited by some family devils
xiangyun stared at xifeng until she said with a smile , here ’ s another about the lantern festival
the lady dowager , apparently at her last gasp , feebly opened her eyes and quavered , my son , i never thought to see you again !
accordingly they changed her name again
i weep with longing and shed tears , not knowing where to go
in the garden , the lady dowager led her party to enjoy the osmanthus in bloom , after which they returned to the feast and fresh wine was heated
i must say i have not the courage to pass myself off as someone else
when we go back we will fix a date , they told him
without further ado he asked :
your cousin zhen ’ s wife isn ’ t an outsider , so such formalities are uncalled for
and they were on such intimate terms , it was no wonder that their schoolmates suspected the worst
they can be excused their lessons today in honour of our guest from far away
whom shall we find as master of ceremonies ?
ha she is to be shown lenity and sent to the frontier to expiate his crime
i was wrong , but in future i ’ ll do whatever you young ladies tell me
that line about ministers of the celestial court must mean that you will be promoted to the rank of prime minister
plenty of glass vases and agate bowls have been smashed before without your flaring up
all right , go and report me to the old lady
zijuan handed the bowl back to xueyan and gently laid her young mistress down once more
where did you learn to behave in this scandalous way ?
when feng yuan demanded her back
said they live in some monastery
when jia rong heard this he told the lady dowager and xifeng , zhang hua and his father have fled for fear of being punished for bringing a false charge
you do not think i would let you get into trouble , do you ?
if i don ’ t , and my father knows , he ’ ll call me an idler
no matter how styles change , the reasoning remains the same
she ’ s frantic , that ’ s why she ’ s sent me to beg you to help
it 's not serious , someone shouted
not only can he count on the support of those three other families , he has plenty of influential friends and relatives both in the capital and in the provinces
we ’ ve been doing nothing but reckoning accounts for others
but if you try to conquer by force , weak as the people of chekiang are , i am afraid they will not submit
when she saw baoyu fit fangguan out as a boy , she followed suit by dressing kuiguan up as a page too
then those relatives and friends streaked off like lightning , leaving jia zheng , jia she and their households livid and trembling with fear
since she was so occupied , the girls called on li wan
after that he knew he could expect trouble , and planned to move to another town
i must meditate at the fifth watch , miaoyu remarked
meanwhile baoyu had scuttled back to grand view garden
recalling what bao yong had said , she felt sure the thieves had seen miaoyu and returned last night to kidnap her
you can ’ t trust these people an inch , miss
in addition , in an unoccupied room behind her kang hung a seven-star lamp , and under it were straw effigies — some with iron bands round their heads , some with nails stuck in their chests , some fastened with locks
he was wearing an old felt cap , a tattered grey silk gown , the right sleeve and seat of which were in shreds , and a pair of shabby red silk slippers
he washed and rinsed it several times , after which he picked up the pot and poured out half a bowl
jia zheng did not know what rejoinder to make to this
i lost no time in summoning the bailiff and sent word to zhang ’ s mother too
the general 's rank is so high and his sons are both so talented , an old dunce like myself can hardly set up as their tutor !
civil officials are even worse
chin 's face turned the colour of earth
he had never been treated like this by jingui and baochan before ; yet as the latter said it was to thank him for helping xue pan , this seemed to him quite natural
so instead of praising you , sir , they complain that you do not understand the situation
do us a favour , won ’ t you , and calm down
well , when you sent me these things , i knew cousin lin must have her share too , explained b ’ oyu
when daiyu heard that jia zheng was coming home , she knew he would certainly check on his son ’ s studies and was afraid baoyu would get into trouble
let ’ s quietly invite miss baochai and miss daiyu over to play for a short time
when he reached the inner courtyard he found the wicked monk seated on the couch in the central room , a bright sword in his hand
and facing you i treasure every moment
she wanted to send wuer there as a maid but had no one to recommend her
as soon as he arrived , he grabbed all the business with official families
can ’ t we talk if we want to ?
that 's what was so strange
his dejection made his old illness flare up again , and instead of answering he grinned inanely
aunt xue said with relief , i was hoping you ’ d come back to see to our family affairs
sheyue urged the woman , steady on
and now you are sighing again
but the next day he returned mr huang 's call , and when they met they started comparing notes
cried baoyu , i may as well wash here to save the trouble of going back to my room
i will set a subject then , and you can write on it tomorrow
i can ’ t remember too clearly , was xifeng ’ s answer , but i felt i couldn ’ t control myself , as if someone was pushing and tugging me to kill people
the red-jade shadows of caltrop apart has tossed ;
they all went the nest day to the temple and offered incense , then slept there at the foot of the altar while their spirits waited for the king of hell to appear
yoo suppressed a snort of laughter , and kept old cheng to lunch
xifeng had already left on the pretext of some business , while yuanyang had retired to her room to sulk
she ’ s worked for me all these years , so i slipped in to see her
their graves are a mass of briars
so saying she entered the room , inspected the embroidery and praised it loudly
get up , ordered lady wang , have another careful search made
in the second place : she gets on well with the older and younger mistresses alike here , and never tries in my name to ask this mistress for clothes or that for money
he waited , listening intently , but no one came
this type of appointment is worse than none at all , rejoined chin
first soldiers and runners marched past two by two
if you pass it , madam , it can be sent over
in the absence of ha she , jia zheng was the head of the house
but as people say this sutra , like taoist canons , is only the shell of truth whereas the prajnaparamitra sutra is the kernel , this second sutra must be included as well to make the offering more meritorious
and after tea had been served three times , he was taken into the bridal chamber for the wedding ceremony , which we need not describe in detail
i knew you ’ d be no use
i propose that we carry the coffins back into the main hall , and choose a day for the interment later
she has work to do at home
what do you say ?
the metropolitan examination was held by the ministry of rites , the test examination by an official appointed by the emperor , and the palace examination by the emperor himself
forty years ago , i spent whole days with your father
is he a relative of yours ?
make haste to despatch your business
the two friends rushed furiously in to complain to jia rui of jin rong ’ s uncalled-for insult
two or three times xue pan , emboldened by wine , stormed at his wife and threatened her with a stick , but jingui simply dared him to beat her
at least we should agree on how often to meet , urged baochai
huge horn lanterns high on both sides of the main gate of grand view garden cast a brilliant light , while all the paths were lit with lanterns too
yuanyang cheerfully assented and cried loudly , the table is covered with legs
in that case , i beg you to be the go-between
even if he ’ s still living he ’ ll be in a coma , so it wouldn ’ t be any use sending for him
she announced that all the men-servants ’ wives were to come to her early the next morning for instructions
i have plenty of rooms , he said , when he learned their business
this morning , our teacher set huan and lan some couplets to write
but to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
we ca not count on it , though
i want you to buy something for me today , but don ’ t let anyone see it
fan chin 's wife wailed as she prepared the food in the kitchen
~you need not raise money outside , replied jia lian
the old lady frowned
within three years an end will be put to famine
this is your wedding day , she answered
although it could not be called a large party , they had collected quite a number of people
under the peach-blossom behind seeping fragrance pavilion
she ordered some matrons to deliver the hamper of crabs and tell xifeng that she was keeping pinger there
by the time this was done it was nearly the second watch and after sitting up for a while to chat she sent them all to bed , then retired herself
some suggested a monk , others a taoist , yet others a marionette
then pao wen−ching also ordered his son to stop weeping ; but he himself fell ill
i was not in a chair , however , but riding on a donkey ; and when i wanted to alight , the attendants would not let me
yingchun was vexed and depressed by her nurse ’ s disgrace
when jia lian finally came home after completing his business , he went straight to the new house
just tell your master that we are from the minister 's house , and he will understand
failing that , i can kill myself
i ’ ll get you some more
both my son and daughter−in−law have died , leaving me only this lout of a lad who is not yet married although he is already eighteen
won ’ t you teach me a few of them
who will go with me to keep me company ,
it would take too long to tell you that in full
a man often gets a thrashing too when he ’ s drunk
this should have been cut long ago , said the maid with a smile
i asked them just now , said tanchun
in his fury he ordered his own pages to beat them
if i wait till my mother calms down it ’ ll be too late , because qingwen ’ s illness won ’ t wait
the next day as soon as he was dressed , he sat down by the window to grind ink and practise writing in real earnest , instead of going straight to his grandmother
chunyan told him tearfully all that had just happened to her and yinger
no matter with what pains he schools his sons
why treat her so unkindly ?
i wasn ’ t expecting the honour of this visit , so i didn ’ t come out to meet you , she apologized
petition on behalf of his brother , a victim of foul play who-has been unjustly accused
fame and achievement depend upon study , not upon any supernatural forces
niu pu returned to the temple in a very bad temper , to sit there glowering
a jar of lichees preserved in honey
wiping her own eyes , she patted the maid on the shoulder
with that she shoved huan forward
when they had finished eating , they washed their hands and rinsed their mouths
she 's been spoilt since she was a child , declared the bawd
one can never be too careful , was baochai ’ s reply
so it 's all the same whether she sees me or not
the old lady must be waiting for you to start dinner
convinced that he had met the goddess of flowers and determined not to let slip this chance , he persisted , if you are in charge of this plant , sister fairy , there must be others in charge of those countless rare flowers
then chih hengshan rolled it up again , and they went on talking
from first thing this morning till now you ’ ve done so much talking , and you ’ ve a different argument each time
and praise on this sagacious reign bestow
you must have caught cold
he escorted them out , and tu and chih left
go in quickly , chou chi−fu told her , and bid your daughter prepare a meal for the two gentlemen
an old man like you should not behave so disgracefully , when it will make things worse for you !
now that he had made this row outside , they seized the chance when jia zheng was free to report that bao yong had been drunk and disorderly
it doesn ’ t really matter whether you listen to me or not , but why carry on like that ?
by the time she reached home she had over two hundred
how stupid of me !
don ’ t worry , poor old thing , said aunt xue , laughing
after that they washed their hands and lit incense , and a pint of beans was brought
since you are going to the magistrate 's yamen , you had better travel with me to antung and stay with me while you prepare clothes for your visit to the yamen
she 's right , agreed old chin
xiren and sheyue were nonplussed
though mrs zhou was not in charge , as the maid who had attended lady wang to the jia mansion at the time of her marriage she was a person of some consequence , and so quick-witted and ingratiating that all the mistresses liked her
it would be better for me to make the proposal
that evening , as baoyu was quieter , his grandmother and mother returned to their own quarters but sent several times during the night for reports from the sickroom
she turned to keqing
i haven ’ t drunk any cold wine , he protested
wei−hsiao , said tu , nobody irritates me more than these people who can talk about nothing except their official connections !
when presently the meal ended , the lady dowager and some of the others adjourned to tanchun 's bedroom for a chat while the tables were cleared and another laid for li wan and xifeng
he has now risen to the rank of under-secretary
on the sixteenth the villagers sent in contributions to shen hsiang−fu , who prepared a feast for the new teacher to which he also invited mei chiu , the new scholar of the village
yes , i meant to tell your daughter-in-law , but i was so busy i forgot , said xifeng
we ’ ve told qingwen and sheyue to attend master bao
i didn ’ t hear talk of that but of some scandal
so mrs hua and her son did not press the point
this goaded baoyu into sitting up
xifeng in to sit down
if they just dropped in for a call , well and good
now fangguan brought in a cup of freshly brewed tea which had been cooled in cold water ; for even in summer they dared not use ice , as baoyu was so delicate
it ’ s a present from cousin tanchun
at this , li wan could no longer restrain herself
a man called pao is here from nanking , he announced
although the daughter of a cook , she was just as good-looking as pinger , xiren , yuanyang or zijuan
i was only making a suggestion , said whiskers wang
the next moment whiskers wang came flying in
she ordered her maids to fetch lin zhixiao ’ s wife to drive the woman away
it ’ s enough if just pinger stays here
all this was preying so much on baoyu ’ s mind that the honour conferred on yuanchun failed to raise his spirits
he produced another plot ; and this time he bribed a man living to the left of it to say that one night he had dreamed that old mrs shih in ceremonial dress had pointed out this plot to him and signified that she wanted her grave moved here
madam you and madam lou joked to li wan , the one who ’ s drunk monkey ’ s piss is playing innocent !
no matter what small alley you enter , you are bound to see at least one house where a lantern is hung to show that tea is sold ; and inside the shop you will find fresh flowers and crystal−clear rain water on the boil
the third master has just arrived from peking
it was reported that the culprit was a servant of the former senior imperial tutor jia hua , which reminded his majesty of my ancestor 's name , and he asked me what it was
let me tell you , then
it 's too bad that in our time even those in refined ladies ' chambers have been contaminated
so they abandoned all thought of buying her freedom
her dimpled smile is peach-blossom in spring , her blue-black hair a cluster of clouds
which of the girls is that ?
the two brothers received him , and kept him to a meal
before he had gone half a mile , however , he heard someone calling : abbot huei min !
baoyu turned to whisper to sheyue , i didn ’ t know yuanyang was here too
ask fangguan to come out , urged wuer
we must set out by boat the day before , so that we can reach his house early and spend a whole day there
what 's the idea , lashing out in all directions ?
when xifeng was up and about there was someone to scare them , but now they ’ ll be taking advantage
go on , do not worry about that , said pinger
besides , everyone here from their ladyships down is ever so fond of you
old mr cheng was the head of the brokers ' guild
who ever heard of a man falsely claiming a father ?
in the ning mansion
beside himself with joy , although he sometimes talked nonsense he behaved quite differently from when he was demented
he was a handsome young man
but i ’ ve already reported it , and they ordered me to take her there
there haven ’ t turned to ashes yet , but they have dried up and lost their potency
i have some slight skill in archery , and can hit anything i aim at within a hundred paces
chih and wu said nothing
soon it was time to go to the examination in the capital
the other day i was sent a couple of bottles of scented flower juice and meant to give them to him , but thought he might waste them
they watched as feng rolled up his right sleeve
he swung himself into the saddle then and his pages escorted him to jia she 's house , where he found that his uncle had nothing worse than a cold
after a hasty leave-taking she mounted her carriage with baoqin to go back , amid general consternation
the next day a number of suspects were summoned to court and yucun cross-examined them carefully
the young people laughed and exclaimed , what an idea !
after they had talked for some time , chu hsien−fu rose to leave ; and ma chun−shang asked where he lived so that he might return the visit the following day
the new wife brought the wang brothers in to see how he was before they left for the provincial examination
seek the cause of untimely death in a part existence ,
now the music , on top of the wine , set granny liu waving her arms and beating time with her feet for sheer delight
wang told him their names , and teng sighed
he charged forward , knocking into everything in his way
i must go to cassia pavilion to find him
he stood up in surprise to greet tinghsi , and invited him to be seated
at once out came several fairies , lotus sleeves swaying , feathery garments fluttering , lovely as spring blossom , entrancing as the autumn moon
now that she was married , she felt it incumbent on her to behave as the mistress of the house , not with the gentle shyness befitting a girl — she must show her authority to keep others under her thumb
she made an old nurse put the broth and dishes in a hamper and carry this behind them while they walked empty-handed to happy red court
when chin reached his door he was shown in by two attendants in brand−new clothes
how can we respect a mistress ’ like that ?
if my sisters , brothers and cousins are nice to me , i will be nice to them too , regardless of which is the child of a wife or the child of a concubine
are not you my uncle pao ?
it was now feng ziying 's turn
and his successor too did faith inspire ;
and it ’ s too early by far to talk of learning
our meeting reminds me of mr cheng lien 's voyage on the ocean , responded tu
of course , in that society and under the influence of the literati of the time , it was impossible for any man to be completely indifferent to officialdom
baoyu grabbed hold of the cup and started drinking , and before he could speak again zhishan came to fetch zhineng to lay the table
although there ’ s baoyu , he ’ s not cut out for the job even if i win him to my side he ’ s not much use
she knows very well how it is with our young mistress but never shows the least concern for her
i have heard say , went on the old man , that our dynasty would have been as perfect as the chou dynasty during confucius ' time , if emperor yung lo had not seized the throne and ruined everything
you must listen to me so that later , when you become an official , we may meet again
you can punish her any time you please
though baoyu was married last night he didn ’ t share the same room with his bride , so today we should make him see you some way on your journey
but first zijuan went in to have another look at their young mistress , and found that she had kicked off her bedding again
so xue ke had to let her leave the wine
some others are up on the roof
suppose i first feel the pulse to make my own diagnosis
daiyu for her part was also remorseful after her quarrel with baoyu , but could think of no pretext to go and make it up
why are not you eating anything ?
i ’ m most grateful for you help , sister
the young maids there also denied any knowledge of his whereabouts
what about the third of next month ?
tell me all these things clearly , you dog , and i may spare your life
niu pu−yi chanted poems , iron−armed chang performed his sword dance , chen ho−fu cracked jokes , the lou brothers appeared extremely cultured and chu hsien−fu extremely elegant , while yang chih−chung looked venerable and chuan wu−yung eccentric : thus the party was unique
i see now that it 's no good basing your opinion of somebody on hearsay
yuanyang assented and withdrew to pass on these instructions to serving-women , who went off to relay the message
his hair was tousled , his face streaked with mud , and one of his shoes had come off
i ’ ll follow suit , said aunt xue , and give twenty too
her maids ca not stop her !
at sight of her qiuwen smiled
why should he rush in if not to loot the place ?
they made merry till midnight , when the brothers left with their lanterns
staring about her she saw a box-like object attached to one of the pillars in the room , with a weight of sorts swinging to and fro below it
jia rong let go of his aunt then and grabbing hold of the maid kissed her on the mouth
when shall we see you again ?
you know the proverb , the empire ’ s officials control all in the empire
pin−niang was overjoyed , chin hsiu−yi drank his tea and left
please sit down , said mr hsiang , and i will tell you about it
jia lian knew that madam you had made this proposal because she was not on good terms with xichun , who could not take effective charge ; and xifeng was too ill to cope
and now a letter came from xue ke which aunt xue had read to her
she had only just married a talented , handsome husband with a cheerful disposition , but then he had contracted this fatal illness which might any day carry him off
her heart is loftier than the sky ,
is not your mistress taking medicine ?
this girl is perfect for you
ma was seriously wounded , and died a couple of days later , but his body has not been found yet
daiyu , her eyes half closed , took two or three sips , then shook her head and would not drink any more
there were only miao women there
have you recovered completely ?
there are some pleasant rooms over there that you should see
turning away , li wan saw that zijuan had vanished and asked xueyan where she was
it was not xiren but qingwen
and at each prefectural town or county seat you come to , show this scroll to the local officials
i won ’ t have you coming here again tomorrow !
there ’ s no need to send a feast to the other house
lady xing of the other house often takes yanhong , cuiyun and other young concubines there
i put you to so much trouble the whole year round , don ’ t stand on ceremony now , urged the old lady
when he shows so little interest in all those who belong to his household by rights , what time has he to waste on you ?
tomorrow i will send sedan−chairs to fetch your wives
this is better than being squeezed by those stewards outside and having to pay them
if you are fond of me , mother , take my advice and now that you are old take better care of your health
at last everyone was able to breathe again
you are drunk again , talking so wildly , they objected
jia zheng arrived in the middle of this dispute
i ’ m not coming here any more , sobbed qin zhong , if jin rong is allowed to stay
beaming all over his face he said to his second aunt :
baoyu fails to find a true friend
once this trouble blows over we must hurry up and arrange your wedding , and that will be one less thing on my mind
after drinking a few cups of tea niu pu went back to the temple
kuo tieh−shan and i were equally famous in our young days for our skill in the military arts
the patriarch , holding an arrow , asked , who will go and steal sweet taros ?
and the next morning niu pu collected the seals , stamped the two volumes and put them away in a safe place
the pages outside say he was at a loss because you would not let him have the jade
i know him , of course , but not well
if they need help , madam should use her own discretion
on second thoughts he decided , never mind
simmering with resentment they cursed their fate , for separation in life is harder to bear than separation by death , and saddest of all were the people seeing them off
so now with a radiant glance at him she complied
if he ’ d never shown up , i ’ d have stayed single all my life
the prince of xiping will deterrnine what other measures to take according to the earlier decree
just now , said niu , when i learned from your uncles that your father was no longer with us , i felt very sad
next time your master wants baoyu to meet or entertain guests , you can tell him without reporting it to me that i have forbidden the boy to set foot outside the second gate until after the eighth month
as he and his wife watched by the bedside , weeping , he gave orders for the funeral ; and when evening came the old lady breathed her last , so that the whole household was in a ferment all night
i am ashamed to display my incompetence before a connoisseur like yourself
steamed-bread convent was the popular name for water moon convent because of the good steamed bread made here
the other two seeing that he was drunk ignored him , simply putting out the light , then lying down to sleep as best they could
what do girls like you know about such things , child ?
the lady dowager smiled and pointed at daiyu
i know what to do when i am sent for
your cousin knows best whom to send
theat ’ s all we ask
yu yu−ta was disgusted by the way they talked
go to cassia pavilion at the end of the north corridor , he read , and ask for lai hsia−shih , who is newly arrived from yangchow
being a cosseted girl from a wealthy family , the anxiety on top of her night-long exertions brought on a fever , she was unable to eat or even drink water
if he 's a minister 's son , how dare people cheat him ?
don ’ t be afraid , my child , said aunt xue
the meal at an end , baoyu went back first to the garden as he had qingwen on his mind
re then retired to his room
jia lian stood up hastily too
yu yu−chung felt relieved of a crushing load , and wrote to recall his brother
i ’ ll keep it for you , and let you have whatever you want when you need it
jingui had meant to make a show of annoyance , but now his flushed cheeks , sparkling eyes and appealing expression had melted her anger away
as long as i live i shall try to repay your kindness !
the wine ’ s cold but you ’ d better take a sip , old ancestress , to wet your gullet before debunking their lies
how should i for my sallow features care ?
because yuanchun had borne no son , her posthumous title was virtuous and noble imperial concubine , according to the rules of the imperial house
baoyu , disappointed as he was , could hardly leave at once
it 's true that in a place like nanking even cooks and porters are cultured !
chen ho−fu , at your service
the two brothers were chuckling to themselves , when the boatman opened the cabin door and asked lou feng to step on deck where the bullies could see him
but soon repenting other counsel heard
the instructions read , all the feasters must drink a cup by way of congratulations , for this is the queen of the flowers
i ’ ll make a guess , said daiyu
don ’ t believe a word of it
baoyu stopped eating , rinsed his fingers and sipped some tea while exchanging a few more remarks with the two nurses , who then took their leave and were seen off to the bridge by qingwen and some other girls
the constable protested , if they did not break in openly with torches and clubs , how can you call them brigands ?
responded lung san reproachfully
even if you didn ’ t see me , we called you at the top of our voices a dozen times , but that only made you run the faster
how long can you go on like this—neither fish , flesh nor fowl ?
how do you know ?
one of the servants accompanied the chair to a house with a big gate by the riverside
unfurl the sail and fit up your oars to row back
and now that he has a fortune he has come to settle down in nanking
to miss baochai ’ s place
he was my father , replied tu , surprised
at any rate you will have to go
at this , daiyu broke out in a cold sweat
at last , at about eight o'clock , his sedan−chair turned up , with two men running before and behind it carrying two torches each
last year , chu−ko told hsiao and chi , examinershen set a poetry test for students from twenty−seven counties in our prefecture
after i left , did sister xiren send anyone to see sister qingwen ?
i use one hundred and twenty different ingredients which complement each other just as do a prince and his ministers , and co-operate with each other just as do a host and his guests
we shouldn ’ t play this game , she declared with a blush
next came a picture on a beautiful woman hanging herself of a tower , with the verdict :
it need not worry us , agreed mrs pao
xiren sent a maid to urge them , stop that noise
as people say , the way to happiness is never smooth ’ and nothing can prevent a match made in heaven
but hitherto i have had no opportunity of making your acquaintance
baochai and xiren too , it goes without saying , encouraged him to work hard
strolling in he found the bamboo portiere down
and in that case , if xiren 's pay is not cut cousin huan ought to have a maid with the same pay as well , to be fair
the mistress made people help her back to sleep ; but because of that commotion outside we did not get her a doctor
at sight of zhen baoyu he felt as if they were old acquaintances , while young zhen too had the impression that they had met before
do as you think fit
how can we put up with that ?
alas for the ning mansion , once so grand !
the girl 's delight : a good fuck
in those days the price of a salt licence was high , and when he had made forty to fifty thousand taels of silver he bought his freedom , purchased this house and set up in the salt business himself
haven ’ t you noticed recently how she ’ s been avoiding you ?
now that jia zheng had inherited the title and apparently still enjoyed the emperor 's favour , they hurried over to offer congratulations
but what reason has anyone to hate baoyu ?
he was unable to leave before the end
as he said this he winked at his second aunt
dear cousin , let me off
then all the family , great and small , began to wail and prepare for the funeral , placing the coffin in the central hall of the third courtyard
whenever i miss some dead friend , whatever the date , i burn incense and offer some fresh water or tea , or maybe flowers or fruit , or even meat or vegetables
old chin hastily called his son to make tea , kill a chicken and cook some meat to entertain the bailiff , and asked wang mien to accompany them
we told aunt xue , and she was only too willing
after jia lian reached pinganzhou he called on the governor to settle his business , and was told to come back again before the tenth month
this is only everyday family fare , put in lady wang
xiren overtook him to ask what was amiss
when she entered xifeng ’ s room with her hair dishevelled and her costume rumpled , like a frail beauty just aroused from sleep , lady wang immediately recognized her as the girl she had seen
as she was not wearing a skirt , he could see her pomegranate-red trousers with floral designs and her new embroidered red slippers
she 's nothing to do every day and needs something to keep her out of mischief
when the men who were friends with the first ten actors on the list saw the notice , they were delighted
but though baoyu was recovering steadily , he had not overcome his infatuation and he insisted on going to mourn for daiyu
we can not look for a speedy recovery
being at a loss , she could do nothing except berate xue pan
they were crying out for joy
even if she 's busy , you would think she would put in an appearance to please the lady dowager and lady wang
have no fears about that , his secretaries assured him
in this packet the medicines : plum-blossom powder , purple-gold pills , tonic for the blood and restorative pills , each kind wrapped up with directions for its use
i managed to fill that whole dark blue porcelain pot , but it seemed too precious to use so i ’ ve kept it buried in the earth all these years , not opening it till this summer
first of all , your hearts are at peace , so you are more spiritual and have quiet perception
when the others had left as well , baochai asked xiangyun where she had found the ticket
worried because she was not likely to recover , jia zheng sent to ask leave from his yamen and be and his wife attended her day and night
they may take a little finding
besides , you will need to take quite a few servants south , and as that will leave fewer here i can cut down on expenses and get by
why , this wine has body all right , said lou chan
cousin lin is talking like a southerner , teased tanchun
don ’ t laugh at me , miss , cried xiangling
who else is there to see to things ?
there 's something else i want to ask you , she said
where does that luting come from ?
terrified , niu pu asked : what have i done to offend you , great−uncle ?
arguing that shooting at random could not improve their skill and might even spoil their style , he imposed certain penalties and set stakes as an incentive to all to do their best
when he comes out , we ’ ll give him some more silver and that will be that
then the lady dowager saw them out no farther than the inner ceremonial gate
one was that piece , she answered , in which li kui abuses song jiang and then apologizes
now you two are getting on fine , but i ’ m left out in the cold
before you have got over it , here you are starting again !
regarding himself as the master now , he decided , here 's my chance to avenge
strangely touched by this , she stopped to listen
she ordered more wine to be heated , saying , i ’ ll drink a few cups with you and then we ’ ll have our rice
hurry up and take that wine back to the temple , and on no account show any despair or panic
why leave your post and come here ?
tomorrow we shall have to change this for her
so why not use that line from an old poem :
since the child was so delicate , her lessons were irregular and this meant that his duties were light
since you are one of the ablest officers in kiangsi , if you surrender i will have you promoted
why did not you come last time we sent to invite you ?
but he demanded that i pay the interest for all these months
have you asked any other guests ?
you just have a good rest
how many girls are there in your family ?
to tell you the truth , gentlemen , scholars of the five northern provinces respect my name so highly that they often light incense and tapers to me on their desk , calling me ' master kuang of sacred memory
this is no time for jokes !
the attendant sneered : your honour is right , of course
just then , as luck would have it , up came a nurse with a kettle of boiling water
the girl playing wenbao ad-libbed :
by now the contributions had been counted and they totalled just over a hundred and fifty taels
chu−ko 's arrival put a stop to this conversation
it must be the pill i took this morning
kuang ta had just finished gathering together his wares
what more apt than the spring of wuling ’ ?
composing herself a little she said
a whip cracked three times , eunuchs trooped out from the inner palace bearing golden censers of ambergris , and palace maids with long−handled fans escorted the emperor to his throne
go on , he said
tell these novices to get ready at once to drive to town
when did i ever have money from you ?
i am very ill , and do not know if i shall see you again
if i were you , i would go to another province to lie low for a time
i do not believe it !
which of us would dare ?
baoyu started off with one line :
he says he knows mr wan too
if not for this rumpus you made , our party would have broken up long ago
and when the woman had kowtowed her thanks they left
i have twelve taels here , which have been given me
who was your patron ?
we have left it behind the temple until you go back for the burial
wasn ’ t that a young lady i examined just now ?
she asked with a smile
this is the green gauze you admired yesterday , she said
i wouldn ’ t think of troubling you
do you think you play better than i do ?
presently chuang shao−kuang came in , greeted tang , and sat down
after dinner , when baochai had gone to see the lady dowager , she went to bamboo lodge
she rolled up her hair , removed the false tongue dangling from her mouth , took off the iron halter round which the rope had been fastened , and divested herself of the red garment
then jiang yuhan took over
so baochai must have moved out for some other reason
you ’ ve written just five poems , cousin , he said
take your hands off me !
if so , how did the name come to be handed down ?
you ’ re wrong there , old ancestress , laughed xifeng
he said a whole lot , too much for me to repeat , answered mrs lin
if you find an insufficiency of grain , horses or other supplies , please use this sum to make good the shortage
we shall see if anything comes of it or not
even if i had two mouths , i could not get through all the eating
so far no evidence has been produced
otherwise you might abuse me for selling it too cheaply
then a messenger summoned them back to xifeng , who had washed and changed to remove the dust of the journey
we must celebrate for a few days and invite all our relatives
by painted pavilion grow willows and flowers untold ;
that 's not hard to settle , said old pu
the mutilated pouch , the fan-case in two or three pieces and the snipped off tassel were on the little table ; and daiyu , clutching two old handkerchiefs with writing on them , was gazing at them in tears
her powder and red chamber , her youth and beauty wasted ,
the fact is , this old woman had only one son
she went along the covered corridor to the gate and discovered baoyu there , drenched as a drowned cock
the idle screens gay ducks and drakes enfold ;
she played until it was late , then called zijuan in to clear up and went to bed
or am i forbidden to see him ?
shutting his mouth and closing his eyes , he munched slowly
feng really ought to give me that silver
now she remarked with a smile , if we are to play drinking games we must call yuanyang back
yours is bound to be good , so let ’ s hear it
the mystified taoist placed refreshments on the table and busied himself with the tea ; then he produced a volume of poems from his sleeve and asked for tu 's criticism
then later , if you pass the examinations , you will find better teaching jobs
she lodges in handkerchief lane by palace pool , where clients will find her signboard
the old lady 's waiting for you
no , i really must be going
don ’ t ask me , said xifeng
oh , no , you don ’ t , laughed baochai
they control this household and run everything but pay no attention to you , their only younger sister
then there are others like li guinian , huang fanchuo , jing xinmo , zhuo wenjun , hongfo , xue tao , cui yingying and zhaoyun
so jia qin became their lover and whenever they had the time they would get together and learn how to sing and play the fiddle
why pin it on me ?
but after one sip he put it down—the tea was cold
all our income and expenditure were entered in the accounts by lai da , wu xindeng and dai liang , and you can check on them by asking them , sir
xiren drew a picture of peach-blossom with the motto exotic scene at wuling ’ and the line another spring returns and the peach blooms red
recently i was entrusted with the purchase of flowers , and thanks to your great influence i have been able to make the acquaintance of many gardeners and visit many celebrated gardens
but it ’ s not very fair for the two mistresses to give less themselves , only sixteen each , and not to pay for anybody else either
you ’ re my goddess , he panted , going all out
in one respect only had she been unlucky
so she said , fetch them , and we ’ ll see
and i came back too late in the evening to see her again , so how else can i have offended her ?
i thought you wanted to pass the examinations in order to go up in the world , and that you had bought essays to study
especially when , a few days later , some old eunuchs came with gifts and silver from her , announcing that her highness wished to express her gratitude for the family ’ s concern , and apportioning each one ’ s share
but as the proverb says , 'public business comes before private affairs
mourning with bitterness my years ill-starred ;
they went to a tea−shop , sat down and ordered tea
he told a young maid to light a fire and burned the scraps of the letter
the instructions were : all must congratulate the one who draws this lot and make her drink three cups , drinking one each themselves
the twenty-four young buddhists and taoists from the dharma convent and jade emperor ’ s temple in the garden had now been moved out , and jia zheng had been thinking of sending them to various temples elsewhere
she can wear new ones every day if it comes to that
wouldn ’ t that be nice ?
what does it matter ?
since your second uncle went to this provincial post , instead of sending home a single cent he 's spent a whole lot of the family 's money
he 's afraid to come
zhang hua , given this cue , acted on lai wang ’ s advice and wrote out his plaint , taking it the next morning to the court of censors
he will tip you for your trouble
yuanyang , standing there , now whispered to the old woman , do not forget !
baoyu pointed at xiren
when your mother was alive she was ten times better than concubine zhao , so you should be superior to tanchun
she went into the bedroom to tell xifeng the same story
what ’ s the matter with her ?
she ’ s an honest old soul and on good terms with yinger ’ s mother
he found in it both condemnation of treachery and criticism of flattery and evil , but it was clearly not written to pass censure on the times
xifeng standing near them smiled
then yuanyang came to announce that dinner was ready
i would not tell this to anyone else but you
the other day , however , when mr lu met prefect chu 's grandson in your honourable house , he was struck by his genius
take my word for it , it will be best for you never to meet her all your life
jia zheng , aware that his mother might well be anxious , said with an ironic smile , so sometimes you are at a loss too , you young rascal
though you ’ ve done some calligraphy , that doesn ’ t amount to much
i can see the only one who counts for you is xifeng
do not tell him , for instance , how good prefect hsiang was to you
it 's only a few months since last i saw you , and now you look so ill !
search all the cells
how are you , granny ?
a couplet on the two pillars read :
it ’ s baoyu — he came here specially first thing this morning and talked like a silly boy
his father is an outsider — he dares not enter
but what can we do when he was born with such a strange cranky temper ?
then lady wang and her sister sat up half the night talking
she told zijuan to go back for one then catch her up she would be walking on slowly
caiyun lowered her head in thought and then agreed
he could not tell whether this was said by baochan or jingui , but it convinced him that they were up to no good
they presented the paper , and he read :
why , uncle , i ply my small trade and all i ask is not to lose my capital
still , when i was young and your kinsman mr jia yucun was my tutor , i read a few essays too
hsiao chin−hsuan knelt to pass the grain to dr yu , who placed it on the table
li wan and madam you laughed
you would much better tell the truth and say that your brother is in nanking now , so that they can send a writ there and you will be cleared
he was one of the party at oriole−throat lake , with mr yang chihchung , mr chuan wu−yung , mr niu pu−yi , mr chu hsienfu , iron−armed chang and the two lou brothers
luckily mr chen the apothecary was on hand
but we need not dwell on this
she was too far away to see what i was doing and thought i was picking plums , so she let out a screech , then started squawking at the top of her voice that this fruit hadn ’ t yet been offered to buddha , that their ladyships being away hadn ’ t tasted it yet , and that after the best had been sent to the mistress the rest of us would get our share , carrying on as if i were dying for her plums !
as luck would have it , it was just the time for the preliminary test for the provincial examination
she was followed by baoyu , xiangyun , the three jia girls and li wan , and their choices were put on in turn
could not these people have protected them ?
our mistress had some peeled for her to taste , but she refused as she ’ d just been drinking hot tea and said she ’ d try some later
and butcher hu cursed him again
saying this he took two volumes of poems from his sleeve and presented them to wan hsueh−chai
have you forgotten , sister , that even you sang one too ?
he passed her the book
if bandits attack us , i need only draw my crossbow and they will be done for
all present were both frightened and amused
the jia family ’ s cure for a cold or cough , among masters and servants alike , consisted mainly of fasting supplemented by medication
luckily her ladyship gave me twenty taels of silver yesterday to make clothes for the maids , and i haven ’ t yet touched it
his father was furious and swore he ’ d grow up to be a dissolute rake
i ’ ve even got the title ready for you
when lung san , all his bluster gone , had thanked chin tung−ya and slunk off , the prior took his guests downstairs , greeted them again , and begged them to be seated
at the gate of mr lu 's house they sent in largesse to the attendants ; then the gates swung wide open and music struck up to welcome them
a stop was put to this discussion by the arrival of wenguan with xiangling , siqi and daishu
soon it was the end of the sixth month
and not wanting her to grieve too much , as baoyu was still bemused xifeng quietly sent someone with the trumped-up message , baoyu is asking for you , madam
sweating with fright , i woke up and rubbed my head , and it still seemed hot
this quip rankled so much , however , that she reddened and laughed sarcastically
i told them you were away , and they put up at an inn , but they have been back every day since
you have obviously bought it to make fun of us , yet you ask whether i like it
would not that be more flexible and greater fun ?
they bustled in and out non−stop , and it was our mistress this , and our mistress that all the time
you ’ re to go to see your father after dinner
in time they ’ ll turn back into soil
the only thing that worries me is leaving my mother here by herself
he came into the world with three horns on his head and four eyes , eight feet in height , with arms reaching to the ground
shiyin with his innate intelligence at once grasped the other ’ s mean-
her highness wants more pines and cypresses planted in the northeast corner of the garden , as well as more flowers at the foot of the tower
second sister had married a scoundrel
mrs wang started with the other girls ’ cases and , finding nothing exceptionable , went on to open siqi ’ s case
most of their attendants were pages of less than fifteen , all grown men-servants being debarred from the place
don ’ t talk about pawning things for a mere thousand taels when i know you could easily produce three to five thousand of ready cash here and now
let me , stupid as i am , explain this to you
they were prefect chu 's nephews
the ladies are all in the gallery , one of the girls told her
such things can ’ t really happen
once you see i ’ m gone , you can slip out and no one will notice
let me go and notify them , said ting−hsi , smiling
the old lady and lady wang have their titled status of course , but your ten taels a month is twice as much as we get , and yet the old lady and mistress still pity you as a poor widow with no means of support
let us send out a notice for you , sir , suggested yin chao
you ’ re so intelligent you know the saying : if your arm is broken , hide it in your sleeve
ting leapt in his rage
all the maids admired her goodness , all the nurses praised her kindness
we certainly ca not complain about the way mr chi treated us
there , however , he ran into two of his father ’ s proteges , zhan guang and shan pinren , who hurried forward smiling
this is all owing to the virtue of our old ancestress , she said with a smile
thereupon xifeng ordered a halt
kaoyao is one of the most famous counties in kwangtung , he continued
how come you don ’ t realize how heating wine is ?
if you ’ ve taken a fancy to someone , say so outright , and we can make her your concubine to avoid any hint of scandal
can this count as foretelling the future ?
seeing the maid kowtow now , she hastily raised her to her feet , shedding tears of contrition and distress
the whole company burst out laughing
why is not rong here ?
and so the three of them settled down to sleep
i have no use for the likes of you , was his retort
wang han−cheh clasped his hands in salute without bowing to niu , and took a seat
a trifling matter like taking a man ’ s life wouldn ’ t frighten him away
hurry up and bring us some of the birthday noodles !
could this refer to cousin lin ?
on the way he heard of the general amnesty and received another letter from home confirming his pardon and official reinstatement
she reported that you ’ d just started the feast and wouldn ’ t be back for some time
asked baoyu in dismay
i just want to be prepared
people may call me crazy , but you ’ re even crazier !
where ’ s your elder sister-in-law ’ s contribution ?
yes , i have not seen you all for so long , today i had to come
at this daiyu forgot her nausea and rushed over to snatch the jade , seizing a pair of scissors to cut off the tassel
after chatting a little longer , wang hui left
baoyu hastily changed his clothes , then paced up and down frantically , calling for his carriage
even if she were out , pinger and fenger would hardly be out as well
she ’ s young and inexperienced in these matters , said lady wang
the page did so , saying exultantly , why go yourself , sir ?
the other day you even beat xiren , and now you are picking on me
you know that pair of shoes i started the other day ?
hupo , knowing that she meant to worship buddha , had placed a red felt cushion on the ground
if you stayed at home you would only sleep the whole day long
my mother ’ s sister ’ s child
it ’ s unheard of for servants from outside to enter the young ladies ’ rooms without any reason
it sounds as if the two of you are already of one mind , second sister chuckled
at that lung san lost his head , and removed his chaplet and clothes himself
here ’ s the bezoar , madam , she said
pinger paid no attention to such remarks , but when jia lian learned of them he was disgusted and each time he lost his temper would swear at qiutong
baoyu threw back his head and laughed
no , you ’ re obviously fibbing
what is your relationship , sir ?
yingchun ’ s maid siqi and tanchun ’ s maid daishu raised the portiere at that moment and stepped out , each carrying a cup and saucer
if you want it to be within your power , so do i !
then came a sudden knocking on the gate , and the maid opened it to admit zijuan and cuilu with some old nurses come to look for daiyu and xiangyun
the next day they invited the go−betweens to a feast ; but because ting−hsi had to go out with his company , kuei helped entertain the guests for him
i do not need any at the moment , but if we run out i will send somebody to fetch it
so considerate as you are to her ladyship , and kindness itself to those of us beneath you
but let us turn our eyes to the roseate clouds
we always sent off a few kites every year , so why begrudge one today ?
he fetched fifty taels for huang ta , who took the silver and left
the main pavilion became grand view pavilion , its eastern wing variegated splendour tower , that on the west fragrant tower
now that tanchun had gone and baoyu was staying indoors to recuperate , there were even fewer pleasure-seekers left
besides , if you want an official career , this is the scholarly way to go about it
on the eleventh , vice−minister hsu saw chuang to wu men , and waited in the waiting room while chuang entered alone
when my master came back to the governor 's yamen from nanking , he sent someone to peking to fetch the mistress
men laugh at my folly in burying fallen flowers ,
while baoyu was changing his clothes before setting out , a gift of sweetened junket arrived from the imperial consort
how thoughtful you suddenly are !
according to the last letter from nanjing , jin cai has had a stroke , sir , replied his son
when you have extra money , you should give it to the guild head to buy silk
they sat there till the sun began to sink in the west , and two dung−carriers set down their empty pails on the hill to rest
you do not know , madam , said baoyu , cousin lin suffers from an inherited weakness and has such a delicate constitution that she ca not stand the least little chill
at sight of him they stood at respectful attention
they mustn ’ t come in
sheyue and qiuwen had been waiting in the old lady ’ s place with two younger maids
and as human beings in a real society , they can not be perfect
she hid in the doorway to watch
did you read the end of the letter , uncle , where grandfather urges us to study hard ?
and now i am going to match you with my younger sister jianmei , number whose childhood name is keqing , and this very night at the auspicious hour you must consummate your union
after tossing off the cup of wine , in the hope of wine , in the hope of raising another laugh she observed :
it was only to ask you to stay for dinner with the girls
when she saw me she gave me two handfuls of cash -- how much it is i do not know
after that affair with bao er ’ s wife , the master seemed to be restraining himself and behaving much better
the other day i was asking our elder sister-in-law about you
she smiled at xiaohong
it soughed through the trees , and made the waterfowl take wing , crying in alarm , while wang mien and old chin hid their faces in their sleeves for fear
but what does the last line mean ?
i will pay it for you
i know nothing about it , he cried
mr shen agreed to this , and looked on while his daughter adorned herself as a bride
awake , to whom can i describe my grief ,
when the music ceased , chih bade them prostrate themselves four times , then rise
i can ’ t be bothered right now

but how did you guess ?
personally , i can ’ t stand poplars
i haven ’ t seen them , said baochai
if i would known , i would not have found him a wife or ruined your daughter 's life !
they had now reached the back door of the pavilion of heavenly fragrance , where baoyu was amusing himself with some maids
if we do anything wrong , i was sent here by her ladyship and you can report me to her
i was an actor by profession , and when i came home i had nothing to do , so i have been making a living by training a small company
not wanting to mention the maid 's suicide , baochai sat by her aunt in silence until asked where she had come from
that 's right , agreed xifeng
how can you sleep just after a meal ?
everyone in the room burst out laughing
as her quarters are in the back and she 's such a tartar , nobody
pray ask them to join us , said wan
there are no respectable wangs left now , and we could not invite people from this house just after the old lady 's funeral ; so only cousin lian helped out a little

don ’ t worry , baoyu assured her
she gave an evasive answer
jia zheng at once fell on his knees
as a rule she meditated in solitude and she was therefore reluctant to call in someone today to keep her company
as the boat rowed across the lake , pu mo−ching remarked to mr hu : i heard there was some trouble in mr
baoyu promptly slipped off the kang and went to his cousin ’ s door , before which hung a somewhat worn red silk portière
but what a scoundrel that lampoonist must be !
you spoke of 'friends
what would people think if they saw ?
everyone passed this , and so the game ended
coming a few croppers should cure him
the old lady nodded and sighed
we should not wrong innocent people
i don ’ t want to go out , replied madam you , but madam zhu over there is unwell and xifeng is laid up too
please go back as fast as you can , nephew , and send a messenger to convey my regards and say i shall call on him tomorrow
baoyu told them with a chuckle
let her move in now , and after a year they can be formally married
while they were sipping tea , another maid announced , the new wife asks permission to pay her respects
only his neighbour , old chin , realized how remarkable he was ; for old chin was an intelligent man , though a peasant , and he had seen wang mien grow up
at once xiuyan came out to greet her with a smile
she scolded ruhua for her stupidity , saying eating too much rich food had addled her wits
— who saved his life , yet we never thanked them for it
have you heard the news ?
he was not back till dawn
accordingly , the next morning when their case came up , the magistrate simply gave them a brief warning and drove them out
i have read much of your distinguished work

play 'the air to delight the spirit , cried chin
he has two other novelties : a screen and a musical clock , jia lian informed them
a servant reported , miss xichun has quarrelled with madam you ,
i shall have to wait for him to come back before i know what to do
so standing there by the table she finished all the food except two cream puffs , saying , i ’ ll keep these for my mother
zijuan ran to the kang to attend to her while the two other girls fell silent
the two brothers could not repress a sigh of admiration , feeling as if they had wandered into fairyland

hsiao chinhsuan and his two friends had run up bills at the shop and eating house , and could not leave till they paid ; so they asked tu to help them out

but the officials i have seen have all come to a bad end
kuang asked his brother−in−law to take his wife home with a letter to his brother explaining that she would invest some money in the shop and draw what she needed each day
she reached seeping fragrance pavilion as li wan and the , girls , just back from lady wang ’ s apartments , were laughing at baochai ’ s account of how xiangling had been versifying and talking in her sleep
but siqi had just emerged from a cave and stopped to fasten her skirt
and what could i give her to eat ?
decoction to improve the respiration , fortify
the lady dowager and the others believed her story
but at least let us leave jung here to serve you wine
men may say that in idle moments i ape children
if you kept me for no reason , it would do you no good and would break up my family
tell me as soon as the old lady comes , she said
may i beg you , sir , not to condemn him ?

now daiyu naturally preferred solitude to society
the jade hill crumbles , never to rise again ;
if your sisterin−law and nephews are stubborn , that will be your bad luck

in chapters forty−four to forty−seven , in the sections dealing with the morals and conventions of wuho county , the author 's views are sometimes directly expressed
so suppressing her grief she bade them all farewell , heart-rending as she found it to leave the other maids
i sent in my card today as a sign of respect
she took the reel and paid out the cord
he bowed and raised his clasped hands in salute , but daiyu simply ignored him , walking straight off to find the other girls
then they chatted a while
better tell the purveyors to have a whole lot of small gauze bags made
she had uncommon features , bright eyes and graceful eyebrows , and although no great beauty she possessed considerable charm
it was a mistake my marrying you because that ’ s made me step down one generation , as if i were the one chasing after power and profit
thereupon the runner produced two hundred coins with which he bought wine and meat
that sister-in-law there brought me some just now , put in granny liu hastily
on their return , baochai asked , did you see madam [ ian ?
we must have been fated to meet , sister-in-law
when they found the courtyard so quiet xiangyun walked towards the servants ' quarters in search of xiren , but daiyu peeped through the gauze of baoyu 's window
she is here now , and our master would like to marry her to you , sir
the ladies uttered cries of astonishment and hurriedly tried to slip into the inner room
the more i see of it , the less i want to leave
baoyu in front pretended not to have heard them and walked on a few paces , then stopped
why carry on like this ?
tomorrow you must try to persuade the master not to question those girls , but instead to fetch a broker to take them away and sell them
the old lady said everyone worked so hard while baoyu was ill that , now he 's better and all the vows have been paid , each one would be rewarded according to grade
she may do something for us for old times ’ sake
at first he ignored these rumours ; but when more and more people began to talk of it he secretly packed his belongings and , without telling old chin , slipped away by night to kuaichi mountain
i ’ ve already sorted out all her clothes and things and put them aside
if you have some-thing on your mind , why not ask her tomorrow ?
with her brother in jail , how can his sister get married ?
a table and chairs were arranged , the table laid , and they had dinner with the girls
jia lian replied thoughtfully , yes , was not it zhou rui 's godson whom master zhen wanted to punish that year ?
then the two brothers went in , not changing their manner to him , and expressed their indignation on his behalf
hurry up and kowtow to her
the two brothers hastily stopped him
i ’ m for ever finding him fooling about with them
a boat was moored at his gate , and to visit any of the other islands he had simply to ferry across ; but without this boat , not a soul could reach him
those are two sets of clothes given to the old lady on previous birthdays , she said

miaoyu promptly ushered them into the courtyard , luxuriant with trees and flowers
he regretted having passed on the news to lai wang , and was scared stiff for worrying what to say when jia jian returned
there are several different designs -- sprays of blossom , floating clouds and bats , butterflies and flowers -- the colours so vivid and the gauze so soft , i have never seen anything like it
you are so tickled at selling her life for a hundred taels , you would have been even better pleased that year to have given her to the elder master for a still bigger
chunyan had to accept it then
if you are not well looked after outside and catch cold , that will be bad
but why not talk openly instead of in this hole-and-corner fashion ?
since that woman has no son living , one of our sons should inherit my brother 's property
tearing himself loose he rounded on baoyu and qin zhong
she exclaimed in surprise

last year when i had a chill and a bilious attack , and doctor wang examined me , he said i couldn ’ t take strong drugs like ephedra , gypsum and citrus trifoliata
this is that iron−armed chang , who tricked my uncles with the false head !
small groups of village children would tag after him , laughing ; but he did not mind them
caressing her daughter aunt xue told daiyu , this child means as much to me as xifeng does to the old lady
at once i kowtowed and replied that it was jia daihua
it stings a bit but it 's nothing serious , baoyu assured her
kao and wan came down from the pavilion and walked up to them
mingyan was the first to be hit
having tucked the quilt around mr chen , she snuggled up to him to sleep again
but to be fair to your cousins , i pity the poor girls
whoever wins first place among the palace scholars shall drink a cup

in jia she 's absence , she had to send jia lian to the sun family to find out the situation
the autumn wind makes moan ;
each time this happened zijuan had to comfort him
if i tell you , it will upset you too

a great force of infantry and cavalry has reached drum tower slope !
not till nearly midnight did the brigade general go to the library to see the clerk , having ordered his attendants to withdraw

she has induced her young lady to join her lover
this is not my affair
jia zheng and jia she told jia lian to see him out

with these reflections , he felt put out at not being able to identify the girl and he studied her more closely
a thousand lithe east wind blows ,
baoqin was young and warm-hearted , intelligent too , and well-educated from an early age
and when he had finished she put the list away
there must have been a reason
how can you be so soft , miss ?
and xiuyan had a sense of self-respect
kuo tieh−pi agreed to this
he was a provincial graduate , and had served as a magistrate in his time
we ’ ve only just arrived , he told her
he is the grandson of our uncle who was prefect of nanchang
let others pluck laurel in the moon and dance
she accepted me as her mother , so she ’ s my daughter , was the reply
all these questions you ask show that you are a pig-headed pedant and wo not get you anywhere !
if you smash them because you like the sound , all right
we are born to put up with hardships , madam , and you to enjoy good fortune , replied granny liu with a smile
it will assuredly record anything said
kao is here , he announced
so they gave me this nickname
that evening yingchun stayed in her old quarters , and her girl cousins and the maids lavished affection on her
they had therefore asked leave to return to attend to the funeral
he was hesitating when he heard his name and turned to find that the old lady , lady wang , baochai and xiren had gathered round , tearfully calling him , and he himself was still lying in his bed
the moon , now in mid sky , was more dazzlingly lovely than ever
they found her lying on the ground , foaming at the mouth
do wait a bit , cousin lin
the prince of beijing in ceremonial robes had come out to the corridor to meet them
presently they were invited into the library to eat , but still they made no reference to the matter
some questions to ask him
but more of this in the next chapter
and when i asked about their daily life , her eyes filled with tears and she made some evasive answer
i suckled you , i raised you ; but now that you don ’ t need my milk any more , you push me aside and let your maids insult me
can her highness make over the imperial treasury to us ?
instead of making good use of the proceeds , however , he kept the silver at home to use as he needed
curiously enough , writers and scholars nowadays refer to wang mien as the commissioner of records , though actually he never served as an official for a single day , as i have tried to make clear
we mustn ’ t raid miss baochai ’ s quarters
for not doing that you fully deserve a beating
i am under such an obligation to you that , if i am spared , i am determined to repay you in full
pouring out respectful greetings as he entered , fan chin kowtowed again and again
lady wang asked what all this was about , and xifeng reported what had happened the previous day
it ’ s you who ’ ve spoilt her
not so vulgar , was it , that sudden idea of mine ?
it would take one of fan chengda ’ s poems on country life to do justice to this place
are you going to sleep outside again tonight ?
meanwhile baoyu and tanchun had also arrived and sat down to listen to this disquisition on poetry
after consulting together they write their prescriptions , but the medicine hasn ’ t done her the least bit of good
there are still some ways in which he could make use of some of us leading citizens
they are having the time of their lives !
it was not until the candles had been lit that a clatter of hooves was heard in the street
and if he is not able to save you , they will kill me too for talking !
it ’ s true you re one grade lower , but i know you ’ re all rich
baoyu , listening , was overwhelmed with grief
will it come back next year to see the blossom , i wonder ?
the consequences may be serious
give it to lai sheng
i have my share of literary fame , responded kuang
meanwhile the lady dowager had been looking through the window gauze at the back yard
do tell us before you leave what 's your good luck in a stretch of bad , urged baoyu
just then someone came in to announce , we ’ ve made everything ready
only when xifeng had sent this woman away did she go over to the old lady ’ s place
is there only one kite like this in the world ?
but during the new year festival we wanted to invite you to drink a few cups of wine with us
i then appointed an auspicious day
they have squeezed enough and no hard work ever comes their way
why come crying to me ?
then lady wang gave way to weeping too until caiyun who was attending her tugged her sleeve
she has maids in the garden to wait on her hand and foot , and i ’ ve prepared rooms for her in our place exactly like my own , where i meant to take her as soon as the old lady knew
let all three of them tangle together , that will be amusing
but we hope you wo not be long , sir
such creatures talk nothing but nonsense
i don ’ t believe it , replied mrs lin
not stopping to ask any questions she sprang up and hurried out , followed by suyun and biyue
the boy handed it to them
suppose we ask aunt xue over for a consultation here this evening ?
although , not to mention a concubine ’ s child , even one of the maids in our family is better than the daughters of other households
this is all xiangyun ’ s doing , said daiyu
in place of trees and flowers there was a profusion of rare creepers , vines and trailers , which festooned the artificial mountains , grew through the rocks , hung from the eaves , twined round the pillars and carpeted the steps
having agreed on this they retired for the night
why are you standing here all alone under the eaves ?
the splash it made startled the four girls
baochai said , that ’ s good sense from a flibbertigibbet like you , but you still talk too bluntly
he first met old mrs you and third sister ; then second sister came out to greet him , and he addressed her as before as second cousin
they all admired the subtlety of these riddles , baochai , however , commented , the first eight deal with authenticated incidents in history , but it ’ s harder for us to understand the last two fictitious ones
lin zhixiao ’ s wife agreed and left
yet cold the fingers from chess played by quiet window
if you use green jade ’ again , won ’ t that look as if you ’ re challenging her judgement ?
seeing fangguan still sleeping on the edge of the kang she got up quickly to wake her
make it five catties a day then , said the lady dowager
they were told to sit down and handed a fiddle and a lute
i think he ’ s better anyway than huan
besides , i know nothing about writing on sand
we have been waiting for you for some time
fangguan lying on her back in a flowered bodice , red pants and green socks was thrashing her legs wildly , quite out of breath from laughing
daiyu asked with a smile
i did not expect to bump into an official who would make so much trouble for me
better let master bao take the blame to keep us all out of trouble
let ’ s drink a few cups , then those who like can leave first
i ’ ve just put some scented rouge on my lips , she whispered
he says he won ’ t come because the master hasn ’ t invited him
the truth is , gentlemen , i am growing old and useless , said chou , now in his cups
not one of the bastards is here !
the dream of the southern tributary state
i do not know how to express my gratitude !
is mr wei a friend of yours , uncle ?
when hare and tiger meet ,
after hearing of such a feat , we should consume a whole gallon of wine !
then they went their different ways , pinger rejoining xifeng who asked her what tanchun had wanted her for
say one word more , and i ’ ll bury a white blade in you and pull it out red !
i was so frantic that , before coming back , i faced northwest and burst out howling
xifeng clowns to amuse her elders
though the lute is a refined instrument , i don ’ t think much of it
granny liu 's seat was on the east ; below it
that same evening the body was put in the coffin , and the next morning they hired eight carriers to bear the coffin to the ancestral graveyard
tang went neither to the city nor to call on other officials , but had a villa built beside the river , installed his books and lute there , and taught his sons
even those relatives and friends at your feast either went home or are keeping well away until they know the upshot
can ’ t you make do by finding other commissions at home ?
lai wang ’ s wife came with the interest on that three hundred taels , which i put away
master bao , it ’ s getting colder ; better put on more clothes , he advised
he fetched his horsewhip and gave him a few dozen strokes all over his back till xue pan , pretty well sober now , yelped with pain
that ’ s a good idea
jia lian called from the room
now the jias are the bridegroom ’ s family and the wangs have no one in the capital
i don ’ t think accounts need be turned in at all , said baochai
baochai was just giving xiangling some instructions when aunt xue suddenly let out a cry :
but if you kill him today , it means you want me to die too
swallowing her resentment she went on and found xifeng , sure enough , chatting in li wan 's apartment
if the dead man is zhou rui 's godson , then from her ladyship down the whole household is involved
the runners told him
but he was thinking : our third and fourth masters are a queer couple
but please , miss , for old time ’ s sake , let me die here with you !
she sobbed even more bitterly , so distraught that she threw up the herbal medicine she had just taken
told to pay his respects , he complied
he was to accuse him of marrying during a period of state and family mourning , against imperial decree and unknown to his parents ; of relying on his wealth and power to force zhang hua to renounce his engagement ; and of taking a second wife without the consent of his first
i ’ ve reported this to the mistresses
well aware of what he wanted , she only made a show of resisting
when , after the meal , tu mentioned that he wanted to find a house , chih heng−shan was delighted
now that baoyu ’ s ill , just-leave it to-us to do our very best to find it
at first his father tried to discipline him , but he ’ s long since given that up
why ask for trouble ?
the dice is thrown and wins the dots are red
if you really love me , aunt , will you be my foster-mother ?
so daiyu accompanied her to alpinia court
they hired horses and , accompanied by attendants , set off for kaoyao county
yoo bowed to him and tea was served
when this man saw niu yu−fu he put down his brush and came over
the imperial envoys asked after his father and instructed him , come tomorrow to the imperial treasury to receive your bounty
yuanyang ordered some maids to drag granny liu back to her table
why , cousin , he cried , surely you are sufficiently well versed in ancient and modern literature to know the title of that opera
do bring him in and let me have a look at him
i will get him to meet me in my uncles ' home to impress them
nowadays baoyu talks in such an ambiguous way , blowing hot and cold by turns , i can ’ t tell what he means , she thought
after jiang yuhan had moved on , there was some speculation about him
madam you and li wan shared a third table with xiren and caiyun
why , sir , chuckled the nanny , lowering her voice , i see now why the boy told me they ’ d invited a new doctor
this done , he fetched a big iron lamp he had brought from hangchow , filled it with oil and sat by his father 's side to read essays
then tanchun came to ask me to call on xifeng with her , but i felt too lazy to go
i remember when i first went there , i no sooner presented my card than he sent two attendants out to help me from my sedan−chair
it ’ s one that madam lian gave me
i have long wanted to make his acquaintance , but never had the opportunity !
this has always puzzled me
no need to tether these fine steeds with ropes , galloping round the walls how fierce they seem !
if they see this account of your exploits , i am sure they will be glad to write of them
and grub for money all their lives
in a few more days we will pack up and go back
but this time it was really my own fault
the old woman reached out with her chopsticks but failed to secure an egg
the saint 's image occupied the middle of the temple ; on the left was a stork and on the right a stone slab inscribed with twenty characters
he roared to baoyu ’ s other pages chuyao , saohong and moyu , all of whom were ready for mischief
so she treated her with contempt
i never expected you to grow so proud that flow you have no use for me while you are so fond of outsiders like baochai and xifeng
the more modest you are , the more respected you ’ ll be
would you like to meet him ?
i can easily fetch them for her
the reason for their fall , not far to seek ,
if you copy sutras now , i ’ m afraid you ’ ll wear yourself out
have you all finished ?
and since he came from a good family , pao would not train him for the stage but made him study for two years before taking him into the business
convinced by this reasoning , xifeng replied , in that case , i will go tomorrow and try
doctor wang felt the pulse for some time , then that of the other wrist , after which he and jia lian withdrew to take seats in the outer room
he ’ s raving again , they said
if i find you being too soft , i shall make no allowances for you , even though your family has been in service here for three or four generations
do not you really understand ?
after some talk about home affairs , they went to bed
the fact is , this business is more or less solved ; we ’ ve even found out as well who took the things missing from the mistress ’ place the other day
don ’ t let baoyu run wild
such was her plan
won ’ t you stay here for a few days , aunt ?
but my mother recently contracted a chill and has been out of sorts for two days
as my uncle and cousin are away , we mustn ’ t leave her here too long as this is a minor funeral
if there 's poison in the dish , xifeng explained , the silver will show it
i ’ ll put it away at once
the heaviest responsibility devolved upon xifeng , who , unlike the others , had not a moment ’ s respite ; but she was always so eager to shine , so anxious to give no one a handle against her , that she strove to carry out her many tasks as if they were nothing
if you both agree to be more careful in future , so that nobody loses face , i ’ ll ask master bao to take the blame
i was afraid she would scold me for over-salting it , and did not know what to do ; but then she moved to the hack of the room , and while she was not looking i changed the bowls round
in that case let me settle the rhymes , said yingchun
the prefect had invited them to a meal
husband and wife fell out
leaving the others to chat , she strolled into the bamboo grove before the steps and concentrated on thinking , deaf and blind to everything going on around her
concubine chao must keep her place
by the way , i have something to ask you
there were still some famous actors then
let me find out for you
go on with your fun , and don ’ t stop eating or drinking , she said when she had sat down on the rug
distressed to hear her talk like this , jia zheng and the others knelt down again and pleaded , do not take it so hard , madam !
your presence here contaminates this place and contaminates my door
until then i ’ ll fast , chant sutras and look after my mother while waiting for him to come and marry me , even if i have to wait a hundred years
mrs lin advised xiren and qingwen to brew him some puer tea
as for using his name , we ’ ve done that since he was a child , as well you know , on the old lady ’ s orders
i have seen the poem myself
look , cousin lin ’ s already left — she couldn ’ t last out any longer
don ’ t drag me in
it seems to me time to arrange a match for the young master
i did not ask for a single cent
i understand , he cried , clutching hold of them both
several maids dressed in red and green rose from the terrace and hurried to greet them with smiles
but in my seven or eight months here i have had nothing but a little meat and wine—not a copper have i seen
why did miss xue get the same as me and not miss lin ?
too frightened to pick up his scissors , the boy scrambled to his feet to run outdoors
tell her i wanted to send her word that her husband is staying in sweet dew temple in wuhu county
it was you who told him that
suspicion poisoned her mind
so miss shi is frantic
as the proverb says , injustice will cry out
touched by her besotted master
there are reasons against it , replied mr ma gravely
now magistrate tang happened to be the son of a concubine , and when he read the statement he thought , laws are one thing , but the human factor has to be taken into account too
we shall have to hire some for the servants , but how can the ladies take hired mourning carriages ?
his father-in-law tricked him , however , by pocketing half the sum and buying him some poor fields and a ramshackle cottage
whatever happens , do not let my aunt come over here !
what shall we do ?
asked one of them
why do not you lend them a room for a couple of days ?
senior licentiate yen invited them to take the seats of honour and , offering them wine , said , i should have invited you to my poor home , but i felt it was unworthy of you ; and , since you have to go to the yamen presently , i wanted to avoid unnecessary delay
i seem to glimpse some vision ;
so little by little these turned into gambling parties
the next loser was uncle xing , who when asked for a song said , i ca not sing
dear cousin , how fascinating you make it sound !
but servants of the throne like ourselves should be careful how we discuss affairs of state
all the villagers came and bowed to the ground to thank him
i worry too much about my children , she sighed
now jia zhen and jia rong urged their elders to mount their chairs or horses
what else is there ?
recently it has been rumoured that he has entered buddhist orders too
now that 's settled , put in baoyu , let 's go to paddy-sweet cottage
when i said i lost it outside , you wouldn ’ t have it , he reminded her
but some vestiges still behind the screen we discover
what else could fami
once outside , lai wang presented a packaged gratuity to the peasant family , whose womenfolk came to thank them
i didn ’ t want to invite some people , not others
when he had been served a meal , the old nurses , li gui and others strolled with him through the temple grounds till he was tired , when they took him back inside for another rest
are you escorted by the god of clouds ,
they petitioned the emperor on his behal { and the sovereign in his great goodness granted him an audience
it may be important
gaze up to catch the message from the phoenix , and sigh your answer to the azure air
not yet divined the fate in store for me ,
she hurried across and pulled the nurse aside
i want to go back but have none of you with me
but as yu leant out from his cabin window to watch , he saw another man on the bank opposite throw himself into the river !
then he borrowed a few taels from tu shen−ching , packed his luggage , and crossed the river to travel to tienchang
baoyu clapped his hands
yuchuan tastes some lotus-leaf broth
aunt xue ’ s anger over the scene with jingui upset her liver , bringing on a pain in her left side
it had papered latticed windows on all four sides
what brings you here ?
baoyu had to comply then
big as he is , he ’ s unique in never having had any proper schooling
she also allotted them the sanrie monthly allowances as were issued by the accountants ' office to members of the rong mansion
it would be still more senseless to offend any of these girls
stay here for a couple of days , he said
when no one else was about but zijuan , he took her hand
when i was young we had a pavilion like this too at home , she said
my name is pao , and i am a native of nanking
thus we can not arrest him
as you went in you saw three rooms with an eastern exposure
let 's go back to your place , shall we ?
he is for ever taking his wife to taverns
but with your cousin pan in this fix and your cousin ke away to sort things out , there was only baochai at home — and what could she do ?
in agony , he bowed
pao wen−ching and his son wept as if their hearts would break
until it was revived by being watered every day with sweet dew by the attendant shen ying
if we did , people would complain
when his father died he shut himself up and dared not see a soul ; so he was always being cheated , but had no one to complain to
but there ’ s another thing : people are bound to be worried by our absence
now , though life on a farm is hard , we have bought quite a few mu of land and sunk a well
surely not crude , one of his protégés remonstrated
we ’ ve been like brother and sister since we were small and played naughty tricks together
so this is where you ’ d run off to
the other made no answer , looking torn between grief and joy
xue pan stamped his foot frantically
when all were assembled and they had talked for a while , jia zheng 's messenger arrived and presented his letter , announcing that the master would soon be home
a native of kwangtung , who was sentenced to exile at the border of shensi and was travelling there with his wife , had died here
if the master beats you to make you confess , your only way out is to refuse to admit it
into grand view garden
are you a friend , sir , of prefect li ?
there was a mr niu pu−yi too , but unfortunately i only knew him by reputation : we never met
but now his wife had stepped forward to say : i am the only one who understands you
today she had been catching crickets there when she saw behind a rock a gaily embroidered sachet
besides , i thought , it ’ s sharing our masters ’ good fortune that ’ s brought us this undreamed-of honour , so i don ’ t mind even if it bankrupts us
i ’ ve met this cousin before , he declared at the end of his scrutiny
lu has important business and asks master chu to go back
he entered , holding his breath , and saw the son of heaven in civilian costume on his splendid throne
then there is your cousin lin 's
that ’ s the best of the lot
she kowtowed sullenly a few times , without offering tea or shoes , then went straight back to her room
jia zheng saw his brother , sons and nephews next , and when the younger ones had paid their respects he informed them that the next morning he would sacrifice in the ancestral temple
i joined the expedition against green maple city , and , because i spent too much on reconstructing the city , have only just succeeded in making good the deficit
where would she have seen one ?
not the kind you would get from perfumed pastilles , scent-balls or sachets
taking only eight runners in red and black caps , and with bailiff chai in attendance , he went straight down to the village
above its door was the inscription warm scented arbour , and perfumed air struck warm on their cheeks as attendants lifted the red felt portiere
only as she stepped into the courtyard was she quietly apprised of this by some serving-women ; but it was too late to retreat now that her arrival had been announced and lady wang had come out to meet her
though he 's supposed to wail by the coffin , when the ladies come he spends all his time peeping at them round the curtain before it
chu−ko can not recognize jelly−fish either
if you want to talk about character and foundation , tell me who has achieved the supreme primeval state ?
i hope i get something good , she thought while drawing a lot
you ’ d better write out the half you ’ ve done , tanchun
here he invited them to sit to enjoy the quiet beauty of the bamboos and boulders , the birds and the fish−pond ; and presently prefect chu , who had changed into country dress , came out leaning on a stick to accompany them
so this romance was an empty dream , a chance encounter between an ill-fated young couple
now there were many girls , temperamentally different , in the garden ; and as xifeng considered it unnecessary to open up another house for xiuyan , she decided the best thing would be to put her up with yingchun ; for then if later lady xing heard that her niece was dissatisfied , no blame would attach to xifeng
each used a different approach
i know all about it
in the gold tray by it , on which zhao feiyan once danced , was the quince thrown in fun by an lushan at lady yang , number which had wounded her breast
i dropped a hint to the old lady , and i suspect she must have told xifeng
xifeng ’ s plans were already laid
my health is not up to it , replied tu
after reading them ca not you understand ?
what do you think , sir ?
all right , you go over first , but don ’ t let a word leak out
exclaimed the lady dowager
by now some maids had brought him a rinse-bowl and some strong tea to rinse his mouth
but zhang the taoist immediately objected , that 's a charitable thought , master bao ; but even if these things are of little value , some of them are well made
those who like to look at the moon from a height can come here ; those who prefer to see its reflection in water can go there
he had to run away
just now , though , i had a dream
passes on any news to her
, 'waxed sandals come from far away , and 'chants endless poems ' describe visiting the chrysanthemum all right ?
she treats my cousin like her own sister ; in fact she ’ s even fonder of her than i am
when the waiter asked what dishes they wanted , ching ordered twelve cents ' worth of assorted meat , one plate of pork crackling and one of bean sprouts
scores of torches were lit , and scores of devils leapt forward with iron prongs and spears
just think of your health
do not trouble , had already made himself scarce
it 's my turn next , and if i ca not think of a line i will drink with you
get her another pair
for instance , there are profligates in the world who delight only in physical beauty , singing , dancing , endless merriment and constant rain-and-cloud games
you are old , said the girl
once home , the two brothers had to see to some business and entertain guests for several days
zijuan and her other maids pleaded hard with her
this reduced aunt xue once more to tears
it was weighed by the market balance , which gives thirteen and a half cents less to the tael than the official balance
may i trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me ?
it ’ s a pity to give a lecher like him the insignia of the fifth or sixth rank
when i have recopied my poems , i will bring them to you with my notes on old texts and other miscellaneous writings for your criticism
then drink this cup of wine
daiyu could not suppress a laugh
now that she 's coming to the capital you can feel much easier in your mind , madam
dozens of different suggestions were made , all of them stereotyped cliches ; for jia zheng ’ s secretaries were well aware that he meant to test his son ’ s ability
he described the dressing-down they had been given
let us revert to jingui , who had sent baochan with refreshments to sound out xue ke
at sight of him , they exchanged knowing glances
what is your honourable name ?
stop teasing , sister , he begged
in fact , it ’ s bad for a patient to have to change her clothes four or five times a day and sit up to see the doctor
i ’ ve my own means of reckoning , though
kuang chaojen bowed and knelt down , but his brother raised him up and made him sit in the hall while he told him of the hard times they had had
lady wang suggested , go and entertain him first , sir
the old lady had these directions sent to jia lian with instructions to see to -this quickly
that 's why you can keep my son-in-law in jail
it ’ s still early , said the duke , coming over to press him to stay
so far her home beyond the distant mountains
you must not take it so to heart
you are the one who started this
ouguan went off cheerfully with the other two
while they were talking , two priests came out from magnolia monastery to invite niu pu 's companion to a meal , so he said goodbye and left
the others saw that after baoyu 's revival his mind had cleared , and by taking medicine every day he steadily recovered his health
we must use the name baoyu a couple of hundred times a day ; so it ’ s strange that you should choose this to pick fault
in the afternoon , you ’ ll expound texts and read essays
missed ; but since master lian left there have been fine goings-on in the outer quarters !
the servants had been afraid that jia lian on his return would bring them to book , not grasping the situation ; but to their surprise he knew more about it than they did
then we all burst out laughing and the old lady had to laugh too
here ’ s a granny asking for you
promising to do so , xifeng left
how old are you ?
on no account look into the front — remember that !
yet already you are full of worldly desires
but leaping again , with all its might , it came within a foot of kuo
standing petrified baoyu asked , what is this place ?
but recently she ’ s stopped coming here so often , and i have to go to school
give us a few more taels of silver , and tomorrow we shall act as hosts and invite over a hundred of your relatives to a feast
daiyu commented with a smile , you ’ ve no lack of ideas but the language lacks elegance , because you ’ re restricted by having read so few poems
but he 's extremely timid
let ’ s play some drinking games , baoyu proposed
having taken her seat granny liu picked up the chopsticks , but found them too awkward to manage
now as jia lian was on his way out a page had approached and reported , the elder master wants you , sir
the woman who admitted them reported , thieves were fighting here , and our young lady passed out for terror
the next morning he got up early , took the silver to the market and bought about a bushel of beans and several pigs which he kept in a sty
quite right , agreed li wan
but when you just ignore me and i ca not tell why , i am at my wits ' end and do not know what to do
i ’ ve kept xiluan and sijie here , she said
raising his eyes to her face he
these two volumes contain all the poems i have written , he said
striking his fist on the table , wang jen declared , the great thing about us scholars is our adherence to principles
the old lady , recollecting the zhangs ’ proposal , reminded lady wang , you should go and let your husband know what we decided
we ’ ll look in again by and by
tanchun ’ s totally different from huan , whom nobody could like
where are you going ?
' the servant brought in five bowls of noodles , and their host offered them vinegar , then heaped their bowls with cauliflower and meat
his wife ’ s sudden change for the better may mean that his luck will change too
she ’ s never to set foot inside the inner gate again
this clever imp had really kept some good lines up her sleeve
we are all good friends , not mere strangers who meet on the road , quoted hsiao
where did this come from ?
in the tea−shop he saw a man in a tall hat , sapphire−blue gown and black shoes with white soles , drinking tea alone
xiren and sheyue reminded them , that year when the jade was lost , lin zhixiao consulted a fortune-teller ; and after madam bao married into our house we told her that the character he came up with was the shang meaning reward
wang grovelled on the ground , kowtowing as fast as a pestle pounding onions ; but that only made the two scholars more angry than ever
chou chin 's travelling expenses and clothes were provided by chin
now our father is dead and we have too many mouths to feed — my brother and i ca not manage
you ’ re quite right , mother , agreed xue pan
are you trying to hasten my death with your wailing ?
let me have it
pinger agreed to try and hurried off , coming back before long with ha huan
he happens to be here , said chuang
this is no time for tea , declared chi wei−hsiao
but when he started to argue , yen 's sons took the bolt of the door and a rolling−pin and beat him within an inch of his life
all i ’ m wondering , madam , is this : which of the two , miss baochai and miss lin , do you think baoyu prefers ?
where their ways parted baochai said to daiyu :
you must call on him yourself
i am going to join in
we belong to different households
the lady dowager was feasted by hia she on the eleventh , by jia zhen on the twelfth , staying with them on each occasion for half a day , while time forbids us to enumerate all the feasts to which lady wang and xifeng were invited
now the sight of ouguan , to whom her sister had such an aversion , added fuel to the fire of the anger
when people are fated to die and the king of hell summons them , he sends small devils to fetch their spirits away
her heart beat wildly
and so having drunk enough , he went to bed
he at once sent men out of the city to tie up zhou rui and take him to the police to be cross-examined
tang called out his three battalions , as well as his two auxiliary forces
yingchun mentioned that at the time of her father 's departure she had wanted to see him of { but her husband had forbidden her
once home , unable to check her grief any longer , the old lady dismissed lady wang and sent baoyu to see off his uncle and cousin
too angry to speak , she fixed him with furious eyes until his cheeks were burning
granny liu didn ’ t know whether to sit or stand and longed for some hiding-place
meanwhile runners had swarmed in to guard all the doors , so that no one
i did not mean to kill you
with that profit you can buy more silk and get more from the pawnshop
baoyu made no reply , and lady wang was too worried to get a word out
anyone who sends word to the inner apartments will be killed on the spot
i am old and foolish , answered yu
what were the subjects ?
they would be wasted on beggars , who would have no use for them
you won ’ t be able to give a thought to eating once you start reading it
when she had this trouble before , replied the bawd , she would not swallow so much as a drop of water
i will come back tomorrow to see how you are , she assured him
then baoyu exclaimed , i ’ m done for !
it ca not be helped : i must go
if you wanted these things why didn ’ t you tell me before ?
how can you touch their fruit ?
when he came back she had gone
why do such a thing ?
it 's up to you whether you marry again or not
the tutor sat in the highest seat , with tang erh opposite him , mr yao in the place of a guest , and yoo as host
put in li wan with a smile
a long poem with tricky rhymes had to be padded out a bit
yu wrote to his younger brother : what is this trouble ?
but as she ’ s engaged it ’ s no use bringing it up
one of the gamesters made a note of this and after a few more throws remarked , i have lost quite a bit but wo not try to win it back now
they bundled the woman off
better put the blame on us here
i will do something more for you later
doctor wang and doctor zhang , who come so often , aren ’ t paid for each separate visit
knitting her sulky brows , her eyes flashing with anger beneath half-drooping lids , she pointed a finger at baoyu in accusal
the other , meant for baochai , in addition to writing-brushes , ink-tablets , inkstones , stationery , perfume-sachets , scented beads , fans , fan-sheaths , powder , rouge and pomade , had in it all sorts of toys from huqiu in soochow
go and check up to find out what ’ s really happened
that was just wild talk when i was too young to know any better
thereupon the old lady made lan sit beside her
order a good meal for her
just then a serving-woman came in to report that bao er ’ s wife had hanged herself
have you ever heard anything so funny ?
what do you want a new one for ?
did you really give him the cow for nothing ?
they want us to move out , but he wo not give up the house ; and so they take it out of me
xiren and sheyue , listening outside , compressed their lips to check their laughter
fit for a king ,
'you are a smart fellow yet now you are broke , said the man
just listen to our advice once in a while
though simply an empty lament , they voice my distress
your worldly obligations have been fulfilled , they declared
no wonder i caught nothing , she said with a smile , then told suyun to adjust the hook and bait it with another worm on which a reed had been fixed
as an old hand here , surely you know this rule ?
indeed , the fact that i brought a letter from shensi for your father sets us apart from the ordinary run of new acquaintances
so the wailing in the room grew louder and louder till the womenservants keeping watch outside hurried off in alarm to report this to the master
i ca not even suffer instead of her
baochai made servants open the cases and cabinets , but all were empty
that was smart of her , said the lady dowager
recognizing jia lan 's voice , baoyu stood up and called cheerfully , come in !
this is for your journey , fourth brother , he explained
you , madam , why everything 's still topsy-turvy though today is the third day
they were laying into xiaohong in turn when an old nanny arrived with a message from xifeng
still clutching his cane , jia zhen made an effort to kneel to greet and thank his kinswomen
let him off and send him packing
it was xifeng with her persuasive tongue who succeeded in consoling them a little and urged them to go back
baoyu hastily put his hand over her mouth
she sent for ha zhen ’ s wife and daughter-in-law
all right then , but i can ’ t return this favour
so i ca not take the case to court
a man carried a fire-cracker as large as a house out of town to let it off , and thousands of people followed to watch
mother he saw that her daughter had darted up to baoyu , who had taken her hand
she never gets up before noon or lifts a finger in the house
and when niu yu−fu spoke up for wang they spat at him
if things go on like this we will have no peace either
we ’ ve not even been allowed to write poems , retorted tanchun
the girls and baoyu crowded round to read it and took it to mean that the jade could not be found quickly , but it would turn up some time when they were not looking
after a while he said , why should i worry about other people ?
judging by what i have heard of him , he must have been a fine man ; and had i known him i would certainly have asked for his instruction
first think about chronicle
yucun went to court to make his report , and by the time he returned to his office this incident had slipped his mind completely
then , taking up an old brush and dipping it well in the ink , he stared at the paper for some time , and wrote a line all in one breath
you seem to think the world of xiren , but who is she ?
if baoyu ’ s uncle wants to offer congratulations , daiyu ’ s uncle ’ s family can celebrate her birthday too
why get so excited ?
i liked it , retorted daiyu
zijuan clambered on to the kang beside her , the cup in her hand
it would be futile to reason with her now , seeing that she was so stubborn
he had better return to the garden and go out again the next day
in the end they were so devoted that when diguan died she nearly cried her heart out , and to this day she ’ s never forgotten her
fenger hastily stepped forward to put in , miss [ in sent a maid with a note several times to invite her over , so finally she went
do i have to stay here ?
but i hear you ’ ve another mistress who ’ s a widow , and several young ladies too
i have not been there
cousin bao 's too reckless !
who else is she going to put in ?
this soft-mist silk comes in four colours only : light blue , russet , pine-green and pink
his cheeks burning , he left the room
as soon as the party was seated the lady dowager proposed , let 's begin with a few cups of wine
as regards both character and learning , the yu brothers had rarely been equalled
baochai knew from the poetry he had recited that morning that he
the girl 's worry : she has no money to buy pomade
as baoyu followed her in , daiyu called from the inner room , zijuan , bring master bao in here
luting was truly an art the men of old cultivated to achieve tranquility and integrity
they took to having breakfast there and returning to their own quarters about noon
that reminds me , i ’ ve not fetched your pewter bed-warmer
one of these girls named lin , the fourth child of her family , was a surpassing beauty and expert too in military arts
presently a maid raised the portiere and two others carried out the table
i lie here getting worse and worse , and your uncle keeps trying to turn us out because he wants to repair these rooms
jia zheng summoned the twenty-one men-servants then working in the mansion to question them about the family 's income and expenditure in the past
he seemed very upset when i explained all that had happened
give me back my husband !
how could she possibly know ?
she really is a treasure
promise me this and i shall die in peace
re takes that talk about 'leaving the world of men ' seriously , she reflectedno good will come of it in the long run
is your master well ?
baoyu made no objection as baochai stepped forward to take the jade from his hand
the manager here has asked me to select a few essays , and i have to hurry to get them ready for the printers
the maids who saw her hastily scurried away
mrs zhang , weeping , testified , my husband , zhang da , lived in the southern suburbs and died eighteen years ago
ever since you ordered it , madam , xiren has been giving me one every evening
all the relatives had arrived and were discussing whom to appoint from the clan as his heir
he asked all the servants and maids , but none of them knew
pinger stepped forward to mix the lots and picked one out with her chopsticks
in that case , said yu , how can a man who 's only just passed the provincial examination abandon family relationships and consider himself his uncle 's fellow−candidate ?
when the truth is discovered , they will all be punished
its one fault is that it is too luxurious
if you want a couple of hundred taels , that ’ s nothing
for no matter whom she marries she ’ ll still be within my reach , unless she dies or remains single all her life , in which case there is nothing i can do
actually , goodness is something inherent in human nature , yet people don ’ t hanker after it
give us a couple of examples
as soon as i ’ ve done my hair , we ’ re both going , over to your place
you even bully your own foster-mother , to say nothing of other people
helping baoyu to alight , he called out from the yard :
what a devilish monkey you are !
these forty , divided into two shifts , will have the job of burning incense , keeping the lamps filled with oil , hanging up curtains , watching by the coffin , offering sacrificial rice and tea , and mourning with the mourners
once the buyer was asleep , the woman stole four packages of silver worth two hundred taels from his baggage
don ’ t move , just wait , and it ’ s bound to surface
it 's not impossible , she said
struck by this scene of desolation , he could not contain his feelings but then and there made up a song which he chanted as follows :
every single flower has its goddess , and there ’ s
taken in by foolish uncle 's fabrications she consulted wang ren , who gave her even more blarney
her obvious distress made the lady dowager give way to tears
he was just raising his chopsticks to his mouth when something black hurtled from behind the table to smash the two plates of sweetmeats
i used to have a flair for decorating rooms , but now that i am old i have not the energy
her thoughts turned to xiangyun and she sent to fetch her
this jia lian , who has bought the rank of a sub-prefect , takes no interest in books but is a smooth man of the world , so he lives with his uncle jia zheng and helps him to manage his domestic affairs
shaking with mirth and pressing her hands to her heart , daiyu cried , do start soon
pinger had barely regained her feet when xifeng came in and told her : get the patterns out of that box for the mistress , quick
have they gone off to amuse themselves while you run wild ?
peacock-feather cape in bed
we traced him today to you , sir , and i am here to ask for him
his stepmother could not forget that he was an adopted son and did not love him as she did her own daughter and son−in−law ; but pao wen−ching loved him more than if he had been his own son , because he came from a respectable family
we are separated in form only , not in spirit
he observed that third sister ’ s behaviour had indeed changed out of all recognition , and as second sister was managing the house diligently and prudently he had no need to worry
qingwen switched then to lashing out at the younger girls
what is this prescription from across the seas ?
in order not to worry him on his journey , she did not tell him of baoyu ’ s relapse
really egg-plant , is it ?
said the old lady playfully
if there were , you ’ d be crying for fright
tell aunt not to worry
the next morning he had barely washed his face when the servant came in
lady wang , dumbfounded , collapsed
you can enjoy the moon again tomorrow ; it ’ s still bright on the sixteenth
lady wang felt thunderstruck on hearing this , borne out as it was by the case of jinchuan
this is all the doing of that minx xifeng
three carts were hired for the luggage , and four sturdy mules
he passed with the taoist through a large stone archway on which was inscribed : illusory land of great void
by this time the tea had been drunk , and chi bowed his visitor back to his chair
this xue family mentioned just now is one your honour can ’ t afford to offend
red in the face , wuer mumbled , he did say something i could not catch it clearly in the first part of the night
when the second seventh day had passed , fan chin gave his father−in−law a few taels of silver and told him to go to the temple in the market to ask a monk there whom he knew to invite other monks from the big monastery to recite the buddhist scriptures , chant intercessions and say masses so that mrs
has your mistress had her meal ?
however , winning as his appearance was , it was difficult to tell what lay beneath
a creature black as coal was sniffing at her with out-stretched nose , its two eyes shining like lamps
the writer , chuang ting−lung , had died ; but his body was exhumed and cut into pieces
i will ask governor chi to give you my whole salary for this year to bring back to nanking as capital for a business or to buy some property which will bring in rents
xiren chuckled , all the rest of us can go , but not you
as you ’ ve nothing here to cut it with , you ’ d better put it away , miss , and pick something smaller
when our family 's hard up you do not come near us !
apart from the usual greetings , the letter said that jia zheng would definitely be back by the middle of the sixth month
even strict sticklers for the truth can not beat such entertaining fantasies
and being in a towering rage , he did not trouble to weigh his words carefully
seeing that he paid no attention , the neighbour went up to him and tried to grab the hen
then she turned with a cold laugh to mrs lai and the stewards ’ wives
baoyu must wash and dress quickly !
the maid assented , but as she was about to go on this errand yuanyang put in with a smile :
zijuan refrained from trying to comfort her , for fear of making matters worse
my game isn ’ t worth watching , said zhan guang with a smile
or am i prejudiced ?
we thieves all have ready tongues , retorted tanchun
six maids and ten stewards ’ wives in all would be going , in addition to men-servants ; but yuanyang and yuchuan were to stay behind to see to things at home
last year my mistress did speak of doing it , but with all the bustle over new year she forgot
now that your mother 's dead you must be guided in everything by your second grand-uncle and me
xiren hunted frantically round , clutching at shadows and searching under each rock , but there was no trace of the jade
a long silence followed
there is a mr chuang , too , who was presented with lotus lake by the emperor
this sort of thing can ’ t be helped
i feel dizzy and there 's a bitter-sweet taste in my throat
but you should reconsider which is the better , lady alpinia 's or queen bamboo 's
lady wang , however , who had brought yingchun up , was bitterly distressed
his son and grandson are to escort his coffin through the lower north gate into the capital for a funeral ceremony at his own home , so that his descendants can mourn for him as is fitting before escorting his remains to their ancestral district
wu liang should be flogged and sentenced to hard labour
hurry up and stop qingwen from spanking me !
upon hearing this , chu hsien−fu hurried home to congratulate his father−in−law
at soochow wang changed boats again , then went ashore at west water gate in nanking
this is a good family anyway
i must go back to the hostel for a while , said ni ting−chu after one cup of tea
are you sure you can cope ?
you have done me a bad turn !
a hsun family servant in mourning rushed in and kowtowed
she chose as inscription for this convent the words , ship of mercy on the sea of suffering
though these men often come to the shop , goodness knows where they are now , he thought
i was fed up with hunting for it , and as soon as i saw it i said to myself , 'at last !
and this is what he heard :
it never occurred to me that you would have trouble here , sir ; but i have heard something about the east mansion 's business
a day later , when the steward in charge of the kitchen came with a request for money , jia zheng had to pay him out of his own pocket
one day mr chang called , and asked to speak to mr
i realized they must have come with an alms list , or to make their annual requests for donations or incense money
they need materials for the job
as yucun went closer , the man 's face struck him as familiar and he suspected that they had met before , though he could not remember where
in that case , said the others , let ’ s first look near by
the abbot was warm after his walk , and sitting down in the yard pulled open his clothes to cool his chest and belly
so he first discussed it with master rong , asking him to act as go-between and arrange the match , and promising him presents if he pulled it off
she started getting up
so you ’ ve noticed that too
you are looking more handsome than ever
but of course it ’ s good
just then the clock on the shelf in the outer room struck two
tell me what it is , quick !
it ’ s nothing , pinger answered
otherwise i may have to hand in a blank paper , making a fool of mysel { which would reflect badly on you , uncle , as well
my uncle was an honest officer , who did not add anything to the family estate and left no more than ten thousand taels at his death
at the risk of offending him i ’ d like to say that if he remembered to pay us back all he ’ s borrowed , goodness knows how much that would come to
having sent the servants out of the room , he opened a chest and took out two packets of silver , each containing a hundred taels
at the end of two years , the prince was defeated and captured by count wang shou−jen , and his puppet officials were either killed or fled
no need to tell her that these are my instructions
talking of baoyu , she went on , i want to consult you on something
hurry up and bring me their bodies !
you ’ ll see for yourself by and by
the friends brother pan has been making these years !
after all she 's good girl , said lady wang
how can you say such a thing !
i shall never beat him again
i did not bring enough money with me , he concluded , and i have only five coppers left
if you are going to sleep , mother , i will curl up in my quilt too and think over my lessons
for essays which read like commentaries will simply lack the literary flavour , whereas those which sound poetic will not resemble the words of ancient sages
when he had taken the examination , magistrate li called on the examiner , bowed and said : this kuang chao−jen , whom i passed first in the county examination , is a poor scholar and a good son
but he 's a handsome young man , and , from what we have seen of him , very easy-going
but he ’ s roaring drunk and using foul language again
but no more about that night
but he had to go out to send the countrymen away
she wanted to urge him not to cry , but feared that bottling up his resentment would be bad for him ; on the other hand , comforting him might seem like slighting daiyu
they were roofed with glazed tiles and set within winding red balustrades
fun — don ’ t take it seriously
the whole room was pitch dark , and yet i saw it clearly
they helped him aboard and began to carry his luggage to the junk
yu fu took the clod and turned it over under the light
and if you are not lucky enough to pass all the examinations , you will at least be able to become a stipendiary which will enable you to be a tutor and apply for titles for your parents
asked the lady dowager
don ’ t try to get to the bottom of it now , madam , they urged her
he sent men ahead to the temple to spend that night in redecorating the repository and in seeing to refreshments and the reception of the funeral party
since you come from kwangwu , sir , said wu , am i right in assuming you were posted here from the capital ?
by now they had reached the door
that was our young master ’ s room , and your patient was one of his maids , one of the more senior ones , true , but no young lady
maybe things were getting so out of hand he was afraid there might be some big scandal and therefore accused him of negligence to get him off more lightly
the abbot was most disconcerted
then , tired out , he walked stiffly back through clear stream gate to his lodgings , closed the door and went to bed
in that case , said the young man
when the results were published , he had passed ; and he bought more examination paper for the next test
anyway you must understand what i meant just now
as jia zheng was a vice-minister of works , though there were rules concerning the construction of an imperial consort ’ s tomb , the minister had to consult him more specially regarding the building of this one , while his colleagues also called to ask for his instructions
as soon as she had gone jia lian went in to see xifeng , who had woken up and heard him ask for a loan
here was a narrow stone bridge , which looked difficult to cross ; but holding the vine at one side , ma chun−shang walked over
is not the reason obvious ?
never mind those other things , rejoined li wan
prostrate yourself four times !
wild geese wing slowly through far-flung frosty clouds ;
suppose he does pass the prefectural examination and have a sun falling on his head — what about me ?
estimating that his funds would be rnnning out , he had no choice but to write to magistrate lai shangrong , the son of lai da , to ask for a loan of five hundred taels of silver , instructing the messenger to overtake him with the requisite sum
hill after hill like crouching elephants
how can we taste them first ?
i went to my uncle ’ s house , and because it was late he kept me for the night
daiyu had in fact determined to ignore him , but this speech proving that she was dearer to him than anyone else , and all the endearments he now poured out , made her break down again
it was kind of your master and mistress to think of us , and another day we will go over to express our gratitude
i ’ m the one , if anyone , who deserves to be punished
are not such people born any more ?
then li wan asked lady wang , have you read the master 's letter , madam ?
you sleep in his room , sheyue
thinking this fellow was making fun of him , fan chin pretended not to hear , and walked forward with lowered head
it shows he 's on the mend
the two girls went off then and sat down to sulk while xiren helped baoyu to bed
now maids came in to pour wine and bring in dishes , while outside the performance had started
have you ever seen me take any advantage of your family ?
it ’ s our mistress who put us in charge here ; so how dare they call us thieves ?
this must have been done by a spark from a hand-stove , she commented
in that case you can have mine , offered baoyu
why do not you go and see the shows ?
her eyes intent on the board , she was thinking hard , toying with one hand with the draughtsmen in the box
now he ’ s really gone and killed a man !
unlike the girls , she was richly dressed and resplendent as a fairy
when i said i was too clumsy to wait on the young master , the old lady scolded , i ’ m not asking you to look after him , you don ’ t have to be smart
don ’ t worry , said second sister
the day before yesterday the sixth mr fang made a bid for it , and the owner would have sold it if the tenants had not protested
this is only poor stuff , and it 's not for you but to entertain two honourable guests here
you worry too much , li wan and xifeng told her with a smile
pinger and li wan approved but tanchun teased , i ’ m only afraid they may forget friendship for profit !
chi fetched a card , and took up his brush
she told the younger maids to bring a table , and sheyue waited on baoyu while he finished the soup and rinsed his mouth
if you have the guts to go , i ’ ll have more respect for you
then ting−hsi 's wife sulkily took off her brocade gown , put on an apron , and went to the kitchen
demanded the fifth mr yao
after feeling the pulse for some time he declared :
first you tackle only the idea of no resentment ’
their ladyships felt reassured , but after waiting for a while lady wang sent a young maid in search of him
she ’ s really most lovable
i suppose she and baoyu must be destined for each other
come and look at this
the next day the runner reported : i have been to the imperial college , sir
yes , said baochai thinking back
in any case , he was the one arrested , not i
presently a maid invited them to mrs
then fangguan had to give them a careful rendering of a verse set to the melody the season for enjoying flowers
by the time this scene ended he was firmly convinced that jiang was a romantic , completely unique
the lady dowager , being in a good humour , took lady wang , aunt xue , baoyu and the girls to spend half a day in lai da ’ s garden
fancy forgetting a ready-made phrase like that
lending money is always a risky business
in the same way , xifeng has you
he ’ s in the right too , so why not make an indictment ?
baochai shot daiyu a warning glance , making her regret her indiscretion ; for in her eagerness to tease baoyu she had forgotten until it was too late how sensitive caiyun was
he was offered a seat in his study and served with tea
meanwhile yuanyang had guessed that lady xing would be going to discuss this business with xifeng , and that other people were sure to come to sound her out again
wang zhu ’ s wife stepped forward , very flustered , to urge her , please takea seat , miss , and let me explain
why do not you wait for him in my shop ?
it must be destroyed before it does any more harm
this was the first time chi had heard pao 's name mentioned , and as it emerged that pao was an old actor the captain began to raise his eyebrows
take good care of the mistress and wait for my good news !
only for little more than five years and eight
these four families are all closely connected , said the attendant , injure one and you injure them all , honour one and you honour them all
why gad about outside so shamelessly ?
she said playfully to sheyue and the rest
the young ladies don ’ t know her
to cut short such wild talk xiren said she was tired and gave up answering him
knowing how delicate and hypersensitive she was , they all made allowances for her , overlooking any lack of hospitality and courtesy
such talk ’ s enough to set one ’ s teeth on edge
now i have only been away a couple of months , yet look at the chaos here !
it must be yang chih−chung !
your petition is rejected
i am delighted to meet you
he mounted a horse and rode back out of the city while she , afraid xichun might commit suicide , sent fenger to comfort her
then , dressed in ermine cloaks , pheasant feathers and the brightest costumes , the players raced in , leaping , somersaulting and forming figures
he shook the tube , intoning , the yin and yang of the primal order have interacted ; sacred symbols have appeared with infinite changes ; divine manifestations must answer the prayers of the pious
so i ’ ve come to ask you how we should deal with this
that time we sent him wine , he said he could not drink ; but just now i saw him going to see the mistress , red in the face and tipsy
if he has food , he can eat ; if not , he ’ ll just have to go hungry
i ’ d rather scrap the whole thing than give up this new madder-gauze ’ image
i have a guest
and as rong is not involved , should not he be released as well ?
no need , rejoined xifeng
between ourselves , i do not mind telling you that although i have a few thousand taels of ready money , i do not want to spend it at the moment
go back and tell miss tanchun and miss xiangyun i ’ d like them to drop in if they ’ ve time after lunch
why should i be afraid of his laughing at me ?
get up now , you shameless creature !
but now see what ’ s become of me !
all but lady xing and lady wang had risen from their seats and were standing by them , with their hands at their sides , to show respect
he left his eldest grandson jia rui in charge
asked her business , mrs lin pointed at the woman
you are right , of course , sir , replied li with a smile
my own servants have clocks and watches , because everything large or small must be done on time
how could she work herself into such a passion ?
now that you ’ ve given me this lesson , auntie , do please do your best to settle this with the court
may i trouble you then to step into that tea−shop with me ?
what a terrible tongue madam lian has !
then you wo not have to dance attendance on me
you have madam bao and sister xiren , both as pre~y as goddesses , yet you insist on fooling around with others
with your poor health you ought to look after yourself
the mistresses certainly have good judgement , she thought
please , please speak up for me , madam !
i decided to see if he was with miss [ in , but i ran into some of her people who told me he wasn ’ t there either
he hurried into the hall and paid his respects to his grand-mother and mother
i sha not be writing now
asked mrs zhou , sitting on the edge of the kang , i haven ’ t seen you over on our side for several days
why should my fate be so cruel ?
as they were chatting , the lady dowager ’ s party returned
we ’ re here on the prefect ’ s orders
xifeng went over to whisper something into her ear , at which she nodded and smiled
from his pit kuo watched furtively as the tiger loped off to a mountain peak about a mile away , whence it looked back with blazing eyes to see whether he had moved or not
but although qingwen had departed this sea of woe , the thought that they could never meet again inevitably filled him with grief and longing
when he saw these matrons marching into the maids ’ rooms , he asked xifeng what they were doing
at number one scholar square they saw some new book covers pasted up in a bookshop
i know the kidnapper who sold the girl , and i knew the poor devil who bought her
if investigation proves that it ’ s true , there will be a fearful scene
she ’ ll get the stewards to have them made
the servant on her return slipped in to find yuanyang , but could not enter the old lady 's room where yuanyang happened to be with lady wang and others
this commissioner 's name was tsui and , as the nephew of a eunuch , he had started life with a hereditary title and later been promoted to his present position
her aunt saw her to the ceremonial gate and after giving the maids some further instructions waited to see them off
then ha rong went out chuckling to himself
jia zheng nodded his approval but said nothing
i want our kinswoman to sit next to me
drive that boat away , quick !
even so , that 's hard to say after two provincial appointments
siqi had no alternative but to kowtow to yingchun and take her leave of the other maids
how is it that i don ’ t remember a thing ?
he only comes back every ten days or so
how did it go last night ?
i have not much to say , he faltered
we used to be colleagues in the same yamen
she spies on me as if i were a thief
after a few cups , feeling randy , he ordered the maids to clear away the wine and dishes , then closed the door to undress
she and cousin daiyu have the same birthday , that ’ s why she remembers it
tu is known for his brilliance , and his poems are generally admired
why talk such nonsense ?
as jia rong was rattling away so wildly he noticed that the old lady had woken up , and made haste to pay his respects
he came back presently and was reproached by old chin , who said , you are too obstinate
his eye fell on the inscription on a large stone which was still discernible and he read it through
( ming dynasty scholars called all those who passed the prefectural examination classmates , and those who only qualified for this examination juniors
by rights , jia zhen and his wife of the ning mansion should both have assisted at these obsequies ; but as that would have left no one in charge at home , after much discussion they decided to beg leave from the court for madam you on the plea that she was with child , so that she could take over the supervision of the two mansions
the other fair flawless jade ,
there you go again , talking in that heartless way !
you may be able to fool newcomers but you can ’ t fool me
jia yun walked out to question the page , who told him :
moreover , i ’ ve been re-instated by the emperor ’ s favour and am in fact beginning a new life
it 's just dawned on me that these books count for nothing
but to learn his name , you must turn to the next chapter
on the fourteenth he sent chou erh home
it 's too bad she was born into such a rich family , said one of the girls
now that you have been recommended , shaoching , you must do some good work for the government , to justify this generation of scholars
i don ’ t need her services here
tipsy snow-sprites over shattered rainbows have sped ;
after all , to be honest , which of us can compare with her ?
please give me that book then to take back with me , and i ’ ll read a few poems tonight
but on pay-day or when sweets are shared out , she ’ s always the first to come running
then mingyan brought round his horse , and they left by the back gate
do not worry , he replied
she ’ ll be married next year
the two men laughed and stood up
i hardly like to say this , sir , said yin chao
that ’ s silly talk maybe , still there ’ s something in it
but no more of this
if the flower seems able to understand , we are so thrilled that we want to get closer to it ; hence nine is wearing the chrysanthemum
but by the fifth watch , shivering with cold , she had just decided to summon her maid when a sound outside the window startled her , recalling what had happened the previous night
this letter , far from angering xifeng , amused her
the jade in the box hopes to fetch a good price ,
this was a stroke of luck !
i am afraid the young fellow knows too much and is going to bad places
little did i think you would honour me by reading it
as pan handed over two hundred coppers as largesse , the door which had been closed at the bridegroom 's arrival was opened and old mr cheng came out ; and when he and his prospective son−in−law recognized each other as fellow passengers on the same boat some years before , they felt this marriage must have been predestined
the emperor sighed , then ordered the prime minister to decree : permission is hereby granted chuang shao−kuang to return home
you all think me silly , she told him , shedding tears
whenever you get wind of any perks of handouts to one of the stewards ’ wives , you dash off like dogs with wagging tails to announce it
pin−niang spread her scarlet handkerchief on chen 's knee
is it cousin xiuyan ’ s birthday too ?
say these are my instructions
feeling a little more reassured , they were waiting blankly for xiuyan ’ s return when they saw baoyu ’ s page beiming beckoning outside the door to a young maid
he doesn ’ t practise medicine for a living and only came as a favour to our friend feng ziying
or because the horoscopes don ’ t match
i ’ ll soon be turning in
jia rui , anxious to smooth things over , urged jin rong softly , remember the proverb a murderer can only lose his head
how can you accuse me of spending your money ?
niu pu−yi went on alone by boat down the yangtse , past nanking to wuhu , where he lodged in a small temple called sweet dew temple at floating bridge
when i am out , zijuan chats quite happily with her ; but as soon as i come in she goes away
____________________ the fourth son of the first emperor , he seized the throne from his nephew in
i have decided to leave with him tomorrow , said feng
i have invited my cousin to teach him some moral principles , so that he wo not turn out a low , obsequious character
that 's a long story
even if i do this , i mustn ’ t be too casual about it , he told himself
i had meant to invite mr wan myself : now i shall have to wait till the day after
this girl ’ s muddled up the message
in the half year that i have been in nanking , she tells tu shao−ching and wu shu , all the men who have come here have taken me either for a prostitute or a member of some brigand 's band
they can only judge of our delivery and voices
in desperation , the magistrate said : judicial commissioner tsui sent you here , and if i treat you discourteously he will take it as a slight
entering , he saw on the wall a picture by tang yin of a lady sleeping under the blossom of a crab-apple tree in spring
for instance , what would the old lady do without yuanyang ?
the next day , jia zhen came over to attend to certain business
lady wang now summoned yuanyang 's sister-in-law to attend to the coffining
your officers must have slipped up and allowed thieves from outside to break in and rob you
you must not think of declining
if you do not obey him , he will enforce our monastery 's rule and have you carried to the back courtyard and burnt !
she sent to have her fetched from the maids ’ room
he handed her the card on which was written the date of the wedding , and when she had made a polite rejoinder and nodded her consent he hurried back to report this to jia zheng
after that , they performed the fairy brings a boy , and golden seal
her spirit 's purity surpasses jade ,
moreover , this enabled him to write more trenchantly , and make the best use of the satire in which he excelled
and urged my train through all the heaven wide
if the properties entered in our
owing to the disturbances , i have been stranded in these parts for five or six years
ouguan said nothing to this , not even when baoyu repeated his question
his name used to be on the ning mansion register
these men thought themselves remarkably shrewd , whereas in fact they were thoroughgoing fools
well , you may be right to keep out of his way , but you mustn ’ t really go off on a long journey without letting me know beforehand
and on her return , jia lian himself took the money to lady xing while xifeng and pinger went on trying to guess who had let the cat out of the bag
come back early tomorrow then , stipulated pinger
fortunately there were enough of them there to restrain her and talk her round so that , eventually , she left off storming
yen asked them to be seated , wished them success in their coming examination , and offered them refreshments
the next day captain sun rose before it was light to bid his muleteers bestir themselves ; and when the porters had carried out the silver , he paid the bill and left
the two brothers sat up talking by candlelight until nearly midnight , when they heard a thud on the roof and a blood−stained man dropped down from the eaves carrying a leather bag
she took the things and came ; then the master told me to watch out for you , madam
what ’ s to be done ?
seeing them talking together , baochan slipped inside
i do not think that 's necessary , said the old lady , as we were relatives before this marriage
when i provoked him too much , he swore he would become a monk
by this time it was also decreed that each province should have one governor
from his baggage he took magistrate yiu 's letter , which he gave to hsiao yun−hsien
do not worry , she answered
he did something even more amusing , said wu shu
the servant went home as instructed
she was naturally delighted and , taking him by the hand , urged him to work diligently to repay the emperor 's kindness
dr chao ranks high among the poets after kuang chao−jen left to take the prefectural examination , his father missed him so much that twenty days ' absence seemed to him like two years ; and every day , with tears in his eyes , he watched for his son 's return
the two young actors , accustomed to such scenes , knelt down to offer xing a drink
but he dared go no nearer , for fear of the sword
yuanyang went on to morning emerald hall and , sure enough , found all the inmates of the garden there chatting
you are still young , ting−hsi , and i promise to find another wife for you later
zijuan , arriving with tea for them , supposed they were bickering over something again
the waiter disappeared with the order into the kitchen , to reappear shortly with one portion of duck and two pots of wine
take my advice and go home for a couple of days
then ma chun−shang told him how the runner had reported the matter to him , how they had discussed it together and how he had had to pay ninety−two taels of silver to redeem the casket
the boatman dared not protest
you will know that when you draw one tomorrow , madam
it was a quite nondescript quatrain , but of course she praised its ingenuity and pretended to be thinking hard although she had guessed it at once
after talking for some time , they went back to their rooms
li wan , the jia girls , baochai and daiyu were waiting with pinger and xiren in the outer room when they heard that the patients had come to and eaten some gruel
the skin was broken , blood spurted out , and very soon he died
the young maid came back with a hamper for their inspection
baoyu put the list away then and they chatted
my eldest daughter is a widow at home
then those low types will be sorry they sized me up wrongly ; and when second master comes back and sees this , he as our husband will regret his mistake
baoyu hurried out to meet his cousins , beaming
if they heard , they ’ d give you another slapping
pao then made ready all he needed for the trip , buying ribbons , soap and other nanking specialities for the yamen servants
so it did not last very long
although the object of general admiration , so that others also had designs on them , they were left unmolested for fear of xue pan
just hold out till master huan grows up and gets an official post
all else takes second place
he asked xiren , do you still have that red sash which you refused to wear the other year ?
we must hurry up and stop yun from going there
in which four new characters are introduced to link the past with the present , and the story ends with an epilogue by the twenty−third year of the wan li period , all the wellknown scholars had disappeared from nanking
just say , is she prettier than me ?
then the nurses and attendants made baoyu lie down and slipped out leaving only four maids xiren , meiren , qingwen and sheyue to keep him company
although artificially made , the sight of it tempts one to retire to the country
if he makes some small mistake you can set him right
the third young master is only a couple of years older — he ’ s not reached manhood yet
lady xing and lady wang were completely flummoxed , frightened out of their wits
by his bed the old gentleman had a number of packages of charcoal which would turn into silver if you heated them above a brazier
jia rong withdrew to see about buying the medicine , which was then prepared and given to his wife
don ’ t take it so seriously , said the old lady , smiling
just look at the story of the lord of ngo and his embroidered coverlet
by the time of baoyu 's marriage and daiyu 's death , as xiangyun had also left and baoqin had moved home very few people remained there
before this trouble of his , when he invited us to taverns he would order at least two ducks , to say nothing of mutton , pork , chicken and fish
i can join in the feast to celebrate !
he reddened and could not answer
xiangyun spat in disgust
the next morning the local authorities sent over a student accused of gambling , for dr yu to discipline
in the outer room , baoyu softly begged xiren to fetch zijuan
of course i know the importance of discipline
i must go and have a look
tanchun , however , had sense enough to see that it was not for lady wang to clear herself of these false charges , nor for aunt xue to defend her sister , nor for baochai to defend her aunt , while li wan , xifeng and baoyu were in no position to protest either
he himself remained on call in the outside study , daring neither to go home nor to confront his father
why don ’ t you say anything ?
guessing that she was on her way to see their grandmother , he waited for her by the pavilion and they left the garden together
i ’ d like to stay and keep you company for a bit
he ordered the wet−nurse to unlock the door of the room where wine was stored , and went in with two servants
you ’ ve turned up just in time , master bao
stepping forward she boxed her ears
her voice was so clear and tender that the listeners were entranced
you should be thankful i ’ m not borrowing from you , just asking you to put in a word ; and yet you still demand interest
and swear he must clear himself
seeing the state he was in , chin and the guild head tried to lift him up , one on each side ; but he refused to budge
frightened out of her wits , bao er ’ s wife flew in to report this
come and keep her company
he grabbed his own inkstone ready to let it fly
no wonder you ’ re unwell then !
just come with me , and i guarantee you a good time
you are all on your own , and in our group you wo not want for food or clothes
that fence there is covered with rambler roses and monthly-roses , as well as honeysuckle and other flowers , all of which fetch a good price in tea-shops and pharmacies when they ’ re dried
this is just as well , she remarked to mrs zhou
by the long river at sunset a ball of flame
then she will have to change her ways
recently she was ill again for over ten days , and the doctor diagnosed it as consumption ; so then and there i dismissed her with instructions not to come back when she ’ s better , giving her to her family to marry off
there 's no satisfying some people
baoyu promised to do so , and from that day on he had to apply himself harder to his studies
he took a look at his retinue -- the men were slouching and straggling
tell them the master 's going to beat me
there were three men in the cabin : mr cheng was sitting in the middle with his son on one side and a traveller from another district on the other
she turned to yingchun
xiangyun had been leaning on the back of a chair and , this being none too steady , her weight on it as she laughed had toppled it over , upsetting both girl and chair
the pimp had heard her ask this simple customer for a tip ; so now he climbed the stairs
i have not seen you for many years
but a five it was
before jia yun could get out of the way , the drunkard grabbed hold of him
prefect hsiang ordered their luggage to be put in the library where they were to stay
thank you , miss , for taking so much trouble , she said
as the proverb says , you can ’ t judge by appearances , madam
when dogs started barking outside , shen hsiang−fu went out to welcome the guest ; and the villagers stared as chou chin came in
you know , do not you , that all the ladies have come today , so not a single outsider must be allowed in
if that ’ s so , he did right to go , observed li wan
daiyu was not seriously ill , simply suffering from the heat
with no means to banish grief ,
why give me a bad name ?
i shall just sit here to help keep an eye on things , and you can consider me as an old assistant
and mr chih has gone to chujung to see to the repairs of the college ; so i know he wo not be coming
wouldrink our family 's tea , a daughter-in-law to be ' !
this depends on the unknown merits laid by for one ’ s children
baoyu made qiuwen and sheyue open the hampers , and as they did so the two women squatted down
this morning , uncle bao f~ni shed his papers first and waited for me to hand them in together
she tells her parents : don ’ t grieve for your child
high and low alike in both mansions were kept hard at work
staring at niu yu−fu 's face , niu pu lost his footing and fell into the lake
grabbing the osiers she brandished them in chunyan ’ s face
baochai told sheyue and wuer to make a bed for him in the outer room and to sleep lightly themselves and see to his tea
then she gives a scream of laughter and falls unconscious too
the next day hsiao called on these four scholars , and they returned his call
one or two had not , but all alike expressed their admiration
the paddy fields and vegetable plots in paddy-sweet cottage are only for fun and don ’ t need to be cultivated seriously ; still , it would be better to have her there in charge during the different seasons
thus both were lost in equally foolish reflections until baoyu abruptly asked qin zhong what he was reading and , the latter answering frankly , they embarked on an animated conversation which soon made them feel even more drawn to each other
we need not dwell on the details
then one of our household , a man called 'numberao , managed to get on the roof and beat them off
she turned to baoyu
it was a bolt from the blue !
that 's why i advised them , when his birthday came round , to pay back the opera so that we would not be beholden to him
he did so well that he became a millionaire
rong will write separately
one is madam lian ’ s mother-in-law , the other ’ s her father ’ s sister ; yet instead of taking their side she sides with someone less close
hsiao took it , turned over a few pages , and was full of praise
old yu supervised his sons ' work on their vegetable farm
his hand slipped — that ’ s how the wine bowl hit zhang san ’ s head
the lady dowager nodded
tradesmen like us ca not dream of passing the examinations , said niu pu−lang
i would like your opinion on this
i shall seek your advice on all matters in future
the oracle never lies , said chen ho−fu
five catties or seven at the most would be ample
wherever he goes now , people will know about him and will have to send him back
and please ask cousin zhen to lose no time in settling this lawsuit
then , under pressure , he thought up another trick
as regards her looks , conversation and behaviour , she was superior too
let ’ s go to her place to look for them
what has this to do with her ladyship ?
yingchun , reading retribution for good and evil with baochai , had not even heard what tanchun was saying
in this autumn season ruled over by the white emperor , i dream in my lonely bed in a deserted room
the maid did as she was told , coming back to report , miss lin says she received presents too ; she wants you to keep yours
let 's talk about something else
maids moved back the brazier and set out two tables in front of the old lady ’ s couch
she asked , even more bewildered
then he went to his own room to rest
that essay of yours , sir , which won the first place , said wan , has been carefully studied by everyone in our province
after a little further chat he took his leave of xifeng and went back to the garden
i will call on the others first and mr chin last
not like our children , who as soon as they can walk are scampering all over the graveyards
when he mentioned that his grandfather had been a pupil of tu 's great−grandfather , tu addressed him as an uncle
this time he passed , was placed in the second rank in the palace examination , and recommended by the authorities for membership of the han lin academy
he led his troops to defeat fang kuo−chen , and ruled over the whole province of chekiang , so that villages and towns were at peace once more
she told you , sir , pinger retorted
both his parents died when he was young and he had no brothers ; he lived as best he could on his small property
but all the repair men , carpenters and masons will work half time only
by this time the passersby had heard the crash , and a crowd gathered round to watch
she will distribute it as soon as she 's collected the interest
they can ’ t keep them for ever either , so how can you ?
having put down the incense-burner , mingyan stepped aside
you do not know , old ancestress , all the solemn warnings there are in the buddhist sutras about the sons born into noble families , who are always dogged by evil spirits who pinch them , nip them , knock their rice-bowls out of their hands , or trip them up on the road
i went all the way to straight eye cave , he reported
untiring they relentless means employed ;
in this dilemma he rose after a few remarks and ordered the meal to be served
so jia zheng did not insist too much on baoyu working for the examinations and had recently treated him more leniently
then the prime minister approached vice−minister hsu
if you have nothing better to do when you return , do come to yangchow , uncle
like the shadow of peaks , her grief is never gone ;
she keeps an eye on everything down to the least details of our father 's affairs at home and outside
if you could take me to see her , that would be nice
the lady of the alpinia
noticing that he seemed lonely , the old monk often brewed tea and took it to his room to talk with him till midnight ; and when there was moonlight they would sit in the courtyard to talk over past and present
since you ’ d left they shouldn ’ t have called you back again , making a trip for nothing
though she had lived with xue pan for several years , because of irregular menses she had never conceived a child
parted from his valleys and streams ,
why not weigh out two hundred and ten taels to lend him ?
having said this she hurried away
the musicians are very busy in other families—how can i get them here ?
seizing all the flowers on the plate , she stuck them this way and that in the old woman 's hair , reducing everyone present to helpless laughter
growing old now and worn out by his heavy responsibilities , he was so happy after this long time away to be reunited with his family that banishing all thought of business he passed the time reading , and when he was tired would play chess or drink with his proteges or enjoy the domesticity of the inner quarters with his mother , sons and wife
in future when i am with the old lady and you have something to report , it can wait
the muddy worm made no objection , for provided he had wine , meat and money himself he cared for nothing else
now third sister is going to marry far from home , so we will never meet again !
but xichun although young had a will of her own and was most uncompromising and eccentric
you produce six ministers in four generations , and your pupils and former dependents are to be found everywhere
embarrassed by this question , jia lian sheepishly changed the subject , then left her on the pretext that he had business
i have something to discuss with you
only a long poem in the old style— some song or ballad—can convey the spirit
baoyu , watching , decided that this way of dressing her hair was an improvement and regretted having sent her to comb her hair before the job should have been left for baochai
will you pay the chairbearers for me ?
but now that i have found my benefactor , i ca not let slip this opportunity
light a stick of that tibetan incense , she told zijuan presently
in a daze he forgot his search for yuanyang and boldly opened the first cabinet , in which he found several albums
we can enjoy ourselves here every day , unlike tu shao−ching , who has to take his wife to chingliang mountain to see the blossom !
there are a few dozen big willows there too , so that it is quiet , shady and cool ; and if the buffalo is thirsty it can drink at the water 's edge
when i called him he could not answer , and soon he died
i have a favour to ask you , shao−ching , said dr yu
it was nearly dark when they left the tavern , so mr ni went home while pao went back to tell his wife what he had arranged , and she was very pleased with the suggestion
i agreed to it only because he struck me as clever and pleasant
he has not been preparing very hard for the examinations , but recently in my spare time i have taught him to write verses as a pastime ; for , whatever fate may have in store for him , i want him to know how to rest content
come hack and change
but do you know that minx qingwen in baoyu ’ s place , madam ?
the secretary straightway sent the following memorandum to the magistrate : this licentiate yang is connected with the lou family , and two of the lou gentlemen have sent in their cards and instructed their steward to act as guarantor
feng raised the front of his gown
i needn ’ t remind you that we must all do our best during this period
i know anyway , so do not think you can hide it from me
so we have to make do with pearls worn by living people
with that warning she went in again with tanchun
he wanted to know
i ’ ve always maintained that you were cut out for great things
please take these two cents of silver to buy some wine
after leaving him the old lady went in to see baochai , who having been married less than a week behaved shyly in company
walking along the verandah into the outer room , she found his maids sprawled on their beds having a nap
aunt xue was only too glad to comply so as to have some check on her son , who was likely to get up to fresh mischief if they lived outside
it 's his birthday today , and when i went to congratulate him everybody was talking about this
xifeng promised to do her best , and after a little further talk they dispersed
yung lo is the name of his reign
pity the pure white mingling with the mud
how is that possible ?
in the cold clean scent i hug my knees and chant
then the others thought no more of the matter , and there it rested
no need to come in
the scandalous goings-on in that east mansion of his don ’ t bear speaking of
aunt xue had already come , so all took their seats and started the meal , baoyu just eating half a bowl of rice steeped in tea to keep them company
just now i went to miss lin ’ s place , said zhou rui ’ s wife after transacting her business
dr yu saw them out
he took from his wallet a mirror polished on both sides and engraved on its handle with the inscription : precious mirror of love
i will come when i have changed my clothes
just get the money from the treasury
in any case , i could never bring myself to speak of such a thing
shen escorted him in , and only then did mei chiu rise slowly to greet him
when baochan saw them coming with ropes to bind her she screamed , but the maids from the rong mansion silenced her and trussed her up
it was only a joke after drinking , said lady wang soothingly
if you take my advice , i shall die happy !
as they were boon companions , on the pretext of helping with family affairs they often joined in ffie ganri
it ’ s all very well for you ladies to have your fun , but i can ’ t take it , was pinger ’ s reply
people are waiting outside , they reminded him
why do not you come with us ?
who told you that ?
he wrote out a prescription
on top of that you have to meet the expenses of the elder master and master zhen , not to mention your debts outside ; besides , recently you were robbed , and the police are not likely to catch the thieves or recover your stolen property
at sight of him she stood up
you know how she is
besides , i can ’ t seek out xue ke myself , i ’ ll need her as go-between
it ’ s just after the festival and the old lady ’ s had a happy day
jia lian , when he had paid his respects , described his trip to shilitun to help arrange for wang ziteng ’ s funeral
lady wang and the maids pleaded in consternation , if you are so angry , madam , think what a rage the master will be in !
what girl can see her parents starve to death ?
where would we find one out in the open country ?
don ’ t hurt your hand let me slap myself instead
to this mr kao said nothing
suddenly dense clouds gathered , and there was a heavy shower of rain
better put them back and try somewhere else
this message pleased jia lian on qin ’ s account
may i ask why your honour sent runners to arrest me in a different province ?
but this is anticipating
what is this if not a case of predestined fate ?
i suppose baoyu ’ s not here because he ’ s forgotten this refined gathering in his eagerness to join in the fun
as for master qin , i ’ ll leave you to deal with him
miss lin can stay for the time being in his green gauze lodge
she must have come to summon me
i would like to ask you , sir , with your great literary gifts , to write a few words in prose or verse so that my achievements will not be forgotten
only selected scholars took the test examination , in which there were seldom any failures
later i was the abbot of the defender 's temple in peking
not a day has passed without my pulling them up , replied li
all those at usurious , illegal rates of inter
they will come to no good end
i ’ m glad you reminded me , cried xifeng gaily
on the lot she drew they saw a rose with the motto flower of final splendour ’ and the line when the rose blooms , spring flowers fade
and then half the girls in the household , who are grown up anyway , should get married
monk , said the headman , old kuang is one of the best men in our village , and his son has such fine features he is sure to make good in future
she 's a strange crafty creature if ever i saw one
green lattice nunnery is in our own grounds and i can practise my devotions there , while if i need anything you can see to it
a native of huzhou , he was the last of a line of scholars and officials
you used to live together in the garden , so i am sure you know what i mean
still yuanyang simply hung her head and said nothing
he will reflect such credit on you that you can be sure of receiving a title
my cousin tu shen−ching of tienchang , who 's in the capital , gave him a letter for me
then a note of alarm was sounded
he 's a public nuisance
why no report this to madam zhu ?
take them back and add some more bricks to the wall round the coffin , till it 's strong enough to last a few years
we can punish him when he comes back
come and sit down
but for a long time he said nothing
xifeng was convulsed with fury , convinced by their praise of pinger that the latter must have been complaining about her behind her back too
thoroughly depressed and not knowing how to work off his feelings , he went back to the garden , straight to bamboo lodge
but let us return to baoyu and qin zhong , who were fooling about in the hall when zhineng came in
to know how xifeng coped , read the following chapter
this doctor we had is the best-known , was the answer
it was before you were born
every day the blade goes in white and comes out red
the ning mansion is yours to live in again
we ’ re no one , though , who understands such things
if i ’ d any pride , scoffed tanchun , i should have dashed my brains out long ago
fan , whom i helped to look through the examination papers ; but for some years now—ever since my father was promoted to nanchang and needed someone to help him—i have been with him here
then baoyu , taking his book , took leave of daiyu and went back to his own room with xiren
just then a messenger arrived to fetch them , and they went into the yamen
what should be inscribed here ?
when ma heard this he was appalled
how heartless and stingy you think us !
weeping and cursing her fate , she put it in her mouth and after several desperate attempts succeeded in swallowing it
are you expert in that too , sir ?
having made his report to lady wang , he found out from the ministry of civil affairs that jia zheng was in no trouble - only the magistrate of taiping county had been dismissed from his post
since mr feng and i are friends , we are travelling together ; but i shall leave this boat at yangchow to take the nanking boat down the yangtse
so don ’ t you have a warm scent to match her cold scent ?
do let me choose my own rhymes , good cousins , he begged
have you finished those pills prescribed for you the other day ?
i am over seventy now , and i read the buddhist scriptures
then the truth dawned on everyone
and when mingyan saw who it was , he fell on his knees to beg for mercy
having taken a boat to yangchow and discovered from the college list that chi was staying in the temple of religious renewal , he made his way there immediately
i was at home that day when this mr xue asked me out to drink with him
let 's play a different way , suggested pin−niang
right , agreed tanchun
just then xue ke came in
you would better go back
now on this envelope he ’ s written uncle
`` take office high or low as days afford ,
our two young ladies are with miss daiyu , she told him
since heaven creates such wonderful girls , what use are we filthy males except to contaminate the world ?
baochai accordingly often helped her in secret , not letting lady xing know for fear of giving offence , with the result that now that this unexpected match had been arranged xiuyan felt even more closely bound to baochai than to xue ke
i want you to take this jade cup to drink from
although her face burned with shame , she forced herself to pocket her pride and explain her reason for coming
and in she came with xiangling
zijuan , standing to one side , jerked her chin towards the bed , and baoyu taking the hint walked over to have a look
if you want to know what followed , read the next chapter
you can talk , but you don ’ t dare go either , he muttered
what is your name , sir ?
then they drank till nearly dawn and put the guests up in the library ; for now chuan wu−yung and iron−armed chang were honoured guests in the prime minister 's house
before bao yong could reply he went on to ask , is it true , as i heard , that your younger master ’ s name is also baoyu ?
i ’ ve read the book of filial women , and a fortnight ago i started on the lives of chaste martyrs
baoyu fixed his eyes on her
so she had to tell a maid to take the gifts
it ’ s nothing serious : i just feel a bit limp
at this juncture , mr ni was in tears
just then baoyu arrived to pay his respects
even the imperial gauze used in the palace today is not so soft and fine
at her approach they rose and yuanyang asked :
he had sold all his other possessions , but could not bear to part with these precious volumes
that evening baochai invited xiangyun to stay with her , and by lamplight xiangyun outlined her plans for entertaining the others and setting subjects for poems
when she asked what had happened and i told her , she said :
he causes a great uproar , yet in the end is allowed to punish the moslems in order to preserve his face
there are pearls in the palace , said chen , but i do not think they are used as candles
i ’ ll hire a carriage to bring her , and you can question her in the lady dowager ’ s presence
i ca not go back till i have accepted his invitation
opposite was the table for the old lady accompanied by lady xing and xiuyan
but i am going to finish the lot , even if it kill me
but later , i do not know why , he started dabbling in the occult and persuading people to practise alchemy
he counted the strokes -- vertical , horizontal , dotted and curved -- there were seventeen in all
they asked when they saw the chair
since sixth master was a mohammedan , another twenty to thirty eggs were brought and boiled hard , and a lamp was lit
disconcerted by this , jia zheng answered with a smile , you have so much experience of people , madam , if you approve of him and think him promising , you can ’ t be wrong
in the third place , of all the ladies of our house i ’ m the only young married woman , but there are plenty of servants ’ wives younger than me who are for ever dropping into the garden then going home again at night
i entered orders as a boy , protested the monk
he recognized baochan ’ s voice but made no sound , pretending to be asleep
i was young at the time i took it and did not set much store by it , so i left it in the case
there are real-life images ready at hand — why not use one of those ?
we only wish you would come more often
why trouble to order the meal yourself , old ancestress ?
baoyu took her hand
dai quan ordered one of his attendants , take this to old zhao , chief of the board of revenue , with my compliments
a few steps from here is tu shao−ching 's house
they announced too that the house had been made ready , as the new mistress would see for herself when she moved in
the other day we saw some inscriptions written by you , young master
you have good sense , lian
the next evening , however , when the concubine cried as she poured out all her fears again , the wife said , very well
i went to anching to see a friend , and on my way back the wind held us up here
out of spite , they went to congratulate mr hsun on being the father of a metropolitan graduate , until he was so angry he could hardly speak
two days later , however , hung kan−hsien breathed his last
if not for that , it wouldn ’ t matter going back late
you are a good player , mr chen , said tsou
on entering the presence of the commissioner , magistrate tang took off his gauze cap and kowtowed again and again
then jia zheng dismissed them and went back to the west mansion
you are to retain your post in the ministry of works
if , however , you can not write paku essays well , then all your writing will be unorthodox and third−rate
did he start school this year ?
and jia zheng not knowing the reason said , you wanted to work here ; now you want to leave
the fifth son is not twelve yet , and if i adopt him they can trust me to love him and bring him up properly
he presented the letter with both hands
overjoyed , he ordered servants to wait on the visitor , then hurried in to let the old lady and lady wang identify the stone
send someone over at once to go with me ; i sha not want my full escort , ordered hsiao
he pulled up short , hanging his head
clean rooms were also prepared for the two doctors who would take it in turn to attend the child and make out prescriptions for her , remaining there in residence for twelve days
if you take that line , complained xiren , he ’ ll be even less willing to go
in the end , though he had two pieces more than tsou , he was worn out with the effort !
when i came in you ignored me and lay down in a huff — i ’ ve no idea why
he halted then with lowered head and said , you ’ re right , of course
now what i suggest is this
as it was the depth of winter the nights were long and an icy north wind chilled him to the bone
what ’ s rare about it ?
only too eager to believe this , wang hui felt overjoyed
very well , as her father approves , get everything ready and choose a day for setting off on this long journey , said the old lady
though xiaohong did not want to drop the matter , neither did she want to arouse the suspicions of others by questioning the young man
wang mien nodded assent
are you mrs xia , madam ?
chanjie was first speechless with anger
just look at ruhua : she was here for some years as well , but she left when she was told to
at that everyone laughed , knowing that she was referring to how xiangyun had fallen asleep earlier that day on a stone
if the hour of her birth is correct , she must be a sovereign lady
thereupon he wrote out and gave jia rong the following prescription :
but the scamp has fallen short of her kind expectations , he answered
now you ’ ve caught cold
for life is short
but do not ask me to go to the country ; i am not used to that kind of life
there are no such things as devils
and at my expense this time
you ’ d better let them off
suppose i get them tomorrow ?
but noticing some unusually beautiful water-fowl of various species unknown to her splashing about in the pool by seeping fragrance bridge , she stopped for a while to admire their brilliant colours
so cousin yun 's here !
he made the girls sit down and told qiuwen to take half the fruit to miss lin
ghosts are wailing below green maples ,
was that of lady wang
as baoyu had not yet seen what was on the paper and did not know what daiyu ’ s reaction would be , he dared not answer outright
after lunch i shall learn the emperor 's will
the fifth sign shows another ghost ; hence i fear your mother 's illness is quite serious
it ’ s no use asking her now that she ’ s in trouble
what maid here had any reason to throw herself into a well ?
i think another dose should set him right
cousin baochai was sitting on the edge of the kang , with cousin bao standing in front of her
nobody has died in your family
but i thought to myself : sour things are astringent , and when he was beaten and could not cry out some choleric humours must have rushed to his viscera ; plum juice might affect them , bringing on a serious illness , and that would never do
as wu shu saw him out , one of the college servants came rushing up
i don ’ t have to name him
after this yuanyang seldom went to the garden after dark ; and reflecting that if even the garden was the scene of such strange carryings-on , other places must be still worse , she went nowhere else either if she could avoid it
incense is burned on the ground
thou canst not one by one the crowd persuade ,
what a pity chi wei−hsiao is not here !
he retorted with a grin
it ’ s all very well for you to talk , cried qingwen
then jia yun left the compound
after driving xue pan away she had no one to squabble with as qiuling had gone to stay with baochai , leaving only baochan with her
we must think of some way out but on no account act rashly !
most certainly , agreed yoo
the bezoar is being brewed
soon a maid announced his arrival and an old nurse stepped forward to draw the bed-curtains
with clenched teeth he rained down dozens of vicious blows until his secretaries , foreseeing serious consequences , stepped forward to intervene
at first he had thought her one of the old lady 's attendants , never dreaming that she was xiren
so now his memory has come back again
and that would be too bad
ma chun−shang went in
by rights , i shouldn ’ t bring this up at our first meeting , madam
when jia lian escorted them out , he saw several countrified carts which the servants were forbidding to draw up there
he immediately wrote his name on a card and carried it to the library to pay his respects to the new teacher , taking his nine−year−old son with him
why should you be upset because of me ?
your fine family mansion with its garden , summer−houses and flowers was the best north of the yangtse , he said
being unable to sit with xiangyun and baoqin , he took a seat by the old lady and started toasting the guests one by one on baochai 's behalf
why does the jinx have to be found here ?
what did your clan say , cousin ?
he listened for some time
whatever she says goes , and no one dares stop her
leaving her question unanswered he exclaimed , what a swine this young yun is — ridiculous !
a man who wants to be both will succeed in neither !
after searching the city for him without success , we instituted careful inquiries
they ’ ve already been sent to your rooms
feng ziying only laughed
all those officials have pots of money , dignified faces and big ears
it was as follows :
all this made her suspicious
going back inside tanchun found xiangyun in tears , holding daiyu ’ s hand
i had no idea such trouble would come of it
well , just go with an easy mind
your single-mindedness should move the gods to pity
a rumour comes true and the imperial
li wan and the others read them
but your family has never thrown its weight about like that in the past
on that date we can all meet here
reasoning like this , he felt as jubilant as if seeing daiyu herself
he may have served his first master well , but still he ’ s only a servant and ought to show some respect
we should enjoy ourselves while we are young
she left this sentence unfinished
we send things to the garden , then they send them back here again — our own people doing the sending and the accepting !
the prince of beijing announced , '~we have summoned you today on his majesty 's orders for an interrogation
lingguan writes on the ground
beaming as he ate and drank beside the kang , xinger regaled old mrs you and her daughters with a detailed account of the rong mansion
of course , you ’ re inviting me to go and have everyone kowtow to me because it ’ s my birthday , but it would be a hundred times more to my liking if you had my annotated rewards and punishments neatly copied out and printed
he wrote something you might like to look at
i asked her to let us know what flower she ’ d be in charge of , she said , so that in future we can sacrifice to her
in his generosity he is actually encouraging his nephew 's bad habits
i presumed too much on your generosity in the past ; yet you are still so good to me
some busybody ’ s been talking to xifeng
and as i came through your main gate , i saw some pages carrying off your carriage for repairs they said it was cracking up
he packed his things , said goodbye to yu yu−chung , crossed the yangtse , and came to tu 's riverside house
just now i gave her mother fifty taels
chu hsien−fu came in to greet them , and they exchanged the usual compliments
the feast was served at three tables in the western hall , and the food was excellent though there was no opera to watch
re pulled her sleeve and pleaded , wouldo talk to me , cousin !
as there were many people standing round murmuring that it seemed there was no hope , hupo had to hold her tongue
what shall i do ?
daiyu rose at once to go
she was sipping her wine to keep him company when jia lian ’ s old wet-nurse nanny zhao came in
aunt li nodded and jia lan went off with the letter to find baoyu
did he come here the other day ?
tanchun asked her with a smile
aren ’ t you a girl too ?
so those who want a beating , just come late
now this prefect is one of your clan , and it 's not a big favour to ask
i have started on a pair of slippers but have not been able to finish them because i have been poorly for the last couple of days
that ’ s right , you must help me , madam , agreed aunt xue
baoyu , his eyes still blurred from sleep , took the jade and without so much as looking at it threw it on the ground
if you asked after talent or moral character , the reply was still , mr
the old lady said , they ’ re not married yet , and it wouldn ’ t look good to seize someone promised to another man
she prayed to heaven then with tears in her eyes , born a shi , i married into the jia family , and i earnestly implore holy buddha in heaven to have mercy on us !
when she had gone the two or three other elderly servants who were left , not being over-conscientious , slipped out to enjoy themselves
you mustn ’ t tell a soul though
in this way we shall cover all the fine sights and occupations of autumn
how could you strike even pinger yesterday ?
yingchun was so weak that none of the servants were afraid of her
you have nothing to worry about !
daiyu lay peacefully with closed eyes , snugly wrapped in an apricot-red silk quilt , while xiangyun ’ s black hair had tumbled all over the pillow , her quilt barely reached her shoulders , and she had flung one white arm adorned with two gold bracelets outside the covers
she declared i was the bane of her life , the way i demanded and grabbed everything i saw in her place
i have not yet congratulated you
wants to go in we will keep him company
we don ’ t know them , but they ’ re your relatives
i saw a lot of them for a couple of months , so of course i know
the wardrobes alone are bigger and higher than one of our whole rooms
let us return to baoyu
and by the lake is a belt of green where all the buffaloes of the village browse
what a barrier there is between wealth and poverty
today after lunch she did some reading but soon became bored with the book ; then she did a little needlework with zijuan and xueyan , but found this even more tedious
it 's late now ; you would better go back
li wan interposed at this point , i ’ ll go and see about getting some wine heated for you
now the days are so long , i was afraid you might alt be bored while i was out and go to bed after your meal , which might make you fall ill , i ’ m glad you found a way to amuse yourselves
but not daring to say so outright , she just tried to comfort her
cried li wan hurrying to meet her
go back quickly then , urged the old lady
the answer should be a line from the four books
after a little more chat xifeng took her leave , and having paid various other calls she went home
what you would just said was not right , ni er chuckled
i ’ ve been trying hard to console her , but it ’ s no use
every evening he continued to read poems in the temple
is it snowing outside ?
yen put on a scholar 's cap , a blue gown and red silk sash , while concubine chao dressed herself in crimson and put a gold chaplet on her head
now yuanyang after a bout of weeping thought , i have been with the old lady all my life , and i have found no niche for myself
she called the others to come to serve him his meal
leave the curtains as they are , he can see me like this
them out or recall them
but after standing there for a little while , they decided it was no use creating a disturbance , and went back to the river
you look like a precious object , but you still lack real value
the whole family , lady wang and baoyu too , have had a dressing-down
after a little drink i feel better , she answered
the world is full of strange phenomena ,
i agree to them all , dear sister , good kind sister
two sparrows were fighting over there , improvised xiren hastily
i will get you another , he promised
yoo liang went in to bow before his great−aunt 's shrine , then carried it to the stand
when she had dressed she kowtowed twice , then left the boat with the cuckold looking thoroughly ashamed
it 's time to write poems now
will you never learn to adapt yourself to circumstances ?
'we ’ d never do that
he was playing draughts one day with zhan guang , and both still had about the same number of pieces ; but in one corner the issue was not yet decided and each was trying to enclose that sector
do not denounce me to the king of hell !
you mustn ’ t trouble , sister !
the company roared with laughter
she chased after him regardless , expostulating , last time you lost the jade it nearly cost me my life !
now that your honour ’ s come to this post , said the attendant , surely you ’ ve copied out the officials ’ protective charm for this province ?
the runner laid hold of him
she giggled , i was kind enough to keep this between ourselves , yet you start manhandling me
i want you to live in harmony as a happy family , he told them
apart from my clothes and bedding i have nothing but a casket with a few old books in it , said wang hui
but it would not be right for us to stay here and wait while he sends a man all that way to fetch us
you must give me time to manage it
the two children , being only seven or eight , had no sense and just went on crying and pleading with her
recognizing baoyu 's voice jia yun hurried in
you also have to collect twelve drains of dew on the day white dew , number twelve drains of frost on the day frost falls , number and twelve drains of snow on the day slight snownumber these liquids are mixed with the other ingredients , then twelve drains of honey and twelve of white sugar are added to make pills the size of longans
that ’ s why , at the risk of a beating , i slipped over to see her
i ’ m always urging you not to listen to that vulgar talk or think about those vulgar matters
they rejoined yen , and after a little more conversation and a cup of tea , their servant came in to tell them that classmates were waiting for them to go to a literary meeting
if she were officious or spiteful , i ’ d never have dreamed of it either it would look as if i were trying to show her up
if he wouldn ’ t agree , we could say he was the one who killed zhang san then laid the blame on an outsider
if he 's in the outer gaol i know how to reach him
what ’ s this under the inkstone ?
madam you ceremoniously presented tea to the lady dowager while jia rong ’ s wife served the other elderly ladies , after which madam you served lady xing ’ s group and jia rong ’ s wife the girls
just now miss lin didn ’ t know it either , agreed the women
then pan the headman arrived on the scene , and persuaded the other man to quiet down
we ’ d never have thought of such a thing
now this woman was so curiously constituted that the touch of a man seemed to melt her very bones , so that he felt as if bedded in cotton-wool , while in her wanton tricks and amorous cries she outdid any prostitute
i ’ m on duty all day long at the inner gate , stammered lai wang
in that case , why have you been hiding at home for so long , instead of bringing your money here to give us all a good time ?
but those things are in some cases in the east attic
why , what valuables are you afraid of people stealing that you carry these keys about on you ?
after dinner they chatted for a while before retiring for the night , and xiangyun went back to daiyu ’ s rooms , with baoyu escorting them there
if i do , may a thunderbolt strike me dead !
every girl , not to mention yuanyang , wants to rise in the world and become someone of importance
when jia lian saw how things were , he was very pleased with second sister ’ s virtuous conduct
i ’ ve had insomnia a long time now , daiyu sighed
all noble ladies come from the realm of love and retribution
smiling , xifeng returned her greeting and hand in hand they entered the house , where xifeng took the seat of honour while second sister ordered her maid to bring a cushion , then knelt to pay her respects
second sister ordered wine and food to be prepared
she had heard a great deal from her mother about the magnificence of her grandmother ’ s home ; and during the last few days she had been impressed by the food , costumes and behaviour of the relatively low-ranking attendants escorting her
be a good fellow !
ting−hsi 's eyes nearly started from his head , and for a moment he was speechless
as the fireworks went off with a series of bangs , tu leant back in his chair and roared with laughter
an imperial decree has conferred on him the rank of grand secretary and the posthumous title of duke wenqin , he announced
just now our mistress sent to find your cousin xifeng ; but she wasn ’ t at home and they said she ’ d come to the garden
when hupo saw her she exclaimed in surprise :
his king chanced there and happy proved the day
his glorious dynasty ere long was lost
the lady dowager made her sit down and suggested , what about a game of cards ?
i shall call to tell him
the sturgeon has its tarn ,
so if you have no objection i would like to sleep outside for a couple more nights
give me something to take then , or ask to borrow something
drive out those dirty nuns , quick !
no , there are not any in yangchow , replied wan
we ’ re not as well off as we used to be
why be so stupid ?
his aunt promptly sent for the best wine in the house
yen 's cheeks as he pointed to a chest and said , yesterday the pawnshop sent three hundred taels of interest over
on hearing this , the two scholars came
that ’ s why i secretly stopped her pay as a maid and gave her two taels a month from my own allowance , so that she ’ d understand and look after him even better
but you may fall ill if you can ’ t write good poems
as soon as this man came in he ordered the attendants to clear away the tea things
i know his middlemen
then pay the chair−bearers and send them away
without coming here , i could not have appreciated the old poet 's way of putting it !
first brother has eight corners ,
how can i save you ?
it was mr lai who paid for my tea just now
no end to their victuals and clothing , but at last
when pao knelt to pay his respects , mr hsiang raised him up with both hands
jia she kept summoning more bonzes and taoists , but because these could do no good jia zheng lost patience and tried to dissuade him
the girls were laughing too much to hear his knock , so that he shouted and pounded for a long time before they finally heard
do not alarm the old lady
she then turned to pinger
studio of autumn freshness
your third sister ’ s rather smart , remarked daiyu
what do you mean ?
lady wang opened the packets but could not recall what they were , and there was no ginseng among them
you would better give your money to the pimp at feng family lane in yicheng !
but to her surprise , upsetting her even more , he simply sighed , how sublime !
as they went out she said to mrs wang , i have a suggestion , if you agree to it , and that is to restrict the search to our own family
someone told me he was in chiangnan , so i have been there three times
she turned to baoyu
he put these on the counter and they started drinking
but the doctor would not tell me
when xiren heard knocking at the gate , she got up at once and sent to ask what was so pressing
because he and daiyu both lived in the lady dowager ’ s quarters he was closer to her than to the other girls , and being closer had grown more intimate ; but precisely because of this he sometimes offended her by being too demanding and thoughtless
i don ’ t want them
so eat early and go and rest
buddhists and taoists hung up long banners , chanted their scriptures and performed the funeral rites ; while the widow and her little son wailed morning and evening before the coffin
there was no fixed standard of scholarship , however
she went to the bridal chamber where wuer was setting out candles
but you must not let him know i put you up to this
not that her mother pays any attention , and her father does nothing either , so poor yingchun 's worse off now than one of our third-grade maids
she then thought the whole business over carefully once more , and hit on a cunning plan to kill several birds with one stone , working out the safest measures to achieve this
of course , if your tastes are simple you can have less
i don ’ t know , ma ’ am
he travelled all day , stopping only to refresh himself when he was hungry or thirsty , staying in inns at night , and he had been three days on the way when a caravan of pack-horses came towards him escorted by a dozen or so men on horseback
xiren asked where they were taking the hamper and what was in it
qingwen was wasting away , having touched no food for four or five days ; but now with dishevelled hair she was dragged from the kang and two women carried her off
if you want to study quietly , sheyue said , who ’ d dream of disturbing you ?
the next instant she started at a loud dong like the sound of a bronze bell or copper chimes repeated eight or nine times
it ’ s a mystery to me the way things turn out
have you written the letter yet ?
aunt xue was already upset on this score
you must explain more clearly
if he had , heaven knows how wildly he ’ d carry on !
she insisted i come to see if you would made it up
instead of answering , she stepped forward and threw the powder in fangguan ’ s face
he sighed appreciatively , this is certainly unexpected
with that he tucked the stone into his sleeve and hurried off with the taoist
i shall take part too
when the old man went to the yamen , yoo sent a servant to find tang san
you ’ ll catch your death after that sweat you were in , she scolded
the other , shaped like a small alms-bowl , bore the name in the curly seal script : rhinoceros cup
her sweet soul gone with the wind ,
if i died today or tomorrow , this year or next , i ’ d die content
even if you don ’ t see her ladyship you must see her , or your visit will have been wasted
how can you refuse ?
you must excuse us
if they make scathing remarks , just pretend not to hear and go about your own business
in which a monk invited to say masses is involved in a lawsuit , and a country gentleman out to raise money runs into trouble when fan chin 's mother realized that everything in the house was hers , overcome with joy she fell senseless to the ground
i hear our master is leading troops to suppress the miaos , he said as soon as he saw them
with their lady ships letting her down , who else is going to help poor xifeng ?
the two runners , waiting at the gate , barred her way
they have all changed since last i was here
wei−hsiao , replied the captain
who took my sister-in-law 's things ?
bonzes chanting sutras burned incense , sacrificed to the hungry ghosts and intoned the water penitential while thirteen young nuns in red slippers and embroidered robes recited incantations before the coffin to lead the soul on its way
why did not you put more on before bringing my tea ?
why ask me that ?
as there was insufficient room on the kang , xiaoyan and sier set two chairs beside it
i ’ ll get the blame if you ’ re seen leaving , said jia qiang
then , having taken his leave of the lady dowager , he went over to the other mansion
they were all wearing brand−new headdresses and jackets
on that day all the neighbours brought congratulatory gifts , even kuei contributing his share , so anxious was he now to keep in with them
dairu had crossed out child and substituted at fifteen
under the impression that daiyu was unconscious , and as zijuan was away , xueyan took daishu ’ s hand and asked her in a low voice , was it true what you told me the other day about some mr wang proposing a match for our master bao ?
and she sent messengers posthaste to take the news
seating herself on the steps leading to the small courtyard , she made the girl kneel down
i can truly never repay her tremendous kindness
what were you doing ?
that nephew of hers was an odd fellow too
i come from south of the yangzi , but my parents are dead and i ’ m all on my own , with no brothers ; so i have to put up in my grandmother ’ s house
if he discovered that i ’ d sent someone else , in the temper he ’ s in now he ’ d vent his anger on
though i have a son , it ’ s as if i had none
what have i got to say to you !
he sat there for a long time , but not even a ghost appeared
there ’ s a reason , answered pinger
but before the ropes could be pulled another crack was heard , and the ankle−screws broke once more
lady wang had taken baoyu on her lap
his anecdotes on painting when he described the frescoes zhang sengyou painted in a monastery
idly my orchids into wreaths i bent
the neighbours brought eggs or wine , lugged along sacks of rice or carried over chickens
presents they don ’ t expect , but she should at least kowtow to express her thanks
i ’ ve felt worried for you all these years with no father , mother or brothers to care for you
i only beseech you all to stay and watch over me until the day that i turn into floating ashes — no , not ashes
i came simply to pay my respects to the third master
indicating jia lian , the young man said , i have come to have a word with second uncle
you ca not hurry him
just sit where you are
crafty xifeng kills her rival
they look so refined one would expect them to be understanding , but they ’ re stupid fools with no insight at all into other people ’ s hearts
and your commanding presence—so unlike mr chih 's mature dignity—struck awe into my heart
baoqin , standing up too , continued :
jumping to one side , he whirled round to confront a man with a club ; and as this fellow lunged at him , hsiao shot up a foot to send him sprawling
one ’ s too greasy , the other too sweet , complained the old lady
yes , replied mr wei
li wan assented and did so , after first calling for water to wash her hands
all he could do was to wait
just say yes ’ to whatever he tells you and you ’ ll be all right
editing nowadays is going to the dogs , declared mr wei
i wish i were dead !
then the emperor demanded angrily , 'how can your family allow your servants to abduct a good citizen 's wife ?
and how much damage has been done inside ?
i know you wo not look at me , but let me just say one word
i want to give them as presents
presently we should write some poems on red plum-blossom , she suggested
as they skirted the back of a rockery , baochai inquired :
ting−hsi dared say no more , but asked kuei to go with him to call on the go−betweens
the other day a man came from my district and told me that my father was ill at home ; and i am miserable because i do not know whether he is alive or dead
is this the place for you to bawl abuse ?
you minx , you don ’ t deserve such luck , madam you teased
go on , you little bitch , chuckled her mother
so one of the small girls went to ask her sister to speak to old mrs fei
why spank me for something my mother said ?
i have already made one
to return to daiyu
to live quietly and contentedly in a green plot in the city as you do , uncle , is as good as being an immortal !
when you see the old lady , please give her my respects and tell her i ’ m a bit poorly , but it ’ s nothing serious she ’ s not to worry
have bao er and that fellow he san tied up
that would do just as welt
will take their natural course ' , he said
you came here to have a good time
it must be zijuan , she thought with relief
ni er 's spirits rose again
that should take us over the whole grounds
if she doesn ’ t , no harm will be done as no one else will know
two imperial eunuchs have come , asking to see your lordships , he announced
he and the girls stayed to dine with the old lady , after which they dispersed , aunt xue staying on to sleep in the old lady ’ s annex
from that hour baoyu treated xiren with special consideration and she served him even more faithfully than before
and where is your honourable yamen ?
if this food is poison , ours is pure arsenic
i am sorry to have put you and my cousin to such trouble
they can ’ t do a thing if i withhold the tally
how silly can you get ?
even more embarrassed than earlier on with daiyu , he turned away to talk to the others
since this made it out of the question to wait any longer , yucun went through a passage to the side gate and left
are you my uncle chuang cho−chiang ?
our examinations are a great affair of state , and since we were busy on state business , even if we had to neglect our own relatives we need feel no compunction
that ’ s apart from what else they filch
in which mrs wang quarrels with her husband , and ni ting−chu finds his brother big foot went home to report that mrs wang was willing , and shen tien−fu announced this to kuei when he arrived the next morning for news
i do not want to flatter you , he said , but i know something about fortune−telling and you have noble features
after reading the title he looked up thoughtfully to ask baoyu , have you studied mencius already ?
what a coincidence , meeting you here
consoled by these reflections , she forgot the fatigues of the day and started reading again , till zijuan who was worn out urged her to sleep
he is the third son of the former minister hu , and his name is hu chen
after i was twenty i learned how to be a secretary , and i have worked in a number of yamens
pinger shook her head
if that 's what you want , those things are dirt cheap
she shook herself and changed into a lovely girl with a most bewitching face
is anything there that shouldn ’ t be ?
lou feng agreed with him
it was supported by those with official positions , who contributed according to the size of their stipends , and an elderly man of good reputation in the clan was elected to take charge of the boys ’ instruction
by now xichun was feeling more wretched than ever
why has not he come to welcome mr chou ?
lady xing insisted that she stay for the evening meal
just give him jia yucun 's name , and tell him what you want of him
admittedly , her two messages were not long , but she spoke to the point
don ’ t let anyone give her the wrong medicine , though
how did we come to take on someone so stupid ?
the lady dowager turned to tell xifeng , go and fetch xiangyun , baochai , baoqin and daiyu , and ask tanchun to come with them
you can wear them when you ’ re better
but please go and beg her ladyship to let me off
in the other were tiny fried dumplings no more than one inch long
they are simply natural forces , but whatever they enter assumes a form
although a court purveyor , he knew nothing of business or worldly affairs but prevailed on his grandfather ’ s old connections to find him a well-paid sine-cure in the board of revenue and left all business to his agents and old family servants
it 's nearly time for the examination and your grandfather has it very much on his mind
how old are you ?
meanwhile lady wang and the others had finished their melons , and after some further talk the party broke up , the girls returning to the garden
with the capital so far from your honourable district !
you have reason to worry , madam
it was so amusing that i stayed to watch
i am overjoyed at this encounter here !
it must be lord zhen ’ s fault
there was an omen this spring
a true gourmand should also have wine ;
on the left 'two aces ' combine
when your mother died i was far away in peking , and could not come back to mourn for her in person
and one night she said : all i pray for now is that buddha will take me away in your place and let you get well
we ’ ve just got her to stop crying
if nothing had happened , well and good ; as it is , high and low alike we are all in trouble so who can get you off ?
do not be in such a hurry !
the latter assented but waited till the old lady had washed her hands , rinsed her mouth and left the table to chat with lady wang
if you can ’ t make her drink , chuckled the old lady , i ’ ll go out presently and toast her myself
his rooms were filled with the pungent scent of herbs and qingwen was lying all alone on the kang , her face flushed with fever , her forehead hot to his touch
after a short rest , however , he asked abruptly , is not there someone missing ?
still , you ’ re in too much of a hurry to give her a job
from joy and grief alike your heart was free ;
you ’ re only joking , cousin , said xiangyun , but some people are really jealous
xiren remarked , as your parents aren ’ t on the spot , they must have spoken to your sister-in law
my brother should never have agreed to that match
we know what ’ s in your heart
there should not be any difficulty
xifeng told hongyu , take those things and see master yun out
do you work here ?
miaoyu would not drink out of any cups but her own ; however , before long her maid brought over her things and xichun herself made the tea
if there ’ s anything of use to you , you can have it ; and if you ’ ll make out a list of what ’ s still missing , i ’ ll send people to buy it
when i stopped him he was not his usual self , the rough way he pushed and shoved me without any feeling at all ; and later he had less patience with madam bao and not the least feeling for the other girls either , as if he would awoken to the truth
when you two fall out , why put the blame on me ?
the salt merchant will have nothing so good to offer me !
that was why he gave her the name li wan and the courtesy name gongcai
i do not know how you feel about it
i did not go , said wang teh with a frown
and here is the song to summon her spirit :
thanks to the imperial favour and the virtue of our ancestors , your noble highness embodies the finest essences of nature and the accumulated merit of our forbears — such fortune has attended my wife and myself
it 's nothing like in the old days
jia rong , knowing his game , rejoined , if you ’ ve taken such a fancy to her , uncle , i ’ ll act as your go-between to make her your secondary wife
she had to send xue ke to smooth matters over with the county court
why , even a number of tigers , wolves , snakes and insects have now entered nirvana
nowadays we have these disgraceful scenes — not like a respectable family , she said
we can only hope that from now on he will stick to the right path and never be influenced again by those evil spirits !
what a poor opinion you have of other people !
by the afternoon , however , more relatives and friends arrived , entailing even more work , and she could not see to everything at once
we have no scholar there by that name
then he reported the matter to lady wang , and obtained permission to leave the corpse for five days in pear fragrance court before its removal to iron threshold temple
it ’ s nothing but a cold , said the doctor
why should miss lin be angry ?
we ’ re all women , only a bit different in status , so i can ’ t think why anyone should be so cruel
the lady dowager and the rest sat at tables on either side , while madam you , li wan and xifeng passed round dishes and poured the wine
i am worried too by his illness
the old lady isn ’ t here to keep an eye on him today~~
all you know is how to enjoy yourself
when she passed on her instructions , baochai , baoqin , daiyu , tanchun and xiangyun all went with her to the garden where they were introduced and paid their respects
if it 's not , we will let whoever it is get a soaking
but of them all xue pan was the most frantic , being afraid that in the crush his mother might be knocked over , baochai stared at , or xiangling exposed to indignities -- for he knew what libertines jia zhen and the rest were
li wan , baoyu and the rest , on receiving these presents , tipped the messengers and told them that they would thank baochai when next they saw her
xifeng had no choice but to do as she was told
watchful pinger quickly followed her and took her arm
baoyu reckoned on his fingers
daliao answered with a smile , why , madam , with your broad knowledge of past and present , have not you heard the story of how wang xifeng of the han dynasty found an official post ?
say what you have to say , but keep your hands to yourself
that fortune−telling is a low profession goes without saying ; but even teaching and secretarial work are not proper careers
dismissal was the last thing mother he wanted
i wish you a good journey , he said
this is made from the essences of the different exotic young plants which grow in all famous mountain resorts
if mr wei respects him , i should respect him ten times as much , magistrate shih reflected
jia lian was released , while all ha she 's men and women bondservants were registered and sequestrated
in addition there were two other maids and some old nurses from the different apartments , as well as some stewards ' wives
where did you put up last night , sir ?
what do you want two coffins for ?
the lady dowager sends for her motherless
the brigade general ordered his three forces to encamp at wild goat pool
if we asked caiyun in confidence and she owned up , yuchuan could stop worrying and everybody would forget about it
and doubting the use of this , aunt xue prevailed on xifeng to send jia lian with several thousand taels to buy off the magistrate , while xue ke at the same time squared the others involved
that ’ s a good child too
let me recite you a verse , sir
after one beat on the gong the music started
jia zheng described the raid to him and asked him to make inquiries
twenty branches descended from the duke of ningguo and the duke of rongguo
before she could finish lady wang rapped out , we ’ re talking about the jade
as lady wang raised no objection , the serving-woman brought in granny liu and greetings were exchanged
we have two types of miaos — the wild and the tame , said the prefect
as they were speaking , servants brought in tea ; and after the tea mr hu stood up and invited them into the library
there was nothing the magistrate could do but send the feast to the servant 's quarters and ask his stewards to eat with the actor
do not be in such a hurry , objected li wan
but not too much salt has been lost , and your honour has already punished the helmsman , so that he will be more careful in future
i ’ d better raise a rumpus in miss lin ’ s place instead
jia yucun had no choice but to say goodbye to the priest and leave the temple
puzzled to find them all with red eyes , granny liu presently asked , what 's wrong ?
we ’ re a happy family of kith and kin i must say , all like game-cocks fighting to finish each other off
when nothing can be called a test
clouds from the islands make a haze over the ocean ,
it did not matter your asking me to take in the tea — you could not do anything else
what do you want incense for ?
it ’ s made two hundred and twenty ingots in all
what does it matter ?
in spite of their depleted numbers , however , it was quite a merry family feast
well , it 's not often they spend their money on me
leading a hard life , uninfluenced by the imperial examinations , they retained their sterling qualities
she told the two young maids to accompany him
how is it my mother knows all the faults of the other girls but not those of you , sheyue and qiuwen ?
she asked what they were
she sneezed so violently , five or six times in succession , that her nose and eyes started to run
we have some families of tribesmen here just say i ’ m from one of those
yinger stepped forward to report , when i saw master bao going out i told sister xiren to go with him
he drew back instantly as if obeying an imperial decree or a mandate from buddha
and i , though i may be ill-fated , do not deserve this
he tendered them thanks one by one for coming
governor hsu of chekiang province invited our master to visit the west lake with him , he was told
he left the study and had just reached the main gate when he saw xue pan there bawling , who let that lad liu get away ?
baoyu , on the other hand , was the one with the least to do and the most leisure
it ’ s because of him that i was dismissed , she told her mother
then he suddenly burst into tears
they actually kowtowed to me too , and called me a living buddha !
with cress leaves green my simple gown i made ,
nothing , was the reply
the proverb says 'even the longest feast must break up at last
at the main entrance her pages withdrew and maid-servants raised the curtain of the carriage
and though they hadn ’ t met for so many years , as soon as he visited her family old mrs xia , having no son herself , sturck by your cousin ’ s good looks shed tears of joy , more delighted than if he had been her own son
why should you talk like this ?
and , as they were cursing away , a family servant arrived from kweichow with a letter from their father , which they read together
till death seals up their eyes
take any of them you like
however , madam you 's exhortations only made xichun more eager to kill herself
when did you go to court , sir ?
at this everybody laughed
white snow and red plum-blossom make
zijuan promptly tucked daiyu ’ s quilt round her and put down the bed-curtains , while xueyan hastily tidied up the room
if any minor points had to be settled , jia zhen and the others would explain them to him or send him a written report , while he passed on his instructions through jia lian and lai da
she certainly seems a strange case , said wu shu
it seems there was no other course to follow apart from that of yang zhu
if i tell you , you mustn ’ t let her know , said xueyan
thought kuo , and fell unconscious to the ground
the lady dowager burst out laughing
i am always scolding him , pleading with him , getting angry with him or crying over him , but after a short improvement back he slips
spend every morning on that
i know you ’ ve come out to avoid the big feast and the racket at home today
she was afraid she had a spring rash again , and would like some rose-nitric powder to apply to it
the next morning his mother took him to the chin family next door
still , she thought , she ’ s a girl who ’ s always been submissive and a model of propriety
go in and congratulate the old lady , quick !
xifeng swore at pinger , other people ’ s cats catch mice for them , but mine just steals my chickens !
questioned about the theft , he mentioned zhou rui 's involvement
i ’ m sure i could acquit myself quite creditably in the examinations ; but i have no money in my wallet for travelling expenses and the capital is far away
we ’ ve only just now learned it
'~your elder brother connived with provincial officials to oppress the weak , and allowed his son to organize gambling parties and abduct another man 's wife , who took her own life rather than submit
i don ’ t see this working out , was her verdict
how can you be so stupid ?
let us now return to jia zheng who was escorting the old lady 's coffin south
she was just leaving to do this when they heard daiyu 's voice outside , and baoyu lost no time in inviting her in
censor shih was the first to break the silence
they urged me to join it too !
longed in the wilderness to roam at will
i must find some great occasion to assemble you all again—that would be worth doing
where have you been all this time ?
and on top of all that she has two or three gold bracelets , two pure gold tiaras , and more pearls and jewels than you can count
please come in and take a seat , miss , she invited when she saw who it was
was i telling the truth , or not ?
the lady dowager and lady wang welcomed these guests most warmly
she had started back to rejoin the other girls when a pair of jade-coloured butterflies the size of a circular fan appeared before her
exclaimed the old lady , laughing
with that they all got up and set off for paddy-sweet cottage , baoyu reading the poem on the way
looking round to make sure she asked :
when his father died he would not let his brothers pay a cent of the funeral expenses , but shouldered the whole cost himself
he knew then that this was no ordinary child , so carried him back to his cave and brought him up
she was interrupted by the cry thank goodness !
realizing from this tirade that their master was quite beside himself with rage , they hurried away , feeling constrained to send word to the inner apartments
i have no time , so i recommended you
just choose two lengths to make your little cousin some clothes
look at all the good deeds he has done at the frontier and the number of lives he has saved
she was interrupted at this point by xifeng , who heaved a long sigh
i am the one hoping to learn from them
mind you rest well
xifeng has hallucinations and
only huan was unchanged , and his father could feel no real affection for him
if you ’ ve something good for me , hand it over quickly , i ’ ve other things to attend to
you sent for me , sir , the diviner said to jia rong
one about the end of the tang dynasty and the five dynasties , they replied
i have lost by half a piece !
at least leave us a little face
together they went home and arranged mrs hsun 's funeral
high and low in the ning and rong mansions knew of this , and none of them but deplored it
as soon as the river ’ s crossed you pull down the bridge
that year our mistress came to the capital , master bao fell very ill he lost consciousness for so long that his father was frantic and had all the funeral preparations made
but now that you have passed the examination and become a scholar , you will be able to support the family by teaching
aunt xue had been so delighted to hear of xianglian ’ s betrothal to third sister that she had decided to buy and furnish a house for him , prepare the bride ’ s trousseau and then choose an auspicious day for the wedding to express her gratitude to him for saving her son ’ s life
did he manage to write the couplets ?
a word with you
and finally he collapsed in a fit of delirium
they drink and gamble whenever they have the chance , sleeping during the day so as to play cards at night
are the others all dead ?
then the actor took his list away
by nature fair as an orchid ,
to roam alone in coir cape and bamboo hat ,
she had to get up twice just before dawn , which left her tired out this morning
we still have to buy our own with those two taels
but in what way are you precious ?
alarmed and scandalized , jia zheng summoned baoyu , who hurried in without knowing why he was wanted
pinger inclined her head and accepted it
a young maid put the dice-pot before yuanyang , who did as she was
as baoyu was finely-featured and as the thick foliage screened all but the top of his face , she took him for a maid
she happened to come in at that moment with two dishes
if she takes it regularly every day , after two or three years her health should be much better
the attendants had simply observed him look into the mirror , let it fall and then open his eyes and pick it up again
i have lost track of all these ladies and mistresses
all right then , i ’ ll see to this
presently they reached the rong mansion and found all its gates , too , open right up to the main hall
but they took the money , protested madam you
that 's natural , said chi
instead of helping you , i should just be a burden to you , and that would make me unhappy
the runners came back and reported : none of the stewards are there
we may fill a page with sorrow and self-pity ,
you should see what i ’ m wearing underneath , chuckled xiangyun
since you dare hold people up , you must know some of the military arts , said kuo after eating
the lady dowager and other women were sobbing too bitterly to make any reply
and miss baoqin as well
when questioned , explained her threat made in fun of going back to suzhou
marvelling , he had to turn back
baoyu ordered them to fetch the silver medicine-pot and brew the decoction over the brazier
no sooner had they buried the blossom than xiren appeared
he told the other servants to search with their lanterns , but all they found on the ground were a few empty cases which he asked them to put away while he himself went to the mistresses ' quarters
they say these are things the master bought for himself , not included in the bill of goods
no , said chin tung−yeh
upon reaching the library door , he saw tu shao−ching sitting there with a guest
who are the honourable guests you said were coming today ?
but let us return to baoyu , who felt so lackadaisical after jia yun left that he curled up as if for a nap
you ’ d better not go in till they ’ ve finished
the others all urged him to go out to question his page , and stepped into the corridor themselves to listen
there ’ s no danger of the two young people meeting , and it shouldn ’ t worry you if she sees aunt xue and the two cousins of the other family every day
delighted to hear that an official would be calling at their house , his uncles consented readily
he protested , but the heart isn ’ t anywhere near the ribs
and xia jingui observing this tried to control him more strictly step by step
this is good enough
i have got a good job for you — but you must not forget to thank me for it !
although i have eyes , he exclaimed , i have failed to see mount tai !
have pity , heaven , on a pious woman !
do let me stay with you , madam !
marshal ping triumphs at green maple city a few hundred yards from here , the old woman told the abbot , is a hill called bright moon ridge
i must insist that you come to my house tomorrow
chi wei−hsiao clapped his hands
baoyu lit the incense , bowed , poured libations and burned sacrificial paper , then went to do obeisance in the clan temple and the ancestral hall in the ning mansion
in the fields spring leeks are green ;
you are wrong there , your honour , said tang
for example , how did i get here , when i ’ m a southerner ?
but first i must warn you that the wooden cups aren ’ t like porcelain ones ; they come in a set , and you must drink from every cup in the set
she wanted to summon zhuier then and there
if you open it there , you will have no difficulty in finding him
she should have come , but we have no one to keep an eye on things at home , so she has to stay in , aunt xue explained
what is it that ’ s so urgent ?
he is on the boat and will not be coming into the city since he is leaving in a few days
it was so as to make us laugh
where did i put that new brush the other day ?
now that we relatives have met , you must not leave with nothing to show for your visit
if you keep sitting up you may catch cold
while talking she had slowly finished the wine and now she started examining the cup
before new year i heard the old lady say she wanted to engage miss baoqin to you
if you go to the board , they ’ ll fleece you
where were you all the time ?
of course i know him
falling like drops of blood on each bare bough
if you will just pass me the bowl , you can report back so much the sooner and have your own meal
fang stood up too
you are better off without them
jia lian was very put out when he heard this
he went to talk the business over with lin zhixiao , then sent people to negotiate and finally hushed the matter up by paying two hundred taels
the overawed boatmen did their best to please these important passengers , and the journey passed without incident
i will return the indictment to huan−cheng , and he can do what he likes with it
don ’ t let on a word about this when you go home
jia lian and xifeng were having their meal together when this summons arrived
by this time the opera was over
the old lady was under the influence of wine , and in the still night , under the bright moon , the plaintive music touched her heart and she could not hold hack her tears
it ca not count as disclosing any secret , as this was fated
no matter how angry you are , miss , do think of your health !
if we dismiss her , i am afraid she will be unwilling , or threaten to kill herself ; but i doubt whether my husband would agree to keeping her
after being told off by sheyue , this woman was afraid that she might not be allowed to remain in charge of fangguan , and that would be very much to her disadvantage
caiping went out to usher in yuanyang , who had brought a young maid carrying a small yellow silk bundle
that provoked our old ancestress into baiting me
powers of darkness derange the inmates
he 's even done me out of my rent !
of course nobody brings her anything ; but even if they did , she ’ d only send presents to those who have power and big face
you can ’ t get by if i don ’ t curse you every other day !
only lady wang and baochai behaved as if this were a separation for lifetheir tears coursed down and they nearly burst out sobbing as baoyu , laughing like a maniac , went out
he found the lodge there quiet and deserted , with only a few old women in charge of the place at night
what has your grand-aunt come for ?
– the crowd roared with laughter and dispersed
after this she asked mrs zhou to convey xifeng ’ s thanks to aunt xue
tell li gui that i ’ m going to call on the prince of beijing , and that he must stop anyone going out to look for me
we had wine ready in the evening , but you did not come
she can put up with poverty , and wealth wouldn ’ t spoil her either
her dressing−table and embroidery−stand were stacked with essays , and every day she annotated and punctuated a few
it ’ s outrageous to make a scene here
we were waiting here on tenterhooks while you had a good time , she said reproachfully
what friends has mr chu ?
what do you intend to do now ?
tears of distress welled up in qingwen 's eyes
xifeng was anxious for news of her husband but had not liked to question zhaoer too closely in the presence of others
may i ask your honourable age ?
thank you , said tu
i went home at the end of last year and stopped here on my way back to the capital to look up an old friend
do not accuse this flower of ignorance—
pinger hetd her up and called for help to carry her back to her room , where they laid her gently on her bed and ordered hongyu to give her a drink of warm water
his grandmother assured him
cousin xue would never do such a thing !
peach-blossom , trampled , stains the ground with red
though they may be poor they ’ re the same as our own young ladies , so you must look after them well
some day when you have time , you can listen to us using his name to the old lady and lady wang ; then you ’ ll understand
ordered by jia lian to ascertain what had been left by the thieves , all they could find were some clothes , some lengths of silk and a money-box everything else had gone
i knew it wouldn ’ t rise
pinger had just scooped out the yellow flesh of a crab , and at this gibe she aimed it at hupo 's face , laughing
he was the only son i had left
the two brothers listened with grave respect , then bowed to him ; and the old man took their hands to escort them outside the front gate
do you think somebody offended her ?
i would like you , father , to go home and tell my mother , and ask her to come so that i can say goodbye to her
without venturing to answer , the nuns left
silver is nothing to him
overjoyed at being received , he hastened in and greeted her effusively , beaming with smiles
over a month later , when his money was finished , during one of his strolls he ran into a man at the end of his lane who bowed to him
as the lad greeted him , tu took him by the arm and looked him over
the selection of two words for the tablet is easy , said his father
let them carry me in now in this sedan−chair and we will see how he treats me
you don ’ t understand , baoyu sighed
so i ’ m very glad you came
there 's another thing i wanted to say , sir
i know these must be wooden bowls that the children use
if you are a scholar , cried the comptroller angrily , how dare you get so disgustingly drunk at night ?
yesterday your uncle told me you would already approached him
at first sight i saw nothing wrong , she said
what are you doing here ? asked mrs zhou
aren ’ t you tired after the last few days ?
they found that , although badly bruised on both face and body , he had broken on bones
it depends half on what one can do for him half on his own fate
we need money ourselves as well
but pounding the table and banging the bench she rounded on him tearfully
there ’ s no fun in hurried visits every day
fetch a dice-bowl and throw the dice in turn , starting with baoqin
sister xiren sent me to fetch you , and for fear you wouldn ’ t come i made that up
i am looking for her too , was the answer
by the time the period of mourning was completed , chu hsien−fu 's eldest son was four ; and every day his wife taught the child to read the four books and paku essays , while the young man stood by giving advice
mrs zhou greeted her with a smile as she entered and said , madam xue asked me to bring you these flowers to wear
take the two of us for instance
jia she and the rest prostrated themselves on the ground
so how could you , young as you are and junior in status , possibly cope with these people ?
it ’ s not even enough for the two fixed meals , so how can it be stretched to cover extras ordered by you girls ?
when mrs zhou had taken them to the east room , xifeng called her back to hear what lady wang had said
they are small and far from the court ; it can not be very convenient for you to live here
they were given my brother by lord zhen , she faltered
but my patron charged me personally to get this man , and if i fail to produce him , mr wei will think me incompetent
today , however , he was pleased because baoyu looked as if he had really recovered
once the gates on both sides are locked , no one can come through
seeing her so adamant he reddened and said , in that case , aunt , i ’ ll look for something more acceptable to show my respect
if you ’ re so powerful , why not strangle me ?
by this time there was less terrorism , but the threat of it still remained
everyone loves roses , they ’ re so red and fragrant
they did not part until the third watch , when shiyin saw his friend off and returned to his room to sleep until the sun was high in the sky
the maids opened second sister ’ s door then
so tell me honestly what you ’ ve come here for
mr shen accepted the post
i have come to see you home , sixth master , he said
if you won ’ t agree to coming back with me , i ’ ll gladly move out to live with you here and wait on you like a younger sister
for over a fortnight , she wailed , you ’ ve monopolized my baochan and won ’ t let her come to my room , leaving me only qiuling to sleep with me
he himself sat at the lower end of the table , and the two prostitutes one on each side
after the younger sister came for news , as she was free that evening she went to enlist ha zheng ’ s help
no clank from their armour in the chilly night
we have only women at home
as soon as old pu reached home , all sorts of tradesmen came to demand payment , and he promised them they should have their money
now this merchant wants
i am in charge of a small company here , said ting−hsi after greeting the young gentlemen
this is no laughing matter , said li wan in desperation
you ’ ve got quite enough face , so stop nagging now
i tried not only weavers and the best tailors but embroiders and sewing-women too , she said
his knowledge of the first half of mencius was so sketchy that if suddenly give one sentence from it he would be unable to recite what followed , and the whole of the second half had slipped his mind
a white jade bed ,
after drinking the tea and finishing his meal , he hurried to the market−place and spent what remained of his travelling money on a pig 's trotter for his father to eat that evening
its body is square ,
so she replied very frankly , treating xifeng as a trusted friend
then he declares that this cow is his father and goes crying to the owner to ask to have it given him ; and when he gets it he sells it
aunt xue had the seat of honour , the others sitting down in a row on each side according to their ages and the seniority of their family branch
and he grumbled , 'if i would known all the trouble involved , i would have left it alone
as the nurse shook her head , from xifeng ’ s room came the sound of laughter and jia lian ’ s voice
third sister was in fact a born eccentric
when baoyu was born with jade in his mouth , i knew it was uncanny and
what will people think ?
in vales below a single gibbon calls
then , pointing to an old man who was better dressed than most : not to mention others , mr hsun alone sent you fifty catties of oil on new year 's eve
only at the end of the road does one think of turning on to the right track
if we ’ d drunk to our full capacity , it wouldn ’ t seem such fun looking back
let me write out the numbers , proposed baochai
that unicorn i got the other day
did you take me for a fool who wouldn ’ t know ?
of course i know that two men who pass under one examiner are called fellow−candidates
hearing this , chuang returned dr yu 's call
what a fine kite , remarked the other maids
if yung lo had not stirred up this dynasty , but left the government in the hands of that weakling chien wen , the empire would now be as weak as in the time of the six dynasties
this second beast was completely white , had a single horn , eyes like huge red lanterns , and held itself erect as it bounded forward
his office is not a lucrative one , they answered
there they found the other girls assembled , most of them in red capes of wool or satin
so that 's why it 's called happy red court , he thought
those used to eight maids can make do with six , those used to four with two
these three books have kept me so busy , i have had no time to teach
inhibited by xinger ’ s presence , third sister just lowered her head and went on cracking melon-seeds
then she made the red velvet pompon , the size of a walnut , bob up in front
my uncle has gone to nanking to sell silk , and i am going there now to accompany him back
the magistrate at once ordered them to be changed for a porcelain cup and ivory chopsticks ; but still fan chin would not eat
i can not leave you !
he wore a square cap and light gown of azure gauze , his beard was sparse and his complexion sallow
so after listening for a while outside the window , she entered the room with a smile
why play all these silly tricks ?
she can not forget her sorrows new and old ;
then second master felt safe enough to go boldly ahead
it 's best not to drink -- much better than landing in trouble through drinking like your cousin , so that when you take a wife she becomes a lonely grass widow like me , poor thing !
she burst out laughing
because the brewer 's family was not here , he had hired two big−footed country−women , and was carrying on with both of them
number cures mysterious diseases
she told yingchun , the mistress says siqi has grown up and her mother keeps coming to ask to have her back , so her ladyship ’ s giving her back to be married off
this is my cousin yu yu−ta , said tu
it 's your second uncle 's birthday he 's celebrating - did you know that ?
what 's so marvellous about running a little errand ?
by the tomb of flowers
tinghsi hired a donkey , and trotted along beside the chair
she told him then exactly what to say
if senior licentiate yen does not wish his son to be adopted , she may choose somebody else to adopt
since tsang was not a heavy drinker , by the afternoon he was sick and had to be helped home
what a great act of imperial kindness !
did you really put in a word for me ?
sit down , they urged
he does not use these chopsticks either , said mr chang
my cousin ’ s conversation is so illuminating , i could never tire of listening , he told her
as one and all said this , xifeng too accepted this interpretation
the trouble is that this examiner is very strict : we shall have to think out a new way
i suggest that , starting tomorrow , you ’ d better put aside all other business and concentrate on writing a few sheets every day to make up
presently tea was served , after which mr tsung left , while chi remained behind to chat
you ’ re so easy to scare , yet still you indulge in talking such nonsense , she teased
take it back at once to buy a few mouthfuls of food !
goes back to jinling
ah , such a thing only happens once in a thousand years , declared nanny zhao
asked the lady dowager
take , for example , the poems on wang zhaojun , all expressing different opinions
and four country fellows carried this lopsidedly along , without any retinue
surely you who understand me must sympathize with me ?
i can give you enough money for the journey
i have to go to the capital for audience with the emperor , so i will see you off to nanking first
excuse me , he blurted out
old as you are , you have no sense , she scolded
and his eye fell on a rectangular marble jardiniere in the alcove in which were arranged some single-petalled narcissi and rocks
i will send a maid to fetch it , daiyu promised
let us return to baoyu
he pleaded with her until she consented to wear it
her mind made up , she locked up her ramshackle cottage and asked the neighbours to keep an eye on it , after which she and her nephew took a boat to wuhu and found their way to sweet dew temple by floating bridge
daiyu tossed her head
one of the men asked , why isn ’ t brother liu here today ?
i don ’ t like putting you to so much trouble , objected jia zhen
whiskers mao saw the game was up , and had to come out
if they have any business they should tell you , madam
then here ’ s another passage for you to expound
now i have been sworn at all the same just for doing as i was told !
but what am ito say to the old lady ?
how can you leave it at that ?
the young man nodded , then raised his cup to drink
of titbits on the rocks
so now she had mentioned this request to fangguan , asking her to pass it on to baoyu
second master had two , but within half a year of her arrival she picked fault with them and sent them both packing
this done , he rushed back , seized his sister−in−law and showed her the way out , then carried his mother out too
having alighted in front of the main hall , he mounted the steps with a beaming smile and , facing south , announced :
xifeng agreed and went back to her apartments
as a result they ’ re worse than anyone else when it comes to making trouble , setting their mistresses against each other and covering up the faults of their favourites
you ’ re all wrong , declared baoyu , who had been chuckling to himself for a while
the judicial commissioner , of equal status , was the provincial judge and supervised the postal service
if you stand on your dignity , how dare i take liberties ?
i could hardly defy them could i ?
when lady wang rose to leave , she went out with her
they bowed to chuang shao−kuang and sat down
it was a maid picking flowers
when he saw her turn into palace pool , he wondered who she could be
baoyu told her , i am going now , cousin
i saw her coffin , it 's true , but who knows whether she was in it or not ?
let ’ s have something quieter
it was no other than jia yun
now they ’ ve sent to fetch you back , and the wedding will probably take place as soon as you get home
very good , said li wan
he heaved a long sigh , and turned his face to the wall
he ’ s nothing but a source of trouble
so it ’ s just as well she ’ s had it
after the meal , wine was served and dr chao proposed : we have a good gathering today : we must have some poems
baochai next read out the petition :
all i can do is eat pap , sleep , or amuse myself for a while with these grandchildren when i am bored
for what reason , may i ask ?
just then the gate−keeper came in to announce : dr
and when pure ginseng was prescribed this was beyond jia dairu ’ s means : he had to ask for help from the rong mansion
why should a man like that have all the luck ?
at last there was nothing for it but to adopt a son and find a child bride for him
no love is greater than that between the sexes , replied chi
the next day they requisitioned a large junk , and whiskers
his stupefied silence -- so unlike baoyu -- exasperated jia zheng , who had not to begin with been angry
baochai urged her to be of good comfort and called to the servants in the outer room , quickly go with master ke to deal with this business
it ’ s grown cold , daiyu told her
it ’ s all the fault of that upstart jia yucun the bastard deserves to starve to death !
raving been in the mansion all through baoyu 's illness , jia yun remembered most of the people of any importance there and knew that this was no other than xiren , who enjoyed a special status in happy red court
first i thought it was a cat chasing rats , but then i heard a sound like someone sighing
i may as well take some capital and travel around with zhang dehui for a year
more exasperated than ever baoyu cried , what are you talking about ?
very well , said lady wang on second thoughts
chuckled daiyu , tugging at baoqin ’ s sleeve
it 's not every day that you can see a head changed to water
then the same ceremony was repeated , chuang shao−kuang as second master of sacrifice , and different men bearing offerings
otherwise i would have heard
taste them and see , says hsiao
after a brief chat she urged him to go back and rest , and baoyu took her advice , being eager to question fangguan
when i was bought , it was to serve the old lady ; that ’ s why miss baochai gave me this name
the other scholars urged wang to join the feast , declaring that by bringing up such a virtuous daughter he had reflected glory on his clan
peeping through the lattice-work , he saw a girl crouching below the flowers and weeping all alone as she scratched the ground with a hairpin
it ’ s because aunt xue saw she ’ s not only pretty but really well-behaved , being even gentler and quieter than most young ladies , that she went to all the trouble of inviting guests to a feast to make her his concubine in proper style
if it ’ s not enough ask for some more
about how long can i take ?
mrs lin went off on this errand
suppose you cold-shoulder her but she befriends you ?
you ’ re right , agreed the lady dowager
raising his eyes , kuo saw an extraordinary creature squatting on the hillside in front
it will take me at least ten years to become a senior licentiate
then , uncertain whether this was real silver or not , he went to bed
so old , yet so hale and hearty !
if we ’ re sitting or lying about when he turns up , and we pay no attention to him , he never ticks us off
how can you let them have their own way ?
with his face fair as jade , his eyes bright as stars , he was truly a handsome figure
you don ’ t understand , she explained to the fairies
'since she immolated herself she ca not be treated as a bondmaid , he said
fancy you remembering so clearly , madam , the exact case and box it was in after all these years !
one expects a boy to be mischievous , but this extraordinary liking he has for maids has been preying on my mind
let me see it
just now sister sheyue brought us two plates of cakes
xifeng questions a page boy
baochai who had come up behind her chimed in , do make it up , both of you , for baoyu ’ s sake
we mustn ’ t send away the little buddhists and taoists , because they ’ ll be needed next time her highness comes , and it would be hard to get them together again if once they ’ d been dispersed
the older women intervened , enough of that , you two
if you don ’ t behave properly as a loyal servant of the state to be worthy of your masters ’ kindness , heaven and earth will surely condemn you
why not let the kitchen do it ?
she imagined his new wife would protect her and share her responsibilities , enabling her to lead a quieter life
then , too restless to stay with them he started fooling around outside , but still went on feeling disgruntled and frustrated
father sent me to fetch her
that 's too bad , he cried
we ’ d better go somewhere within easy distance so that it wouldn ’ t take long to come back
if we are afraid of mobilizing our forces , we should not feed so many idle men !
the old man was very pleased
she blushed but did not answer , simply putting the sweetmeats back into the hamper , which she then took away
i will go now and discuss this with her
i don ’ t usually feel there are too few of us , yet tonight i do , observed the old lady
the following year when the willows burst into leaf and the peach and apricot trees blossomed , hsiao rode out with mu nai to enjoy the spring
xifeng , as it so happened , needed some festival gifts and had been thinking of buying some spices and aromatic herbs
abject apologies , is it ?
the girl 's worry : her boudoir in the tower is blown down
kuang chao−jen dared not miss this opportunity
you shift the blame for not lending your things to us , to stop her complaining about you
presently it was reported that he was out paying a call
remembering what had been said the previous day , baoyu sent for his outdoor clothes and waited for them in the library
what does it matter between cousins ?
as they walked on they were greeted by xiangyun , pinger and xiangling , who had been picking balsam by some rocks and now left the garden with them
but how dared they tell her the truth ?
you can tell me when i come back
what should his punishment be ?
mr yu was wearing a square cap , an old sapphire−blue gown , and crimson slippers
besides , the prime minister has served so many times as chief examiner that he has innumerable members of the han lin academy as his pupils
we were chatting in cousin lin ’ s place in the garden , she answered
mine did not amount to much , daiyu observed
aunty , you used to be so fond of me , how is it that now you have forgotten me completely ?
whom were you going to propose ?
presently they all had a meal there and made merry with the old lady
congratulations on your return home , uncle , said hsiao
xifeng broke into a cold sweat
the fact is that baochai 's knowledge of her brother had led her to suspect that he was behind the visit of the prince 's chief steward , and xiren 's report confirmed her suspicion
still , there isn ’ t much she can do , she simply sticks to the old ways , not throwing her weight about like madam lian to show how smart she is
my name is chi
calling in the secretary , he bade him appropriate some of the salt tax to pay the merchant , accept tsin chueh 's offer to act as guarantor , and release licentiate yang immediately — there was no need to bring in a verdict
yuanyang left the side gate still blushing , in a flutter after this shock
you ’ ve made a mistake , they cried
still , this will not prove too serious
when we told the carters to drive on , some runners beat them up and made off with our two carts
as my daughter 's daughter you are dear to me ; but baoyu is closer to me even than you
that evening when mrs pao 's son−in−law kuei came back , she told him all she had heard , and asked him to make further inquiries
this was the form taken by the stupid stone from the foot of blue ridge peak in great waste mountain
in addition , jia zhen installed his own servant bao er and his wife there to wait on second sister after she moved in
the maids in the different lodges in the garden had heard of their arrival and summons to the palace , but did not know the real facts of the case
he immediately called for fresh tea and refreshments
if they court death in a fit of temper , is that necessary too ?
as she was busy during the festival she let things slide for a couple of days , but now she had come to inspect all the maids in the garden , not only to dismiss qingwen , but also because it had reached her ears that as baoyu was growing up , his maids who were hussies were teaching him bad ways
ting−hsi fell weeping to the ground , and ah−san had to help him up
even if you make her smash it , this is no job for you
only then did he remember that the green sash belonged to xiren and he should never have given it away
both those poems were original , not mere plagiarizing
he gazed abstractedly at the magnificent hall which he had certainly never seen in the garden , and halted to look up at the inscription enlightenment for the infatuated
by now jia she and jia zhen were also back and , meeting again , they described their experiences since parting
never mind , said madam you
and when this was eaten she told them , sit down and go on with your meal
as they filled their cups daiyu remarked to tanchun , you ’ re the apricot-blossom destined to have a noble husband
but what makes me angry is his lack of guts
an evening banquet is held on the feast
since when have you been so attentive ?
in that way he was just able to make ends meet
you can keep your end up with us , but what happens when you cross swords with daiyu ?
a salaried licentiate is a scholar , and all he has done is to use some money belonging to a salt merchant ; yet they want to deprive him of his rank and penalize him
there stood jia qiang , a taper in his hand
on his return to offer thanks , the prince spoke to him kindly again and suddenly remarked with a smile :
when false is taken for true , true becomes false ;
how long have you been a friend of brigade general miao ?
such a force would find expression in human dignity , in the upholding of ideals of justice and truth , in the love of life and creation
i agree , he replied
i know what to say when i am interrogated
occupied by these reflections he reached home , where ni er 's wife and daughter were waiting for him
have there been any poetry meetings ?
i will tell you why i sent for you , said jia zheng
i doubt if this merchant appreciates such seclusion , she thought
knowing the old lady ’ s partiality for lively shows and sweet , pappy food , baochai gave these as her own preferences , adding even more to the lady dowager ’ s pleasure
they did not suspect that there was anything behind this ; but when the prior opened the double door at the back and invited them to walk through , they came out upon a great plot of level ground , as high as any house , which had an excellent view on all sides
baoyu was doing his lessons when a wind sprang up , buffeting the window paper
he announced , tomorrow is the feast of winter gruel when all men on earth will be cooking their sweet gruel
what ’ s the row about ?
why did not you bring her a couple of red cornelian rings like those you sent over the other day ?
he went out at dawn to the east market to fetch pigs , and he ca not have come back yet
but as we ca not leave the coffin we entrusted them to you
but master bao had better wait till the charcoal is red before going there
i ’ m always hearing how good your plasters are , remarked baoyu
well , i do not blame you , she said
only faint moonlight falls on the lonely blind
that casing 's made of pigs ' guts !
you mustn ’ t take nanny li so seriously
chuang went out to meet him in civilian dress , and tea was served
suddenly his way was barred by a sword and he was ordered to halt
last time he was here he betrothed her to academician mei ’ s son ; but the year after that he died
duke ping of lu wanted to meet mencius , but chang tsang dissuaded him
he gave tsang chi a sheep and wine , and told him to go and rest
the master trusts you , mr li , said the others
since you ’ re unwilling , said pinger , i ’ ll tell you an easy way to fob him off
yuanyang continued , on the right wouldouble aces ' are found
don ’ t risk your little life like this , child !
they made yuanyang drink a cup and toss to see who should start ,
mr chi lent the young couple a room , and at the end of the honeymoon yu went back to his post
but now that there are two of you , next time you ’ re beaten for raising a rumpus you can run away to nanjing to find your double
because that kind of talk would get him nowhere : nobody would give him an official position
it was clear to her that he must have heard some gossip in the jia mansions which led him to believe her a shameless wanton , not fit to be his wife
xiren hastily picked up the pieces
this order given , jia zheng dismissed the stewards
tanchun put in , and what about the lady of the alpinia ?
but it would be worth dying , even with nothing to show for my life , provided i would won their hearts
there is really no danger , madam , i give you my word
as roaming wild the damsel fair i sought
he , too , wanted to bare his heart to her to console her , yet he feared this might offend her and make her illness worse
wang hui fell to , without inviting chou chin to join him ; and when wang hui had finished , the monk sent up the teacher 's rice with one dish of cabbage and a jug of hot water
pin−niang sprang up and opened a drawer from which she took a packet of powdered sandalwood and poured it into the basin
after new year i shall tell your second uncle lian to dismiss you
whenever the kitty is full , you can pocket the cash and let them start again
then she kowtowed , pleading , your honour , avenge me !
i should have held my tongue
today , as he has no time to look into this scandal , he ’ s told me to report it to you , madam , to do as you think fit
the censors have investigated the business by the coast and discovered a deficit during your elder uncle 's term of office
set your mind at rest , sir , replied hsiao with a smile
today he was looking forward to a visit from her , when the arrival of a xue family servant convinced him that here was another gift for him
one day a letter arrived from xue pan
bring huang chiu here and we will talk it over
you should let me pay my respects
i ’ m too tired to tell you
what more do you want me to say , except that you ’ re straight and i was wrong ?
if we start it again now in spring when everything burgeons , it ’ s bound to come to life
i ’ m not a ghost , snapped xifeng
yet autumn moon and spring flowers are soon abandoned ,
baoyu , a whole lot of things happened to make it slip my mind
for some time now he 's been asking me to find him a good wife , but i could not think of anyone suitable except yourself
i raised troops in chiangnan and was known as the prince of chuyang ; but now , because i hold nanking , i am called the prince of wu
i ’ d better keep out of his way
has he gone himself ?
recently , they say , it 's gone from bad to worse and her in-laws wo not let her come home
swallowing her anger , she started out with her daughter
tell me who ’ s dared to offend you
baochai , not knowing the reason , thought he was scoffing at her to show disapproval and therefore paid no attention
it would be all right in the old lady 's place , but all sorts of people go to her ladyship 's rooms
why xueyan and not zijuan ?
they left after calling zijuan to attend to her young mistress
i shall use three dominoes , announced yuanyang
that ’ s just it , she replied
since she hasn ’ t invited us this time , only
and you must present an account at the end of the year
a white silk belt from the heavenly loom is broken
i imagine you ’ ll be needing other things too , so why not go on another couple of ii to river goddess convent ?
these had come as tribute from different parts of the country , and although not very large they were most ingeniously made in different colours , ornamented with scenes from stories and fitted with all kinds of fire-crackers
may i know your honourable name and place of origin , so that i can tell them who you are ?
not one of your relatives will call on him
in future you will be responsible for this whole household
she wrapped up the cape and told an old serving-woman to take it out
once seated inside , they questioned him and xiren had to prompt him each time with an answer
do you know what those wafers were made of ?
jia xing , jia zhi and some others had ranged themselves in due order all the way from the inner ceremonial gate to the terrace by the verandah of the main hall , where stood jia jing and jia she outside the palisade , while the ladies stood inside
i shall brazen it out somehow in my shameless way
what do you think of this , madam ?
one flute played in the distance will be enough
baoyu insisted , it does not matter , if only you are clear-headed
so her dreams of future honour and splendour had gone up in smoke !
please remain seated , sir , while i clear up my things
they want you to go home to send off the heralds
feng is a champion of justice , he said
when over a month had passed , the lou brothers could not help feeling somewhat astonished
apart from incense and candles , a few catties of oil every day for the big lamp
each year by strict economy yoo saved a few more taels , then summoned brokers to ask the price of a plot of land or a house
i am not saying this as a compliment to aunt xue , but the truth is that none of our four girls can stand comparison with baochai
so that ’ s who she is !
xiangling had no choice but to carry her bedding over
stupidity and ignorance are characteristic of these men set on official careers
it was a hot day and the brothers began to be worried
do , do arrange it !
so you have such a treat without telling me !
and who knows what will have become of our family by the time he grows up ?
all you can do is to disparage other people
go and rest now , there 's a good boy !
she means well anyway , remarked sheyue as she started to lay the table
it isn ’ t easy for her
it 's bad enough your family cooping us up here to learn that old trash , she retorted
she may very well come here
though she did not hear everything , she caught the main gist and felt as if plunged into a raging sea
where did you see it ?
i ’ ll wait for you here
how could i know ?
no house but has its windows opened wide
all the ladies of the house called daily to ask after the old lady 's illness
then he overheard several passers-by in the street saying that an imperial concubine had died , and the emperor had suspended court for three days
and as xiren now turned her back on him and went in , he had to leave dejectedly with chuyao
i heard a customer call for wine , and soon after that someone cried , confound it !
no , you must go to my home
i must drink a big cup as a forfeit for forgetting
as her father just said , she 's a lady now
then she asked baoyu where he had come from
you come over so seldom , protested madam you , i do hope you ’ ll stay a bit longer
he unwound his puttees , and fastened himself to the tree
ma saw that he was wearing a worn cap and thin , threadbare gown
afterwards , however , although he still longed for xifeng , he steered clear of the rong mansion
if your ladyship tries to force me , i ’ ll kill myself rather than marry
besides i hope you won ’ t mind my saying this you country folk aren ’ t so well off , and a name given by someone poor like you should act as a counterbalance
i will tell the mistress you have reached the age to be sent home
hsiao and his friends reeled back to their lodgings as if in a dream
it ’ s only right to worry about one ’ s health , replied baochai
fan usually stands in awe of , said the herald
in that case , may i call to tell her my story ?
daiyu had been annoyed at first by baoyu ’ s immoderate language
it 's too late today , wu shu , said tu
turning round she saw xichun standing there and asked , why are you so thin , fourth sister ?
jia qiang was as intelligent as he was handsome , but he attended the school only as a blind for his visits to cock-fights , dog-races and brothels
our fortune−telling is nothing but a trick , sir , said ting
but since jia zhen had other ends in view , alleging the need to relax after their exertions he soon started arranging card games in the evenings and they laid wagers while drinking
inside , they heard the strings being returned
by this time , tsai−ping had married and shuang−hung was the only maid left to accompany the bride
her parents are dead now and she only has two old nurses and one maid to look after her
give me your programme , quick !
as for passing the provincial or metropolitan examinations , since i have never passed myself i may not be the best teacher
what is this gentleman 's name ?
let 's both go to the library now
that is why i have called today
yes , lord zhen is too short-sighted , said pinger
she told caiyun , fetch those bottles of juice which were brought the other day
kuang chao−jen was aghast
instead of answering , he merely took the bowl from her , putting it down again after one sip
for all we know , she may have been an immortal
chih heng−shan called upon the master of sacrifice , dr yu , and the second master , chuang shao−kuang
they quickly told her the rhymes
niu pu dared not go in , but the old monk caught sight of him
they hunted around for hours , even turning out cases and crates — but all in vain
as xiangling protested her innocence aunt xue came running over to stop her son
then you two must help the two nuns to pick some buddhist beans for me
i ’ m just telling you so that you ’ ll be on your guard
if you would told me earlier , this little business would not have taken so long
i treat you so well that you have lost all sense of respect
i will keep an eye on everything here for you , and see that your mother is all right
never mind , said baoyu
if he understood the meaning of 'careful study , he would be a high official !
his jaw dropped and he gaped in consternation
when they agreed to this arrangement , he sent word to lady xing and reported the proposal to lady wang
he has another good subject for poetry
please read the decree , your highness , then we can start the search
when she emerged the wine had gone to her head , and squatting so long had left the old creature too dizzy to remember the way she had come
just think , madam , the reason why buddhist sacrifices have been made throughout the centuries is because they have proved efficacious in safeguarding the country and enriching the people -- that 's why men believe in them
tell her to send for some more water to wash her hair
in that case , why are some people so red in the face ?
you might send her a couple of dishes
however , his grandmother was afraid that he might get over-heated there or catch cold , and that the place might upset him ; for though daiyu 's coffin had been deposited in a nunnery outside town , the sight of bamboo lodge might bring back his earlier grief for its dead mistress
if a gentleman like you , uncle , wants her as a secondary wife , i guarantee both her mother and my father will be willing
but let them clap their hands and jeer by the roadside
we have just come back after giving an allnight performance
you ’ ll make yourself ill if you sleep on this damp bench
we would have come before this to pay our respects to the mistress and to you , miss , but we have been very busy on the farm
you can have your say about it some other time
i came first in the first rank again
yet you were in such a hurry to get away
and this she held up a bundle of tibetan incense is for you to light while copying
together : the cherries ripen nine times in all
i have not seen you for a long time !
on the morning of the fourth day baoyu opened his eyes
xifeng spat in disgust
once through the archway they came to a palace gate , on its lintel the inscnption fortune for the good , calamity for the licentious
since my father died early i was brought up by my grandfather and occupied with family business : i had no time to study for the civil service
madam you and the others all came to meet them
she would make fun of me if she saw
before he could give this order , jia lian came in and paid his respects
your trouble is that your father gave you such a soft time of it when you were young that you ’ re a bad manager
tanchun , having decided earlier on that she could not compete , had been writing down their lines
and even senior licentiate yen when he comes back will have nothing to say
jia lian outside had also intimidated the son so that he was only too willing to go to the board of punishments to sign a statement that no inquest was needed as the cause of death was clear and to promise not to bring any suit later on
fragrant herbs and aromatic pine and cedar-wood were burning in the brazier
we ’ ll redeem it without fail
i was just whiling away the time to stop you from felling sleepy
jia zhen watched till the distribution of goods was finished , then returned to his rooms to dine with his wife , and the night passed without further incident
it pleaded poverty , and the silver sent was a paltry fifty taels
holding it he thought , i have a faint recollection of this ; it 's too bad that i ca not remember clearly
she died so long ago , what brought her here ?
whiskers thanked him and took the silver
by now mingyan had grabbed hold of un rong
inquired the old lady
one day prefect hsiang sat down with pao wen−ching in the library
she ’ s got a cape too , yet she ’ s dressed herself up like a saucy little tartar
aloud , he said with a sigh , if i ’ d known that you ’ d be going , i shouldn ’ t have taken you on in the first place
he clung like a limpet to the lady dowager , too terrified to leave her
before playing one must dress fittingly in a loose cape or long robe like the men of old , to be worthy of this instrument of the sage ’ s
what were you discussing ?
whether they call or whether they don ’ t , it ’ s nothing to do with you
baoqin told her maids to fly a big red bat kite
and liu ’ s neighbours when questioned said he had never come back
how could i get someone to pummel my back each time ?
his page mingyan tried to think of some way to distract him and decided that there was only one thing that might appeal to him as a novelty
the lady dowager then reiterated that baoqin , with the plum-blossom in the snow , had looked prettier than a picture
just now mr tu was kind enough to call and invite me to your house ; and now you are so good to me , madam , i feel i am among old friends
first cursed that i angelica should wear ,
her knots of clove and her hibiscus belt
don ’ t talk like that , friend
if i do , i ’ ll have asked for leave all for nothing
now what ’ s to be done ?
see , when spring draws to a close and flowers fall ,
when they had settled their luggage they went to bed
xiren hastily assented and withdrew
i have been waiting outside for sorne time but could not find a soul , and i dared not burst in i was frantic !
you ’ d prefer to be on your own , free to do as you please
much of wu ching−tzu 's humour is indirect : he excels in innuendoes
by this time sixty or seventy people had gathered round to watch ; and out of this crowd stepped a man with big eyes and a few brown hairs on his chin , wearing a military cap and black silk jacket
in the old days , at every festival the nuns would send her presents and the flower−girls would give her little trinkets , while those blind girls who often came to play the three−stringed lyre would not budge from the door
lady wang knew that this presented no difficulty for the xue family , and therefore agreed
i had to leave in too much of a hurry to wait for the double ninth festival , he explained
since you are a cheat yourself , why get so upset ?
the more the merrier
the breeze that softly fans the air is chill
you trouble-maker , she snapped back , gnashing her teeth , this is all your doing
tell me , friend , said ma , do you want to go on studying or to go back to see your father ?
were invitations sent out that you are here in force ?
this room of mine is probably fit for a god , rejoined keqing with a smile
you didn ’ t buy me
nonsense , her husband retorted
and when i asked how she felt , not a word did she say — simply cried
he 's outside the mundane world now and would not have anything to do with us , yucun assured her
at this thought , he felt a pang and could not hold back his tears ; and as they were mourning the lady dowager he did not restrain himself but sobbed aloud
if that 's so , get me a fan to tear up
don ’ t just eat , they scolded
they reached the courtyard as the three servants were squabbling
the concubine then called in a trusted old servant to whom she whispered certain instructions
how old is your nephew ?
i ’ d rather die than go south
the servants brought in four cold dishes and two sets of bowls and chopsticks and moved a table out for the meal
brother , said ni ting−chu , i was in peking when you were adopted by the pao family , so i knew nothing whatever about it
twice a month is enough
all will be well , but you must take precautions
if you ’ re not satisfied , you can complain to mrs lin and ask her to speak to master bao about it
when he heard bao er scrapping with zhou rui he joined in
overwhelmed with shame as i am , i would like to make over to the state my ancestral estate , emoluments and savings
qingwen happened to be unwell that day and had just got up from a nap , feeling out of sorts
presently she made her drink some vinegar soup too , after which xiangyun felt better
the lady dowager had sent to invite all the members of the elan
but at xifeng 's age i outshone her
cold is the green-sleeved girl as she writes a poem ,
since changan was only a hundred li away , within two days the matter was settled
but with the flowing water her beauty has gone ;
where shall i wear them if my head is shaved ?
i will after all the rest of you are gone , retorted qingwen
better , in fact , than some chinese could write
don ’ t worry about that , replied aunt xue
i shall have more free time here , remarked xiangling
regarding this company of yours , i can tell you somebody who can help
the bright moonlight , coloured lanterns , scents and incense evoked an ethereal splendour defying description
what is his rank really ?
if anything should happen to the old lady your marriage might be delayed , or else not turn out in the way you hoped
qin zhong plucked at baoyu ’ s sleeve and whispered , isn ’ t she fun ?
these words made baoyu laugh in spite of himself
so jia zhen responded with a smile , what sort of talk is this among friends ?
today he couldn ’ t go to school , and we ’ re sending for a doctor to prescribe medicine
more recent examples are ni zan , tang yin and zhu yunming
but the maids had gone back to bed after jia lian went out , not expecting him home so quickly , and had therefore not prepared tea ; so what pinger brought him was not freshly brewed
didn ’ t you go too , master bao ?
xiren , hearing this , covered her face and doubled up in a fit of giggles
so let me make a suggestion
the last of the local gentry , tang erh , held a notebook in which he was writing down a record
as soon as mother 's ready we are going to the garden
cried the old woman
a terrible disaster befalls miaoyu
just take it , second brother
here the villagers would come to discuss public business
at sight of yuanyang seated on the kang he halted
wouldn ’ t that be more effective than stealing outright ?
yes , that ’ s right , chuckled the lady dowager , now kneel to your mother and ask her not to feel hurt , but to forgive me for your sake on account of my old age
under the red flag squat the spirits of those the candidate has helped , under the black flag the spirits of those he has wronged
sure enough , at the fifth watch , the miao chieftain led forth a force armed with swords and spears from straight eye cave to slip silently over stone pillar bridge
five hundred strings of newly minted cash were also given as largesse to the cooks , actresses and jugglers
the four sedan-chairs were borne in behind some young eunuchs , while the gentlemen followed on foot
he set six chairs facing each other , and told his wife to light a charcoal brazier and boil a kettle of tea
do take her away quickly
and even though you were robbed it does not matter
in unison they quoted one of the sayings of confucius , and warned her , you must conform to etiquette
the desk was bare except for a rough crackleware vase with some chrysanthemums in it , two sets of books and a tea-service
ladyships because you have not pulled together , making our family look ridiculous
i had better made myself clear in the hope that then we may become close friends
but the two maids in ling 's house had grown jealous
your zijuan is looking for you too
ascribing their visit to the news that the jia family was no longer in trouble , she paid her respects to aunt li and to the old lady , said a few words to her mother , then greeted the li sisters
jia she came over at this point to ask jia zheng if he would be going the next day
a physician of the tsin dynasty , whose books are medical classics
with that , two of the older men led baoyu out
although as members of the prime minister 's house they could never get into serious trouble , the presence of a head dripping with blood on the steps of their inner chamber caused them a little uneasiness
the lady dowager urged her to come again and told yuanyang :
why , i ’ ve been like the frog at the bottom of a well , imagining that our girls here were unmatched ; but now , without searching far afield , here on this very spot i see others who surpass them
abbess pen stepped forward and greeted him
and overjoyed by this , she would not even hear of baoqin staying in the garden the girl was to sleep with her
this was hsia , the new village head for hsueh market
only that a number of brigands captured at the coast have been tried , and during their interrogation they revealed the whereabouts of many more , some of them lying low here in town and looking out for a chance to break into more houses
'all scholars must have self−respect , said dr yu
four other pages , yingchuan , saohua , tiaoyun and banhe , were up on the roof robbing a bird 's nest
soon the first seven days passed , and wang teh and wang jen returned from the provincial examination and came to mourn
now daiyu had discovered xiangyun 's whereabouts and knew that baoyu had hurried back , no doubt to talk about the gold unicorns
i wouldn ’ t dare tell a lie , sir , he exclaimed
if she were going to entertain visitors , she wouldn ’ t bother to set out an incense-burner first ; if she were going to burn incense , she ’ s not in the habit of scenting her clothes with it or having anything in the room except fresh flowers and fruit
and while in office he showed no respect for his superiors but simply tried to please the people , talking nonsense about 'fostering filial piety and brotherly love , and encouraging agriculture
then wagging finger at them all she scolded , you ’ ve really gone too far
zijuan felt constrained to ask xueyan , was it really true what you told me earlier on ?
on her way back with lady wang , they heard weeping in several apartments
then two of the family ’ s bailiffs came in and paid their respects
we don ’ t mean to notify relatives and friends because , as you ’ ve said , all pan ’ s friends are a bad lot and our only relatives are the ha and wang families
they paid for the tea , and went to a big eating−house on three mountains street
countered the old lady , laughing
on the twenty-eighth they would invite the prince consorts , princes , princesses and dukes of the imperial house together with their ladies ; on the twenty-ninth , ministers , military governors and their titled wives ; on the thirtieth , other officials with their titled wives , and relatives close and distant with their wives
your conduct and learning are unparalleled ; and your son in particular is a boy of extraordinary promise—you must bring him up to be an honest man
when swans fly off , crickets chirp , does your heart ache ?
what are you doing here ?
she went without supper that evening
i delivered the silver to the third mr tsang , announced the steward
someone behind them laughed
of course you will get what you need for the jobs you are given
the true root is she of the family ’ s destruction
to know whether she lived or died , read the next chapter
but water the whole world over in the last analysis comes from the same source
unfortunately she died and my son−in−law left home to do business ; but they had a little girl whom i have brought up
zijuan hastily got up and roused xueyan to help daiyu with her toilet
your ’ re the one trying to drag us into this
we ca not just arrange this between the two of us
he took baoyu attentively by the hand
if some future scholar should come across them and publish them for me , my ghost will rest content !
this will be a great act of mercy , and my whole family will for ever remember your ineffable goodness
let him be , said jia zheng
never mind whether it 's true or not
xifeng chuckled , it ’ s a case of talk of the devil
this is the end of my career as a licentiate
so yuanyang and the others kept quiet
though you had a short stay on earth , so deep was my feeling for you that i took careful thought and made detailed inquiries
if i had , i ’ d change it quickly and things would be all right for the time being
and his father , without telling him , had accepted ten taels of silver from old mrs you for cancelling the engagement
now i heard the master quote a classical tag i did not understand it something like 'in mourning , grief counts for more than appearances
they veil my virtue and the evil praise
how could he keep a girl so staunch and bold ?
if these girls think it wrong or there ’ s something i ’ ve omitted , then they can let me know
if i should push myself forward , they ’ d all start cursing me
i am afraid mr chuan may wonder at our presumption , said lou chan
something nice for me ?
just then the feast was spread
but she was not in the group
his mouth watering , he walked into a noodle shop to have a bowl of noodles for sixteen coppers ; then , still hungry , he went to the tea−shop next door and ordered a bowl of tea and two coppers ' worth of dried bamboo shoots which he munched with relish
of course , he could not know this , said chou chi−fu
and as he ’ s seen second aunt , who ’ s already related to our family , marrying her would be better than getting some girl from a family about which we know nothing
by emerald pavilion hangs a mirror of jade ,
those shameless slaves must have egged her on again to do this , using her because she ’ s a fool to get their own back
at sight of qin zhong , baoyu had felt quite eclipsed
once again , the prior could not stop them
i ’ d just taken miss xiangyun some tea when she suddenly disappeared
as he was turning back to the hall he found zhang the taoist standing beside him
he grimaced then hastily covered his mouth
but they ’ re carrying on worse and worse
as he finished his toilet sheyue said , it ’ s cloudy again and looks like snow , you ’ d better wear something woollen
he invited mr wei into the library with the southern exposure
getting slowly out of bed he recalled wuer 's remark during the night that both baochai and xiren were as pretty as goddesses
as for relatives and friends who came in person to invite the jias to a feast or to enjoy a feast given by them , she declined to meet all , making lady wang , lady xing and xifeng entertain the callers for her
he made his wife and mrs yao sit down to a meal with miss shen , then went to the room overlooking the river to find a volume of his own poetry
it will take the masons three months
i ’ m on my way there too
she then instructed zhou rui and lai wang , don ’ t take the presents through the main gate but by that old side-gate in the garden
glaring , he threatened to have him beaten and tortured
you know the ancient saying , put in baoyu
you will feel better once you are out
i saw it with my own eyes
xiren seeing this went out to brew him some tea
at the dead of night when few people are about , thieves may hide themselves there and debauchees and bandits can easily be smuggled in , and then anything could happen !
he smiled and walked in , asking , what are you doing , cousin ?
you wo not let me go , yet pin this thing on me for no reason at all
when the lady dowager had been ensconced here , more furs were spread on both sides and the few other ladies of her generation were invited to sit down
you may leave tomorrow
the examiner will soon be here , and my son wants to take the examination ; but i am afraid the college authorities will say i am an outsider
haven ’ t i enough to put up with , without dragging them in as well ?
and the day after that chang chun−min gave a feast in tu 's house , to which tsang and ting−hsi were also invited
the cooks and waiters had arrived in good time , and so had the actors , with their chest of costumes and stage properties
besides , how could i bring that up when it was our old ancestress aunty came to see ?
no more , said mr ni
this is how it came by its name as the mother of pearls
baoyu had been resting at home that day , wearing a fur-lined gown , when he noticed that the crab-apples had blossomed and went out to look atthem , sighing with admiration
then this craze might die out by degrees
he had a fight with bao er , and you saw him yourself , sir
you have been speaking of writing essays
nobody will ever come to fetch her
but you must want something of me , coming at this time
tanchun showed these items to li wan
they , too , left in order of precedence , and by about two o ’ clock all had gone except a few close relatives who would remain for the three day ’ s requiems for the dead
baoyu could not resist filling his cup with wine , which he tossed straight off
i would better pay the forfeit
as the actor stepped forward to put in a word , the surgeon rounded on him
and jia rui , afraid of being incriminated if this went any further , had to pocket his grievance and ask qin zhong and baoyu to forget it
'when the fragrance of flowers assails men we know the day is warm '
just amuse yourself with them here , but whatever happens don ’ t go to sleep and catch a chill , or the blame will fall on me again
and secondly , treat the servants here as you would your own , don ’ t be afraid they may resent it
there ’ s nothing difficult about this case , but out of deference to them it was never settled by your predecessor
i just wanted to have a try
seeing that he was obviously feeling better today , she deliberately ignored him
your father can barely support himself : he ca not feed you as well
cried granny liu , taking the bowl
a foolish scholar offers poems to a courtesan when pin−niang slept with chen mu−nan , she dreamed that he went to hangchow to take up his prefectship , then woke with a start to find the windows bright
she likes the writings of zhuang zi , from which she took that term the odd person
why were you away so long ?
then he said , ' i could have bought some pearls , but pearls for this medicine must have been worn on the head
i therefore felt my wisest course would be to ask for leave and return to see to some family affairs
their name is wang
it will spoil the fun if you go
he then looked into their land rents in the east province , which of late amounted to less than half the rent delivered to their ancestors , whereas the family expenses had increased tenfold
fan , and when i showed it to people they said he had written three characters wrongly ; it was disgraceful
who asked for your opinion ?
his mother stopped weeping to retort , is this ajoking matter ?
of course the young ladies should be provided with cosmetics every month , and they ’ re bought by the stewards in charge , then delivered by the matrons to us in the different apartments to be kept ready for when the young ladies need them
and he 's let them get away with such goings-on
presently a servant came to announce that other guests had arrived , and mr hu went out
can you tell me where it comes from ?
we can only make up the deficit by drawing silver from our clan funds down south and by selling our houses there
fetch the girls , her grandmother said
he does not want anything to eat , replied daiyu
you ca not do this , mrs pao !
when the yu brothers reached the temple , the four scholars greeted each other
after a little polite conversation the priest produced a book of poems , and kuo tieh−pi presented tu with two seals
they all approved this idea
baochai ’ s absence puzzled him too , and he remained lost in thought till daiyu ’ s arrival cheered him up and stopped him thinking about her
in that case , i ’ ll wait for you on the bridge outside the north gate
i had to harden my heart to tell the matrons to tie xiangling up and leave her in baochan 's charge
they want us to get her a doctor
as he walked out of the kitchen , the girls stepped forward
soon mrs wu came back with the old accounts
later on she married wang san−pang , who was waiting to be appointed to the post of assistant magistrate
this daughter of mine has never shown me any respect in this household
the villagers put down their chopsticks to listen , while he recited : foolish scholar fasted so long , whiskers covered his cheeks ; neglecting to study the classics , he left pen and paper aside
then jia zheng was forced to withdraw
what 's come over you ?
invoking buddha again , granny liu remarked : everyone says 'the great live in great houses
sheyue and qiuwen agreed and went off separately to make inquiries ; but nobody had seen the jade , and they were all alarmed
how can he say such a thing ?
~ighness , while i supervise the search before coming back for your instructions
this was covered by a painting in ink , not of any figures of landscape but of black clouds and heavy mist
it must sound ridiculous to you over there
it was not that to which my heart aspired
after wuer had poured out her thanks pinger took them to
when we have no visitors we should joke and chat , so long as the young people do not break the main rules of propriety
again he exclaimed in surprise , so yuanyang , xiren and pinger aren ’ t the only fine girls !
that evening they played the finger−game and drank till midnight , when all the two hundred coins were spent
you shall each have a string of cash , he promised them
vanished from heaven and the world of men , the bamboo frame bids us beware !
i shall be staying here for some time ; so i will wait for him to come back
this is quite clean , do use it
this is retribution for your sins
the scholar stood up to bow to him again
what do you mean ?
one tael , eighty cents
she chased after chunyan then to beat her again
next she scraped away the singed edges with a knife , sewed two threads across at right angles to each other , stitched in the outline in cross-stitch , and then darned the hole to reproduce the original pattern
our new management of the garden shouldn ’ t go through their hands at all
xiangling gushed , i simply love those lines by lu you :
tell mr hu to bring the money at once
and xiangyun , being young and straightforward , picked it up to have a look
this caretaker is new here and does not know our ways
on a board above the main gate was written in large characters : ningguo mansion built at imperial command
i am not saying you did
you know all about it , replied xiangyun with a smile
baoyu often made time to visit her after school ; but although she had so much she longed to tell him , now that they were no longer children she could hardly tease him playfully as before or express her pent-up feelings
construing xifeng 's silence as consent , pinger sat on the kang beside her and pummelled her gently
it had a small gong in its hand , which it now struck twice
baoyu cut in with a disarming smile , i did not know that sheath was your work
daiyu had been delighted to hear him make fun of baochai
open-eyed , she has to leave everything behind
then the four girls went off
when baoyu saw that he was indeed looking at himself in the big mirror , he also smiled
this was too much to bear !
the lady dowager glanced up again at the inscription on the board above her head , then turned to aunt xue
whose could that good-luck kite be ?
he intends to pass you
at an altar erected in the heavenly fragrance pavilion , ninety-nine taoists of the perfect truth sect should pray for forty-nine days for absolution
in the case senior licentiate yen found two brand−new sets of silk clothes , and in the package two hundred taels of silver
go and see what miss lin is doing , he said
in the same way , wine is absolutely forbidden
he called over his shoulder , smiling
this time , the rest of us should keep out of it and let just the three of them write
he was starting to leave when xifeng called him back , saying that she had something else to tell him
it makes you sad to speak of old times , said kai
she asked her grandmother
i just implore you to save me !
we would better consult chang yun−feng
see , when spring draws to a close and flowers fall ,
jia rong hurried back to the temple to report to his father that all was ready at home ; and that same night they assigned the various tasks and prepared all the pennons , poles and other essential paraphernalia
xifeng opened her eyes and felt a pang of distress
the clerk was terrified , not knowing the reason for this
they are sure to be doing themselves well !
well , it 's lucky no bones are broken
besides , it ’ s entirely up tp you to save me from getting a bad name
the new judicial commissioner has arrived
what do the rest of you think ?
i received lian 's letter about the elder master 's illness , but do not know if there is more definite news
for when your father lies ill in bed with nothing to eat and hears you declaiming compositions , no doubt about it but his heart will rejoice , his sadness will disappear and his pain will pass away
he bounded out laughingly then from behind the rockery
the day after that , the second mr peng 's daughter will be ten , and i must call to wish her a long life
under pressure from all sides , jin rong bowed to qin zhong
quite apart from your losing something , she ’ s gone too far , forgetting her place like that
next , xifeng was ordered to take her pick
wait till he arrives , and you can talk to him
all flowers must bloom , what makes you bloom so late ?
why should you be afraid qiang isn ’ t up to it ?
through withered leaves turned roan
it was dark by now , so lanterns were lit and the four attendants gathered at the stern to prepare dishes and heat wine ; and when all was ready they took the food to the cabin and lit a red candle
the second grade comprised sixty to seventy men
the next day her chest felt constricted ; however , she would not let yuanyang report this to jia zheng
another bowl was poured
after that we must go and see their ladyships and call the whole clan together to discuss this
but that day she told them to give me a few strings of cash , saying i was a 'poor , delicate little thing
where has he gone ?
you ’ ll still be in their clutches , and they ’ ll be able to fleece you
you can never tell
all of them gathered round to read the riddle :
we will see about that , was the reply
he left word that your ladyships need not worry
they crushed these willows and blooms—alack the day !
how can i put a thing like this down in writing ?
by this time baoyu ’ s hundred days ’ confinement was up and he was allowed out of doors
startled , they jumped to their feet to see who was there
daiyu had been listening intently , but now , at the mention of her own name , she spat in disgust and grabbed hold of baochai
emboldened by her previous experience of superintending qin keqing 's funeral , she was confident that here was another chance to display her ability ; and their ladyships both thought her the best choice
like drops of blood fall endless tears of longing ,
for the gatemen there watched their masters ' behaviour to visitors and acted accordingly
but after laying siqi in one coffin — without so much as a whimper — before anyone could see what he was doing he whipped out a small knife and cut his own throat !
that same moment jia lian rushed in with his sword , followed by a crowd of people
are you such a moralist ?
not knowing the reason , baoyu turned back grinning , holding his muddy hands away from himself
their faces radiant with pride , they broke into a tumult of talk and laughter
if you want a fight , you can have it
this morning i sent in a plea in my name , but it has not yet been approved
a concubine in secret
lai−kuan told the maid to clear away the crabshells and fruit dishes , wipe the table , fetch a stoneware pot and brew some fragrant tea
madam you , being unable to go home , invited her step-mother old mrs you to come and keep an eye on things in the ning mansion
so we had no idea what was going on inside
you have been standing here in the damp since first thing this morning
but why do not you pay for the pork you eat ?
one morning , as soon as he woke he heard giggling and muffled cries from the outer room
i will join you later , he said
and in came daiyu
having told the magistrate that he was ill , tu shao−ching did not stir from his home for some time
last night her illness flared up again , and she coughed all night , cuilu answered
your three cousins are excellent girls , and i ’ m sure you ’ ll find them easy to get on with during lessons , or when you ’ re learning embroidery or playing together
she returned , angry and discomfited , to report to lady xing , it ’ s no use , she just swore at me
he took the money , thanked them all and left
after some time , two boys who were staying in the house to study for the stage brought in a vegetarian meal which pao shared with mr ni
is the jade really lost ?
your interest in old books shows your respect for learning , sir , said chuang
players came in next , kowtowed to the feasters , then clashed their cymbals and beat their drums as they danced the dance of official promotion
this is woven of mermaid-silk
he surely ca not deceive many people that way , said the young man
snorting with rage , niu stalked away
did he really say that ?
yet she suddenly came to my home demanding her husband
if you take offence now , i shall be most upset
its adobe rooms with their thatched roofs and bamboo windows were surrounded by a wattle-fence , and it was possible to fish through the windows
but you spend it all gorging yourself on pig 's head and flaky cakes , and do not bring a copper home
the lou brothers unfolded the white sheet of paper and read the following lines : i dare not do anything wrong , because i have studied old books
there 's no need for that , baoyu objected
he summoned bao yong and reprimanded him ; but not liking to punish him ordered him to keep watch in the garden and not to leave the place
if you ’ d waited for the king of hell , he wouldn ’ t have known
i still have about a dozen coins left , which i mean to use to buy alcohol
xiangling ’ s whole heart was nowadays set on writing poetry , but she did not like to trouble baochai too much
my guest is in trouble , not i
madam you invites xifeng alone
you came just too late to see something still more ridiculous , she said
yes , go along , all of you
on the feast of lanterns
what could be better than pinpin ?
if he accompanies you to your post in fukien , i shall miss you both very much
but that would be rather lonely for baochai
of course , he chuckled
the more pleasure people find in parties , the more lonely and unhappy they must feel when the parties break up
i think i might
why did not you pick any of my things , as i asked ?
by now baoyu was thoroughly exasperated , but for politeness ' sake he made an evasive answer
this drunkard did not get out of the way but came charging at us , he reported
mingyan grinned and stepped closer
for another thing , after i moved into the garden that small side gate in the southeast corner was kept open for me to go through ; but other people wanting to take a short cut could use it too , and there was nobody to make a check there
for hosts and guests alike the same requital
baoyu 's grief for daiyu deepened as it led him to reflect on the dispersal of all her attendants
at once he stepped forward to bow respectfully
if i have three thousand or fifty thousand , i didn ’ t earn it from you
they entered the hall where the abbess had indeed prepared a vegetarian meal for them
when this tale later came to be read , someone wrote four lines of verse to elucidate the author 's meaning , as follows :
there was a pavilion at the top of the hill , and here tu strolled in the sun for a long time watching his shadow , while chu−ko went to have a look at a small tablet in the distance , then came back and sat down
this enraged their father even more
to his relief , after less than a month he found himself on familiar terms with half the jia sons and nephews , and all the rich young men of fashion among them enjoyed his company
you are resting now in peace ;
but lai wang had reckoned on their coming , and was already waiting out in the street , when he saw the runners he approached them with a smile
the two boys promised to do as she said and left
master lian simply answered , it ’ s nothing to boast of , if somebody is willing to ruin a family for such a trifling reason
haven ’ t you seen that censer on my desk ?
if you drag me in i ’ ll pinch your lips , warned madam you
after all your kindness , mother , not a word of thanks do you get !
ah , it ’ s too bad !
she was looking most put out
besides , when the imperial consort learned that these were the work of her beloved younger brother , she would feel that he had not fallen short of her hopes
when they are filled with vital force they grow well
when the fragrance of flowers assails men
of course not , said pinger
he chanted the couplet :
thus every sexual transport of cloud and rain is the inevitable climax of love of beauty and desire
every table in the tavern he entered was full , except for one at which a young man was sitting
why ruin her life for her ?
they describe plenty of ways and means
you ’ re just looking for trouble
time and again they had sent a go-between to propose the match ; and as they were in easy circumstances and fairly well connected , liu and his wife were quite willing , but they could not get wuer ’ s consent
a fortnight after this his selection of essays was published , and he was given a feast that evening at which he got very drunk
xifeng was just walking on when a snuffling and sniffing behind her made her hair stand on end
the xia family entertained him for three or four days , and those old pawnshop assistants of his as well , pressing them to stay even longer , and only letting them leave when they absolutely insisted
then she can go on staying in purple caltrop isle , eating and playing with us just like in the old days , instead of being bullied by that scoundrel sun
in that case i ’ m ready to go with you , said the taoist
and although baoyu ’ s childish efforts were far from inspired , at least they were passable
after they had talked for some time the vice−president entertained fan chin to dinner , and then he took his leave
even if you call your cousin the queen of bamboos she 's no ehuang or nuying how could my mistress be related to mortals ?
to them , xiangling would seem more likely to do it
you must have been in good spirits today to come here
from now on this will be cancelled
the present holder of the title , shui rong , was a charming and modest young man of less than twenty with remarkable good looks
passing through a second door in the east corner and walking down the eastern corridor past the main building , they looked up to see another placard bearing the gilt inscription : the pavilion for studying ceremony
she had heard that tanchun was difficult to handle , but thought this was because others were afraid to stand up to her
the fact is that xiren had tried to fob him off for fear that the sight of bamboo lodge , reminding him of daiyu , would distress him again
not knowing that this was pornography the silly girl wondered , are these two monsters fighting ?
when she took the skirt and unfolded it , she found it was just like her own
i was looking for a messenger
before my illness i could have figured it out , but now i ca not remember a thing
you are no longer young , and you should discipline those youngsters so that they do not offend people outside
he did this without consulting the lou brothers , entrusting the business to iron−armed chang , who pawned the gown for five hundred coins which chuan put beside his pillow
fourth brother feng , you are an able man !
he offered baoyu a seat so that they could talk , and the boy kowtowed his thanks
can i look people in the face again ?
instead , he called his steward and cursed him under his breath
what has our east mansion done to be reduced to this ?
baochai had to accept this
i shall be back again at half past six the next morning
she was choking back her sobs when fenger brought in the clothes sent by xifeng
you may as well entrust this to her
if it does , i will do what i can for you
music sounds better on the water
aren ’ t they sure signs ?
though he and daiyu had grown up side by side and were kindred spirits who longed to live and die together , this was simply tacitly understood by both but had never been put into words
there he discovered ouguan , her face stained with tears , crouching over the ashes of some paper money , a light still in her hand
the doctor came and prescribed some medicine for her , but she would not take it because it tasted so bitter , and i had to boil ginseng and give it her little by little
instead he carried the medicine to her and raised her on the pillow to drink it
he was just seven at that time , but after all these years he must have grown up
jia lian also told lin zhixiao to deduct the two hundred taels from their housekeeping funds , under cover of various items in their daily expenditure
when breeze ruffles fragrant osmanthus and frost gathers on chrysanthemum
however hard they pleaded , she was adamant as she felt the maid had disgraced her
mrs liu now gave her daughter some soup and half a bowl of porridge , then explained to her about the pachyma flour
baoyu , withdrawing , hurried to call on his mother and then to report to his grandmother , very soon leaving her again to rush to bamboo lodge
it was an anthology of yue-fu , containing lyrics such as autumn sorrow in a girl - chamber and the pain of parting
but all this time i ’ ve been unwell i ’ ve had to depend on them for everything
he hopes the old mistress and second aunt will see to that matter right away , so that he can make the final decision when he comes tomorrow
would madam xue let her daughter-in-law die and do nothing about it ?
how lucky for whoever picked it up !
that 's a lively spot all right !
have not you even got a hat ?
just then baochai and the other girls were dismounting from their carriages , escorted by a multitude of matrons and stewards ' wives
you must be lying
as she was speaking , in came a maid sent by li wan
i haven ’ t anything special to do that i know of
now these were removed , an ebony pair inlaid with silver taking their place
it was early summer and fresh , newly−opened lotus were floating on the water
it 's you we are thinking of , miss
turning back to smile at him , she pointed towards the inner rooms
that ’ s a fine drinking-game , and this is just the time for it , approved the old lady
he wandered aimlessly on until one of xue pan ’ s pages appeared and asked him to go back
i have not seen you for some days , third brother , remarked tu
that day saw the end , too , of disorder , negligence and pilfering
my home is above the sphere of parting sorrow in the sea of brimming grief , she answered with a smile
women from rich and noble families were strolling to and fro here , in small groups , dressed in silk and brocade
we are pressed for time because we must have the book ready for the merchants to take to shantung and honan to sell
you see today how right i was
if you ’ ve made no progress by the end of that time you can stop studying , and i shall disown you !
they pulled him aboard , sopping wet , but fortunately it was a mild day
let me ask you a question , retorted baochai with a smile
there ’ s nothing amusing outside , it ’ s quiet and deserted
in relief zijuan answered , you seemed unwell just now , miss , when you left the old lady ’ s place , and we didn ’ t know what to do — we cried for fright
jingui interposed , of course other people 's wine tastes better than ours at home !
if only i ’ d known how things would end i ’ d have acted differently ; but i was fool enough to think we ’ d always be together
we ca not set our own house in order , so how can we handle other people 's affairs ?
autumn orchids coated with frost
for suitable tasks are selected for different talents , and the wrong choice of person would do the flowers injustice
quite right too , agreed the old lady
this man is not a bandit , he told them
this shows that plants change in accordance with human beings
even if i still had to see doctors and buy medicine , i needn ’ t spend the family ’ s money on it
how could you possibly have met her ?
although daiyu had spoken so sharply , this talk had distressed her
while her father was still alive he made her study , and she turned out ten times better than her brother
daiyu was not in her room but mrs zhou found her in baoyu ’ s , trying to unravel the nine-ring puzzle with him
they can ’ t do without me over there
where are those girls now ?
while yet in swaddling clothes an orphan lone ;
understanding her anxiety the latter said , you go back now
dear cousin , put in baoyu hastily
do not worry , child , said lady wang tearfully , your grandmother gave me a good ticking-off because i spoke up for you ; so i ca not see myself talking her round
then he went to bed , feeling less frustrated , and slept
after the meal sixth master said : i must be going now
seven or eight , i should say
however much money he made , he always threw it away
when they approached the inner gate , some old eunuchs sitting there rose to their feet
i was frightened to death , your honour !
he also produced a hundred cash and asked the inn−keeper to buy three measures of wine , two catties of meat and some vegetables
baochai opened it and read :
even if the old lady would let her go , i wouldn ’ t
what is this man 's name ?
it was the fifth of the ninth month , and the weather was dry and clear
i was rather bored , he told her with a laugh
her nose was stopped up and her voice was hoarse
let ’ s go and see how she is
the choice of words and images is superb
so even in the yamen there is no beef
our zhen family never let such creatures cross our threshold
do keep quiet for goodness ’ sake
they have not sent it back yet
if you will be good enough to write the certificate and count out the silver , i will send in a report to close his case and see that he clears off , so that this trouble does not crop up again
of all the girls in our family she 's the best , yet now she 's going so far away to get married -- there are fewer and fewer of us here every day
just drink as much as you want , i ’ ll answer for it
and the lady dowager made him sit next to her and helped him to dainties , while the others chatted and enjoyed themselves
a woman is called new wife when she marries , and later mistress ; but a concubine remains new wife even when her hair is white )
don ’ t you believe the rascal , mother , one of them cried
taking the hint he changed his tune and said , cousin [ in hasn ’ t felt too well these last few days
by now xiren and sheyue were up
if you bury someone in this , you will bankrupt your family
soon he turned to a tragic air , expressing grief and longing , and as old yu heard the most moving passages the tears ran down his cheeks
the other day i seem to have heard someone complaining that she was one string short
xue pan nodded his agreement
i have an old friend who 's the prefect of wuwei , and the other day i received a letter from him inviting me there , and i mean to call on him
what 's got into you today ?
since this is my home province , i hurried here to look for you
he flared up then and threatened to kill me
now they are interrogating him to find out the whereabouts of that gang of thieves
i got up early one day and had not yet left the house when i heard a noise from the woodpile
then , having put his takings under his father 's bed , he sat by the old man 's side and , to cheer him up , described the scenery of the west lake and the different sweetmeats sold there
the threshold of a noble house is deeper than the sea
then he seized the rascal 's club , and prepared to whack him over the head
you look less flushed
and how did you find qiaojie yesterday ?
she added , let ’ s choose the three characters red plum flower ’ as rhymes
together they entered the court
why should a man fall over at the sight of that red thing ?
zij nan suddenly thought back fondly to daiyu , telling hersell what a pity miss lin is dead !
there ’ s still a rhyme :
the sergeant is here , said wang when she had finished
the two women tuned their instruments and played until the lady dowager asked the time
xiangyun roused herself from a brown study to urge xiren 's party and the maids at the foot of the slope to eat their fill
the other old woman simply smiled and did not answer
i have been looking for you everywhere !
but one of the maids attending the young ladies may have dropped a cup , they suggested
you ’ re talking nonsense again , said his grandmother , laughing
hurry up and get dressed now
we tried to take it down , but it was glued on too firmly ; so we copied it out , then soaked the paper to get it off
nonsense , said li wan
i have heard something of the sort too , said tu
if you spread the news and the thief smashes the jade , i can ’ t see you living it down !
after standing there for a few minutes she turned and went out , signalling to fangguan to join her , then quietly told her what ruiguan had said and handed over the powder
xue pan 's eyes bulged , he was so frantic
but all-seeing buddha meted out retribution
are there no men outside your family ?
the inn−keeper assented with alacrity
when enough contributions have come in , you can take charge of repairing the shrine and restoring the image , and every month i will give you money for incense
i don ’ t drink liuan tea , said the old lady
your cousin happens to be my husband , sister
'of course miss xichun 's doing this of her own free will , but the girls in her service are not willing to do the same , said zijuan
where have you been ?
then he asked his secretaries for the list of those who had failed in the prefectural examination , and carefully checked their names and cell numbers
these really were gifts to her brother from zhen , madam you confirmed
as she stepped over the threshold in the dim lamplight , she saw the shadowy figure of a woman who appeared to be about to hang herself with the scarf in her hand
by now they had reached his study where they found zhan guang , cheng rixing , hu silai and shan pinren as well as the singing-boy
seal its roots with mud and water it with spring water
i will watch you write your plea
i happened to be the one who went that day , and the old lady was as pleased as pleased could be
maybe these girls of ours ca not compare with those young ladies , but they should not go to the other extreme either
at this point jia zhen came in
take it , sir , said chou chi−fu
in that case , how do you know ?
so you get an extra ten taels for your son , which means getting as much as they do , and on top of that you ’ ve been given land in the garden farm and are paid rent , apart from the largest share in the annual bonuses
wait till we see what can be done
and he asked his clerks : is there another yu yu−chung in this county who is a senior licentiate ?
xue ke was a simple , honest young fellow
knowing that the two girls were good friends he ignored her too and raising the door curtain went into his bedroom
he 's the cousin of the ninth mr hsu of the duke 's palace
but to yuling ’ s eternal spring my soul has fled
having finished her toilet she went off with the other girls to pay her respects to the lady dowager
that year his concubine you died , although i was not in the capital i heard you spent pots of money ; yet now that your mother 's dead he 's skimping things like this
he could not resist accosting them with a bow
he did not awake till the morning , when he turned and saw xiren lying fully dressed on the cover at his side
on his return he did as chu chin−yu had foreseen and procured an outsize balance
an impostor masquerades as an official wu shu was about to return teng chih−fu 's call when an invitation card was brought in
i am not one to blab -- if i were , they would be involved in plenty of murder cases !
then baochai did not insist , and they tried for a while to guess the answers , but with no success
the attendants were afraid to go near her
qingwen and the others had done as he said , however , and now they ran back smiling
what does it matter to you ?
already deranged , after the mysterious apparitions and vanishings of-this evening he knew even less what to think
this said , he left
and thus the wizard spake with omens bright :
these two were not the only ones to be talking this business over
when they reached the arch erected for the imperial consort ’ s visit home , granny liu exclaimed :
that would be pointless
here ’ s fresh trouble out of the blue !
don ’ t you know the way she is , sister ?
although my status is higher , i ’ m just a stump of rotten wood swathed in silks and satins , just a ces s-pool or gutter filled with choice wines and meats
xifeng told the stewardesses to make a note of this name , and the things were entrusted to zhou rui ’ s wife for temporary custody till a check had been made the next day
when they see us come down in the world they strike out on their own ; and some of them , so i have heard , help other people to squeeze us
cousin daiyu feels the cold , said baoyu
i am sure master bao will come back
i ’ m just giving her part of some that was given to me , she explained
lady wang was speechless , in tears
this talk reached the ears of ni er 's wife and daughter , who waited in vain that night for him to come home
who would have known it ’ s her turn next to die ?
four maids who were waiting knelt down upon both knees
how do you come to be here , uncle ?
think over what you said
afraid his pig-headedness would lead to trouble , the others hastily put in , you understand everything else so well , why ask about the term natural ’ ?
his mother saw from the dazed look on his face that he had something on his mind
they could not escape hsiao 's catapult , however
everyone speaks of miss baochai ’ s good manners and generosity , she gushed , and sure enough here ’ s an example today
we must not hold them up ; so i will say goodbye
so she and zhou rui 's wife set out with granny lin for the lady dowager 's quarters
it upsets you to see how fond i am of your cousin , but i love you even more if you only knew it
the heartless meet with certain retribution
my dear cousin , you are being touchy instead if you talk like that , said xiangyun
selected essays have a short vogue only , said the shopkeeper
can you really be so vulgar as not even to tell the difference ?
go and get them to make some tea while i wake him up
the wine in his left hand , he took aim with the sword in his right above the old man 's crown
jia lian grabbed his arm protesting , there are ladies inside ; how can you charge in so wildly ?
and mr mei said , amy own name seems to be an auspicious one , so i will give it to him and hope that he will turn out like me
why does their love come to nothing ?
but no more of this
i ’ ll take care of him
what do you want of me ?
dark tradesigns flutter above the wineshops , and red charcoal glows in the tea−house stoves , while men and women stream by , on pleasure bent , to throng the countless taverns and music halls
inevitably , this over-indulgence had made her like the brigand dao zhi of old : she had as high an opinion of herself as if she were a goddess , and treated others like dirt
now that things had come to such a pass , xueyan could not but grieve for daiyu , though she dared not show her feelings to the old lady and xifeng
fan was taken ill in front of my temple just after he passed the examination , but i was out that day and could not do anything for him
this xiangyun resolutely declined , however , and at her insistence they let her move in with baochai instead
this impressed them all
yet the things you say !
i really can ’ t bring myself to do such a thing
your first and second young ladies ’ families are on close terms with ours
pray allow me to reflect carefully before submitting a memorial
at last cuilu held out her hand
when people like that ask for me , just say i am not at home
the girl lifted the portiere and came in , having been sent by lady wang to find jia lian
they got up early and went secretly to try to win pinger over to their side , taking her presents , complimenting her on her competence and good judgement , and telling her all kinds of tales about mrs liu
the butcher went on cursing at full blast , till fan chin 's head spun
this was a huge lake , almost as large as the west lake in hangchow
he bowed his way to his chair , then left
she caught hold of the girl ’ s sleeve to drag her off
yun , the son of fifth sister-in-law who lives in west lane , has come several times begging me to find him a job , and i promised him i would if he would wait
as the old woman rose to leave
i hope you will consider doing good as its own reward , and not take offence at my lack of courtesy
you ’ d feel the same if you heard someone in my place complaining about me
transmigration has always been considered a mystery , declared magistrate hsiang
not only for my sake either
zijuan laughingly fetched the tea leaves and told one of the younger maids to make tea
that ’ s why , in front of the master , i said it was xiangling
the old lady , lady xing and lady wang immediately asked what had happened
what business have you here ?
i am lu hsin−hou of hukuang
he used to be my disciple , and now that he has become a great official he has sent these men to invite me to become the abbot of pao kuo monastery in the capital
i heard just now , sir , said pao , that charges are being brought against magistrate hsiang of antung county
who are you , you lawless brigand ?
jia zheng entrusted all three to the care of
to know what followed , turn to the next chapter
some mr wang was the go-between—he ’ s related to the east mansion ; so without making further inquiries they accepted out of hand
i fail to understand your attitude , sir
i am fortunate to have met you who can certainly edify me
the chicken and pork simmering in one pan set his mouth watering ; and he saw a pan of good rice , too , and a bottle of wine
who am i to be cross ?
from spring till summer ?
tell the mistress that , he cut in halfway
the master sends you his respects , sir , he said to kuang
jia zheng found the whole privy council as well as the princes assembled in the palace
as he was speaking , he fastened up his hair and asked the apothecary for a basin of water to wash his face , while one of the neighbours found his shoe and helped him put it on
they ’ re doing it in their own good time
his mother could surely have seen her daughter by herself
if you fix this up , i ’ ll make it worth your while how ’ s that ?
to know the reason for this summons , read the next chapter
chinese feudalism , the development of which had long been retarded , was in a state of decline
so it was just one of your tricks
and in he walked , in a large hat of plaited bamboo leaves and a coir cape
i gave you a lot of trouble yesterday , declared baoyu
do you know mr tu too , nephew ?
the old lady ordered sheyue to send to fetch him
when they entered the courtyard they heard her talking with a man
thank goodness it was miss baochai and not miss lin -- she would have made a fearful scene , weeping and sobbing
i am so glad you have come !
she dressed rather conspicuously too
where have you been all this time ?
then xifeng , having washed her face , went back to wait on the lady dowager
i do not ask anything else — just let him show me the marriage certificate signed by my father , and i will say no more !
really i should drink a few cups with you , but i have some very urgent business today to report to my father
by now jia lian was calling pinger from the door of the hall , and before she could go to meet him he stepped through her doorway
thinking daiyu had been scolding him again , xueyan had to go back to bamboo lodge where she gave zijuan the ginseng , as their mistress was still asleep
she quietly told baochai , 'the talking-to you gave him did the trick after all , madam
it ’ s all that jia yun ’ s fault !
he dropped her hand then and told her , she said to me , 'if i would known i was going to get a bad name , i would have committed myself
jia lian agreed and withdrew to order a carriage for hupo and the maids
some outstanding examples are the juniper tree before confucius ’ temple and the yarrow before his tomb , as well as the cypress before zhuge liang ’ s temple and the pine before yue fei ’ s tomb
i only beg your highnesses to be lenient to my uncle who knew nothing about this
she presented some brushes and stationery to baochai , yingchun , baoyu and others
none but admires her talents and her skill ;
who could have imagined such a stroke of luck ?
and what i like about you is that you are the most lustful man ever to have lived in this world since time immemorial
i dared not , sir
tang san called one day when yoo had nothing to do
if i ’ d known , i should never have struck her not even if some devil were forcing my hand
when the results were published , chou chin had passed with distinction , and all the merchants were delighted
and mrs you , to be easy in her mind , had to bring her two unmarried daughters with her
and when the lips are gone the teeth will feel the cold
let 's have the dice
but we have brought that stupid object back with us
magistrate fang of our county has treated you very well
he seized this chance to add : as the proverb says
baoyu were to come back how happy we all should be !
this set xiangyun worrying
aunt huang immediately flew into a passion
he was dazzled by the glittering gold and emerald and the elegance of all the furnishings , but could see no sign of baoyu
no , it 's usually kept shut , they answered
but to bring out its splendour once it is displayed we must write poems about it ; so six is writing about the chrysanthemum
the author 's condemnation of his negative characters can not be considered as personal attacks
she called me silly , said i was talking nonsense , and i dared not argue with her
not until feng ziying came out did he let them go
i needn ’ t name any names
qiaojie turned to look at him , then started crying again
as for his sister ’ s wedding , pan says your decision was a good one , and rushing it through will save a good deal of money
he started sobbing too
master bao , not being used to this heat , might be over-powered by the stench
how do you know he will suffer in the next world ?
at sight of these nine spirits , he raised his magic staff and threatened to beat them
the older you grow the more outspoken you get
they came in now to greet the scholars , and chih heng−shan gave the boys the vermilion flutes and pheasant feathers for their dance
yen told the nurse to bring in his son , and threw a coarse linen cloth over the child 's shoulders as a sign of mourning , the coffin had been ready for some time
i was just old enough then to remember things
gold is like iron to them
often lost in thought , he did not know what to do
daiyu could only pretend not to have heard
as it was nearing sunset , she had to find yuanyang and tell her which of the old lady 's things she wanted
all eyes were fixed on mr
are you in low spirits , madam ?
is your other name yu−huei , by any chance ? , he asked
there ’ s no need to discuss it , expostulated baoyu
otherwise , in less than a year you will have spent all your family 's money and made those above and below resent you too
then with a smile to aunt xue the old lady said , let 's go
the more he thought about it , the worse his hand hurt , and he asked the apothecary to give him some ointment for it
and there ’ s something even more amazing
if he is a successful candidate , it will help to atone for our faults
when yu yu−ta reached wuwei , the district magistrate , truly mindful of old friendship , entertained him for several days
li wan agreed , yes , since ancient times many men have given up rank and wealth to achieve buddhahood and become immortals
shouted niu , beside himself with anger
all right , we wo not have them pulled out
i hope you ’ ll guess them
he then paced up and down outside alone
he prepared a farewell feast , and produced over a dozen taels of silver , then hired a sedan−chair and saw wang off to huichow
and now that i ’ m tipsy , unless i ’ m very careful , i may smash this porcelain cup
i love meddling in other people ’ s affairs , said the lady dowager
no matter how thick a sheet of ice , a piwan can shatter it with one roar
lady wang pointed out the place
collect my books and bring round my horse
did you write this ?
why should you , who are usually so good to me , be so hard on me today just because of pinger ?
the others were wondering what she meant when xiren picked up the slip for all to see
since wu comprised the modern provinces of kiangsu and chekiang , it was fitting that a native of chekiang should act as master of sacrifice
accordingly baochai ordered a serving-woman , go and ask my brother to get us several crates of big crabs like those we had the other day
sheer went straight to find xiangling
they could not agree on their diagnosis
when she and her mother got back , jia huan and jia cong had just called to see baoyu
how would that be ?
she ordered the stewards to conduct the eunuchs to where refreshments were waiting
i am not making this up you heard her for yourself in front of alpinia park
both stories seemed likely and xiren was convinced
asked chi tien−yi , very pleased
no wonder it tastes so good , cooked with a dozen chickens
in that case , do invite them over , urged the dowager princess
we shall thank you again when that man of mine comes out
xiuyan , after bowing and praying on her instructions , got up to help hold the planchette
by the afternoon when there was no sign of them , she , li wan and baochai sent servants out to make inquiries , but they did not come back , having no news
the men ignored her for a while , but finally one of them said , wait over there by that corner
it would simply pour oil on the flames
when shall i be able to go ?
the top compartment was full of brushes and sticks of ink , fans , incense slabs , multi-coloured pouches , sashes and the like
baoyu paid his respects to aunt xue and greeted baoqin but looked in vain for baochai and xiuyan
it ’ s only the tenth month , and this is the first fall of snow this winter , rejoined the old lady
after the steward 's return the news spread like wildfire that concubine zhao had been tortured to death by the king of hell because she had plotted murder
how come then that when i was away for a few days and you were laid up , practically at death ’ s door , you mended that cape for him with no thought of your health ?
when you go in , auntie , do filch a few apricots for me
xifeng told fenger : bring that set of ten cups carved out of bamboo root on the bookshelf in the inner room
out with the truth !
if i ’ m not in earnest may i drop dead !
if you would spoken before , it could have been fixed up some time ago
at once she recoiled a few steps
i shall probably be here for some years , so i have taken another wife
so do stop drinking cold wine
if she weren ’ t quite incapable of any exertion , i know she ’ d have made an effort to be here today , observed xifeng
what ’ s been keeping you all this time ?
have you come from miss xing ’ s place ?
he was marveling , too , that the voice carried so clearly right into the house
i was on my way to ask cousin daiyu when luckily i met you
the other beast flew into a rage , and thrust out one paw to knock off the tiger 's head , felling it to the ground
they ’ re lucky to be here at all , able to watch and eat free of charge , but i won ’ t let them choose any items
approved li wan too
then chin tung−ya , followed by lu hua−shih , entered the hall
leave that to me , said feng
ting−hsi asked a diviner to find a suitable site for the grave and to choose a day for the burial ; but there was no one to write an inscription for the pall
my innocence is proof against abuse
riding on , xue pan observed that the houses now were few and far between
as long as baoyu lives , i shall always be his whipping-boy
we will get somebody to keep you company , to pour you tea during the night
the next year rebels rampaged east of the mountains ,
and she was so dazzled by everything in the room that her head began to swim
we were trying to amuse the old lady , why should i be cross ?
then , wailing loudly , she tried to climb on the wooden roof of the bed , and began to sing snatches of opera
as she entered this temporary palace , she saw torches in the courtyard flaring to the sky , powdered incense strewing the ground , flaming trees , jasper flowers , gilded windows and jade balustrades , to say nothing of screens as fine as the shrimp ’ s antennae , carpets of otter-skin , musk burning in tripods , and fans made from pheasant plumage
he left his uncle 's house in a temper and was trudging home with lowered head , fuming over such shabby treatment , when he bumped into a drunkard
the old lady chortled , as the proverb says : even a clever wife can ’ t make congee without rice
mind you blow gently though
do you appreciate them better now ?
then he passed the palace examination and was appointed a magistrate , after which he married one of the zhen family ’ s maids — his present wife is his second
go back and tell your master that
when the proofs are out and when the book is published i will invite you again , he said
one book on ceremony , one on etymology , and one on country etiquette
so what could i do ?
every day they either fight or squabble , and there ’ ve even been several cases of gambling and theft
these may not be divulged in advance to you with your human eyes and mortal frame
strictly speaking , it ’ s not my job to announce visitors
it will be livelier having it together
i wanted my fortune told
such was the depth to which the people of wuho had sunk
mind you don ’ t hurt your hand , madam , urged pinger
but who will bury mc when dead i lie ?
exclaimed granny liu in surprise
to prevent gossip she ’ s ordered you to ignore me , but here you come seeking me out
he had a lean , sallow face and sparse moustache and , because he was a short−sighted fellow and absorbed in his reading , he did not see kuang chao−jen come in ; but when the latter came over and greeted him , he stood up and returned the greeting
those who know us say : boys will be boys
wouldn ’ t that be the same ?
he burst out weeping
but when second master carried on like that outside you ought to have told me about it earlier
i ’ ve thrown the wrong one !
whatever happens , don ’ t just slip away
why put up with such bad treatment from her husband ?
luckily she was challenged by no one on her way to happy red court
where are you going ?
he then cautioned xue pan , mind you don ’ t tell the family
this is the best !
formerly a small alley had separated the two houses , but since this was private property and not a public thoroughfare the grounds of both could now be thrown into one
you must go home at once to see to qiaojie
aunt xue declared , i ’ m too old to mix in your crowd , and i feel very boxed up here too , i ’ d rather lie down in comfort in the council hall
more cheerful now , the old lady told yuanyang to get out a hundred taels and order the servants to prepare two days ' feasts , starting from the next day
especially as the family of your betrothed isn ’ t as well off as before
jingui makes a scene and baochai
when you heard i was here , why didn ’ t you come out ?
they ’ d never heard of it and said instead i was cheating , so we started squabbling and i ’ ve spolit my new skirt
rather sheepishly , she hastily sat up , straightened her clothes and went back with the others to red fragrance farm
even so , proposed pinger , we must call those two trouble-makers caiyun and yuchuan over , and get them to agree to this arrangement
leave it to me
but if she goes home to rest i ’ ll have nobody here , as xiren ’ s away just now
then baoyu , instead of going out , ordered the doctor to be sent for at once
i wo not deceive you
take this to show your uncle bao , then give it back to your mother
but pinger slipped from his grasp and ran out of the room , leaving him doubled up in frustration
but you mustn ’ t wear yourself out
let ’ s get on with burying the flowers
from now on i shall have to address you as master , not as sister ’ any more
all men must die
but though he knew the real reason for her distress he refrained from speaking of it , for fear of making her feel worse
so you are the famous chekiang editor , said feng
it is not fair i would not have begrudged xiren ten times as much either -- she deserves it
i can ’ t eat anything or drink much either , so i ’ ll leave my place to them and that will suit everybody
jia zhen was not in good health himself at this time and , being weighed down with grief , he limped in with a cane
the body is a bodhi tree , the mind a mirror clear ;
there was nobody about , nothing but a few trees , and the smoke from some distant cottages where supper was being cooked rose up , a vivid blue , straight to the clouds
why should i trouble my head over such matters ?
don ’ t go to sleep just yet , you two , she said
even if he does not pay us back , we merchants always fritter away a few taels one way or another , and this is in a good cause
but there 's not a moment to lose : you will have to get busy at once , sir
although our aim is to economize and make a profit , we mustn ’ t be too stingy either
she ’ s better , answered xifeng , who had an aversion to both him and concubine zhao
your remark the other day about good fortune and bad has been on my mind ever since , he said
kuang was too worried that night to sleep
let them bring me three thousand taels and i ’ ll see to this for them
because your daughter was always making trouble , she asked xiangling to keep her company and they slept in the same room
you must have a simple meal with us ; and mr wu is writing a poem for you
but master bao wanted to send something today to miss shi in the house of the young marquis
the gate was closed but not yet locked
i ’ ve searched even the young lady ’ s person
kuang chao−jen was annoyed
the garrison commander of the capital reported : xue pan , a native of jinling , while travelling through taiping county put up in li family hostel
this would mean fewer men without wives , and would help to strengthen general morality
how can one take everything so seriously ?
finally she voiced her own fear of punishment , all but going down on her knees , she was so frantic
the other one is xiren
one day after drinking a few cups alone jingui , lying on the kang , decided to work off her spleen on baochan
by law you should be punished , but in view of your brotherly concern i shall pardon you
do not you know that one ancient sage taught that we 'should not lose the heart of a child ?
in a trance with a goddess he leaves the world of men
now that it 's settled , they will be sending you rich presents , madam ; and once your grand-daughter 's married to a prince , the elder master will get a high post for sure
a temple to tai po
in panic aunt xue and the others searched everywhere for good doctors , but not one was able to diagnose his illness until a certain bi zhan , a poor physician who lived in a ruined temple outside town , ascribed it to both internal and external factors : sudden transports of joy and grief depriving him of his senses and appetite and pent-up indignation resulting in congestion
why go to such trouble ?
a filial son is seen off by his friends to search for his father in szechuan dr yu received his guests , and after an exchange of courtesies they sat down
but now it looks , doesn ’ t it , as if we were celebrating our own ?
some people say he ’ s returned
does he have to go to the palace to have a good meal ?
but as soon as the meal was over he called for tea to rinse his mouth , suspecting that his grandmother might be worried by his absence , and worried himself about daiyu
i ’ m sure you ’ ll inherit our noble ranks in future
chih and tu stood one on the right and one on the left of the incense table
better take siqi to her with the evidence , and after seeing it they ’ ll at most give her a beating and assign a different maid here
what ’ s come over you , miss ?
sit down while i brew some tea for you , and tell me all you have been doing
she said , 'your aunt 's delicate yet look at all she has on her hands
i kept telling you , ma , but you never believed me , said chunyan
today , hearing that the old lady might be wanting fruit from the garden , we opened it in readiness
tranquil you sleep in your secluded vault ;
presently niu pu came in wearing a new tile−shaped cap , new blue cloth gown , new shoes and new socks
you ’ ve come just in time
since i came here as a girl , your ladyships have been so good to me !
why , when she ’ s carried out wearing this , people won ’ t be able to take their eyes off her
all the cups on the tables were changed then for fresh ones from the basin , and when more wine had been poured they resumed their seats
so mr wei and mr sui are here
but when she picked up the chopsticks she still found them unwieldy
there ko lai−kuan in a lined gauze , jade−coloured gown , with a fan of wild goose feathers in his slender tapering fingers , was leaning over the balcony enjoying the breeze
as they were talking lady wang was announced
he says it 's all right to keep up the connection now that our second master has inherited the title
after a simple meal we can have a good talk , said kao
i must have taken the wrong road before
daiyu , standing in the shade of the blossom , went on staring into the distance towards happy red court
they hired a small boat and set out that same afternoon without attendants , and had soon covered several dozen miles
why didn ’ t you go to the front ?
if it comes out after they have left , we will have missed our chance
after a hasty tour of this monastery , he went back to sit in the same tea−house again—its name , the southern screen , was written in letters of gold — and here he drank a bowl of tea
i ’ m so tired , my bones are aching , protested xifeng
my old woman burns a stick of incense every day under the eaves , to pray that you gentlemen will become ministers too
at the mention of daiyu , though he still raves his mind seems clearer
when jia zheng commented on jia lan ’ s absence , a nurse went inside to ask li wan the reason
then ni er 's wife and daughter told him their story
now , seeing that xiren ’ s wrapper was of black and white silk gauze , lined with pink silk , and in it she had only two worn silk-padded jackets and one fur jacket , xifeng told pinger to bring her own jade-coloured velvet wrapper with a silk lining , as well as a cape for the snow
i ’ m not afraid of you !
zijuan , who had just brought in tea , was puzzled to find the two of them like this
don ’ t stand on ceremony , sir , said yucun , rising
the little wretch just smiled and did not stir
thirteen years have passed in a twinkling since we left you at the foot of blue ridge peak , he said with a sigh
she asked baochai , did cousin baoyu take his jade with him ?
yes , it ’ s the same
i am a rustic fellow who scribbles at random , replied niu pu
dear cousin , you ’ ve got me wrong , he said
this is strictly forbidden : it would have been a fiasco !
tomorrow ’ s still a holiday , and we ought to get up early
pasted on each boy 's desk is the warning : do not imitate tu shao−ching of tienchang !
drink up now like a good girl
we must have some dress materials ready for them
as baoyu happened to come in just then , she asked him whether he had had his lunch
mrs lin asked pinger if she agreed , and the answer was :
he ’ s not afraid of you , mother , and won ’ t listen to other people ’ s advice either
for fear of vexing her he made no mention of going to see her brother
all agreed that it was time to disperse , so when xiren and baoyu tried to keep them li wan and baochai demurred :
some lamented her fate , some blamed mao yanshou the painter , and others reproached the han emperor for making him paint portraits of palace beauties instead of good ministers
the master of ceremonies invited the bride to alight from the chair , and baoyu saw a maid with a red sash help her out — her face was veiled
from the moon cave roll silver waves
the more serious charge is of abducting the wife of an honest citizen , who was forced to kill herself rather than submit
i have not been out for a long time , and have therefore failed to profit from your instruction , said tu
each one is a household word
but by now wang was beginning to feel quite sick at heart , so he declined to join them
by no daiyu was wide-awake
but we won ’ t teach you for nothing
but luckily here you are
what good friend is this ?
just then , however , at the bottom of the hamper , she discovered a bowl of ham-and-fresh-bamboo-shoot soup
as she spoke she began to grow angry again
they are all good friends of mine
i hear from your mother that your wife is too unwell to go
now xue pan was a living example of the saying to cover the land of shu after getting the region of long
as for the reward , you can raise it by selling my jewels
his grandfather fell ill of rage , and since he was an old man of seventy with a lowered resistance and had no cordials to help him , in less than ten days he died
baoyu had to accompany her to lady wang ’ s place , only to find that his father had left already
if they were here , we could arrange baoqin ’ s wedding and then yours
and at this point jia lan and jia huan slipped away
one of them even picked up the gold chaplet that the new wife had let fall , and concealed it in her clothes
mind you don ’ t tell anybody !
he must have gone to find the hibiscus spirit , or in search of some other goddess !
seizing hold of aunt xue she demanded , just how did you murder my daughter anyway ?
but because the imperial consort never sent for them , they gradually became lax in their devotions ; and as they grew older they began to take an interest in men
one boat was for the bride and bridegroom , the other for the senior licentiate
he distinguished himself in the fighting against the huns , but was never made a noble
jia lian promptly called for his horse and rode off , accompanied by longer , leaving xinger behind to attend to other things
then zijuan told some younger maids to take the kite to the women on duty at the gate , who should give it to anyone who came asking for it
let ’ s go before baoyu sees him , urged another
we shall have to send to the capital for more
jia she and the other men waited outside in the west street entrance , the lady dowager and the women outside the main gate , the ends of the street and the alleys leading to it all having been screened off
the messenger need not say a word , once you saw the rings you would know that they were for the young ladies
here is his letter , sir , and here are five hundred taels of silver for the wedding gifts
since your name is niu , said niu yu−fu , our family must have been the same five hundred years ago
after raising his chopsticks to invite his guests to fall to , he took merely a few bamboo shoots and cherries himself
he thought , this seems a bit lacking in respect
xifeng promptly assented and took her leave of aunt xue
how quickly the place has run wild !
drive all those humbugs out , i say
although the woman did not like the idea , as xifeng had done her the honour of proposing it in person she had to agree out of hand
tomorrow we can travel together
if i ever run amuck again , swore xue pan , may i be killed and disembowelled !
to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
and he would not come back anyway
having made out a prescription including ginseng , angelica , astragalus and the like , he took his leave
it was this jade that made him fall ill , this jade that cured him , this jade that he was born with she broke off here in a fresh fit of weeping
jingui asked her , did anyone see you fetch those things ?
this is actually only a makeshift , madam
all laughed at that , and then daiyu suggested one piece
why did i say you couldn ’ t take her as your mother ?
pinger had already called out xueyan , who had been holding aloof these last few days as the others had been taunting her as a careless child ; and in any case she would never dream of ignoring a summons from the lady dowager and madam lian
if i don ’ t do my best , you can cut off my head
he had several concubines but fate had not granted him another son , and he could not remedy this
this night ’ s royal tour gives rise to poetry ,
any delay , and the master will suffer for it
at once he had her laid on the bed and sent for a doctor
if madam you heard , she would drive us away from our nunnery with curses !
you don ’ t have to worry about that , xiangiian assured him
then why not engage him to baiyu ?
it was baoyu ’ s turn to laugh
when lady wang and xifeng had agreed to this , she went on to see baoyu and asked what he wanted her for
he has studied hard for scores of years , but never even passed the prefectural examination
whether it 's true or not , i must go to town to have a look
we will presently be eating crabs , said xifeng
if she ’ s rude to you , she ’ s rude to me as well
i ’ ve been waiting for a chance to go to court
he noticed in the middle of the wall a scroll painting of the moon goddess change and another goddess , each with an attendant , the second one carrying what looked like a long clothing bag
the others rejoined in surprise , we often see her but never heard tell of this
do you mean to say , retorted ting , that these poems by chao hsueh−chai and ching lan−chiang are really by other people ?
fate has brought us together to this feast today , he said
what poems can the old monk have that he wo not show me ?
don ’ t stay here talking nonsense
another couplet on the two sides read :
and even if she were not , she could not be passed over
what luck for you to meet me as soon as you get here !
while they were speaking the table was spread , and they sat down : mr wei in the seat of honour , chang chun−min opposite him , tu shao−ching in the place of host , and pao ting−hsi in the lowest seat
xifeng , who was passing outside , overheard this exchange and called back through the window :
a most plausible explanation , said the others
then , seated in front of the lady dowager 's couch , she found some more gossip to tell her
they had now reached the convent gate
if we led our forces there , we would start dying off in a few days of thirst
but i ’ ve noticed that at least half our sisters attending in the different apartments make these purchases with their own money
so you still remember that ?
what is she doing here ?
she ordered siqi to pack up her things and leave
lengthened my pendents , where bright jewels blazed
then the sight of the old lady , terror-stricken and gasping for breath , made him even more frantic
nothing of coil sequence , replied jia zheng with a smile
we can copy it out tomorrow
by midday there was still no sign of him
third sister , he said , i heard that you were there when cousin lin died and that , far off in the distance , there was the sound of music
this is extremely urgent
i didn ’ t know about that business of burning paper
when he saw that it was chou chi−fu , he put down the urn and they greeted each other
put out by his stare she asked :
his hereditary rank is hereby abolished
for how otherwise could i have seen such a sight ?
rather hard on baochai , though
at noon baoyu drank a few cups of wine with xue ke , and baochai took baoqin to pay her respects to him too
yu yu−ta kept wang to a meal , and refused to accept his card inscribed as from a pupil to a teacher
now i ’ ve a broiled pheasant in my room , piping hot
that year the records of officials in the capital were examined , and the ministry of works ranked jia zheng as first class
if you tell her she will want to come , but she may not be able , and if she ca not she will be terribly disappointed
one day dusk fell while he was far from any village ; but as he pressed forward he met a man
i will bring it you , sir , for your opinion
whichever of us you choose , madam , they replied
ripples radiated out to shatter the moon ’ s reflection , which then rounded out again
do take me home at once
what are you talking about ?
after a stay of four or five days , they announced that they must leave ; and during the farewell feast the question of chu hsien−fu 's marriage came up again
she sat down to sip tea while mrs wang and the others set about searching
though their poems and paintings were not as good as his , kai kuan prized talent so much that when such visitors called he would feast them , and there would be talk and laughter
one evening in the runner 's house , huan−cheng and shuanghung were discussing how they might pawn the old casket for a few dozen coins to buy food
this ceremony at an end , yuanchun asked why aunt xue , baochai and daiyu were missing
i would like to keep out of the way
please tell them to open the gate , they begged , we just want to have a look
the weather was growing warm and chuan wu−yung 's thick white gown was becoming too hot , so he decided to pawn it in order to buy some blue cloth to make a gown for the party
today , after calling on their ladyships , we want to see miss xichun too
they weren ’ t officials , were they ?
i told him that , but he wanted me to tell you , miss , so that you can give him an answer
in view of what xifeng had said , mrs wang had to let this pass and they went on to tanchun ’ s place
one of these rooms was occupied by an old monk , and niu pu−yi now put up in the other
and when maids took word of this to aunt xue , she turned pale with alarm
i know a young man who is neither an actor nor a scholar , but a taoist priest
they say magistrate wang was their gobetween , and the wedding has been fixed for the third of next month
xifeng also instructed lai wang , get him to implicate you , then you can confront him in court i ’ ll tell you just what to say and i guarantee everything will be all right
now though the loss of his jade had deranged baoyu , the news that he was to marry daiyu seemed to him the most wonderful thing that had ever happened , and at once his health had improved , though he seemed less quick in the uptake than before
can you , roaming through boundless space ,
today she just happened to fly into a temper
now he ’ s been upgraded and is leaving
i can ’ t raise enough as a scrivener
how can someone your age give way to such foolish fancies just because of a little illness ?
we still have some of those preserves from the south , don ’ t we ?
that 's how i knew you
but in cases like this , the established procedure has always been to consider the local verdict as castiron evidence
he took two turnings and climbed some more steps which brought him to a wide flat road
but qingwen ordered someone to fetch nanny song and when she arrived informed her , master bao has told me to tell you that zhuier ’ s too lazy
if there ’ s no way of finding out the date , you can easily ascribe this tale to some time in the han or tang dynasty
it was not a passer-by either , granny liu chortled
you must not fall asleep again , she said
he spluttered , trembling from head to foot
flowers drift away on the stream
every day i spend with my cousins is all to the good , he answered
he turned to the woman with big feet
most likely only the two or three of us will remain together till our dying day
he bade his family prepare a feast , and invited tu shao−ching
it was cancelled years ago
with a cry she threw up all the medicine she had just taken , and was racked by such dry coughing that her stomach burned and it seemed her lungs would burst
it 's not like you to be so suspicious and unkind
you can get your maids to prepare some every day
her eyes sparkled with tears , her breath was soft and faint
the prefect is not a friend of yours
the next moment she heard a soft thud
just then the monks , hearing footsteps , winked to the abbot to stop talking
i ’ ve some very tender pheasant ready
it 's time to change the subject
daiyu too had been worried on baoyu 's behalf when she heard that he had not come back all day after being sent for by his father
numskull turned pale with fright
i ’ m impatient but they ’ re slow coaches !
my sister-in-law says she gave you some silver the other day to keep for her , madam , said jia lian
lady xing made no further objection then
my father is still feasting , he said
she could not help shedding tears
contented and very dutiful to my mother too , ten times better than her real daughter-in-law ever was
when i was a youngster , he admitted
at soochow feng paid the fare , and they changed for a junk to hangchow which was half as large again as the nanking boat
at new year you should burn more incense before buddha !
since this made sense , baoyu put down the wine and asked to have it warmed
one of them , spotting her , ran over and xiren saw it was chuyao
when they arrived , after the usual polite conversation they sat down to a feast in the room overlooking the river
it was baochai who begged jingui to be reasonable
the next day daiyu rose early , and instead of calling her maids sat there alone lost in thought
then if i get given face you can bully people outside , calling yourselves relatives of the ha family ; if i lose face and land in trouble , you turtles can shrink back into your shells and leave me to my fate
as baoyu and jia lan were talking , yinger brought them tea and jia lan stood up to take it
jia zhen and jia lian flushed red , not venturing to answer more than yes , sir
baoyu makes extravagant answers
she 's not here for anything special
the next morning , after paying the bill , hsiao saw kuo six or seven miles to a cross−road , and there with tears they parted
one day he declined an invitation to a feast from
presently the feast was served and they took their seats at the table
sleepless at night when wind and rain lash gauze windows ,
the porter , who had eaten too , put the manuscripts in his empty basket and shouldered this load back to town
besides , as he ’ s so busy , why have a party ?
we heard that he knocked down one of the thieves too
you can ’ t fool around here the way you did outside
pu , point it out to her
although we ’ ve lost our parents we ’ re living in luxury , yet we have a lot to upset us
when he reached tu 's house , his arrival was announced by the gate−keeper
may the new year bring you great happiness and good fortune , wealth , nobility and peace
suppose he agreed to what you proposed and got money from us after the case was settled , of course that would be that for the time being
in any case , we have too many maids
just now i was afraid you might say something tactless and set our mistress weeping again : that 's why i hustled you out
then , sick as he was , pao wen−ching went out to buy a house and two sets of theatrical costumes which he hired out to two companies
when he had inspected these and supervised the arrangement of the sacrificial vessels , he changed into his slippers , draped a big raccoon cloak over his shoulders , and made the servants spread a large wolfskin rug at the top of the steps by the pillars so that he could sit in the sun watching his junior clansmen collect their gifts
and lady wang , who liked peace and quiet , returned too after her mother-in-law ’ s departure
the others approved this as more original
marvelling at her presence there , he was again about to question the monk when the latter pulled him through the archway
you must try again some other day when you have time
i ’ m starting to beat the drum , ’ she warned
over this he wore a turquoise fringed coat of japanese satin with a raised pattern of flowers in eight bunches
no , i ’ m not partial , the old lady declared
now baoyu , the only one of the three young men to have stayed with his grandmother , described how the prince had entertained him and displayed the jade given him
siqi ’ s mother sobbed bitterly then with remorse
she ’ s got herself some plum-blossom as well
'what 's yours is mine , and all that 's mine is yours
dear nanny , he coaxed , just two more cups -- - that ’ s all
how did you happen to hear ?
it 's that fellow who asks for me each single time
he decided that the cedar-boards he had seen would not do for the coffin and was searching for something better when xue pan called to offer condolences
so lady wang left first with lady xing , while xifeng retired to a small three-roomed annex to reflect as follows :
separate lists were made of all the furnishings and the mansions conferred on the duke of rongguo
he swears i ’ ll never escape him , not even if i marry someone outside , no , not even if i go to the ends of the earth he ’ ll have his revenge in the end
who ’ s not doing it for fun ?
then general tortoise at yuandi 's feet stood up to say , 'you fellows are useless , but i have a plan
then why do you want to leave them now ?
having given these orders , he hoisted one foot on to the bench , and started massaging the small of his back with his fists , saying , i envy you farmers these days
his father nodded with a faint smile amid another chorus of approval
since zhen yingjia was so struck by baoyu , he did not ask about bao yong but kept exclaiming truly extraordinary !
what is this place ?
i have heard say that the cow was not his father at all
his thoughts wandering in this foolish way , he went back to his room and got hold of xiren to explain the situation
finally , the altar having been cleared , they offered up thanks to the heavenly generals
next she rummaged in her waistband for a while and fished out twelve paper figures -- two of human beings and ten of devil~ with white hair and blue faces -- which she gave to the concubine
so let ’ s take this chance to find fault with some of the older and more obstreperous ones , and send them home to get married
so merely taking you on wouldn ’ t count as too many
you ’ d better go right away , miss
i know the old abbot too , whom you saved just now
you do not know how i feel , miss , said xiren
i ’ d marry another who might be just as bad
just wait for them here
with that he gave a long sigh and breathed his last
liu xianglian ran riot after a bout of drinking , but now that he ’ s sobered up he ’ s filled with remorse
after this he collected all the other essays and took them away with him
chou chin made a mental note of this before sealing up their doors
she stuffed the pouch into her sleeve to conceal it from them , wondering where it could have come from , then hiding her consternation went on to see yingchun
you take such things too seriously , said aunt xue
instead of the feast and bath they had expected , the yu brothers spent a long time as mediators , then took their leave of their host
xiaohong burst out laughing
be sure to go in good time tomorrow
lady xing feeling wronged puts xifeng
the ladies ' trinkets were looted by the officers and runners and they were shut up in an empty room !
my mistress had the same idea , but she could hardly suggest it with all you young ladies living in the garden
there 's no need to go in , said pao when they reached their gate
you , who were once a patron , are reduced to making a living by your pen
my patron asked me to look out for hsun mei in wenshang county ; but i have done nothing about it !
so ascends ’ is derived from dawdles up , ’ she said
the only people there were members of jia zheng 's household , and she could not hold back her grief at the thought that both her husband and son had been arrested , her daughter-in-law was at death 's door , and her daughter was ill-treated by her husband , so that she had nowhere to turn
master is not at home and he wo not be back for some days
that would take three years
the next day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month , the festival of grain in ear
he turned to her be a good girl and tell him , will you , that the second master from the back lane has called
the old lady chuckled
when i was away you swindled us , forcing my daughter to flee , and now that they are bringing her back you bar the way !
as if i had time to bother about such things !
do you think it can be done ?
this is why the novel makes such a powerful attack on the paku essay and satirizes the scholars who try so desperately to become officials
at these words , pinger came out wiping her eyes
if a snake bites her , serve her right
my father-in-law and mother-in-law treat me as their own daughter
but i promise not to make trouble
just take a little tea from her and she starts ordering you about
this is that uncle of yours who came last year and said he would be back , said his wife , who had been watching from behind the screen
she asked in surprise
but how can we prevent such a calamity ?
spring is already here , shao−ching , he said , as they were sitting under the plum tree
later , when he blew out the light and lay down to sleep , she went back , very disappointed , to tell jingui and see what she would do
she looks completely natural
besides , this jade may be treasured here but to outsiders not in the know it ’ s quite useless , so why should anyone steal it ?
amid suppressed laughter , second sister was pushed forward and subjected to a carefully scrutiny
i dodged out of sight , and then yuanyang came along too
second sister looked so pathetic when she called that they sympathized with her , and when they were talking alone she would shed tears , but she never breathed a word against xifeng who had shown her nothing of her vicious side
now as this was just after the mid-autumn sacrifices , nuns from various nunneries had come to present sacrificial offerings , and lady wang had kept abbess zhitong of water moon convent and abbess yuanxin of ksitigarbha nunnery to stay for a couple of days
picking up his shoulder pole he led the two messengers into the house , while the headman advised the other man to make off
if she found out and relieved me of the job so as not to embarrass me , then i ’ d really lose face
daiyu got up slowly then and with a smile invited him to sit down
she decided not to tell qiaojie this but to make certain inquiries , which she did by discreetly questioning the maids and serving-women under her , who told her everything they had heard outside
no outsiders knew what went on in his house , so how could his mother be so well informed ?
just then , a maid announced xiren 's sister-in-law , from whom lady wang elicited that some relatives had proposed a match for xiren with a
mrs zhou hurried out to see who it was while granny liu hastened forward crying , sister zhou !
first she went to the lady dowager ’ s reception room to pay her respects as a grand-daughter of the house ; but before she could do so her grandmother and the others knelt to prevent her
some whiteness from the pear-blossom is stolen ,
we hurried off to investigate ; but it 's not true
and would you believe it , this so moved the goddess of mercy that she appeared to her one night in a dream
when both refused to go she grew quite frantic
we ’ ll keep it for the time being , jia zheng conceded
my young lady 's dying !
a young maid by the door of the inner room at sight of her announced , here ’ s madam zhu !
after the midday meal he felt drowsy
before she could start a new couplet , daiyu put in :
i have my own people outside
we know your way of talking , madam , they said
who could think it a bad match in any respect ?
finding him out , she looked through the books on his desk and discovered the passage in zhuang zi which he had been reading the previous evening
what ’ s to be done then ?
he 's not at home just now
just tell me the symptoms of this malady
that 's why she drowned herself in a fit of passion
what a thing to say !
if you will allow me to accompany your carriage there , we can talk in the inn
____________________ chu yuan−chang , the first emperor of the ming dynasty , is alsosometimes called emperor hung wu
so i told her
as the proverb says : we learn from experience
i did ask him just now
they agreed to keep this to themselves and feign ignorance of miaoyu 's kidnapping , not taking any action till the return of the masters and mistresses
when i changed just now in such a hurry , i took it off and put it on the small table on the kang instead of wearing it
luckily for him , dr yu was examiner that day , with another official to help him invigilate
or : the fourth mr peng has written me a letter from peking
this fellow ling must be asking us to a meal too , said yu yu−ta
now that you have become a gentleman , went on butcher hu , you must do things in proper style
why is not he back yet ?
you have no right to stop me from going in !
who will pity me pining away for the yellow flowers ?
besides , unknown to her , the old lady long ago decided on one of the girls in our garden
after some time he found some dry shoes and socks to change into ; but when the priest came to ask whether he had eaten , he did not like to admit that he had not ; so he said he had , and went hungry the better half of a day
i don ’ t see how you can condemn them so sweepingly
i ’ ll see to the incense myself
there are forty rolls of serpent-patterned brocade , a hundred and twenty rolls of coloured silk and satin and a hundred and twenty garments for all four seasons
she repeated at last
when the tea was drunk , the general took his leave , and the other two escorted him to his chair
the passersby commented appreciatively that no other family but the jias could afford to put on such a lively entertainment
zijuan is one of our household ; so -naturally she needn ’ t bring her
after breakfasting they began to stroll outside
get her to make sure your second aunt agress before we make any decision
i mean to call on him tomorrow , said dr yu
if you make another rum-pus , i will wash my hands of you
thirty or forty miles from chengtu , the abbot left his inn early one morning to go out and enjoy the scenery , and walked into a tea−house for some tea
luckily the partition stopped her from slipping to the ground
it ’ s because he ’ s lost it that he ’ s out of his mind
if so , you are crazy
he was panic−stricken , and thought , both complaints are true , and if i have to appear in court i shall lose face
jingui was too amorous to live without a man and had long been hankering after xue ke , but hers was a case of beggars ca not be choosers
she called two old nurses and ordered them to take baoyu there and see that he was not frightened
she hurriedly took off her finery and sent a steward to mysterious truth temple to have all the taoist priests there locked up until her husband came back to question them
even the sage confucius learned from the musician xiang , and as soon as he played a piece he realized that this was king wen ’ s music
the old lady 's just feeling a bit easier in her mind , yet here you are starting fresh trouble
jia zhen had to drag the boy over
slap twenty-three this year and not yet married
don ’ t you call that extraordinary ?
when this was reported to jia zheng the others laughed and remarked , what a queer , stubborn boy
tonggui was smart enough to call out , madam , here ’ s the old lady to see you !
when at last his household arrived in four boats , which moored by the riverside house , tu took leave of the lu family and moved to his new quarters
it ’ s lucky you ’ ve come
most of the company paid no attention ; but baoyu , understanding , lowered his head while caiyun , having a guilty conscience , blushed
why do not you find yourself a riverside house , sir ?
the maids at once took it and put it in the vase , while all the others expressed their appreciation
you know , madam , what master bao is like and how he enjoys amusing himself with us girls
how could you take him to the garden today , with him just over his illness ?
i haven ’ t told qingwen because she ’ s as hot-tempered as crackling charcoal
niu pu dared not refuse , and that evening niu yu−fu bought a chicken and wine for a farewell dinner upstairs
while merry-makers , feasting , toast the snow
the servant handed the silver to tu 's boy , and went in
it was truly a world of crystal and precious stones !
she marched over to open the chest containing provisions , and sure enough found a dozen eggs in it
i seldom drink it
after several more stages , the two brothers disembarked and continued by road to chenyuan prefecture , where they sent whiskers yiu on ahead to announce their arrival , and followed him to their father 's yamen
you live so far away , she said , in hot or cold weather you may find the journey too much
so another batch of amorous sinners are bent on making trouble by reincarnation , commented the taoist
a rich house , all its members at peace ,
in joy , yu treated them to a meal , then sent them off with a tip
baochai looked up and rose swiftly to her feet , saying , ever so much better , thank you for your kind concern
let 's go first to the different quarters to have a look
which mr chi was that ?
that ’ s even truer of us
he kept the courier to a meal , presented him with several taels for the road and the messenger with another two taels , then dismissed them
conscious of his gaffe , baoyu tried to cover it up
i am ready to go with them !
as she alighted she saw before her a clear waterway winding like a dragon
i don ’ t want that tiara
can they count on remaining rich all their lives ?
that ’ s how someone with education and good manners ought to behave
she was advising you for your own good , yet you keep taunting her
when their plans were made and she was ready to leave , madam you returned yuanyang ’ s two taels with the explanation :
and don ’ t let anyone spread foolish talk about this being a miracle
just then her young maid zhener appeared
if there ’ s anything i overlook , come and let me know before the old lady asks and i ’ m stumped for an answer
take it easy till the old lady ’ s in a good mood , then you can tell her about it and ask to have qingwen back
he 's been up a long time
fastening his clothes again he sat down by the lamp to think hard , then picked up a sweetmeat and scrutinized it intently
so he said , i have long known of your talents
siqi said , a woman can only marry once
lady xing had always considered xifeng extravagant and jia lian unreliable and would therefore not let any money out of her hands
what a fright you gave me !
as the day of the funeral approached , a thousand and one affairs kept xifeng so busy that she had no time to eat and was hardly able to have a moment ’ s rest
hsiao yun−hsien enjoys the snow on kwangwu mountain
the ning mansion ’ s main gate was thrown open , as were the ceremonial gate , the doors of the great hall , the lobby and the inner hall , the three inner gates , the inner central gate and the inner secondary gate-all the gates leading to the main hall
good sister , don ’ t worry , he cried
you must make good , child ! she exhorted him
when jia lian came home and observed xifeng ’ s irreproachable behaviour to second sister , he did not give the matter a second thought
we ’ re to hire instructors , buy girl actresses and musical instruments and costumes there
as a matter of fact , i ’ ve thought of a chance for you
for if this came to the ears of the old lady and lady wang , how angry they ’ d be !
we are going to look at the poems now , announced li wan
she announced , before drinking , the loser must quote one line from a classical essay , one from an old poem , one domino ’ s name , one name of a melody , and one line from the almanac
why should we eat here with these dolts ?
do not be cross , granny , she begged with a smile
was not there talk some years ago of an affair between her and their master bao ?
she struggled out of bed and opened her case , from which she took a piece of gold of a fair size
chu saw that prefect wang appeared to hesitate
with that she hurried home with her two maids
by cutting down like this in all our apartments we ’ d save a good deal of money and grain every year
but even so , they should have let me see her and clear myself -then she would not have died with such a sense of grievance !
baoyu clasped his friend ’ s hands and asked through tears , what last message have you for me ?
to him a murder charge was just a trifle which could easily be settled with some filthy lucre
but jingui , delighted to have her mother-in-law take her side , behaved still more arrogantly in her gratification at this and out-manoeuvred him by simply ignoring him
she caught hold of her , begging :
those on which the standard rates are charged are to be returned to you , together with your title-deeds
none the less , he sent servants to make ready one of his own houses for when he decided to move
you are crying for nothing
whoever these spirits may be , thought ma chun−shang , i doubt if they determine official careers
the rogue craned his neck , daring our master to hit him
he hurried off to the main hall , returning presently with a talisman on a tray covered with a red silk sutra wrapper with a dragon design
aunt xue nearly choked , trembling with anger
but he simply glared at the officer and refused to kneel
do not you realize , brother , said wang jen , it 's because last year he passed candidates who wrote essays in an out−moded style ?
how can you turn him out ?
i want to make it up to you all by giving you another day of fun
it ’ s too bad she has no chance to show her kindness
since they are doing this of their own free will i will accept whatever they bring , but it wo not make any difference to my decision
he flew into such a frenzy , he nearly turned the whole household upside down !
she read it through , found it satisfactory , and gave orders that the presents should be distributed
lingguan must have taken a fancy to something and he 's out trying to procure it for her
she had them brought to her and on closer inspection found them even sweeter
when he had gone , ting−hsi consulted with his wife
how is baoyu today ?
where is xinger now ?
i am attached to master bao 's apartments
jia zheng was astounded
soup was carried in from the kitchen with a big dish of dumplings and a plate of fried cakes
then attendants served tea which they drank
but let it be as your majesty pleases
i just want you to understand
the day that spring takes wing and beauty fades
but if you adopt him and have the trouble of bringing him up , i sha not take any money from you
then you ’ d better go to bed early
but to know who it was , you must read the next chapter
do your parents mind what friends you make ?
meanwhile xifeng had summoned two old nannies from baoyu ’ s quarters
a young man in his teens who passed was considered senior to an unsuccessful candidate , even if the latter were eighty years old
when relatives ask her out , she should wear it to look different from the common herd
keep what i ’ ve told you in mind !
but do not be so upset
a few days after his return , ting−hsi took the letter to number one scholar 's square for chi tien−yi
is it su jo−lan ?
all right , i under-stand
are they paid in full every month ?
next , she heard what sounded like a man 's footsteps and a window being opened
these few are all we ’ ve got left for making sauce with
next one , said yuanyang
but i am afraid , though they wo not say so , they will secretly resent the fact that now i have she broke off at this point blushing
he bought pork each day with the proceeds from his fortune−telling , and when he had eaten his fill he would sit at his table by literary virtue bridge reading poetry
daiyu after reading these lines was plunged in grief
meanwhile , hiding her resentment , she went on tormenting xiangling
who 's going to abuse you ?
the following day the youth came in again , and when he had done so for four or five days the monk could restrain his curiosity no longer
then we ’ ll choose a day for the wedding , not engaging musicians but following the example of-the palace , fetching the bride over in a sedan-chair with eight bearers and twelve pairs of lanterns
i never thought she ’ d come here at this time or that , having come , the old lady would take such a fancy to her
to write a poem
you and i are of the same rank
there were also associate examiners who helped to look through the essays , and some of the chief local officials served as invigilators
since , according to the portent , tigers appear at dusk , she must have been taken ill in the evening
what do you say ?
when he did not answer , she repeated the question
after father and sons had left , she was thinking of going over to see the old lady when the foster-mothers of fangguan , ouguan and ruiguan were announced
after my death , i beg you to watch over your nephew as he grows up
then he asked what had become of pieh chuang−yen , the miao chieftain , and feng chun−jui
she said , 'she 's come all that way with a load of things ; let her spend the night here and go back tomorrow
what an odd thing to say !
though xifeng forced hersejf to crack a joke or two , she was less witty and amusing than before ; but the old lady egged her on , in the hope of diverting baochai
so that ’ s the reason
a few strings of cash may not be much , but it was a rare honour
you ’ d have done better to show me in the first place
but pin−niang was born unlucky—her old trouble has started again
upon entering the hall , he wanted to pay his respects before the shrine of his former tutor ; but the two brothers declined again and again
when kuang chao−jen heard this , he sighed to himself as he thought : so rich men are unfilial sons ; but a poor man like myself who wants to be a good son ca not
just across the river is ko lai−kuan 's house
as yingchun lives on purple caltrop isle , let her be mistress of caltrop isle , suggested baochai
they strolled round the garden of concentrated fragrance and were served first with tea then wine ; but it was simply an informal gathering of the womenfolk of both houses for a family feast , with nothing of special interest to record
baoyu , not yet fully recovered , was the only one not to go
it was nothing worth mentioning
all is ready for you to look over , sir , he announced
i should hope not , indeed !
all you need do is tell mr chin to give you the five hundred taels to deposit in a pawnshop , just paying me thirty taels first for minor expenses
then the two men went away
children wo not give me a moment 's peace !
if not for this hill , observed jia zheng , one would see the whole garden as soon as one entered , and how tame that would be
but remarry as soon as he ’ s dead
yes , we ’ d forgotten them , chuckled the lady dowager
if you had not asked me today , i could not very well have told you
this was too much for lovely , and they started bickering from their respective places
but that only made mrs xia and her son set up a still greater clamour
as for our master bao , sir , that ’ s a strange story
xiren frantically clapped her hand over his mouth
and i ’ ll bring it up again in a couple of days
why not come with me to enjoy the strange sights here instead of puzzling your head over these silly riddles ?
he has no sense of what ’ s fitting either
so suppose we sit up together to enjoy these sweetmeats and wine that i ’ ve brought with me ?
they veiled my virtue , by their envy urged
during the first interval , from his seat at the head of the hall he watched this candidate in the linen gown come up to hand in his paper
he 's an official in the provincial governor 's yamen at soochow , with a salary of a thousand taels of silver a year
at the close of this song shiyin stepped forward
some squeezed inside while the others packed
in my own case , if i had any luck i should die now with all of you around me ; still better if your tears for me were to become a great stream and float my corpse away to some quiet spot deserted even by crows or any other birds , to vanish with the wind , never again to be born as a human being
arrange two matches for them
he saw jasper lutes , rare bronze tripods , ancient paintings , new volumes of verse nothing was lacking
bring her some snuff , baoyu told sheyue
how much more so in our case ?
on his return he said to the old man : we have treated you very shabbily , uncle , giving you such a poor meal
then baoyu reined to a halt and turned to ask :
the most famous physicians and the most fabulous drugs were of no use at all
we not only do not need a middleman , there 's no need for a written agreement
let ’ s see how he proceeds now to the fourth mistress
just send a boy tomorrow to ask doctor wang for some medicine , and that will set me right
it is certainly very strange , replied feng
that would have cost more , he said
as long as this is kept from her , we ’ re all right
still nothing proved of any use
now you ’ ve forgotten and say we ’ ve kept it
well , you are not a scholar anyway
li wen named the melody two scholars go to peach-blossom stream , and li wan who was next to her quoted :
just listen to him !
this had nothing to do with me
as for the maids , some doubled up in hysterics , others sneaked outside to squat down in a fit of giggles , yet others controlled themselves sufficiently to fetch clean clothes for their young mistresses
why carry on like this ?
she has no sense of dignity and is too gullible
then , unable to bring himself to it , he could only rage for a while
i made qiuwen go for her meal , and just now pinger called sheyue out to have a word with her
well , i sha not question you now
when i came round , i remember seeing a shaft of golden light in the hall which shone on to my bed
give it to me , or i ’ ll break your arm
as they entered they heard crying inside the house , but soon this stopped and a meal was served
why do not you teach that spiteful brat of yours to behave himself ?
sixth master also invariably referred to his cousins as first master and second master
he grasped at once what was wanted and hurried into town to get the chief secretary to write a letter in jia lian ’ s name , and set off with it that same night for changan county
but you must find it dull sitting here
xianglian stepped forward to have a look at him and , knowing the oaf to be unused to beatings , gave him only a few light punches in the face which instantly turned all the colours of a fruit stall
wang , he said , our young master is very ill , and the young mistress asked me to invite you over
if you were to go on like this till you had no achievements to your credit and your reputation was damaged , you could accuse me of disloyalty for not putting the facts before you
the sound in the courtyard made them wake with a start and prick up their ears , but nothing more could they hear
emboldened by this , qiutong went to second sister ’ s window to scream abuse at her , making her feel even more wretched
dismounting , they led their horses behind the screens , then stood to attention , their faces turned towards the west
this is your brother ’ s share
not knowing what had happened , fan chin 's mother had hidden herself in the house for fear
i believe your name is wei , sir , he said
'he felt he had to thank me ; but if i would acknowledged helping him , he would have had no face left
one day he went out of the city to check on the acreage of arable land , and passing through the county of esoteric understanding he reached the ford in the stream of rapid reversal
if it 's green crickets you want , our village is swarming with them , but you never go there
laughing and talking all the way , chin and feng soon reached nanking and went to their homes
i did not want to tie up xiangling , aunt xue told him
he found the bawd just inside the gate , threading cassia into balls with a flower−seller
with that she settled down for a nap , and the rest of the party dispersed
this silver is your fee as scribe
it ’ s quite simple really
when fenger explained xifeng 's inability to entertain the guests , lady xing suspected her of shamming and shirking , but did not like to say this in the presence of so many relatives
i remember now , xiren said she was going to the pool at noon to wash some clothes
there 's a very good diviner here from the south , a man called mao banxian
she ’ s going to question madam lian as well
li wan said , that sounds easy
not finding much of interest here , ma chun−shang got up and walked nearly a mile further
tsang chi kowtowed as well
what the devil 's your hurry ?
they all laughed heartily
with no answer but a smile he left with qin zhong
if you refuse it , i shall think you ’ re offended
this is what we mean by not letting the words interfere with the sense
baoyu had to rack his brains and then declaimed :
so that 's who it is
her four chief maids get one tael of silver a month , the others only a few hundred cash apiece
in a frenzy , jia lian asked who it was that had fetched that fellow hu and had the man beaten within an inch of his life
they throw their money away on other people
the next day chu wrapped up two taels of silver and took these with some ham and other delicacies to literary ocean bookshop to say goodbye , taking home two volumes of the newly published examination papers
she hastily put down her chopsticks and stooped to retrieve it
we still have to return him to his original place and record his experiences in the world , so that he wo not have descended there for nothing
after these reflections she turned to xiren with a smile
yes , sir , replied chih
is the old lady well ?
his wife was causing a fine commotion , moving furniture
i returned home at the end of winter the year before last and was sent to inspect some works , after which i served as grain commissioner of jiangxi until i was impeached and came back to the capital to my old post in the ministry of works
does not huan have his fair share of clothes , shoes and socks , not to mention a whole roomful of maids and servants ?
i ’ ve no new jokes , but i ’ ll just have to brazen it out
it 's not my place to speak ill of our mistress , but after one of her daughters was made an imperial consort she became too overbearing !
mist from the hills links the forests ’ greenery ;
the fact is , the manager here has engaged me for several months to select essays , and i have a few taels of silver as salary ; but i have to keep part of this for my own expenses
he is now in gaol pending a decision on his case from the provincial governor
of course he is
yes , an old family friend
it gives a lucid account of musical theory and clear instructions for playing
except xue pan , who shook his head
magistrate hsiang wanted to raise him up and to bow in return
his salary would be twelve taels of silver a year , and it was arranged that he should eat with the monk , whom he would pay two cents a day
li wan told them gaily , before we ’ ve got our club going , someone ’ s trying to wriggle out
and when it came to jia she ’ s turn , the manager caught sight of baoyu
it ’ s like fragrant osmanthus , observed daiyu
may i venture to ask your honourable district ?
we were looking just now in that small pavilion at the foot of the hill , and luckily the night-watchers were awake
as soon as they were alone , the old women started talking as they ambled along
we must have this out after i ’ ve won back my money
it would be another matter if our family couldn ’ t afford ginseng ; but your father and mother-in-law can easily give you two catties of ginseng a day , not to mention two drains
when we have finished our meal and the wind has shifted , i will give you ten taels
well then , go to their homes and fetch them , urged the maid
don ’ t be angry , your lordship !
though she was so weak that she felt the bed beneath her painfully hard , she stuck it out
otherwise it will look as if you ’ re still angry with xifeng
what an elder sister-in-law you are !
don ’ t tease him when he ’ s feeling low , she scolded
the bodhi tree is no tree , the mirror no mirror clear ;
baoyu , huan and lan , who had left the room first , stood respectfully outside the door until jia zheng had gone before returning to ask the guest to sit down
her husband walked up to her bed
he 's at the gate and has left his chair
i ’ ve come to see mr zhou who came with lady wang when she was married , she told them with a smile
chi wei−hsiao went inside , closed the door , wrote for some time , sealed up his paper carefully and inscribed a taoist magic formula on it
tsang 's second name is liao−chai , said tu
baoyu ’ s face lit up
dispassionately appraising xiuyan ’ s character and behaviour , she found her unlike both lady xing and her parents , being extremely gentle and lovable
too bad , though , that it 's rather late in the day so close to the examination !
there are such men in the world , true ; but since we have raised this problem we ca not admit the possibility , for then there ceases to be any problem
you are wrong there , mr chih , protested kao
baoyu promptly passed on this request to xifeng , who ordered a serving-woman to take some venison to the garden
day after day she urged ha huan to go and ask for her , but he was too shy to speak and not too attracted by caixia in any case
this upset lady wang even more
it was now dawn
kuang chao−jen was about to choose an auspicious day for his return to yuehching when ching lan−chiang called to see him and invited him out to a tavern
if you were a man , you could go out and right wrongs , teased daiyu
there ’ s nothing wrong with plagiarism provided it ’ s well done , countered the others
if you want to know who came out , read the next chapter
as she was bustling frantically about , a messenger suddenly arrived to announce : you ’ re to leave after serving the morning meal
tell me , third brother , he said , what made you so set on this salaried scholar 's rank ?
xiren hasn ’ t time to look after so many girls
so i brought your nephew here to ask for your help
to shield baoyu from his father ’ s displeasure lady wang said , it was the old lady ’ s idea
i couldn ’ t leave her before , especially not with my daughter-in-law so senseless
of course i do , but you took me by surprise
very well , they said
sending a hand-stove over from my quarters as if my hosts didn ’ t possess such a thing !
in the ning mansion
yucun summoned the plaintiff for questioning
striking the palms of both hands together she sneered :
one is already betrothed ; the other would be just right for your honourable son
did you hear that ?
opposing sides obey the self-same rule
the story-tellers rose to apologize
mr pao is twenty−three , and has no parents , no brothers , no children
baoyu clapped a hand over her mouth
i find poetry very easy , but with this i ’ m getting nowhere , he reflected as he sat there , his mind in a whirl
but there 's no one at home to see to things unless we rope in qiang and yun
there 's no need for tables either ; each of us can have a teapoy with a couple of dishes we fancy , as well as a ten-compartment box of titbits and a winepot apiece
well , now i ’ ve forgotten how to
that 's what i think , answered baochai
then they took their leave of xichun and went on to yingchun ’ s place
as the others thought of and called out the names of a dozen games , she put them down on separate slips of paper , which were roiled into spills and put in a vase
because he would been helped by both mansions , for fear of being accused of shielding them he gave them a vicious kick -that 's why they were raided
you helped a great many people in the past , but none of them come here now
only the other day , said yen
niu pu saw them out and had barely time to wish the old monk a safe journey before the horses galloped off with pounding hooves
not a workman but a waiter , li er replied
three or four days after this , his elder brother jumped into the river and was drowned ; but how can he blame me for that ?
of baoyu and xifeng
that little bitch isn ’ t cut out for such great fortune , nor are we for such good luck
not until prompted by xiren did he say yes
i thought he had already completed his studies and would soon pass the metropolitan examinations , she concluded
i heard say some scandal ’ s come to light and she wants to ask baoyu about it
not a single paper had been read to the end !
if you call that a poem , scoffed daiyu , i can write you a hundred
the twelve new songs called a dream of red mansions ’ , ordered disenchantment
if your girls are lucky enough to hit it off with these two young gentlemen , their fortunes are made
the best store of grain and dried fruits is to be found in the temple at the foot of this hill
you should not have come , protested the old lady
i ’ ve never seen anyone so clumsy !
i think it ’ s an excellent choice
then they all surged after mrs fang 's shrine into the temple
after that , without further delay , he went to the examination at the capital , and in this examination he won the third place
just now she sent me to happy red court to deliver something
a whole lot of robbers have come , all in boots and official caps they'er opening cases , overturning crates , ransacking the whole place '
it started that day when i quarrelled with you and called her in to wait on me
quite right , quite right , he cried
but i think if you sponsor it , madam , it should come off
if our mistress were to give away the whole house , i ’ d get no face from it
besides , to be logical , the second part should refer to what precedes it
that ’ s why the last generations never engaged a teacher from outside but just picked some elderly , fairly scholarly kinsman to run the family school
if it weren ’ t for that , she ’ d like some too
the runner withdrew to sit in the gate−house
his household isn ’ t too well regulated
ask the gentlemen in charge
goblets fly here and there as men carouse
the brothers gazed at each other in silent dismay , then ordered the pig 's head to be taken to the kitchen for the servants to eat
disturbed by these noises , she told zijuan to let down her bed-curtains
she gives others the best and you the cast-offs , yet you feel you have big face
'leave the withered lotus to hear the patter of rain
two serving-women had the portiere raised and two others ushered him in , while baoyu came out to greet him
lucky she who enjoys rank and riches in old age ;
i believe my grandmother and aunt had just come back from bowing to the ancestral portraits , and the old lady 's new red woollen cape was lying there
please sit down while i study this carefully , he said
but to know who he was , you must read the following chapter
'this is a bad sign !
after checking quickly through the list and asking lai sheng number wife a couple of questions , she went home in her carriage
what with one trouble after another here , we have forgotten about her marriage
granny liu assented readily and followed xiren out to the young maids ’ room where she was told to sit down
i alone , it seems , know your worth
i won ’ t mind his being offended if i say he ’ s still a baby
we can discuss it together
and now she ’ s got us into trouble too
this seems very strange
the rules of prosody are secondary , the main thing is to have original ideas
but i do not know how to say it , uncle
if anyone sneaks off without asking leave and isn ’ t on hand when called , holding up our business , you ’ re to beat him for me and drive him out forthwith !
for you she would do it for love , but not for me
the pennons shook like serpents in the wind
why make an exception in this case ?
but we are too poor to entertain you to a proper feast : we can only offer you a cup of watery wine
this had been going on for some time when one day , as luck would have it , jia dairu went home early on business , giving the boys a seven-character line to be matched with another and promising them a new lesson in the classics the next day
as he said this , he offered yu tea
carefully explain the passage and the gloss
then he called in all his subordinates to examine them about possible spoils , not allowing them to conceal anything , so that all squeeze should come to him ; and he checked on them every few days
only three fairy isles on the giant turtle ’ s back have left a name
chang has come time and again to get money : he is a confounded nuisance , he thought
her voice faltered here from distress and she burst out sobbing
it will take mr pao some time to notify everyone ; so we must allow a couple of weeks for that
they did not need any help
but poets will never tire of singing it ,
though i don ’ t understand music , it does sound too sad , baoyu agreed
lady xing being now reduced to tearful silence , lady wang swore at jia huan , concubine zhao was a bitch , and she left behind her a misbegotten scoundrel !
very well , i ’ ll give you until tomorrow
though miss tanchun ’ s an unmarried young lady , you ’ ve all misjudged her
i did not blame you
in addition to describing scholars who are eager to become officials , wu ching−tzu depicts many pseudo−scholars who are cheats and charlatans
when kuang chao−jen heard ching speak of all these scholars , he asked : i suppose you also know mr ma chunshang who compiles essays for literary expanse bookshop ?
before yuanyang could explain someone inside called out , the old lady ’ s woken !
then the troops concealed in the gully rose up together , their shouts reaching the skies
if there ’ s anything you want , tell zijuan to let me know
then , smiling , she said in a low voice , these two tunics and this skirt , four headscarfs and packet of embroidery silks are from me , granny
after a little reflection she went on :
he was beginning to be intensely irritated when the salt commissioners arrived , and after them the local salt gabelle officials , the prefect of yangchow and the magistrate of chiangtu county
the old lady thought back and chuckled
for fear it might not have stood up to the heavy rain this summer , i rode over on my own to have a look and , sure enough , found it slightly damaged
one came to make love , one to spy ;
one afternoon his grandfather , old mr niu , was sitting in the shop with no customers to serve when old pu who owned the rice shop next door dropped in for a chat
but even if he were here , he could not raise such a sum at a moment 's notice
in surprise he remarked , she ’ s so aloof and unconventional that she looks down on everybody
pity silly lads and plaintive maids hard put to
sagacious prince , risest thou not from sleep ?
that evening he opened the old monk 's room and slipped in
too bemused still to know who was speaking , he seized her hands
if you should find yourself short of funds on the ' way , sir , since you will be passing lai shangrong 's place you can enlist his help
i know all the paths in the wild miao settlements , he said
watch out for the fireworks outside , or you may get burnt by some of the sparks raining down
now that his turn had come to pay a forfeit , he also took paper and brush and wrote a four-lined verse which he handed to jia zheng
very soon the stranger returned
what are you still kneeling there for , you treacherous dog ?
you are making your way up , are not you ?
the circle , however , was only half complete , the other half being conspicuously vacant
she ’ s not very well
cried the lady dowager
from the marble balustrades on either bank lanterns of crystal and glass of every description shed a silvery light , clear as snow
they had not the stately splendour of the other mansion , yet nothing was lacking in the way of trees , plants or artificial rockeries
i have just come from auntie , she told him
wouldid not you hear him talk of the zhen family ?
most of his previous posts had been in the capital , and he thought all official tasks the same , for even when appointed as examiner outside he had had no dealings with the local administration
it was then already the first watch , so they all went back to their own rooms to rest
what were you doing in there just now ?
and since chih heng−shan and wu shu were close neighbours , he sent them notes inviting them over to meet his cousin
although already tipsy uncle xing did so , and the others went on carousing until they were all rather drunk
baochai , trying to console her , felt such a stab of anguish that she could not help sobbing too , while xiren was so prostrated with grief that qiuwen had to support her
when he had taken off his official robes and sat down in the same room as before , he asked pao wen−ching and his son to come in
when that old woman took his bowl to pour some for you , he said at once , i ’ ve dirtied that bowl ; you must wash it first
you are afraid your cousin lin may hear and be cross with me for singing baochai 's praises -- right ?
from what she overheard she realized that the match proposed had not been agreed to
are not you old mr zhen , sir ?
because master lian thought him an honest fellow he had him and his wife transferred here
his diagnosis was that her menstruation was irregular and some tonic would set her right
he can say i ’ ve been kept by the prince and will soon be back anyway
how did she seem ?
do take it back for her
and if he had time in the middle of the day , he went out to play chess with the neighbours
this thrashing on an empty stomach and kneeling in the wind to read essays completed the wretched youth ’ s misery after his freezing night
back in her own quarters , the old lady made lady wang sit down to supervise the rooms ’ arrangement
besides , think of all the trouble we had before things turned out well
xiangyun guessed that he was referring to her find
to try their luck
ting−hsi shed tears as he took the money , and a few days later moved into a room wang yu−chiu had cleared for him behind his shop
ignoring his sulkiness , baochai told sheyue and the other maids to keep an eye on him while she went to bed
and the curtains were let down too , so how can it have been a young gentleman ?
it ’ s not all that important , he said
it must be just like heaven !
stream and lonely hills glow with sunset at this hour
let 's hurry up and cook this venison
while they sipped the tea she had ordered , jia cong came in to greet baoyu
as a matter of fact , mr tu created a dangerous precedent , said chen
but as it is hard to describe all their secret thoughts , we shall have to content ourselves with recording their actions
her ladyship has been raking up ancient history , and i had to answer her questions one by one
if one of the maids there had found it and your girl cousins saw it , that would have been terrible !
now that the whole household knew that xiuyan was to marry aunt xue ’ s nephew , lady xing wanted to move her out of the garden
he asked with a grin
they ’ ve been debating it for half a year : one day it was to be the zhangs , next the lis , then the wangs
we ’ ll make it the seventh
lady wang had been scolding him , but at baochai 's entrance she stopped
why take a joke so seriously ?
then your father would not be so angry , and all my trouble would not have been in vain
she should be coming soon to say goodbye
i had no choice
once he has the means of doing so , he naturally becomes an opportunist
if you find the school cold , mind you put more on , because we shan ’ t be there to look after you
you got the same as miss xue , while miss lin and the three other young ladies were given fans and beads , nothing else
being a disrespectful lot , behind her back we all call her the sick beauty
what scent has the caltrop , pray ?
aunt xue then explained to xiangyun and daiyu what a pawn ticket was
after xifeng and baoyu reached home and had paid their greetings , baoyu told the lady dowager of qin zhong ’ s eagerness to attend their clan school , and the incentive it would be for him to have a friend and companion in his studies
if we were at my home i ’ d take a boat out
of course , i ’ m not all that fussy about my clothes , but what kindness has that woman ever done us ?
the peasant revolts and risings against the manchus of the early years of the ching dynasty had been suppressed
i don ’ t know what busybody went and reported this as if it was something of consequence , just to prove her loyalty
i was wearing it till you grew angry
let each family pay its share , and you will get the thing going
he was rather taken aback to find them performing operas like master ding finds his father , huang boyang deploys ghosts in a battle , monkey plays havoc in heaven and the patriarch jiang kills generals and deifies them
jia zheng read the next riddle :
not venturing to follow her , he stood there woodenly in a daze and sighed , what have i done wrong to make them all cut me like this ?
so i took it from her double-quick and gave her a piece of my mind , not knowing you ’ d hear
you can give more if you want
i ’ ll drink with you some other time
are these your lodgings ?
bring the silver in at once
the next day fan chin had to call on relatives and friends
unable to refuse , jia lian had to take his leave of jia zheng and set off
if we take his word for it and there ’ s worse trouble of this kind in future , how are we to control these servants ?
well , i have a fox-fur , but i don ’ t care for the way the fringe hangs and was meaning to have it altered , said xifeng
once your marriage is fixed , that ’ number be double happiness for you !
if we were writing a composition to speak for confucius , we should take exactly the line we are taking now the scholars ' ranks were filled with such brazen hypocrites
no , i shall just have to slave away myself
can you spare me a few odd pieces ?
what a pity i came too late to take part in that magnificent ceremony !
soon several dozen guests had gathered , but the last to arrive were three men in square caps accompanied by a taoist priest , whom nobody knew
panic-stricken lady wang could not tell whether it was genuine or not
if this is how the board 's handled it , master xue has got off lightly !
it has to be kept burning day and night
but i can ’ t do any more
yet you talk like this , making us feel quite embarrassed
what remained of the money was spent on household needs
then you ’ ll have two homes , uncle
please put in a good word for us , mr pao
keep him on , i say , madam , and give him a good beating to teach him a lesson
observed the physician after feeling his pulse
why do you ask ?
she grabbed all our family property and brought it over with her at the time of her marriage
within and without the city stand monasteries and temples with green tiles and crimson roofs
that 's right , approved the rest
as we happened to start with poems on begonia , why not call it begonia club ?
wang wanted to look at these
he used to live in a tutelary temple where he took a few pupils , and every year he prepared for the examinations
raising its head it saw in the moonlight a man perched on the tree ; then it hurled itself furiously at kuo
he went back dejectedly to his own quarters to brood in gloomy silence
he cast them a sidelong glance
why not just discuss it with cousin ke ?
i just wanted to be clear on that before leaving , sir
you are too modest , sir
though this pavilion is open on all sides , one does not feel the least bit chilly here
even if you ’ re bursting with anger , put up with it for a few days
but you mustn ’ t leave this place
so that ’ s who it is
he was on the point of going in when he heard yuanyang say with a sigh :
meanwhile li wan wrote :
jia qiang being too absorbed in lingguan to notice , it was left to the other girls to see him out
so it 's you , shao−ching !
the next morning he washed with soap , changed into new clothes and scented himself lavishly ; then , with chi weihsiao 's paper in his sleeve , went by sedan−chair to divine pleasure temple
he called repeatedly but could not find him and , reaching the gate , saw li gui barring the way , refusing the monk admission
suddenly a wind sprang up and the red paper was blown to the ground , revealing the words underneath on the placard
as he was speaking , a servant came in
baochai asked them merrily
that evening on niu pu 's return , the old man demanded an explanation ; but niu pu was unable to clear himself and simply mumbled some literary jargon with a great deal of other nonsense
they ’ re all more likely than me to have such things
the next morning they parted , lu setting off for nanking to await chuang 's return
tell her i ’ m back and her ladyship is here too
his mother , not believing him , sent the page to question the gateman
he had come to beg permission to take her home
the chief steward did not beat about the bush
she asked , laughing herself before embarking on it
i ’ ve another good subject for him , put in xiangyun quickly
if you find one or two of the buildings not too tame , please condescend to re-name them yourself , that would make us extremely happy
do go to bed , little ancestor !
although i longed to trace you , i feared that as a mundane , vulgar official i would never see your saintly countenance again
taking their leave of xichun , they left smartweed breeze cot and followed a winding path which took them near bamboo lodge
the ushers led dr yu back by the west to his place as master of sacrifice , then returned to their own positions
on his way home the wind was against him and he felt rather unwell ; and by evening he had a headache and high fever so that he had to go to bed
seems to me things can ’ t go on the way they are now
unless , of course , he has some miraculous means of shortening the distance
through seemingly casual incidents , the novel gives a most penetrating exposure of the government at that time
this said , he left
it took them a whole day to settle matters to their satisfaction
how am i to write it ?
i have not seen you for a long time , li number four , said pan
daiyu just shook her head
do not bring too many crabs , xifeng told the maids
she had another table set and more hot crabs brought for xiren , zijuan , siqi , shishu , ruhua , yinger and cuimo
may a thunderbolt strike me if i don ’ t !
every day she takes eight silver cents ' worth of medicine ; and she wo not eat meat , but insists on duck one day , fish the next , and soup made of water−cress and fresh bamboo shoots on the third ; while in between she must have orange comfits , dragons ' eyes and lotus seeds to nibble at
will you took after it for me ?
and when she grows up and has her own family , if anything untoward happens , her bad luck will turn into good all because of this happy coincidence ’ in her name
the old man sighed
i will take my leave of you tomorrow
i heard it was because master bao kept an actor from some prince 's mansion , and they came to ask his lordship to send him back
one day when he could not buy even bread , a man in a square cap and black gown came in and greeted him
please calm down , madam
people ’ s temperaments differ , and just at the start she ’ s bound to feel a bit awkward
in the ninth month at the beginning of the frost they will sacrifice to the flag — the emperor as commander−in−chief and my uncle as his second in command
number oz dioseorea from the huai region ( cooked )
then the other two took their leave and went off with their maids
i ’ ll slap their faces for them , and in a few days we ’ ll deal with them properly
but we must not waste time talking
baochai is quite right , he agreed
these two new arrivals were both remarkably handsome
this is a government court
after kowtowing they stood there at attention
thus reminded , lady wang remarked to xifeng , last time we went for a stroll with the old lady in the garden , i noticed a girl with a willowy waist , sloping shoulders and eyes and eyebrows rather like daiyu ’ s
now i must go to see your mother-in-law before hurrying back to tell the old lady how you are
the waiter brought them rice , a bowl of fried wheat gluten and a bowl of beancurd , and the three of them started to eat
my name is pao , admitted ting−hsi , much surprised
the bill came to six coppers—which meant that he could not leave the tea−shop !
in addition , twenty-four lengths of satin and a hundred strings of newly minted cash were allotted to the women-servants and maids in attendance on the lady dowager , lady wang and the girls
i sent those rings to you by the page you would dispatched
they greeted each other and sat down
at sight of the priest they cried , you ’ ve come just at the right time , father !
just now we were talking face to face but you wouldn ’ t stay , he pointed out
xifeng had their orders read out and pointed at two of the four items
the lantern-sign above it bore the words , smartweed bank and flowery harbour
he probably began writing the scholars during the first years of chien lung 's reign , when he was nearing forty , and completed it before he was fifty
how could last year ’ s rain-water be as light and pure as this ?
i see very little difference between prince ning 's rebellion and that of emperor yung lo , put in lou chan
i know one of the magistrates in the sian prefecture , a mr yiu , who used to be a colleague of dr yu of the imperial
tomorrow ’ s the first of the eleventh month , isn ’ t it ?
he sighs or mumbles to the moon and stars , and has so little spirit he even puts up with the tantrums of those pert girls
he was born in the country of great trees in the western paradise
you must not take offence , responded xifeng quickly
that evening they spread a feast to welcome him , and lodged him in the library
as a matter of fact , i do not know
that 's why i invited you all here today to celebrate my granddaughter-in-law 's birthday
after madam you had gone over to see tanchun off that day , as it was already dark and she did not want to take a carriage , she decided to walk through the side-gate which had been made in the garden to give access to the ning mansion
yes , said old chin
speak for yourself , said daiyu
pinger ’ s not like that , he assured her
is your brother 's name hu chen ?
what happened next is related in the following chapter
and when a coffin was brought and her body laid in it , he clasped it and lamented bitterly before finally leaving them
wang jen and wang teh clapped their hands and roared with laughter , drinking until after midnight when they were carried home
could she be the girl who was killed ?
we must have a good meal ready for my brother when he comes back , he said
the officers there , assurning that they were going out on official business , did not even challenge them
she turned to xiangyun
theirs is not as good as ours
daiyu helps her true love
are you upset because you ’ ll all feel lonely while i ’ m at school ?
you ’ re right to tick him off for blurting out whatever comes into his head
after a while , the fat man said , mr
i feel the greatest respect for you
how can i celebrate it now ?
we have not seen you doing any business in the market
looking round carefully , he observed that everything in the temple was undisturbed with no sign of anything amiss
amazed , they invited wang tai to a feast
in sleep the vision recedes with the flight of swans ,
the outer wall has crumbled and will have to be rebuilt and a new stairway will have to be made as well
continuing up the road , he reached a large and magnificent temple built to the guardian deity , and into this he marched to have a look round
so though the stories referred to in these two riddles are fictitious , they ’ re mentioned in ballads and operas , even in temple oracles
he went on watching as the girl went on writing , but she merely repeated the same character
although shantung is a northern province , its chief city was rich and populous , packed with buildings
after the three months of the spring , all flowers will fade and each will have to find his own way out
in that case , she suggested , let xueyan go instead
after this , on the pretext of illness he stopped calling on his mother , being actually afraid to face her , sending his wife and son instead to pay their respects every day
in raptures he was wafted as if by magic into the mirror , where he indulged with his beloved in the sport of cloud and rain , after which she saw him out
especially as she was the invalid , not aunty
she went into the inner room then to lie down , turning the problem over in her mind
i ’ m going to ask all you girls , as well as the maids you brought with you , to take off your clothes to be searched
and after that she beamed at daiyu — after his wedding they ’ ll fix up a match for you , miss
she looked at the dragon and serpent designs on the sheath which was studded with bright pearls and jewels , then drew out the two swords , identical in size , one engraved with the word duck , the other drake
in the corridor outside the portiere the male members of the clan also sat in due order
what spiritual understanding has it got ?
i know you ’ re straight
so the foolish youth lost himself in rapturous day-dreams
then tang chose the best singers among the women captives , made them comb up their hair , put on their embroidered clothes , and sing and dance barefoot in the main tent , while all the soldiers , horses and officers hid themselves in the gully
it may not fit that scale
qingwen ’ s on the mend , and going home like this she ’ ll be able to rest quietly for a few days
wang took his teacup from him , and stood up to ask : have you heard recently from your uncle ?
ma bowed in return
for the sake of our friendship these years , please do this for me !
xue pan himself would ride a large black mule from the family stable , in addition to which a horse was provided for him too
look at that ignoramus , ting !
only two mouthfuls of the soup the old lady sent
then some old serving-women fetched in from the pages at the inner gate the presents the young masters had received
the second of the eighth month that year would be the old lady ’ s eightieth birthday , and all their relatives and friends were bound to come to offer congratulations
just now our mistress insisted that if i were to bring back the clothes the way fenger did , she ’ d be really angry with me
our treasury is empty
they untied xiangling too and made her lie down in bed
cousin zhen ’ s wife isn ’ t too old either , and she often brings along peifeng and others ; so this could equally well belong to them
jia yucun concludes the dream
it was granny liu who started it
besides , my brother will soon be getting married
in that case , not only would i be wasting my breath but taking an outrageous liberty
lady wang pushed baoyu to her bedside and the old lady reaching out one hand from the quilt took his hand
baochai went with them to peony bower , a small three-frame hail in red fragrance farm , where all the ladies of the house including even madam you had assembled
so you ’ re up to monkey tricks again , little wretch !
when the page had assented and left , nanny li and xiren were summoned and instructed to tell baoyu this to reassure him
where is your uncle bao ?
kidnappers of this type make a point of stealing small girls
this is no time for you to cry , he said , seeing niu pu weeping too bitterly to speak
daiyu did not fall asleep till nearly dawn
i will give you a hundred taels to start training a company
actually , sir , if i were you i ’ d have nothing to do with this
when my term of office is up and i come home , we will do some serious drinking together
having reached this decision , she sent the eunuch xia shouzhong to the rong mansion with the order : baochai and the other young ladies are to live in the garden , which is not to be closed
he went into the shop and sat down , picked up a copy of his book and looked at it , then asked the price and how the work was selling
they savour the last watches of the night
why try to blackmail people before finding out the facts and seeing the corpse ?
at the foot of the stage stood twelve pages , still too young to let their hair grow
as this was a special occasion , the lady dowager was determined that xifeng should have a whole day of unalloyed pleasure
you should put on a gown
these last few days she 's been unwell or else lamenting her fate
sixth master and wang yi−an walked out
he 's only been thrown off his balance because sudden joy made him choke on his phlegm
they wo not stay longer than they have to , and i shall give you some incense money
we ’ re so stupid , they chuckled , there ’ s something else we ’ d like you to explain
but still there was no improvement
as the proverb says : there are golden mansions in study ; there are bushels of rice and beautiful women
jia lian , coming home in high spirits after drinking , had allowed himself to be caught off his guard so that when his wife burst in he was quite at a loss
ting−hsi accepted the silver , and offered his brother wine
the clack of the portiere alerted xiren , who came out from the inner room
it ’ s something very wicked
no ordinary pills bring any relief , but he gave us an exotic prescription from across the seas , together with a packet of aromatic powder he ’ d procured as adjuvant goodness knows where
just think , madam , how could a younger sister-in-law know that her elder brother-in-law was going to get a concubine ?
qingwen picked up a hand-mirror and stuck the patches on her temples herself
but all this study does not seem to be getting you anywhere , and a bad job is better than none
this was built in the time of the duke—my father
that 's not fair , cried xiangyun
i didn ’ t dare tell grandmother , but it kept me from sleeping all night
aunt xue dismissed the page and went straight to the jia mansion to tell lady wang of this and appeal to her husband
my worthless son does not deserve such high praise , rejoined jia zheng hurriedly with a courteous smile
white-haired , she still washed clothes beside the stream
why , in that case we old women ought to live in stables !
you stay with your uncle or aunt
accordingly she urged her to make a start
he then bowed to aunt xue and filled her cup as well
when have i ever done such a thing ?
it ’ s not a pregnancy , just congestion of the blood
before they could finish some nurses came along
do i have honey on my hands that you squabble even over a cup of tea ?
the man who walked in wore a tile−shaped cap , a raw silk gown and a silk girdle , had a grey beard and looked over fifty
about twelve miles beyond yenchow he stopped at a village called hsin family station for tea
having said this she laughed
the doctor summoned by jia zhen to attend her diagnosed a chill which had upset her digestion , making her delirious and subject to delusions
she unbuttoned her red jacket and drew out a bright gold necklace studded with glittering pearls and jewels
by now he was dressed and she urged him to pay his respects to his grandmother and parents
besides , you both come from such well−to−do families that even if your husband does not become an official you will lack for nothing as long as you live
you ’ ve capped my attempt , admitted daiyu
let them sing whatever they think best
the master and miss lin are escorting his coffin to suzhou and should be home about the end of the year
in the rong mansion , lai da posted extra night-watchmen and locked the two main gates so that the only way in or out was through the small west side gate ; and at sunset he had the ceremonial gate closed , allowing no entrance or exit
she ’ s made up her mind to kill you
asked where the old lady was , they returned evasive answers
he came to another big temple , with tables before it at which tea was served ; and since his legs were tired , he sat down again
he should have drowned himself in his own piss and died in place of his father , for what ’ s his life worth ?
well now , let me see what this is
you ’ ll have plenty of time to grouse about me later
listening to shao−ching 's conversation is like drinking elixir , said chih heng−shan
here you are at last
they lit benzoin incense to calm him and made him lie down
how can you change with someone else ?
since jia zheng never took much interest in such matters , he made no objection
she thought it was another slip of the tongue , but he sobbed :
if mr fang is there , why do not you join him ?
she ’ s taking a nap now
but when you close the book and think , the scene rises before your eyes , and you realize it would be impossible to choose any better words
then he went down on one knee in salute , saying , bao yong pays his respects , sir
the only one paying any attention was daiyu , who was nodding at him with a look of speculation in her eyes
this is mr feng cho−an , answered niu pu−yi
why don ’ t you pinch her lips ?
why pin the blame on this person or that ?
he added , tomorrow when i have time , i mean to write on all twelve themes
you live here but do not know the first thing about it !
butcher hu dived into his daughter 's room and dared not come out , while the neighbours scattered in all directions
by beating her you make me feel bad too
tomorrow i shall ask the old lady to take you back
at home , he found his father ill , unable to leave his bed
wrecked by red cliff , choking the stream ,
the lady dowager and others went in and took seats , after which daiyu with her own hands brought her grandmother a covered bowl of tea on a small tray
bring him to court again when he is a captain
do not worry about that , brother
jia zhen has a son called rong just turned sixteen
the wind is soughing , the days drawing in ,
what 's this crispy stuff ?
he carried their luggage into the cabin , and the two women sat down with chiung−chih
soon after his arrival , he set out in a high carriage drawn by four horses on a tour of inspection of the various stations
all questions connected with the funeral can be decided by these gentlemen
my name is also niu
when you reach home you must work even harder ; and if you come to see me before you go to the prefecture for the next examination , i shall help you with your travelling expenses
i do not think any peach blossom stream is needed
you ruin your health by worrying so much
but what you did was even worse than the others laughing and making comparisons
cutting him short , jia she instructed him , go and tell your aunt about this , but do not let the old lady know
asked how it had happened , she told the old lady
and while some maids were serving tea , hupo came in with a whispered message for the old lady , who turned to tell xifeng :
who dreamed of such loveliness in the world of men ?
what with the pain in her side and her vexation , xiren ate nothing that evening
i ’ ve only two requests to make
in all these , especially the two last , gods , ghosts , monsters and ogres took the stage among waving pennants , temple processions , invocations to buddha and offerings of incense , while the din of gonging , drumming and shouting carried to the street outside
but the coat ’ s on the drab side
as soon as she had gone , qingwen felt tempted to give her a scare for fun
wouldesperation drives men to rebel and a dog to jump over a wall
but perhaps we shall meet again some other day
let me congratulate you
xinger announced with a grin , tell the second mistress that madam lian is here
he did not even ask his son what he meant by playing about outside and exchanging gifts with actors , or by neglecting his studies at home and attempting to rape his mother 's maid
she sent for xifeng , told her the master 's decision , and asked her to see to things
mr chou was the teacher in mr ku 's house
kuiguan , who had played warriors , kept her hair shaved over her temples and forehead as that had made it easier to paint a warrior ’ s face , and she was nimble too
it is nothing but a literary diversion to entertain readers
after you left , your third uncle took a fancy to our house
qingwen noticed baoyu ’ s distraught look , the hectic flush on his cheeks and the sweat on his forehead
next the finance commissioner 's secretary kneels to invite the god of literature to preside over the hall , and his bodyguard — the star of successful candidates — to come to the hall to shed light
and now xiren arrived
it sounds neither like an account nor a list of presents
the envoy greeted him , and old chin invited him into his cottage to take a seat
it was bitterly cold , and he was trudging in the teeth of a north−west wind along a mountain path as hard and slippery as wax
but when concubine zhao heard of this , she flew into a rage and fumed that i was getting too many perks
i just ca not get over that monk !
i must count it here in your presence
then in due course she ’ ll be cured
though i turn my pockets inside out , the very most i can raise is ninety−two taels
she fell ill herself , and had to be carried home and put to bed
not daring to conceal the truth , the magistrate told him , it was painted by a peasant in one of the villages in my county
chu hsien−fu gave a start
going on in this way , little master , will only make him worse
he sent for jia lian
yang is very hard up : how can he entertain our young gentlemen ?
baoyu waved his hand saying , there 's no need for that
is not he sitting pretty as a magistrate ?
did she think the girl would have a bad time with me ?
if all of them move to our monastery , even if we built two extra wings we could not hold them all
lady wang concurred and urged yuanyang and others to open the chests at once and get out the old lady ’ s ceremonial costume
after suppressing her anger for just a month , she fall ill and lost her appetite
he asked the local runner
one of them , qian hua , who had not seen baoyu for some time , stepped forward and fell on one knee
baochai was so interested in the stomacher that she sat down without thinking in xiren 's place , unable to resist picking up the needle and going on embroidering the charming design
please go on with your game , he urged them
yet kai had no choice but to sell
having taken the silver , jia lian came out with some others and ordered men to buy wood for the coffin
after the harvest she sent them two piculs of rice apiece , two piculs of pickled vegetables and four hams , to say nothing of chickens , ducks and other delicacies
he entertained kuang to supper
one precious jade ’ and one gold locker ’ — how could you forget that , madam ?
the next day wang went to the college to thank mr yu
at home nowadays he just fools around with the children
i only wanted to offer some advice
struggling up to take off her robe , she told zijuan to tuck in her quilt and lay down again , but toss and turn as she might she could not sleep
these two men were sons of minister lou , a native of huchow who had served at court for more than twenty years and had sacrifices and posthumous titles decreed for him after his death
in those days he used to teach in the city and was employed as a tutor in the family of various yamen officials ; it was only later that he came to our village
that ’ s enough , said li wan
i am not fit to be sitting here with you anyway
in the evening the death−rattle sounded in his throat , and with a last gasp for breath he gave up the ghost
but since there was no money to buy a coffin and he was a good man , he hurried to his lodgings to fetch ten taels of silver for the funeral expenses
sweet spring water in golden basins her maids bring
he called for li gui then and told him , tomorrow morning beiming is to accompany baoyu to the family school , after first getting ready the books he needs and bringing them to show me
soon after this , a man came to the gate wearing a felt cap , blue cotton clothes and slippers with cloth soles and leather uppers
what have the two of you been up to now ?
tomorrow ’ s the sixteenth our club ought to hold another meeting
i wouldn ’ t be so demanding if i were you
as the saying goes : better a virtuous scholar than an unprincipled official
then the ginseng−seller rapped on the spirit screen
pinger had more or less guessed from their behaviour that they were looking over a prospective bride ; but in jia lian 's absence , with lady xing in charge , she could not find out which family they came from
you would better take it easy and wait for news
giggles broke out again
inquired chi , when he had ushered his visitor inside
this business is really too much for me
as to what to live on ourselves , we can worry about that later
our uncle sent a letter home from kaoyao saying how he missed crabs , but he could not get a single one there
sister zhou , see that they have all they want , said xifeng
go to the front , he ordered
kneeling before her ruhua sobbed , i dare not lie to you , madam
the shih was the ancient , classical verse form
one day as the stone was brooding over its fate , it saw approaching from the distance a buddhist monk and taoist priest , both of striking demeanour and distinguished appearance
never mind about that , old ancestress , xifeng chuckled
wo not you stay for the night ?
how can every girl be like your eldest sister , chosen as an imperial consort ?
so she stood for a while leaning against the doorway in a brown study , before stepping out to look at the bamboo shoots sprouting below the steps
it is quite a length
the lai family requested jia qiang and jia yun to beg lady wang to be kind enough to release him ; but jia qiang knew that this was out of the question and told them a day later that she had refused
this is not like a young lady 's chamber , she remarked
entering a tea−house , they ordered tea and a plate of yicheng dumplings
now they won ’ t be able to sail away , he laughed
please go right away , mrs lin , to tell madam lian what the fortune-teller says , and report it to her ladyship too so that she can stop worrying
he had to step forward to greet the newcomers
magistrate hsiang then called the doctor
then , hearing that it could be found in a pawnshop , without waiting for him to finish i rushed over to several pawnshops and gave them a description of the jade , and one shop said they ’ d got it
yet we ’ ve put his couch in front of this big mirror
moreover , the sentiments expressed here sometimes contradict the ideas of the book as a whole
you were begging for mercy a minute ago , but now you ’ re worse than ever
such a lovely girl !
pay no attention to him , said daiyu
now that he had stayed out all night his grandfather was furious and suspected him of drinking , gambling or whoring , little guessing the truth of the matter
can ’ t you get someone else to go ?
baoyu followed her there and said with a smile , although i ’ ve read the western chamber and annoyed you by quoting some lines from it in fun , a line has occurred to me which i can ’ t understand
i ’ ve come at the right time
perception of the transience of flowers
jia zheng rose in dismay and distress to greet his mother , who entered on a maid 's arm , gasping for breath
instead of going in , baoyu accosted two matrons in charge of the garden who were sitting on the threshold gossiping
what a stroke of luck my coming here again today !
afraid this maudlin talk would make a bad impression on their guests
that ’ s how she became a lay sister
well then , since that ’ s how you feel , why not take these girls away as your acolytes ?
instead she embroiders slippers for baoyu
the cockatoo before the eaves still remembers her sweet name ; the begonia withering outside the balustrade foretold her death
when i asked what it was , she started questioning me !
mrs lin agreed readily to this and left
then , towering his head , he noticed that the ground was strewn with balsam and pomegranate petals
tomorrow we will have not one guest more and not one less , he said
when she reached home , the old lady and lady wang asked what the oracle had said
how can you refuse to call on him ?
taste this of ours and see how you like it
baoyu was about to leave too when xiren came along carrying a small carved , double-circle foreign lacquer tray on which were two cups of newly brewed tea
the priest then remarked to jia zhen , of course , sir , your generation were born too late to see the duke
you can come whenever you like and i won ’ t pester you
she got up and started out
and after some further bustle the others gradually dispersed , leaving xiren able at last to wait on him hand and foot
how can i bear it , saintly teacher , he said , if you draw a veil over your past ?
we could not manage it even if we wanted to
they ’ re trying to take advantage , because madam zhu ’ s a real bodhisattva and you ’ re such a gentle young lady
this said she took her leave
this is far too much !
the stewards spread word of the old lady 's death and , though ihe jia family had declined , when their relatives and friends saw the favour shown them by the emperor they all came to offer their condolences
she opened the door and looked out
generations to come will make solemn sacrifice for deeds whose fame resounds to heaven
li wen took over and added :
no one paid any attention , of course , to such crazy talk
we girls don ’ t have to write essays , daiyu answered
just tell me what you want , she said , pulling her up
even if you had , it wouldn ’ t matter , she usually asks us all , which can ’ t be much fun for you
baoyu , left alone with daiyu , clasped her sleeve and smiled but could not get a word out
to end , despite herself , defiled on the dusty road
i can ’ t be bothered with offering him advice either
they were always declaring that since yung lo had usurped his nephew 's throne , the ming dynasty had gone to the dogs ; and whenever they had anything to drink , they would hold forth to this effect
she broke off abruptly , regretting her indiscretion , and hung her head with a blush
i ’ ll come every day
but if you wish , madam , i shall be more attentive in future
he just mentioned that he had escaped without bringing away any money
even if mrs liu had nine lives she ’ d never dare offend you
tomorrow send ke to tell pan that while we have the wedding here we ’ ll find some way to settle his lawsuit for him
when evening came the party broke up and , after the two brothers had seen their guest off , they all turned in for the night
i hope your honour will graciously permit another trial
and then there ’ s old mrs tian who comes from a farming family
____________________ the six dynasties lasted from the third to the end of the sixth century
you have no call to talk like that
just do not work off your temper on them
xifeng spat in her face
it certainly sounds it , replied the other rats
when an official calls , said niu pu , according to proper etiquette you should serve tea three times
is there such an allusion ?
if i tell you , it will be too good for you !
the main string is too high !
re mischievously nestled close to her
xiuyan blushed when she realized that it was one of the xues ’ shops
the young man ’ s face clouded
but he is wearing a gauze cap and official dress of the seventh rank , and claims that this year in peking he was appointed a secretary of the imperial patent office
if you get leave to go home , that ’ s our good fortune !
with a murmured apology , daiyu obeyed
well , worrying wo not help
when his mother knows what i want , i am sure she will be glad to give him to me
a poor scholar like you ca not afford to feed so many daughters !
and her eternal , peerless gallantry
niu pu put down his luggage , stepped outside and saw a junk moored by the bank
~'how did sister xiren fall so ill ?
go and have lunch , said baoyu , and come back as soon as you can
take it for your parents
when the results of the metropolitan examination came out , fan chin had indeed passed
to part ; so granny liu , having given her some instructions , said goodbye to pinger and went with all speed out of town
in fright the girls dropped to their knees , swearing that none of them dared say a word out of turn : whenever questioned about anything they denied all knowledge of it , so how could they have let this secret out ?
how close they had been , yet today they were parted by death !
just because of the marriage of our master bao to miss baochai
now that she was taking in a second wife for her husband , she was naturally pleased
if you hog all the space , where are we to sleep ?
an old poem has the line the jade hairpin is broken , the red candle cold
two bowls of tea sobered her up enough to ask :
with what does the book on ceremony deal ?
the few taels you have offered are not even enough to buy charcoal for this urn
i give you one year
when it came to the third , they saw fairy pages and maids with flags and pennons lead in a girl dressed as a goddess , with black gauze on her head , who sang an aria and then left the stage
and on top of that , xifeng ’ s unwell
though baoyu was already a married man , as lady zhen was advanced in years and an old relative too , she showed a great interest in him when she saw his close resemblance to her son
why fool me into coming out here and then beat me up ?
since you asked me today , i couldn ’ t hide it from you
what have we to boast about ?
i don ’ t want to see you eating your heart out , she said
that ’ s not the point
his admiration is even more clearly apparent in the first chapter , when he depicts wang mien 's life in the country , and in his description of the four eccentrics in the last chapter
i suspected she must have had an unusual mother
when she saw the two others had left , she came out of the cabin and smiled at him
daiyu gave a little snort
that would make a very handsome gift
so i came , sir
after a while she sighed , i came from yuanmu to the capital hoping to make a name ; but then number was invited here and could not go anywhere else
hence they arrived looking listless and apathetic
tell him from the mistress that if he does not bring in the rest of that interest tomorrow , she does not want it -- he can keep it for himself
this induced many other amorous spirits who had not atoned for their sins to accompany them and take part in this drama
xiren urged her to stay for some tea , but for fear that the garden gate would be closed she went off
daiyu and xiangyun heaped praise on this ending
that was my fault too , i suppose ?
but the best thing would be to find a teacher from the county−seat
in fact , parents only engage them for their strictness
li wan and the others talked it over again , then summoned the servants in charge of the garden and made them lock the gates
what did he want ?
xiangyun was too excited to give careful thought to her poems or to polish them
baoyu took the locket eagerly and found two inscriptions , one on either side , in the form of eight minute characters
yes , of course , replied the old lady
this sign indicates the loss of animal spirits attended by deaths , sicknesses and alarms
as it was now the fifth month , the roses were in full bloom
know where the second mistress has gone ?
what business has kept you so long today , madam ?
the finance commissioner was the head of the civil service in each province and treasurer of the provincial exchequer , in charge of the revenue and the census
we shall now leave ha zheng travelling to his new post and return to baoyu
what future is there for me if i stay on here alone ?
there are nearly a thousand people in this household
when the dead man 's parents heard this , their tears fell like rain
but if this tiresome wretch keeps yelling about it and the master bears , there may be trouble
a two−storeyed building on the left was the library built by the number one scholar , overlooking a large courtyard with one bed of moutan peonies and another of tree peonies
though you are not one of those rich merchants , you would still better be careful
for my father knows that after serving for several years in the capital you can not be wealthy ; and he does not want to put you to any inconvenience
after playing for a while with the birds in the gallery , he strolled beside the river of seeping fragrance to have a look at the goldfish
that 's ridiculous talk , third uncle , protested jia yun
cousin zhen has seen to all the important outside arrangements , it ’ s just a question of keeping an eye on the domestic side
all the others had melon-green covered bowls with golden designs of new imperial kiln porcelain
you haven ’ t just used an allusion for padding
but miss lin 's narrow-minded and likes to make cutting remarks
why did you come to nanking ?
when the runner had consented and left with wang , pan took hao back with him to his house
she would , indeed , have joined in if not for baochai 's retort regarding the fan
if you want anything just let her know
wang teh and wang jen became palace scholars in turn , and drank a dozen cups apiece
i also heard that a vacancy for a vice-minister has come up in the ministry of works , and people outside and in the ministry are all saying that you are to be appointed , sir
what time is it ?
no two scenes were the same
imagine the daughter of a respectable family raising such a row !
i will tell you frankly , sir , replied ma
and since it is his son , you should consult his wishes
eight scenes from eight gallants at the lantern festival were being performed , and the climax had just been reached when baoyu rose to go out
xiren and zijuan were still keeping hold of him
being old and infirm ha jing had retired to live quietly in mysterious truth temple outside the city , where he had now died of illness
after breakfast , baoyu and the others paid their respects again to the lady dowager , after which they returned to the garden
so he was a good monk after all !
after greeting them he invited them to be seated , then asked their names and where they came from
xifeng left the hail and mounted her carriage , in front of which were two brilliant horn lanterns inscribed with the large characters : the rong mansion
li wan , the only one to appreciate xifeng 's dilemma , dared not speak up for her
this morning master huan told lady xing it 's the rule of the prince 's house to fetch the girl there within three days of receiving her horoscope
just then tea was served
if it is , i doubt if it can be cured and i don ’ t care !
one on the head , replied zhang er hastily
i shall go myself with your wife to ask aunt xue s consent
then the teacher went to his desk while wang hui said to his servants , since it is dark and the rain has not stopped , bring the hampers here and tell the monk to cook a peck of rice
her family had served the jias for generations , and her father was now in charge of various farms and properties outside
tell the new bride the master is not at home today , and let her go to her room
as yinger had gone to make tea , the two of them went straight to find her
and xiren despite the presence of lady wang sobbed , i want to be a nun with miss xichun too
having paid her respects to the lady dowager and xifeng , she sat down and had some tea
your aunt , poor thing , has no more to say for herself than a block of wood and ca not show herself to advantage to her elders
verily , glass vessels overflowed with nectar and amber cups brimmed with ambrosia
that family alone entertained the emperor four times
daiyu flushed and spat in disgust
if you want to know the upshot , read the next chapter
xifeng knows all the usual run of smart talk , said baochai
then get some chicken breast , fresh mushrooms , bamboo shoots , dried mushrooms , spiced dried beancurd and various kinds of preserved fruit
how is she now ? asked the old lady
no , no , these are not ours , she protested with a smile
after drinking tea , ma and chu expressed their regret at parting , then took their leave
next they decided to buy some meat dumplings for a snack , and went into a shop where they found thirty dumplings
and this said , she ignored her
talks so wildly , i decided not to call out
their descriptions of how our first emperor toured the country like the sage king shun of old are better than anything in history , but alas !
after a month ’ s grief shiyin fell ill , and then his wife
for the jias , after all , were a scholarly family all of whose friends and protégés were men of parts
so now all the lines had come true !
nanny song knew at once that this was because of the bracelet
yoo opened the letter and read it through
a memento of a dead maid leads baoyu
i ’ ve no anawer to that
having reached this decision , he left
but no one paid any attention
in future , when you come to our family , i dare say you ’ ll find a whole chest of such trash still there
some dreams do come true , though , said chou chin
send her packing and we ’ ll all have some peace and quiet
yet with getting sons won ’ t have done
there ’ s nothing wrong with me
thank you for bringing it
gritting her teeth and smiling , second sister you scolded softly , you glib-tongued monkey !
that 's the way to talk to her !
since they mean well , coming to see us , we shouldn ’ t slight them
there 's money in this
are you engaged yet ?
they are already at nine twists mount !
i want it for new year , so don ’ t be lazy !
alone i drove on to my dreary doom
you will find things very different from what they were under your old master , who left everything to his concubine and let you get away with anything
his father was my colleague , said tang , but i sha not recognize this young man when i see him
life and death are determined by fate , rank and riches decreed by heaven , quoted daiyu with a sigh
it would reflect badly on xiren and the rest of you as well
you have nothing to do anyway , dear sister , so do make them for me
he ’ ll become the mainstay of the house some day in place of his father
all he could do was send some stewards in secret to raise a few thousand taels by selling certain country estates to defray the prison expenses
he noticed that in her white mourning , her face bare of rouge and powder , she looked even lovelier than before her marriage
told of her qualms and the ghosts she had seen , granny liu assured her that the buddhist deities in her village temple could work miracles
when he loses something , why suspect me ?
they reminded her of a line in an old poem :
i do not fancy it
resenting his harsh treatment at xifeng 's hands , he decided now that jia lian was away to vent his spite on qiaojie , using jia yun as his cat 's paw
at once they asked what had happened
but xiangyun on hearing the clue had started staring around too
what are you doing here so early in the morning ?
that evening the things were brought over , the mother of the old lady ’ s girl numskull came to deliver the laundry and stayed chatting for a while in the servants ’ quarters
then as quick as lightning the brush wrote : ' emperor chien wen
beneath was the poet 's name : hung kan−hsien
indeed , she treated him like one of her own grandsons , giving him clothes , shoes and other necessities when she saw that his family was hard up
let 's drink a few cups , then have rice , proposed the lady dowager , then noticed that the place beside her was empty
and are you a native of this city ?
and presently , thinking it time for the lady dowager ’ s meal , xiangyun and baochai went back to pack their things while madam you took her leave of li wan and went straight to the old lady ’ s place
ascends to the great void
xifeng agreed to this and took her leave
the feasting went on for two whole days
baochai may look stupid but she had good sense you know what she 's like , madam
early the next morning he went back to urge his grandmother to send for xiangyun , and did not relax until she finally arrived in the afternoon
aunt huang had come there to complain about qin zhong ’ s treatment of her nephew , but after hearing of keqing ’ s illness she hadn ’ t the courage to mention this , much less to complain
why , these prongs are heavier than our iron shovels , the old woman complained
hearing that chih heng−shan would be there , wu reluctantly consented to go
that 's why the sight of the provincial examination school today upset him
the next morning he got up early to go on with his editing , and by working all day and late into the night he was able to finish seventy or eighty essays a day
with that she turned to go back
just look after your end of things inside the house
i met this fellow pao from nanking on the road , said mr wei
the gate of this court was ajar , but not liking to intrude he decided to ask permission from the monk
tu ordered his chair−bearers to wait , and took a winding path through the temple grounds
even if she really wanted to leave , you should wait until she 's cooled down and then mention it to the mistress casually
xue ke and xiuyan had met once previously on their way to the capital , and in all probability they were pleased enough with the match ; but naturally this made xiuyan more reserved and tongue-tied in the presence of baochai and the rest of the girls
in a few days you ’ ll do better
she took out pinger ’ s share then , saying , here , pinger , take this back
but his wife—the daughter of butcher hu of the south end of this village—with her dingy hair and red−rimmed eyes was a regular slattern
green willows covered the slopes ;
slender the willow slips , their dew half dry
take them to read
she scolded them several times , but they paid no attention
devoted friends join the clan school
you must think of something fresh
jia huan hung his head
i am in disgrace now because of this robbery
weeping she tried to raise him to his feet , but baoyu refused to getup
and baoqin is engaged to be married too
bao yong said nothing to this , while xichun was on tenterhooks for fear lest he mention miaoyu
give me your pouch
if he is such a remarkable man , said lou feng , much impressed , why do not we go to pay our respects to him ?
she ordered him to be fetched back
has he forgotten who brought him up ?
you are really like precious jade
besides , li wan added , these poems are about places she ’ s visited
an incompetent physician prescribes
a stupid bully is beaten up
we wo not make a ruling that we three are not to write when the subject and rhyme are easy we may have a go but you four definitely must write
this was the temple of wu tzu−hsu , councillor of the kingdom of wu
the three of them went in together , and they told him of the trouble they had just had at the city gate
it shows heaven is kind
some of its spirit winter-plum allots
the lady dowager parried
home again , she told the lady dowager , rong ’ s wife sends her respects and kowtows to you
but by the time he had reached here a couple of years ago his money had run out and he had gone to live in the temple where he made a precarious living by working as a scrivener
this aunt of mine was ill-starred
yucun turned to look
the bawd came in to wish him good morning , and they had just breakfasted when chin hsiu−yi arrived and insisted jokingly that chen should invite him to a wedding feast
lady wang ’ s heart ached at this news , aggravating her pains
it ’ s only natural for men to hanker for more
although she repeated her questions several times , baoyu just went on sobbing , his head bent over the table , unable to speak
but to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
if i don ’ t go , i ’ ll be unworthy of all her goodness ; if i do , i shall have to abandon my own people
well , i should have minded my own business instead of coming here to let myself in for this old wives ' gabble
you should buy a few collections of paku essays to study too , advised mr chi
who can guess the outcome of a game of chess ?
do not blame this young rascal , he said
i would like to get xue ke married
like lady yang 's shade , fresh from the bath , ice-pure ,
on xifeng ’ s instructions caiming read out the number of strings of beads and tassels needed for two palanquins and four sedan-chairs as well as four carriages
when it ’ s time to speak you say nothing
although that brute has gone , he thought , it 's bound to come back to eat me
he kept yu yu−chung to a meal , and showed him the manuscripts of his three books
now , thanks to this money you have given us , we can turn over a new leaf
go on , so as not — what ?
he had only a skull cap and jacket now himself
attracted by this suggestion , he laughed at his wife ’ s objection and proposed :
i know you don ’ t believe in such things , so i ’ ve asked you here to consult you
then they went with the monk to the rooms behind , where chou chin had taught
show her in , said tu
so the two mothers confronted each other 's sons
mind you don ’ t chock
is old lou still here ?
but i am no beauty
unable to change her mind , he had to go back and report this to jia she
they were interrupted by the arrival of lin zhixiao ’ s wife
if he passes and becomes an official , a few taels of silver will mean nothing to him — he can easily repay us
aunt xue , too exploded in such mirth that she sprayed tea all over tanchun 's skirt , making her upset her bowl over yingchun , while xichun left her seat and begged her nurse to rub her stomach for her
tell your mistress this from me , pinger , when you go back
as he reached the gate , he saw a man with baggage enter the city , and was delighted to recognize hsiao chin−hsuan of anching
and for this pao insisted on offering thanks
i have my hands full here , said mrs liu
he kept hsiao pochuan for two days while he drew up a contract , then ordered his elder son to hire a fast boat and accompany hsiao to yangchow to call on mr yu in the riverside house of a salt merchant named wu
the old lady asked him
so she came by sedan-chair to enlist xifeng ’ s help
the men bearing wine , jade and silk stood on the left , while those bearing grain and viands stood on the right
again the other made no reply
jia zheng asked this pair which monastery they were from
go and have a drink yourself
she doesn ’ t even care for appearances
it was an account of the stone ’ s rejection for repairing heaven , its transformation and conveyance to the world of men by the buddhist of infinite space and the taoist of boundless time , and the joys and sorrows , partings and encounters , warm and cold treatment from others it had experienced there
baochai ’ s so intelligent , we don ’ t have to worry
yes , she said more cheerfully , i suppose your maids felt too lazy to stir and that made them answer rudely
after some time she told the other to go
that ’ s my worthless grandson ’ s name , chuckled the lady dowager
come and drink some tea with me
my father was on a most friendly footing with the lou gentlemen
how much stuff could her brother bring back ?
after the lantern festival , he felt stabs of pain in his heart
a laughing-stock for you gentlemen , that 's what i have become !
but no sooner had ho opened the gate when seven or eight men rushed in
eagerness to clear themselves and receive a reward made everyone search frantically high and low — they even scoured the privies
baoyu agreed and turned to tell cuimo to fetch it , where upon she went off cheerfully on this errand
he is the same age as i — eighty−two this year
the fourth , xichun , is the younger sister of jia zhen of the ning mansion
when your master ’ s lenient you run him down ; if he were strict you ’ d complain , said third sister with a smile
you can issue the allowance but do not assign me another maid
tomorrow , replied tang yu
aren ’ t you afraid of third sister ?
jia zhen protested , he was just writing nonsense
the sky was overcast , though , as if it were going to rain ; so instead of sitting there longer he went out through the temple gate
by stressing this she calmed them down a little
the next day there was even more to do , but we need not go into the details
she went back to find everyone ministering to baoyu
that made them go back in remorse to live together , and then the tree blossomed again
i came back very late
but instead of stopping at the lobby this time , they turned west after the main hall and alighted outside the lady dowager ’ s reception room
now he ’ s in a bad way but luckily we have money and , with the jia family helping , there ’ s still some hope
on account of there being so many people here some birthdays coincide with two or three of them falling on the same day
baoqin smiled and blushingly lowered her head in silence
jia lian went in then to see their ladyships
and meeting him spiced rice i did present
arrived at tengwei hill , wang went to look for his friend
tu shao−ching ordered chia chueh to go and find out
at this memory his heart went out to qingwen
in most of the romances baoyu had recently acquired , a young scholar and beautiful girl came together and fell in love thanks to lovebirds , phoenixes , jade rings , gold pendants , silk handkerchiefs , embroidered girdles or other baubles of the sort
i would always known the younger jia men and their servants here were a bad lot but thought the older generation all right , so i was surprised to hear they would landed in trouble
everyone calls it provincial graduate pao 's family
who 's having a wedding ?
why didn ’ t you take your nurse to task for carrying on in that way ?
how is it that of all those in our family only these few are left ?
i ca not see what you two have to quarrel about
the wang brothers deliberate how to make a concubine of the mistress of the house
then baoyu and his party passed through the side gate , where some grooms and the boys under the six stewards had some dozen horses ready
the three of them finished so soon that granny liu commented with a smile :
he urged her to shave off her fringe completely , exposing her bluish scalp , and to part her hair in the middle
who told you he ’ s no good ?
but where is the money to come from ?
cicadas chirp , crows roost , in a flash they are gone ;
the other day , she accused ouguan of burning sacrificial paper ; but luckily baoyu said he ’ d asked her to do it , and that silenced the old creature
the nurses said he wasn ’ t to sleep in this room for fear of infection
old pu had prepared a mirror , candlesticks , tea−pot , basin , chamber−pot and two pillows which were now carried over by his elder son , pu cheng , who bowed to mr niu as soon as he had put them down
i don ’ t need him , declared xifeng laughingly
don ’ t imitate earlier writers
i was worried too that there might be , but i ’ ve checked carefully and there ’ s nothing missing
why have you been hiding this accomplishment from me ?
a whip points at the bridge , the poet must go
aunt xue did not go home that day , staying with her heart-broken daughter to cornfort her
cousin lin has become an immortal
you are quite right , agreed yu yu−ta
but now there 's nothing you can do
he went on kowtowing as if he would never stop
wouldn ’ t that save trouble ?
the mistresses and the young ladies can hardly side with those singsong girls against you
well , anyway , i ’ ll get it clear gradually
with that xiren left the room
i am busy now but come to my study tomorrow
what is there for an old woman like me to live for ?
the brothers looked on with delight
in desperation he summoned li shier
i don ’ t covet such luck
the general commandant of the capital
it 's a fact that mr chu is not at home
why , madam , the truth is they were just spending the emperor ’ s money on the emperor
the next day , as soon as he got up he went to three officials hall to see the runners
beside this temple lived a gentleman named zhen fei , whose courtesy name was shiyin
the servant came back about ten days later with prefect chu 's letter , and reported : when prefect chu heard this , he was very pleased
when kuo gave him two pears he had bought on the road , the abbot accepted them with thanks
sooner or later i ’ ll settle scores with you both
some of the other scholars left by sedan−chair , others oh foot
and steep their hearts in envious jealousy
you must be tired ; you would better turn in first
we can consider it again tomorrow
when the others had gone , he and his wife talked of the happenings since their separation
the caretakers of the storeroom for antiques have mentioned it several times , as they want to record where it is
these women ; summoned and told the plan in outline by li wan , agreed to it readily
do you mind spending a night outside , away from your family ?
no , let 's use that lake pavilion by lotus fragrance anchorage , proposed the lady dowager
he had never given his mind to studying whole essays
is she asleep in the annex ?
as soon as the chair had passed , the official spoke to one of his black−coated runners who rushed over to pao wen−ching
choking on rice like jade and wine like gold ,
a big household like this can only be run by someone with your forethought , madam
don ’ t take on like that , urged li gui
of course you left all your own things at home
however , he heard one of them chant :
his stock was an assortment of sesame sweets , dried beancurd , clay figurines , children 's flutes and cymbals , and women 's hairpins
but to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
i agree with you , rejoined chin
this is mr lou feng 's boat , loaded with rice , as everybody knows
after the usual exchange of civilities , daiyu said to baochai :
i want to bid farewell to you and my husband 's parents , and follow my husband to the grave
your house is full of heralds
she ordered him to be admitted at once
after yu 's return to his post , this servant−boy walked a mile to the market every morning to buy the fuel , rice , oil , flour or vegetables needed , then returned to help his mistress
caiyun , unable to stop her no matter how hard she tried , made herself scarce while jia huan slipped out of the ceremonial gate and went off to amuse himself elsewhere
why should anyone tell such a lie ?
they have a roomful of goods worth one thousand six hundred taels
i fancy the tu cousins from tienchang are even more open−handed than your uncles !
his mother summoned a doctor , thinking he was deranged again , at the same time sending maids to report to jia zheng that their son had recovered from his heart attack and now that he could talk there was no need to prepare for the last rites
it 's obviously no use my thinking of you every minute of the day -- you have no place for me in your heart
it was such a horrible sight that i ran away as fast as ever i could
why are you coming back ?
today he had come to comfort her ; but again , without meaning to , had spoken too hastily so that he had to break off , desperately afraid that daiyu would be angry
so you are really a scholar !
you think nothing of us wangs , not even of me , much less our servants
yu yin turned red
oh , no , protested pao
besides , hearing that aunty was here , i wanted to pay my respects to her as well
they ’ re not as badly off as they make out
look at ma chun−shang , for example
he bade a scullion carry two vats into the courtyard , put a pear in each , pour several buckets of water over them , and mash the pears with a pole
it is even more ridiculous when these charlatans claim that the site for the first ming emperor 's sepulchre was chosen by liu chi of our dynasty
at green maple city , said hsiao , we saw plenty of snow , but i never found it depressing
jia zheng , pleased by the results of baoyu ’ s test , brought the subject up when he went out to chat with his secretaries
soon i shall have to leave you , and there is no knowing when i can come back again
a confounded monk ends a confounded case
do you really mean it ?
just work it out , though , and it ’ s really sickening
have you any objection ?
and should our late master be buried among the ancestors or should another site be chosen ?
i took out two rolls , thinking they would make good coverlets
let us return to daiyu , who had risen late after a sleepless night
do not grieve , mother , he begged
chih is entirely right , remarked wu shu
this is my uncle tu from tienchang , replied hua−shih
but i was afraid that , ill as she is , this false accusation might make her so desperate she would try to kill herself -- then we would have another death on our hands
lady wang urged her not to worry about family affairs , but just to take medicine and recuperate
today , at the order of the goddess of disenchantment , i am going to the illusory land of the great void to register all the amorous spirits in this case
cried the lady dowager turning to xifeng
now if thy heart doth cherish grace within ,
they took kuang chao−jen with them to a tavern , chose seats and sat down
as her family owned so many osmanthus trees , she had been given
what ’ s this you ’ re making ?
suppressing a smile she answered , she has to wait for the appointed hour
but the words were still on her lips when daiyu staggered and fell , vomiting blood
while saying this she rose to take her leave
at a feast with his secretaries , he was so worried that he infected them with his own uneasiness
i just told xueyan to get the kitchen to prepare you a bowl of cabbage soup with ham and dried shrimps , as well as some bamboo shoots and layer in it
as for the contract , in our capacity as mediators we will draw up a statement for huang meng−tung to the effect that the old contract is null and void
then they sat down at a table with ting−hsi
baoyu repeated what daiyu had said to him
the lady dowager and her party went at dawn to the hostel , where they had some refreshments before proceeding to court
we ’ ll give twelve taels each
this done , he chose an auspicious date and wrote a memorial , and the very same day that it was presented the son of heaven acceded to his request
this time , though , something lucky turned up in my bad luck
that means you ’ re bound to be good friends
xifeng was still not well enough to stay there all the time ; but when buddhist masses were held and sutras read , or when visitors came to offer sacrifices , she made the effort to come over to help madam you cope
if trouble had come of it , it would have been awkward for both families
passing through two more rooms , they came to winding steps with balustrades , and climbed up to another building
after the meal pan made the young man take a bath and change into a completely new outfit which he had prepared for him : a new square cap , new shoes and a new sapphire−blue silk gown
to the lady dowager ’ s apartments , and daiyu returned to her own rooms to rest
that ’ s why i couldn ’ t come out to speak to you
that last line ’ s good but rather hard to match
don ’ t bring up his name , he sighed
as soon as the results are published , irrespective of whether you have passed or not , i want you both to come to my headquarters father wants us to go to his yamen , said tang yu to his brother
let me off this time , good sister !
people are easy , said daiyu
yes , you were right to find out
there will be lots of people sending him presents of money
i strove but for his sacred majesty
on the south side was a dainty three-roomed annex facing north ; on the north a big screen wall painted white , behind which was a small door leading to an apartment
do not keep me waiting too long !
wo not the son 's officialdom be enough for the father ?
you ’ d better lie down , miss
the old lady left masses of gold and silver , but they wo not touch it it 's all tucked away in her room waiting to be shared out after the funeral
mr lou 's illness was taking a turn for the worse , and tu shao−ching , who had invited a second physician to attend him , stayed at home in low spirits
their words carry weight
i ’ m glad cousin xifeng is so considerate
and chirping flew the birds of jasper green
she could not do any of the work your sister−in−law does , but she did not like to sit idle while her mother−in−law and sisterin−law waited on her
this confounded stork had helped her !
her heart aching , her grandmother said , don ’ t be afraid , dear child
and the friend who travelled part of the way here with me has gone to the capital for the examination ; so there is no one closer to me than you
opening his door to invite him in , wang hui saw that his visitor was handsome , distinguished and well−bred
but why come such a long way just to tell me this ?
before the raid on the rong and ning mansions , on the day when baochai and daiyu separated , that jade had already left the world of men to escape from calamity and effect a reunion
but as i ’ ve come all this way to ask your help , i ’ d better speak up
we can do without him then , she said
but it 's really hard for us to please everyone with each of the mistresses giving different orders
as xifeng had been her favourite she told yuanyang , give some of my things to xifeng , and take pinger some money so that she can look after her well
a mountain wolf , a savage ruthless beast ,
to return to xifeng at home
as luck would have it , however , there was a dead branch a foot or more long lower down the trunk ; and in its furious leap the beast had impaled itself on this branch
if she ’ s not well , she needn ’ t come , said the old lady
from both i am loath to part ,
the young ladies ditched me , said granny liu hastily
this set lady wang and the others weeping again
what ’ s that cute thing made of ?
then the lou brothers had to pluck up courage to open the bag , only to find in it not a human head but a pig 's head weighing six or seven catties !
may better news follow in rapid succession !
its purity rewards the god of autumn ,
he was troubled with phlegm , and fits of coughing often kept him awake half the night
i ’ ll pay your share
now the fish had been bought and the fire was ready , but when they asked the youngwife to start cooking she refused to budge
kuei went back to his mother−in−law
now that the garden gates are closed it ’ s time to start
if she misunderstands you then why rue ?
then one day , from jingui ’ s pillow-case there fell out a paper effigy inscribed with the date of her birth and her horoscope
insignia of honour in the hall blaze like iridescent clouds
whiskers wang returned several days later having sold the land for one thousand and several hundred taels , which he brought home in a small bag
yet instead of keeping yourself in check , behaving yourself and living peacefully , you act like an oaf and bully her in your cups
the funk that i was in made me muddle things up
and there we leave them
i daren ’ t contradict you
' a cock crows at the moon by the rustic inn , was his quotation
the next day the weather cleared
these men were appointed by the emperor after a test
smiling at each other both girls took a sip of wine
there was someone lying on a couch inside , with a few girls by him sewing or amusing themselves
baoyu had just started combing it with a fine comb when qingwen hurried in to fetch some money
looking at daiyu closely , he found her different from other girls
just then he saw a boat pass with two girls in it who looked very like the two maids in the lu family
all the attendants covered their faces and wept , and daiyu herself could not keep back her tears
though he himself waits day and night upon his imperial parents , he considers this too little to express all his filial devotion ; and he realizes that the secondary consorts and ladies-in-waiting in the palace who have been away from their parents for many years must naturally be longing to see them again , for it ’ s only right for children to miss their parents
you ’ re making fun of me , cousin , and i ’ ve guessed the answer , he told her with a smile
that ’ s all very well , said qingwen
on one condition though
why hurry me when i ’ m in high spirits ?
when that time comes who will worry about anyone else ?
tanchun , taking them , found that two concubines who had been family servants had received twenty taels apiece , and two from outside forty
cuimo said , our young lady and miss xiangyun are in miss xichun ’ s place discussing that painting she ’ s made of the garden
the dockers helped the boatmen to stop him
the concubine felt that ma was yielding
past telling are the marvels in this place
how do you know him , sir ?
'~so you take that line too ?
chuang walked forward and prostrated himself
we officials owe allegiance only to the emperor , not to friends of the same faith
however , for fear that his grief might bring back his old illness , she called xiren into the inner room to ask her just what had happened in the garden
there ’ s two piculs of good rice short , she observed
brew some good tea , quick !
no wonder everyone says it ’ s no good being too familiar with you
if you keep on weeping , you will upset my wife even more
if you tell us , even if we suffer for it , we shall have something to go on
there were several nursemaids there carrying their master 's children and joking with the gateman
what do you think ?
oh , is it you ?
they might saychinese buddhists believe that not till seven , twice seven or as many asseven times seven days after death does a spirit transmigrate to another body
she saw baoyu out of the gate , watched him get into the chair and lowered its curtains
why have i had no notice of it ?
if so , xifeng would count as lenient , not as exacting
you must of course know
that saying is perfectly true
xichun , however , countered , how could a grown man like him get lost ?
we haven ’ t been in for some time and don ’ t know what she ’ s up to
i ’ ve always wanted to play that
just then nanny song came back to report on her errand
hurry up and invite them
but while saying this she was thinking , drat it all !
qingwen told xiren then what had just happened , whereupon xiren dashed off to bamboo lodge
but it 's such a hot day , with so many young ladies here too , that i do not like to presume without your permission
only the fourth mr chen was left at welcome pavilion
no , that would be a sin , a wicked sin
in future i really must make a study of music
miss xiangyun won ’ t let me go
i do not know what you are talking about
what 's done is done , sobbed pinger
i ’ ve only studied for a couple of years and learned a few characters
i know what 's the trouble with her
how can you expect to find them looking through clothes again today ?
i didn ’ t know she had such a champion
but xue pan leapt to his feet
when you have time , do come and see me
he answered — affirming that he would be true to her
i won ’ t have it hushed up , declared baoyu
some went to ask , returning with the answer , yes , we have
baoyu asked after yun 's mother and inquired his business
if i economize too much , outsiders may jeer and their ladyships will feel the pinch , while the rest of the household complain of my stinginess
last night i was thinking of asking my sister for the use of the garden for one day , to invite you to a simple meal so as to enjoy the snow
there ’ s nothing wrong with this place , but reed snow cottage would be even better , remarked li wan
after a careful investigation he discovered that one of his subordinates had told the moslems of mr chang 's part in the business
a clear stream welling up where the trees were thickest wound its way through clefts in the rocks
is there anybody staying in bamboo lodge ?
he received the wine kneeling , drained it at one gulp , then felt better and kowtowed again in thanks
kuang chao−jen then returned to his lodgings
i will come back when i have seen him
after third sister ’ s suicide , it goes without saying , old mrs you , second sister and jia lian were overcome with grief , as were jia zhen , his wife and jia rong as soon as they learned of it
the other day on her birthday i checked our inventory of curios and found this listed there , but i don ’ t know where it ’ s got to now
merciful buddha , save me !
after leaving tu , wu shu had gone no further than lucky crossing bridge when he met a man in a square cap , old cotton gown , silk girdle and straw sandals
this decision taken , she changed boats at yicheng and travelled straight to nanking
nothing much , replied zixing
that oaf of a master of yours falls for every girl he sees , she swore
xueyan agreeing to this , zijuan went off
when you were twenty our masters were kind enough to help you purchase an official post , although plenty of real gentlefolk go hungry
while speaking she laid the table
they joined families because they have the same surname and their grandfather was an official in the same place as our old master
these look better-kept than other places
exultantly , kuang chao−jen thanked the examiner , and when he had seen him off he went back to hangchow to discuss with pan how to return to yuehching county to put up a wooden placard and erect a flagpole in his ancestral temple to honour the family
i ’ m in here , pinger called
i no longer dare keep you
as they were chatting , a serving-woman brought in the drugs
after this , the two friends were constantly together
then the dice-pot went to li wan who made her toss
heaven would not entrust such an onerous task to anyone but a benevolent sage
xifeng had already sent round a flowered lavender curtain , satin quilts and embroidered mattresses
when the servants returned and found their master gone , the boatman told them that he had gone ashore in pursuit of two monks and a taoist priest
after the second watch , the maid informed them
kinsmen and friends came to offer congratulations , but disturbed as he was by his domestic problems jia zheng was in no mood to-entertain them
that would only cause a worse scandal
and a fortune−teller is sensitive to these almost imperceptible signs
why should not one of them at least stay here ?
that would be a worthy deed
the lady dowager , lady xing , lady wang , madam you and her daughter-in-law nee xu grandparents as well as grand-children of the jia family had to go to court every morning when sacrifice was offered , not returning until two in the afternoon
i wonder what 's become of its owners
he wondered what rare plant this could be that it was so specially treasured , observing that the faintest breeze set it swaying incessantly , and that though it was so small and had no blossoms its delicate grace was utterly enchanting
in her indignation she turned and left abruptly
pink petals fall in hundred flowers islet
the lady dowager ’ s gift was a purse containing a small golden effigy of the god of learning symbolizing literary talent and harmony
who can we complain to about this injustice ?
jia zhen asked his wife , have we fetched the imperial bounty yet for the spring sacrifice ?
you don ’ t know the half of it , my dear granny
this maid hurried to relieve them of their load
wait till my zijuan dies , it won ’ t be too late for me to use that phrase then
i think you ’ re right , agreed xifeng
when is it to be ?
losing patience , shiyin clasped his daughter more tightly and was turning to reenter the house when the monk pointed at him and let out a roar of laughter
he was in a quandary when a man in black rushed in
if heaven takes pity on me , i may recover
when she learned of his accident she hurried over to find him in front of the mirror , his left cheek daubed with ointment
you are wide of the mark again
i don ’ t know what that girl is like
caiyun , told by lady wang to see who she was , recognized her as one of the serving-women who had accompanied yingchun to the sun family
coming out , he went at once to find jia zheng , expressed his sympathy over his impeachment , then congratulated him on his return and asked about his journey
wang ren ( 忘仁 -- forgetting humanity )
after some days on the road they were approaching the capital when word came of the promotion of his uncle wang ziteng to the post of commander-in-chief of nine provinces with orders to inspect the borders
now her maid xueyan brought in her little hand-stove
this chance is too good to miss
for this mirror had western-style hinges enabling it to open or shut , and she had accidentally pressed the spring which made it swing back , revealing a doorway
lady wang explained , the last couple of years , what with floods and drought , our farms haven ’ t been able to produce their quota , especially of the rice of the finer kind
this is why jia huan and the others were not afraid of him , only yielding to him to some extent for fear of the lady dowager
he took the lad with him whenever he went out to tea−shops and taverns or on business trips ; and he let him earn commissions so that he could buy new clothes , caps , shoes and socks
just then the old lady arrived with lady wang , li wan and xifeng
just yesterday you were saying you needed a couple of hundred taels
i ’ ve thought of a very good plan , said the attendant
what 's to be done then ?
just now in the old lady ’ s place , baoyu came out to pay his respects , remarked aunt xue
how cruel these people are !
how dare he refuse to help me ?
but now that we are one family i am sure you will not laugh at me
men and women story-tellers who frequented the house came to offer congratulations
ask her what she just said about you
but what caused my mother 's illness ?
later on such a crowd will be going there on business , we ’ ll hardly get a look in
if they learned that the second master married you while still in mourning , they ’ d have him beaten to death !
the others chuckled , a dream does not count !
xifeng turned to lai da ’ s wife
that is what delayed me
although xiren knew what had happened , she dared not mention it and tried to distract him with some more cheerful subject
the flowers would still be spoiled
baoyu first watched daiyu fishing , then went over to make a few remarks to baochai , after which he joined xiren and the rest and sipped some wine with them while xiren prepared a shellful of meat for him
master bao was most emphatic , insisted qingwen
i am afraid you will laugh at me
these last few days you ’ ve just begun to recover your appetite and have a little more energy ; but you ’ re not completely well yet
besides , these aren ’ t worth much
now you dare make fun of me !
this gauze is pretty when new , she remarked to lady wang , but it soon loses its vivid emerald colour
asked pao with a laugh
miss baochai has gone , she informed him
we humbly invoke all divinities to show their divine compassion and display their spiritual majesty afar in these forty-nine days of grand sacrifice , that the departed may be delivered from sins and absolved from retribution there was more in the same vein
the boatmen rowed back
jia zheng ’ s wife , lady wang , bore him a son called jia zhu who passed the district examination at fourteen , married before be was twenty and had a son , but then fell ill and died
just get on with your work , little ancestor , urged xiren
whenever you come back from outside , if so much as a handkerchief or pouch is missing they have to look into it , not to mention that jade !
xiren nearby heard him calling out in his sleep and shook him to wake him up
the fairy maid retorted
the wrong medicine was prescribed and one dose killed him
tell her i ’ m sleeping
lady wang knew that this was a bad business and warned lady xing against it ; but the latter , taken in by her brother and wang ren , suspected lady wang 's motives
no wonder she ’ s a vamp
xue pan , who had long been dubbed the stupid lordling , naturally found xing a man after his own heart
just leave it to me
lady wang also told xifeng , go ahead and eat with the old lady and aunt xue
when tea has been served , i will invite you to have a rest in the library
come back here tomorrow morning
lovely too on the water were the lotus flowers , duckweed and water-fowl made out of shells and feathers
he had often wanted to meet him , but his father kept him under such strict control that hitherto he had never had a chance
some trees and flowers are to be planted in the garden , and i was looking for someone to put in charge
naturally we keep quiet about it
she ’ s only nine , remarked xifeng
your proposal is undoubtedly correct , general , replied the prefect
if i ate it myself , of course i would pay
i do appreciate her thoughtfulness
in dismay baoyu hurried to her side to soothe her , but she kept her eyes shut and paid no attention to him
how can she be so heartless ?
the dance at an end , the herald announced : let all kneel below the steps as the prayer is read
this silenced baoyu for some minutes
high and low alike were splendidly dressed
before she could finish baoyu cried excitedly , you see ?
how can you talk like that !
good , said jia zheng
never having studied them hard , he had since forgotten them and if tested on them now would be floored
both angry and amused lady wang exclaimed , what a fool this old woman is !
in the midst of this commotion jia lian came back and his cousin described what had happened
daiyu was already weeping
he proceeded then to the hall and was watching the pages shift screens , clean tables and polish the gold and silver sacrificial vessels , when a boy brought him a card and list
the jade had vanished , and they dared not report it
but there 's nobody here tonight , and there 's nothing i can do now you have come along
my maids are indolent from long indulgence ;
i have heard that whoever hits the stars in heaven will be carried away by the king of hell , given a hundred strokes with an iron rod , and shut up in the eighteenth hell , never to become a human being again
if all i cared about was my own reputation while other people made trouble drinking or gambling , how could i face my aunt ?
she would first fume at them then appeal to their better nature ; and in this way she managed to send off batch after batch of guests after entertaining them all anyhow
the old lady smiled
whoever ’ s quickest can go on from there
since this garden took a year to build , painting it will naturally require two , what with grinding the ink , spreading out the paper , dipping the brushes in the colours and then
it ’ s only my nephew
you know which of the older girls have most sense
he moored the boat by the bank , and walked up to yang 's door to knock
we boat people are a respectable lot , said the girl
at the same time that scholars were being bribed or deliberately kept ignorant , the rulers carried out a policy of cruel suppression
you jump to obey her instructions faster than if they were an imperial edict
one of the brothers−in−law was called wang teh and the other wang jen
then he blew out his lamp and went to sleep
now when i land in trouble he leaves me in the lurch
when your grandfather was alive , seeing how rich and influential our family was , he went to great trouble to get connected with us
why should i put my head in a tiger ’ s mouth ?
only four or five days later , after kuang chao−jen had seen the examiner off , did he come back in his scholar 's cap and gown to pay his respects to his parents
two maids protect baoyu 's jade lest
after that they cleared the table , some young maids brought in a basin , and as soon as he had rinsed his mouth and washed it was time for xiren and the others to have their meal
you are always at home , my friend , said chuang to chih
after i have made my report to the authorities , i will wait for you in the capital
then you tried to excuse yourself at my expense , calling me petty-minded and quick to take offence
i have a smattering of knowledge concerning the hexagrams , astrology , fortune−telling , medicine , surgery , yoga and chemistry , besides knowing how to consult the oracles , said chen ho−fu
may i ask what business takes you to chengtu ?
while dabbing at her own eyes she turned and took a silk handkerchief from her pillow , tossed him this in silence and covered her face again
that day aunt xue asked the others over to a new-year feast
little did he expect to beget such degenerates , a houseful of rutting dogs and bitches in heat , day in and day out scratching in the ashes and carrying on with younger brothers-in-law
if you are set on starting a poetry club , said daiyu , we must all be poets
every day they sent for doctors
my name is shen , answered big foot
when lovely yu and miss hsiao had given their names , he questioned ma chun−shang and chu hsien−fu
the people outside the window , hearing this , went off to attend to their tasks
i want you to introduce some ideas of your own
one morning , he had just washed and dressed and was thinking to ask his grandmother ’ s permission to pay another visit to his friend , when mingyan peeped round the spirit screen by the inner gate
xifeng spat in her face
as you were such good friends and he lived all alone here , with no parents or brothers , you ought to make a thorough search for him
he said that you were teaching in mr ku 's family
didn ’ t we become friends as soon as you arrived here ?
he san went out with him
after having seen to all this , he went to pay his respects to his grandmother and mother and to have his meal
the brothers stepped forward
niu yu−fu was most annoyed
jia lian asked second sister , but she could not think who it could be
i don ’ t care if i never get married
i ca not abide him , and that 's that , she declared
what happened after that i don ’ t know
you must write an inscription for me some time too
this is a bushel of my brother 's rice allowance , said yu yu−chung
what do you take me for ?
is there no way to prevent it ?
why should you tell such tales ?
she must have gone up to heaven , i suppose , and because i am too vulgar to have any communication with the divine i have not once dreamed of her
he then accompanied his mother out and across to the other courtyard
at the beginning of the term his father asked the new village scholar , mei chiu , to choose a name for him
are you all right now ?
no wonder it ’ s growing so chilly
my , what are these hard things ?
he hurried straight over to him and saluted
the knowing maid quickly tucked it in her sleeve and went into jia lian ’ s room , where she showed him the hair with a smile
naturally they had no patience with such talk
this was because he could approach officials directly
let me fetch the scales so that you can weigh it
if her ladyship asks you why and how so much was spent , people may think we ’ ve been squeezing you !
but what was that about your gold phoenix tiara ?
that 's the way to do it !
she ’ s wasting her love on you
that ’ s how a girl should behave if she wants me to love her
just now you asked who would stay with miss xichun , she said
when the old lady had thanked him the doctor went out with jia lian to write his prescription , then left
one tapping the door ’ number to make the scene stand out
she found him lying fully dressed on the kang , raptly watching baochai as she combed her hair
who am i to be greeted as an equal !
in that case , said xiren , let ’ s each have one final cup
she began to treat aunt xue as her own mother and baochai and baoqin as her sisters , feeling closer to them than to all the other girls , to the lady dowager ’ s great satisfaction
we have not seen each other for half a year , uncle , said shao−ching
there ’ s another reason too
the blades had the cold gleam of two autumn streams
jia qin , a young supervisor ,
but they don ’ t have such a strange fragrance , do they ?
the news of baoyu ’ s impending wedding to baochai , a prospect which daiyu had dreaded for years , had so enraged her that she had lost her senses
meanwhile serving-women had prepared the bier and spread bedding over it
do not be such a fool , jeered xifeng
after the second watch , when the guests living at a distance had left , they prepared to farewell the dead and the women behind the mourning curtain began to wail
and how can i repeat this to madam lian ?
that same instant they heard a great clattering on the roo { and watchmen came running to their compound to catch the thieves
overjoyed by this news , jia zhen had the timber fetched without delay
they know you are a kindhearted , liberal master , who wo not ill−treat them like some other people
do you mean those walnut wafers you left by the tiller ?
our performance can ’ t possibly measure up to the standard to which these ladies are accustomed
baoyu bowed again in his delight and exclaimed , so it ’ s your birthday too , sister !
this was , in fact , the tradition in chenyuan prefecture
if the parents are snug , of course their sons will prosper
they walked along both corridors , and looked at the two libraries and at the building where the meat offerings were inspected
he must be hiding somewhere
hurrying over , bailiff chai called , little chin !
once you know him , you will be able to meet mr hsu
' i never spoke to you , said dr yu
i shouldn ’ t be surprised if she surpasses even baochai and all the rest of us here
you are much more perspicacious than i am
baoyu wiped his tears and smiled
and since the others had left he asked with a smile , who was that girl in red this afternoon ?
this was none other than chao ta , the brigand chief , who looked as fierce as ever with his dishevelled hair and wild eyes
besides , he was quite right
have you ever heard of such a thing before ?
jia lian reflected and said , i remember that year when cousin bao fell ill , we got a man who was not a professional to cure him
you did right to admit this
pao wen−ching came in , in a black gown and small cap , and knelt to pay his respects
thinking her dead , lady xing started sobbing too
suspecting from this that sheyue knew what had happened , wuer numbermiled sheepishly and made no reply
at this point yuanyang arrived , sent by the old lady to say that she had heard of baoyu 's relapse and xiren must comfort him and talk him round
but i ’ ve no paper or brush
and after all they ’ re your aunts , for all they ’ re young
when you go back , tell your husband from me : this match with the zhang family is out of the question
why should they do that ?
though there won ’ t be feasts and operas , we ’ ll all have to go with her to spend the day amusing their ladyships , and that won ’ t leave us any spare time
in the forty−fifth chapter , when the yu brothers examine the soil and talk of geomancy , their gestures are so well described that we can almost see these fools trying to mystify and impress their hearers
don ’ t worry , she told him
just buy another half catty then , said bu
maybe she has other things on her mind and won ’ t send us away until she ’ s dealt with them
after you helped me , lieutenant , i taught for a couple of years and saved up enough money to come home
don ’ t fuss , she retorted
fifty with me , i will tell you
besides , it ’ s not as if we ourselves had read the western chamber and the peony pavilion , which are licentious works
the best thing would be for me to take a holiday too , and go back with you
what if these two stories are fictitious ?
she was sound asleep and covered with peony petals , which had floated over from all sides to scatter , red and fragrant , over her face and clothes
what medicine had the doctors prescribed ?
i was convinced they ’ d make an ideal couple
the lady dowager said , this shows xifeng has good manners
lady xing looked round and saw some girls about
on the right side of the desk he had piled two sets of old books and one slim volume of essays
but who will bury me when dead i lie ?
so how could you slip up so as to deserve punishment ?
girls enjoy rustic fare at
baoyu sips tea in
if this is all , i tired of hearing it when my young lady was alive
i also had some of his ointment , and was very grateful for it too
get rid of him , quick , and fetch some doctor we know
they went to change their clothes before going to the reception hall
but they said since old mrs fang is being enshrined , they must join in her procession !
baoyu , wearing mourning , also went every day to the ning mansion , not returning to the garden till the evening after the guests had left
this has nothing to do with us
you must come and have breakfast with me tomorrow , and we will call on her together
his wife 's arrival roused jia zheng to still greater fury and he belaboured his son yet more mercilessly
how stupid of me !
i don ’ t want that , chuckled the latter
as the shrill music rang out , a little lad who had come to stand beside him clapped his hands and sang one of the songs of li pai
and drinking brings out all the worst in him
traces of frost stain the clustering flowers ;
the courier congratulated him , and the messenger presented a despatch , which had already been opened
if we get the loot , there 's no point in staying here we would better go to sea to have a good time , eh ?
to the primal void
but it was here in our house , objected lady wang
once we have the jade , it ’ ll be easy to question the thief
no , i ’ ve had enough , said madam you with a smile
some of the visitors had met them before
sixth master sat there awkwardly , drinking
he had no supper yesterday evening and passed a sleepless night , xiren explained
in the glare of a hundred torches the prime minister arrived , wu men , the main gate , was opened , and the officials entered through side gates
cousin daiyu is different
what i really want is a mouthful of hot spirits
he asked ssu tou
caiyun frantically assured him that she was not on friendly terms with baoyu , nor had she told anyone
lady wang was naturally so upset by this account that xifeng had to comfort her
none the less he objected , suppose , though , the old lady won ’ t let you go ?
i have not called on you to pay my respects , but your ladyship looks in better health than ever
the two girls sat down
he is a native of chuchow
please do not trouble , said mr tung
pin−niang knew this woman , of course
yoo wants you to teach his son , and would like you to take up your duties soon
of course i do !
one dish was brought in after another
show him in , ordered jia zheng
please overlook my negligence , elder sister
at once qingwen and others ordered the gate to be locked , and coming back qingwen said :
a beautiful invalid has her fortune told in a bawdy house
then , pointing at a lute on the wall , he asked , is this yours ?
the boy 's name will be changed to pao ting−hsi
besides , he told me repeatedly he would not let me give you this unless you offered him some reward
baochai , having sized up the situation , told them , let go of him
on the third i prepared a small dinner for you , said shen
not i , said the abbot
you go and rest now
it ’ s not that i think them dirty , said daiyu
why take the official examination then leave ?
xue pan took the pot , baoyu held the cup , and they poured two large cupfuls which feng ziying stood up and drained in a single breath
he wrenched himself free and made off
you know how much i dislike those vulgar conventions
you should not have done this , said mr lu
i am sorry i passed the district examination , since it means i have to address the local magistrate as my patron !
now you turn up with more yourself
surely you can taste the difference ?
i really can ’ t stand your household any longer !
do not you mind hurting her feelings ?
they feasted all day
madam lian says you and the young ladies must not laugh at her greediness , madam , she reported
i wouldn ’ t mind you finding another wife for your brother in-law , she sobbed
the lady dowager smiled sarcastically
he was laid up for three days with a cold , and when i went to see him he told me what had happened
she offered them tea in the outer room and after sitting quietly for a while they left , having asked her to let baoyu know that they had called
baoyu waited , mystified , until jia qiang arrived with a bird-cage containing a bird and a miniature stage
still green the smoke from tea brewed in a rare tripod ;
i can take him a message for you
don ’ t believe what those children say , miss , they begged siqi
so i ’ ve brought it back
we just looked on this as an outing , but they have sent offerings under the impression that we are making a serious sacrifice of it
you don ’ t understand , said zixing
she came when summoned in great fear and trembling
fluting cast a subtle enchantment over men ’ s senses ,
after drinking several cups of wine , tears rolled down mr
only , having been unwell recently and in view of all the troubles in the household , he had not yet referred the matter higher up
was about to explain that she wanted no special consideration from baoyu but he had recently shown too little ' to his maids , when someone outside the courtyard gate shouted , that monk is back again
has baoyu been up to anything improper ?
the next morning chi wei−hsiao called with tsung chi , who had served in the prince 's palace
sixth master called for more wine to drink , while they listened to her singing
this is even greater nonsense !
you two have grown tired of making fun of me every day , so now you ’ re picking on her
kai called his son out to mind the shop , then walked off with the old man through the south gate
not lingering by breezy spring 's peach and plum blossom
that ’ s enough , she cried
she added , may i make so bold , now that i am here , to suggest something , madam
when they had begged chin to do all he could , he left
the brothers had no sooner sat down than they ordered whiskers yiu to buy them two new square caps , as well as baskets , bronze receptacles , awnings , door−curtains , stoves , candlesticks , candle−scissors , and bags for their papers — two of each
where do you want to go ?
they drank tea and talked about the salt trade , after which a feast was spread with two tables each laid for two
let us go there together now
but this time our mistresses are too pernickety !
they had barely sat down , however , when the gate−keeper came in
and as he doesn ’ t mind how he behaves himself , you can ’ t blame his cousins and nephews for not being afraid of him
here in the boat
how can you compare yourself with me ?
it was the old lady and mistress who told us to call him baoyu , so as to make him live longer and keep him out of danger , they said
fortunate that her mother
to learn what followed , turn to the next chapter
it 's bacon , said chu−ko after a couple of mouthfuls
presently , wringing her hands , she shrieked with pain , her eyes nearly starting from her head , blood trickling from her mouth , her hair dishevelled
the pillar of the earth i stayed beside ;
after some conversation they dined and went to bed
surprised that he had been so indiscreet as to acknowledge his preference for her openly
now , honourable readers , though certain things are predestined and can not be helped , it is wrong for sons of concubines or ministers of vanquished states as well as for men of principle and chaste women to keep using this phrase as a handy excuse
in the middle , 'three and six ' make nine
otherwise other people will follow your example and make fun of her too
they searched all day in vain
if he were there and saw these books , his praise would make all the printers rush to have them
last time i had a bad fright till we heard it was just a rumour
by winter next year , when her cousins will have gone , it will be still quieter
pinger sent me to report this to you , madam
since your young mistress is in luck , of course you as her maid will be lucky too , which is more than your sister xiren can count on
this is no place for you to bicker and wrangle
take that as your subject , he said
i am faint with hunger
rubbish , said his father
when baoyu had assented he went on , i have told your brother ruan and your nephew lan to do some revision too
down south there they have so many ancient firs , they just extract the essence of the fungus on the roots and mix it with some kind of medicine to make this handsome snowy white pachyma cocos powder
it was only a slight chill
what sort of creature will he grow up to be ?
and , finally , kang hsi set up the bureau for the compilation of the ming dynasty history , which was joined even by scholars who had hitherto refused to work for the manchus , for they feared lest otherwise ming dynasty history might be distorted
a big varnished table with a felt cover will be needed too
that ’ s the way to do it
but good looks and a sweet dispostition are hard to find
people not knowing the truth may think her cross-grained , when in fact it ’ s all due to this illness which has upset her liver and weakened her heart
they ’ ve written year after year inviting us to visit the capital
i don ’ t like incense perfumes
my family was poor , and we lived for ten years in a house rented from the nunnery ; so i often went in to see her when i was free , and she ’ s the one who taught me all the characters i know
time enough to worry then
to plant them by the fence before my court ;
bring the gentlemen 's luggage aboard here , and send their boat back
as soon as they arrived , baochai sat down and announced teasingly , you must kneel down
jia qiang asked with a smile
jia she and jia zheng led the way , followed by two old nurses with horn-lanterns
at once jia rong ’ s wife qin keqing said with a smile : we have a room ready here for uncle baoyu
if you both sleep on that clothes-warmer , i ’ ll be all alone out here
but no more of this
if a match between the gold and the jade was predestined , how could baoyu lose the jade ?
she soon noticed , however , that madam you was not her usual amiable self , simply sitting there lost in thought
his rule is strengthened by great bells of bronze ,
the lady dowager , hearing this , called over her shoulder to xifeng , your third cousin 's place is pleasant
in all the garden , not just these apartments , which servant have you ever seen reprimand her children in the master ’ s rooms ?
we can see this is no ordinary beauty
he ’ s lost over ten taels already , but he never pays up
just wait with an easy mind , cousin , he urged him
it ’ s been reported to me that liu er ’ s wife and her younger sister ran gambling parties together , but mrs liu was really the one behind it
when this garden was built there was a detailed architect ’ s drawing , and though it was done by craftsmen the lay-out and directions are accurate
where have you come from ?
on her orders the maid hurriedly fetched one of the pages and , standing outside the window , he paid his respects
naturally we shall not press you , said lou chan , hastily calling for tea
as they thanked him for going to such trouble , they left the garden and made their way to the lady dowager ’ s quarters
some of them showed good sense , some were quite subtle
if that ’ s how you feel , you ’ d better hire a special company to play my favourite pieces instead of expecting me to cash in on someone else ’ s birthday
i did wonder , though , how that could be , as she had been in good health
as we travelled here together , i know her character and what she ’ s like
ruiguan was delighted with it
his scholarship and moral character are excellent , and he ’ s a southerner too
this is not yet the time for you to entertain guests
skirting the hedge , shereached a moon-gate and stepped through it
that temple you just visited is on fire !
when magistrate hsiang opened the commissioner 's letter he was amazed and hastily ordered his men to open the gate of his house and invite mr pao in , going out himself to welcome him
so how could they make a check ?
blessed by imperial favour , we would fain
once i have closed my eyes and breathed my last , they can quarrel and storm as much as they like
it ’ s all right as long as we don ’ t get really drunk
i see the point of this place , declared jia zheng
heaven is yang and the earth yin , for instance
as the young man had not risen to the bait , jingui feared baochan might despise her for this fiasco and therefore tried to cover up , changing her tune
you wouldn ’ t care for this stuff
who cares about your gold and jade anyway ?
if i could live and die with such a man , i would not be grieving and pining away like this !
they sat up apprehensively till dawn , when daiyu seemed a little better
the next day be went back to school as if nothing had happened
a child was born , and tiger marked the day
some matrons announced that another opera was starting
at long last she sobbed :
baoyu produced and lit his eaglewood , bowed to it with tears in his eyes , then turned and ordered mingyan to return the incense-burner
i never guessed that he was no more
a monk came out to greet them , but when he knew their errand he refused them admittance
daiyu continued , the last two lines of your verse are all very well
how can i live on ?
they lay on their beds burning with fever and babbling deliriously
i know you are an able organizer , madam ; that 's why i asked you here to decide
not yet , said the child
since feng chun−jui is a chinese scholar , the prestige of the court is at stake , replied tang
but we can hardly go and dig up graves , can we ?
the young ladies plus their maids come to forty or fifty people , yet each day we get only a couple of hens , a couple of ducks , some dozen catties of meat and one string of cash worth of vegetables
he is a great blessing to the county
soon huang chiu arrived with wang number six
don ’ t talk about silver treated like dirt , every precious thing you could name was heaped up like hills , no one bothering to check the wicked waste
just now i asked madam lian where you were , and she said you ’ d gone to the garden
tanchun said with a smile , there are plenty of silly people ; don ’ t take it so seriously
this reminded him of the passage in zhuangzi :
the following day yu yu−chung came on foot , with a porter carrying a bushel of rice
the first time was when they came to explain the miraculous nature of the jade ; the second time , when baoyu was so ill and the monk took the jade in his hand and intoned some incantation to cure him ; the third time , when he brought back the jade and i saw him sitting in the front hall , then all of a sudden he vanished
she ’ s treating you well because she ’ s so exceptionally kind and generous
to hog it all myself might bring me bad luck ; and after thinking it over i decided you were the only one fit to share it
in the middle , a 'four and a one '
she picked up the pouch meaning to cut it to pieces as well
when i ’ ve serious business , i consult her ; when there ’ s none , she amuses me
they looked at the hall and south corridor , at tripitaka 's burial place and the great frying pan , then went back to the entrance to buy a packet of sweetmeats , and sat down in a tea−house behind the pagoda to drink a pot of tea
he 's making my mouth water
her clothes and trinkets , which were worth some three or four hundred taels , they kept for future use
since there was accommodation for both the dead and the living , the mourners escorting coffins had somewhere to stay
have you only just woken up to them ?
a toad hankering for a taste of swan , scoffed pinger
but as you assigned zijuan to my service , madam , i am emboldened to ask you to agree so that she can realize her aspirations
when chih and tu had taken these three to inspect the preparation of the meat , they came back to ask chin tung−ya to act as herald , wu shu to signal with the banner , tsang liao−chai to recite the prayers , chi wei−hsiao , hsin tung−chih and yu ho−sheng to present wine , chu hsien−fu , lu hsin−hou and yu kan−chi to present jade , chu−ko tien−shen , ching lan−chiang and kuo tieh−pi to present silk , hsiao chin−hsuan , chu hsin and yin chao to present grain , and chi tien−yi , chin yu−liu and tsung chi to present sacrificial viands
if something had given him a turn and brought on another fit , what should we have done ?
i spoke frankly , sir , out of concern for you , not wanting to keep anything back , li answered
yinger answered with a giggle , those two lines seem to match the words on your locket , miss
we should both mind our own business
then the window paper rustled
in the beginning creation had no abode ;
they helped him out to rest
we all ought to take steps
the day will come when you ’ re raided too
invite him in here , replied dr yu
if this is some other business , that ’ s not my affair ; but if it ’ s about those little novices , you must handle it my way
i am not dying yet a while
baoyu knew that she was teasing , and baochai blushed scarlet
he walked forward with a smile
asked the old lady
he was born in the forty−first year of kang hsi , when the manchus had completed their conquest of china proper and were suppressing the minority peoples in the frontier regions
it ’ s not quite dry yet
like water did its lovely fragrance flow :
yes , said lady wang
for further details , read the next chapter
then the runner quietly picked up a brick , charged forward like an avenging fury and hit the other man 's head with the brick so that the blood gushed out
just what i think , agreed qingwen
you are absolutely right !
in exile rather would i meet my end ,
inviting her in she said :
on his way home from nanking after taking the provincial examination , dr yu caught cold and fell ill
then he conducted them into the library , in front of which was a small garden furnished with a lyre , goblets , a stove and some stands
when they came to the west , hsiao chin−hsuan bearing grain and chi tien−yi bearing viands led the master of sacrifice down the west side , passing in front of the incense table and turning east
lan said nothing , only smiled
yet another girl announced , breakfast is ready
after this harangue tanchun resumed her seat in silence
when they heard this and noticed huan ’ s absence — though earlier on he had been running all over the place — they suspected him but were unwilling to say so
cried kuo , falling to the ground
she ’ s gone up in my estimation
tomorrow i ’ ll ask her ladyship ’ s leave to go home
there are twelve big screens and four small ones for kang
when niu pu came back inside , he was met by an angry , red−faced pu hsin
well , set your heart at rest
as for the chestnuts , she had pretended to hanker after them to make him forget the junket , for fear of a repetition of that incident involving maple-dew tea which had landed qianxue in trouble
sure that they must share the same views , he felt he had found a friend after his own heart ; but since this was their first meeting he had to hold himself in check , the more so as jia huan and jia lan were present
this priest also frequented the ning and rong mansions , where he had come to be known as one-plaster wang ; for he claimed that his plasters were so efficacious that each could cure all manner of different ailments
yang was old and asthmatic and needed someone to attend to him during the night ; so he sent for his second son
if instead of that we just report it , lady xing may make excuses in order to shift the responsibility
i do not believe it
now we have received an imperial decree forbidding the slaughter of cows , and our superiors have ordered us to see that this rule is strictly enforced
as soon as the meal was finished , a woman from the ning mansion arrived with an indent for incense and lamps
he whispered the answer to baoyu , who took the hint and secretly told his grandmother
away ! '' she cried `` set craven doubt aside ,
please don ’ t stand in their way , madam
xiangyun hastily struck the stove again
you don ’ t understand , replied lady wang with a laugh
xin told them then how the two actors cold-shouldered losers and made up to winners
i expect he ’ s on his way now , travelling day and night , and will be here in little more than a fortnight
on days when the old lady ’ s in a good humour she lets him drink all he wants , but on other days she won ’ t let him touch a drop
then a feast was spread and they sat down to eat
the money came from
though siqi ’ s parents belong to the elder master ’ s household , her uncle works here
just sing a couple of scenes to amuse these ladies with our amateur style
and when zijuan inside heard what baoyu meant to do , even more frantic than the rest she completely forgot her resolve to remain aloof and ran out to help restrain him
is that a good omen or a bad one ?
i have two or three hundred taels of silver to spend on compiling a collection of essays
i thought it was something different , but it 's only the same again
in the third , the old women won ’ t be working hard all year for nothing , but will have a few perks
numbercr mind in a turmoil of anguish , she burst out weeping again until soon she was perspiring
she ’ s deliberately needling me !
last time you said it could not be true , today you say it is
instead of rising to offer her a seat , he simply stared at her with a foolish grin
what are you up to now ?
little did i think the magistrate today would record my official robes and rank on that despatch
huan ’ s marriage shouldn ’ t cost more than three thousand , which we can raise easily by cutting down on other expenses
when you ’ ve time , drop in again as relatives should
just then qiaojie came in with granny liu and pinger , followed by lady wang who lald the whole blame on jia yun and wang ren
yen 's illness went from bad to worse
it ’ s silly to stay standing here
just as i am admiring your courage , i find you are mr hsiao 's son !
you need have no anxiety on that score , replied chen with a smile
the magistrate is a friend of my brother 's !
the party broke up long ago and the old lady ’ s left the garden
how is it i didn ’ t know ?
i did not go to tell her
once they were alone the lady dowager sneered , i hear you ’ ve been doing some matchmaking for you husband
she told her maids , take this case to the garden , so that it ’ ll be easier to distribute these presents to the different apartments there
why trouble yourself over this ?
he will be all right , said pinger
pinger came in and said , madam xue sent xiangling over to ask me something
i beg your honour to make further investigations
baoyu , close behind her , sighed
he simply coughed by way of comment , after which both of them retired for the night
dynasties rise and fall , mornings change to evenings ; winds from the river bring down old trees from a former reign ; and fame , riches , rank may vanish without a trace
ginseng ’ s expensive , rejoined baochai with a smile
from the beam of an empty room your nest will fall
now jia zheng suddenly remembered his presence
why are you so hot and bothered ?
and tanchun , told by the old lady to join them , after first declining the honour sat down opposite baoqin , shishu then brought out a bowl and chopsticks
alpinia fills the courtyard free from dust ,
feeling easier in his mind he called for water to wash in and decided to stay quietly at home for a couple of days , partly to rest , partly to avoid outside contacts
i ’ ve a bad enough reputation as it is
then i went to her ladyship 's place just as she was looking through some cases with madam lian and the concubines zhao and zhou , sorting out the bright clothes she would worn in her young days to give away
next day , at the crack of dawn , baoyu scrambled into his clothes
just then , however , the prince 's steward announced , the guards at the gate say that his majesty has sent the prince of beijing to proclaim another decree and they ask the commissioner to receive him
noticing that the alcohol sprayed on pinger ’ s clothes was now almost dry , he pressed the clothes with the iron and folded them neatly
it ’ s good of you to think of such things , but you mustn ’ t overwork , he answered
if it were a pregnancy , the liver humour should be strong
this said , he went off with xinger
go to your grandfather 's grave , he said , and tell him that i am growing old and the weather is too cold for me to come myself to wish him a happy new year
with that she served tea
when it came to saying goodbye to the girls , she was prostrated by grief
a bridge across this pool led you to three secluded chambers where tu shao−ching used to retire to study
there 's only one decent room in it
they ate until sunset , by which time butcher hu was tipsy
she simply replied , ~'all right , let her take a rest
you will be questioned in chiangtu county
i ’ ll help you find it
ching lan−chiang looked up
next she asked for the box of rhyme cards , pulled out the thirteenth drawer and told the maid to pick four cards at random
fang kuo−chen occupied chekiang , chang shih−cheng occupied soochow , and chen yiuliang occupied hukuang
one of them had already picked up a brush and written a short preface based on ha zheng ’ s account simply changing a few words
so much the better
i shall come with my son to pay our respects in less than a fortnight , he said
please give my regards to mr kao and mr chin when you go back
inside , verandahs on both sides led to a three-roomed entrance hall in the middle of which stood a screen of marble in a red sandalwood frame
may i make so bold as to ask to have a glimpse of the lady ’ s face , so that i can see how she looks before venturing to make out a prescription
do not make a fuss about it
thank you for coming !
our prefect issued a circular saying he is a dangerous criminal , so summonses have been sent to the different provinces
he deserves to die , xifeng snorted
they greeted the assembled company , and sat down
three ancient kings there were so pure and true
and our young lady ’ s the one who dotes on him most
do not let this rumpus he kicked up upset you
seeing how put out he looked and knowing what a sentimentalist he was , she decided to use his infatuation to cure him
one gateman went in and reported this , handing jia zheng the letter which he opened and read :
only jia lan stayed with his mother and studied hard , writing compositions which he took to school for jia dairu to correct ; but as recently the tutor had been confined to his bed the boy had at present to study on his own
soon all her hair had come down
i ’ ve a patient taking medicine in my place too now
i shall have a good talk with her too
the magistrate signed a warrant and sent runners to yen 's house to arrest him , but he had flown
so far the old lady knows nothing about this business
their distant relatives did not come , however , and neither did jia she
she 's very good-looking , answered jia qiang , and nearly fourteen already
chin , you must give mr kao the wherewithal to take with him
my apartments are the largest , let 's meet there
now , with this other one here , i should be able to crack down on them hard !
today baochai came to visit her and turned the conversation to her illness
complained fangguan , just ladling some soup on the rice and eating a bowlful with two pieces of goose
luckily her remark had been heard only by baoyu and baochai
later you can explain to madam lian yourself , miss
you needn ’ t worry , she urged
sit down next to me and i will tell you
two days later the lists were published — neither of them had passed
that is why this temple was built and offerings are made to his image
a man may be awe-inspiring and exalted ,
thus we see how the actor pao wen−ching helps old ni and the kindness of the monk in sweet dew temple to niu pu−yi
it 's because you are so good at it that you got kicked right under your heart yesterday
in that case i must see her today
jia lian attended the funeral ceremonies at pear fragrance court for seven days and seven nights , during which monks and priests chanted sutras
xifeng teased , when an old ancestress wants to celebrate some grandchild ’ s birthday , no matter how grandly , who are we to protest ?
i have been working all this time in your house , sir , said the tailor
but after the mid−autumn festival the doctors stopped prescribing medicine , and all the stewards and servants were summoned back from the estates
when i asked at the board of punishments , i did not hear the result of the two princes ' report but was told that this morning censor li brought another charge against the prefect of pingan , accusing him of pandering to an official in the capital and oppressing the people to please his superior there were several serious charges
he taught girls horsemanship and archery ,
then young xue , who will never give an inch to anyone , ordered his men to beat feng yuan into a pulp
and even as they rose to their feet she came in
after giving furthef instrutions to other members of the family , jia zheng bade farewell to tbe ancestral shrine , had sutras chanted for a few days at the temple outside the city , then
all the rest of his family are as fierce as dragons and tigers ; he 's the only good man of the lot
the title-deeds of houses and land and the bonds of the family slaves were also sealed up
he made the young eunuch fetch it and gave it to baoyu , who received it with both hands , thanked him and then withdrew
last time one of our teachers tested the students of eight counties together , and i was first of the eight
since i caused the trouble it ’ s up to me to fix it
it ’ s worse for you than for us who are here on our own
and instead of seeing to the presents my parents ’ family sent , he sat there swearing and wouldn ’ t bring them in
he turned then to welcome xiren who had only just come in
who asked your opinion ?
naturally those petty-minded people dislike me
he called on his maternal uncle bu shiren , number who kept a perfumery from which he had just returned
that would be much better
it was too bad of you to spoil their fun
by climbing fig its fragrance reinforced ;
presently it was new year 's eve and old pu 's sons celebrated with wine , a good meal and a charcoal brazier
i was not lying about my money , was i ?
that is hardly fair
zijuan sat down too then beside him
hurry up and wake up !
after being provoked and further upset by baoyu , zijuan wept the whole night long
