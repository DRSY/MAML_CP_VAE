0	oh , nenuphar is crazy
0	on this particular morning , aroma ’ s mother had been round first thing to report to grandmother jia that she was taking her daughter home for a new year ’ s party and would not be bringing her back until late that even¬ing
0	i think your brains must have been addled by too much study
0	this was in large part because usury ’ s emergence into public view was so dramatically sudden
0	grannie liu was concerned to know the latest developments at rong-guo house and sent ban-er into town to find out
0	or suppose one day he finds some means of reopening the case ?
0	joker waved his hand in
0	i suggest smartweed bank and flowery harbour
0	bao-chai and tan-chun were standing at the edge of the pool looking at the fish
0	lest sleeve or pillow they should spot or stain ,
0	no , only mrs lian hasn ’ t paid up yet
0	where are your manners , girl ?
0	of the branchlets forming this flowery cascade
0	i wanted to escape and go home , but i couldn ’ t find any of you to take me back
0	for franics meres in wit ’ s commonwealth ( ) this suggests yet another bestial simile for the usurer : vultures kill nothing themselues , but seaze vpon it being killed of others : so vsurers liue vpon the sweate of other mens browes , and enioy the fruit of other mens labours , against the ordinance of god and man ( )
0	sojourner , then usury must not be demanded from him
0	anyway , i intend to eat it all , come what may i ’
0	she asked , and demanded that the owners should come forward and open them
0	everyone ’ s always saying what a holy terror she is and how you ’ re all afraid of her
0	she ’ s ever so poised and grown-up when you aren ’ t here , auntie
0	out flew xi-feng ’ s hand and dealt him a resounding smack on the face that sent him flying
0	to¬wards evening she was given the second infusion
0	if you ask me , someone ’ s doing this out of spite
0	you , the appellant , an outsider with no first-hand knowledge of the case , in presuming to fabricate this unfounded appeal are guilty of contempt of court
0	i ’ m sure if we take it slowly i ’ ll be able to understand
0	while holding it , he had made the arrangement with mrs you ’ s first husband , who was his good friend , as a result of which zhang hua and er-jie were engaged to each other from their earliest infancy
0	aroma tugged at him with all her might and wouldn ’ t let go
0	now we shall really see something !
0	but the leader of the jugglers was bearing down on her
0	but if you want to smash them on purpose because you like the noise , it ’ s perfectly all right to do so
0	i have , sir , replied bao-yu
0	he was already a licensed scholar at the age of fourteen
0	all you do is build up a lot of resentment against your-self and turn a lot of nasty , spiteful people into your enemies
0	now there ’ s a nice , simple , lively game !
0	jia lian received these instructions with relief , mainly on young qin ’ s behalf , as he would now be spared the master ’ s wrath
0	fetch me a few of those bottles of flavouring essence that were sent us the other day
0	you go and have a proper meal with your grandma
0	i believe in the marriage of stone and flower
0	i am so relieved !
0	jia yun blushed too
0	i have no idea what you are trying to suggest
0	whose sad notes with the wind ’ s plaint harmonize
0	come here , said xi-feng
0	and as regards my second line , i should have thought a few words on the brilliance of the feast were called for , in order to do justice to the occasion
0	he said , smiling broadly at her
0	both her cheeks were burning
0	first we ask to be told the three lines of the lower trigram
0	the creatures too seem to be grander than what they are outside
0	but what a lot of trouble i am causing !
0	from this last post i returned to the capital under impeachment , and have now resumed my former position at the board of works
0	once more she rebuked oriole
0	élégante and the other little actresses came forward to make their curtseys and to inquire what pieces they should play
0	stand up now and listen to what i have to say
0	let us consider this in greater detail
0	it ’ s not much of a present , i ’ m afraid , but it will do to remind you of our meeting
0	from now on you must start getting better
0	the dub was to be renamed the peach-flower club ’ and dai-yu was to be its presi¬dent
0	in fact , there must be
0	we can ’ t all be as happy-go-lucky as you are , said you-shi
0	i ’ m not short of money ; and besides , i don ’ t touch that sort of thing either
0	she chose this moment to go up and speak to him
0	i ’ ve got to see grandma now , said bao-yu
0	they ’ ve already commissioned someone to draw a plan , which should be ready tomorrow
0	how is she now ?
0	if one were to add it all up together , i think your real income must be somewhere in the region of four or five hundred taels a year
0	where are you off to in such a damned hurry ?
0	xi-feng began gesturing with her hands , but was dou¬bled up with laughter before she could get a word out
0	look what you ’ ve brought on yourself !
0	( – ) this is in contrast to adam ’ s rational , kantian reaction to consciousness
0	i think the great advantage of this proposal is that it is so economical and makes the job of construction so much easier
0	it ’ s about half a cup of tea off dinner-time , she said
0	oh , she ’ s always like that , said tan-chun
0	she was never very fond of you while she was alive , and you ’ d be well advised not to go walking in the garden alone after this , or her ghost may pounce on you and try to take its revenge !
0	that is what their holinesses have taken hold of ; by so doing they have rendered the spirits harmless
0	let me make you a reverence now , to show my gratitude
0	she was going to report you , but bao-yu made out that it was she who was in the wrong , so she couldn ’ t go through with it
0	after another brief homily , jia zheng led the way and father and son took a carriage to the school , tealeaf following with the books
0	xi-feng ’ s baby daughter was ill the doctor had been called and had just finished taking her pulses
0	my dear good woman , said aunt zhao , we ’ ve no choice but to let her get away with it
0	i certainly don ’ t want to hand in a blank sheet and make a fool of us both
0	you might let us know if you have , so that we know what to do with next month ’ s allowance
0	there you are wrong , said tan-chun
0	( – ) ngugi suggests that neo-imperialism , being a form of domination that is ( usually ) exercised by the manipulation of symbols rather than by physical force , must be understood in metaphysical terms
0	it ’ s obvious that their husbands have been making money behind your uncle zheng ’ s back
0	if her heart is really set on being a nun and we continue to be so inflexible , she may really take her own life
0	such attempts could draw on readings of the bible that emphasized the gospel ’ s liberation of christians from the mosaic law
0	lady wang agreed and you-shi sent someone to xi-feng to explain what had been decided
0	but someone seemed to have been through them before him , for all he could find were a few bits of broken jewellery and a few far from new silk dresses
0	paradise lost ’ s mammon embodies this alienated consciousness , and milton brings home the definitive nature of his allegorical referent when he describes him as alienated from god even when in his presence :
0	her true-love ’ s gone to follow ambition ’ s drum
0	though deeply distressed on parfumee ’ s behalf , he decided , after some hesitation , that intervention by him could only make matters worse , and resolved to stay where he was
0	unable to set himself free , he could only sigh and say :
0	but later , when he was going to bed , she saw the magnificent blood-red sash round his waist and began to put two and two together
0	i only asked for you because i wanted to give an order and nobody could be found
0	at first light , after a sleepless night , she had to report once more for duty to ladies xing and wang
0	unlike his predecessor , byron agrees with the devil ; he does not understand the sin of idolatry , and as a result he adopts the satanic perspective in which signs are mistaken for the reality they convey
0	to fill in the embarrassed silence that was developing , he pretended to be feeling for something at his waist
0	that was where i first learned that you had achieved enlightenment and had renounced the world , to soar in the realm of the immortals
0	i am so uncomfortable lying down like this
0	the term enclosure describes this forcible creation of a proletariat , and the period ’ s literature often remarks on the mutual determination between enclosure and usury
0	what about giving an example or two of what you mean ?
0	i sent a man with a note today , jia lian was saying
0	she thought she would wait till later , but after the offering lady wang urged her to hurry about her duties
0	and years of health shall be your fee
0	if you find a word of a lie in what i ’ ve told you , you can beat me to death and i shan ’ t complain
0	tealeaf scrambled to his feet , picked up the burner and fol¬lowed bao-yu inside
0	it was nothing really
0	all the cousins were now standing with their faces turned upwards , watching the kites as they soared higher and higher into the sky
0	i ’ d never have thought anything like this would ever come our way , said cook liu
0	my son was favoured , i recall , with your gracious approval , and we have long anticipated the great joy that your daughter ’ s charming presence would bring to our household
0	the precious hours of autumn i ’ ll not waste ,
0	can by saying her ave marye
0	you ’ ve got a nerve , my lad , playing a trick like that on me !
0	you shouldn ’ t do that
0	he heard one of the guards shouting outside :
0	he told them to take him back to his room
0	slowly the life returned to dai-¬yu ’ s eyes and she looked up
0	bao-yu hurried over to him
0	it ’ s no use crying , miss
0	as wind and dew alight
0	these are all things that you would have seen for your¬self , ma ’ am , she added , with the exception of his out¬burst during the summer , which i have not mentioned to a soul until now
0	golden threw herself , weeping , upon her knees :
0	what we have now , i am afraid , is an advanced case of dehydration
0	the young lady xue pan was marrying was said to be not only beautiful but educated ; it followed , in caltrop ’ s reasoning , that she must be gentle and ladylike as well
0	her if she wanted any
0	it ’ s only because of your lack of experience that you can think shallow -stuff like that any good
0	if you won ’ t cut it , i ’ ll cut it for you
0	only please don ’ t let him know that it was me that told you , she wept and implored
0	if you ask me , number think you ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor
0	bao-chai had always behaved towards jia huan in exactly the same way as she did towards bao-yu and made no distinc¬tions between them
0	she smiled when she saw what she had got
0	i wonder which of the girls had offended her to make her so
0	and you have the audacity to ask me do i like it ?
0	but this criticism assumes that life can be broken down into distinct levels of material and ideal , or economic and psychological , activities
0	but in spite of her impatience to get better , the weakness was not to be cured in a day , and it was not until well into the autumn of that year , after months of slow con¬valescence , that her body recovered its strength and the dis¬charge of blood finally dried up
0	the first half of mencius he knew reasonably well , but certainly not well enough to be able to carry on from any sentence given him at random
0	that is why the modern discipline of economics does not treat them as such , preferring to pretend that they are objective and thus real
0	i can not see whi ye ought or mai
0	after a while , bao-yu had composed himself suf¬ficiently to think
0	you manage to get clear again with your second line
0	she merely asked him whether it hurt very badly ’
0	sir she ’ s son-in-law , mr sun , has sent a servant with a message , sir
0	you had better return at once
0	he ’ ll have made it up himself
0	lady wang told jia lan to read the letter out aloud
0	all you ’ ve got to do is stretch your hands out for washing-water and your mouths open for food
0	i used to be able to drop round and see her ten times a day if i felt like it ; but now they ’ ve closed the little side-gate and i have to go round by the front , which is such a performance
0	i ’ m not surprised they say players are hard folk to handle
0	i ’ m not in the slightest mad
0	that circumstances should have put such an obstacle in the way of our plans has been a source of great regret to me
0	her words seemed to have little effect on him other than making him feel rather uncomfortable
0	it is in the nature of this process to disguise itself , to conceal the fact that a reversal of roles has taken place , and to make people believe that the subject really is objective and the object really is subjective
0	she felt too exhausted to cope with a visitor , and so pretended to be asleep
0	he was obliged to wait until sundown before tealeaf finally came back
0	whatever it was , she must have abandoned it , for , after reflecting for a few moments ins in silence , all she said was :
0	take kinship first : you are my cousin on father ’ s side ; cousin bao is only a mother-cousin
0	where have all the gentlemen gone to ?
0	on meeting with determined opposition to his proposal , he finally lost patience with her and , after some angry shouting , walked out on her in a temper
0	then i fell asleep my¬self
0	he got up and stomped out of the room
0	i really don ’ t know , said bao-yu
0	an interesting phenomenon , observed jia zheng
0	i blame myself for allowing this to happen
0	come , ma ’ am , put in zhou rui ’ s wife , that ’ s hardly a very sen¬sible question
0	i think i shall go in and rest , said dai-yu
0	if i ’ d lost my head and started scream¬ing , i might have woken everybody up
0	it ’ s only during the last few years since i ’ ve grown up and married lian that i ’ ve had to start being a bit more strait-laced with him
0	you must try to get well , she said
0	but i seem to have lost my way
0	the sounds of music everywhere pulsate
0	an utterly fantastic notion ! — can not , must not suffice
0	at ten o ’ clock that night the gates were firmly barred - a somewhat superfluous precaution by now - and everyone lay in bed in a state of nervous wakefulness
0	who boast in mortal things , and wond ’ ring tell of babel , and the works of memphian kings , learn how their greatest monuments of fame , and strength and art are easily outdone by spirits reprobate , and in an hour
0	in good generalship surprise is of the essence
0	a maid came in to tell xi-feng that the doctor had arrived
0	bao-yu , who had been hoping that they would go , indicated that they might do so and went off with the two junior maids to a secluded corner behind some rocks where he could question them
0	in its modern form , it involves the externalization of labor-power in the abstract , fetishized form of money
0	panic began to grip her
0	something warns me not to keep it
0	as for pan ’ s friends , it ’ s a waste of time expecting any help from them
0	i don ’ t know about learning how to write poetry : what you ’ ll likelier get , if you go on much longer in this fashion , is a serious illness !
0	i want to see one of my great-grandchildren , and then i think i can set my heart at rest
0	the old lady said what a favourable report she had heard of her husband , while xiang-yun confirmed that married life was turning out happily for her , and begged grandmother jia to set her mind at rest
0	he was about to say something when benevo¬lentia came in and fetched sapientia away to help her lay the table
0	hearing n reply and thinking that they must have fallen asleep with their lights on , she went herself to put them out
0	we must be incompatible
0	it will seem more like a proper visit to rela¬tions if you stay a bit , instead of popping in and popping straight out again
0	then i saw you come out again
0	the floor below the kang was thronged with old women and maids in attendance
0	we must hurry or we shall miss the gates
0	before i go back myself i must first try to sort out exactly what this job is going to entail
0	she isn ’ t worth your getting upset about !
0	the women on night-duty must take the blame
0	at the time jia lian had given him some money and promised him a new wife
0	just because your father ’ s not at home
0	i ’ m sure that if you two went on zennifying at each other till you were both blue in the face , we should still be standing here quite as much in the dark as ever
0	after chatting for a while longer , they got up to go
0	the faust story has moved through many variations as it adapts to disparate historical and cultural circumstances , but in one factor it is absolutely consistent
0	it doesn ’ t really look right , but i can ’ t do any more—aiyo !
0	it will be remembered how jia lian , on hearing of his father ’ s grave illness , had hurried to his place of exile
0	it ’ s not as if you ’ ll be doing anything deceitful
0	in our grey world so are things always ordered :
0	a word or two concerning this diuision of the mony & time
0	it ’ s quite a reunion !
0	the first of these was faithful , who had taken a vow to remain single all her life
0	well , if you ’ ve already looked for him and he can ’ t be
0	even when we went in we were never far apart , we were always within sight of each other
0	when he got there be found jia zheng already sipping his wheatmeal tea and
0	in fact everyone in the city , from imperial princes to shopkeepers , has heard of the cassia xias
0	bao-yu expressed his admiration
0	faust , the enlightened man of science , scorns the witches ’ rites , until mephistopheles explains their real function :
0	after all , you ’ ll want to be on speaking terms with your son ’ s inaws after the boy is married
0	oh , don ’ t be such an old woman !
0	seemes of her bad trade to make iust defending
0	she was aided in this by a highly expressive pair of eyes which seldom failed to convey their message
0	yu-cun smiled back deprecatingly
0	i ’ ve just been having a dream in which i went into a large garden and met some girls there who called me a nasty creature and wouldn ’ t have anything to do with me
0	herself ; she belongs to the right lineage ; her ladyship likes her ; she ’ s a bit unsure of herself perhaps , but that ’ s all the doing of that wretched zhao woman ; in other respects she ’ s very much like bao-yu
0	the phrase in show equates the reputation , or image , of a divine with the reality , and this confusion is evident in faustus ’ s subsequent reasoning :
0	in money , human essence is alienated in the form of a thing
0	her writing to me in this way shows that she must credit me with some intelligence
0	he was lust stepping off the drenched blossoms bridge when he caught sight of xing xiu-yan bustling along in a very purposeful manner from the opposite direction
0	not really , replied dai-yu
0	he said , catching sight of the maid
0	i was just trying to talk some sense into her when you came in
0	this set the ladies ’ minds at rest
0	surely you can settle your differences in a more civilized fashion ?
0	lawrence malkin records how
0	she held out the scabbard with the single sword in it in her left hand
0	a day or two after these events , dai-yu , having eaten her breakfast , decided to take nightingale with her to visit grandmother jia
0	she sent the maids to fetch a large mei¬ping vase with wide shoulders and a very narrow neck to put the plum-blossom in when it arrived
0	as the flowers embroidered on them were all copied from flower-paintings by famous masters , their design and colouring were far superior to the cruder , more garish productions of professional embroiderers ; and the accompanying verses , all chosen with impeccable taste from a wide range of literary sources , were executed in black embroidery-silk with such consummate skill that every hook and squiggle , every variation in thickness of line , every join and break in the brush-written grass script ’ calligraphy was exactly reproduced , not mangled and deformed as in the stilted , wooden attempts at copying of the commercial embroiderer
0	seeing his uncle ahead of him , he stood politely to attention and greeted him cheerfully :
0	i ’ m sure it number simply that bao-yu is too upset by this decision of xi-chun ’ s to know what he is saying
0	aroma sat at his bedside sewing , a white horse-hair fly-whisk with a handle of white rhinoceros-horn at her side
0	see that his pa doesn ’ t frighten him !
0	you can ’ t see her ladyship now
0	then will you please tell her to come with me straight away , said lin ’ s wife
0	the ning-guo servants , who grew fat on the pickings , were delighted with these new arrangements and , anxious that they should go on , if possible , for ever , took very good care that no one outside the mansion should get to hear about them
0	what patterns are there ?
0	bao-yu , who stood by smiling while she washed , now urged her to put on some make-up
0	england clearly saw and often said , usury is inherently insatiable
0	and he was unmarried
0	her consent was given with a nod , conveyed at once to jia rong by her mother , and in due course reported to cousin zhen
0	tan-chun could see how low dai-yu ’ s spirits were , and how tired she was
0	at least i shall have some support then in the world to come , if all support in this world is to be denied me !
0	bao-yu , laughing with the others , got up and straightened out his clothes
0	i ’ ll go along with zheng ’ s idea , and i leave it to you to make the necessary arrange¬ments
0	how could they be so heartless and so cruel ?
0	smile she ordered a welcome home ’ dinner for her husband and took autumn to make her kotows to grandmother jia and lady wang
0	it ’ s not something of my own
0	at once there was a clash of cymbals followed by the mournful strains of a funeral band
0	she finished her tea
0	you-shi was delighted with this news
0	i should have thought that a couple of beauties like feng and patience would have been enough for you , she went on
0	he ’ s written the names on the packets , she said
0	crimson pearl ’ s suffering spirit returns
0	you can go on with your lecture afterwards
0	why don ’ t you come round and ask me for it tomorrow ?
0	i only wish we had got to hear of you earlier
0	this is the substance of the governor ’ s final findings : xue pan was already intoxicated when zhang san refused to replace the wine
0	jia zheng and company had also been in¬formed , and they too made the sad journey home
0	in butler ’ s terms , he rejects the implicit metaphysics of a sustainable promise ,
0	oh , what a shame !
0	what do you mean ?
0	to sell time was to sell life , and the essence of life was the soul
0	during the seventeenth century , the various subject-positions created by a usurious economy began to fall into the patterns that we recognize today
0	you ’ ll have to come along and see them
0	ever since i first moved into the garden , the little south-east corner gate has been left open
0	let me tell you the reason for my change of plan
0	i shall probably be all right again after a few doses , without a single soul knowing any-thing about it
0	getting out of bed , she dragged herself over to take tangerine ’ s part in the argument
0	it was only then that her head began to clear ; she threw on some clothes and told the old matrons to heat the water for adamantina ’ s morning tea
0	who will pass over ,
0	where stands , mossed by old rains , the flower-pot
0	a string of cash each
0	the eldest had only one eye , the second had only one ear , the third had only one nostril , and the fourth , though he had all his parts in order , was dumb
0	like most of his contemporaries , malynes identifies widespread usury as a recent innovation in the ancient law merchant ( ) :
0	i really think it ’ s too bad that i should have to live in an age when the minds of nice , sensible girls are contaminated by such idiocies
0	as long as her old ladyship is alive you ’ ll be all right , but once she ’ s gone , you ’ ll be at everyone ’ s mercy
0	by six bay bridge the flowers smell sweet
0	xi-feng promised to do as she had said , and on the second day of the next month she went over to the ning-guo man¬sion as soon as she had finished her breakfast
0	he imagined his relationship to deity in quantitative terms , so that one step higher / would set me highest ( : – ) , and this led him to imagine gratitude as compound interest , a never-ending , always increasing burden exacted on a regular temporal basis
0	bao-qin said nothing , but smiled and nodded , and at once went off into a corner to think
0	how can a girl be given in marriage while her elder brother is in jail ?
0	fame , a dream that soon would pass :
0	i have endeavoured to compose a lament in four stanzas , to express these feelings of mine
0	the lamp needs trimming , and it ’ s awfully dark and spooky inside
0	we shall have to wait and see
0	now they ’ ll be laughing at us
0	the pawnbroker picked it up , took a look inside , and noticed a number of paper figures and four unusually potent cakes of incense
0	she deferred to aunt xing and aunt wang ; but grandmother jia was insistent :
0	no doubt our time too is coming , slowly but surely
0	hadn ’ t i warned these good-for-naught masters time after time -and they always said i was agin them !
0	what ’ s the point of my being here if no one listens to my opinion ?
0	all of you must drink !
0	i don ’ t feel up to it
0	if you don ’ t understand what i ’ ve just said , then not only have feelings towards you been all along mistaken , but all that yon have ever felt for me has been wasted , too
0	she was only joking , of course , but i could see that she was thinking about bao-yu still and half inviting me to make a suggestion
0	the board of rites memorialized back as follows :
0	when she told me about it , there was obviously nothing i could say
0	( – ) faust hopes that his magic spells will prove not to be empty signs , but that they will contain what marlowe ’ s faustus called virtue
0	do you want to lose that whole corner ?
0	they think they can get away with anything - except when i ’ m around
0	i only wonder if what i was saying wasn ’ t beyond you
0	but consider : if it were all a mere fabrication , it might have fooled one or two , but it could hardly have fooled the multitudes of intelligent men and women who have put their faith in him over the ages
0	the women said they didn ’ t know
0	we might get kidnapped or something
0	it ’ s for paper , writing-brushes and refreshments
0	you say what you like to us
0	i must say , you are looking extremely well
0	thereafter , as each of them in turn completed the couplet started by the previous person and then added the first line of another couplet , she continued to write down the lines at their dictation :
0	i saw xiu-yan ’ s maid signet handing it , very furtively , to oriole and oriole slip it between the pages of a book
0	as one pamphlet pointed out : [ t ] he mighty sommes imployed by the waye of usurye [
0	there ’ s lady xing ’ s niece and this cousin of miss bao ’ s and mrs zhu ’ s two cousins : it ’ s not often you get a chance to see four such beautiful bul¬rushes together !
0	aunt xue ’ s initial reaction was one of pleasure , but this quickly gave way to misgivings
0	attribution of subjective agency to objective matter , but analogy implies a difference as well as a similarity
0	you-shi took two doses of the medicine the doctor prescribed , but showed no sign of improvement
0	just as she had finished , bao-qin began hurriedly writing hers
0	it was too late :
0	or are they there in spirit ?
0	next on the programme was a wife eats husks ’ , from the story of the lute ’ , followed by bodhidharma and his disciple crossing the river ’ , from the pilgrim ’ s path ’
0	the term financialization can also refer to developments within the individual subject , as randy martin has observed finance , the management of money ’ s ebbs and flows
0	if they will go getting themselves into trouble , they must face the consequences
0	that ’ s just the way they do behave
0	we experience christ , the son or logos , when we see god in the world , just as satan is what happens when we obscure him behind the our own deified works
0	luther perceived that the pragmatic alliance between the pope and the fuggers , which led to the exploitative marketing of fetishized indulgences , bespoke a shared ideological commitment to idolatry
0	jia lian is to be deprived of his position and rank , but otherwise will be exempted from further punishment and released
0	after a few parting instructions to skybright and musk , he went off to his grandmother ’ s , where he had to listen to more admonitions , then on to lady wang ’ s , and then outside to the study to see his father , jia zheng
0	out of deliberate disregard for appearances she had taken off her hair-ornaments and outer clothes , and from time to
0	in the midst of their chattering and laughter , suddenly startling them into silence , the undulant , lamenting sound of a flute came floating up to them from the cassia-trees below
0	this incident put grandmother jia in a great tizzy
0	in , robert bolton could still casually announce that
0	one solid silver ditto
0	after a few bowls of wine , jia qin suggested a drinking game
0	when have i ever given anything of yours to someone else ?
0	where have you just sprung from ?
0	xi-feng watched lady wang , not daring to accept the tallies without her approval
0	next dai-yu was asked to choose
0	one glance was enough to reduce this old woman ~ tears
0	yes , i suppose the girls who wait on the young mistresses are inclined to be a bit spoiled
0	i suppose they didn ’ t come in here , did they ?
0	her ladyship said just now that the young ladies had all gone to bed , said the woman
0	and though they had aunt zhao ’ s women and all the women from the garden up in front of them for question¬ing , not one of them would admit to knowing anything at all about it , and they were obliged to report back to tan¬-chun that they had failed
0	jiang glanced quickly from left to right , then with a confidential smile whispered :
0	albertus declares that the divinity i serve is that of pythagoras and plato , as well as of jesus ,
0	the servants could obtain no news , and not one of them dared to return empty-handed
0	patience immediately understood what she was getting at and answered in the same vein
0	there ’ ll be trouble if they do
0	my heart is destroyed inside me , but none of you knows or cares
0	how graceful she seemed , as a jade tree leaning in the wind ; how gentle , as a fragrant lotus whose petals are moist with dew !
0	that ’ s not what i meant , replied dai-yu
0	i may be all the time working here outside , but i ’ ve got two girl cousins inside who keep me informed
0	the garden ’ s female population were mostly still in that age of innocence when freedom from inhibition is the fruit of ignorance
0	she came in when we did just now , but went out again almost immediately
0	i think she might even come over herself to thank you for all you ’ ve done
0	they are at present on the stage in the garden getting ready for the performance
0	she ’ s a dreadful person—dreadful !
0	to see her ladyship
0	you ’ re absolutely right , mamma , said xue pan
0	in the author of usurie arraigned and condemned explained that the growing monetarization of society would exacerbate the exploitation of the proletariat :
0	meanwhile the old women and maids busied themselves with sweeping out the pavilion and stacking and washing up the cups and dishes
0	the thirty-fifth had now arrived—an important day in the penitential cycle of seven times seven days preceding the funeral—and the monks in the main hall had reached a particularly dramatic part of their ceremonies
0	under the plantains is where the woodcutter in the old taoist parable hid the deer he had killed ; so the allusion means a deer
0	the swift years like the waters flow …
0	i ’ m going to show you my heart
0	are you really going to ask him in ?
0	i thought you probably wouldn ’ t be able to see him at the time , so i told tealeaf to ask him round this morning
0	before that he ’ d already started playing young male leads
0	now—come along with me and tell her old ladyship all about it ,
0	but you have been ill since then , uncle bao
0	a pair of ivy-coloured embroidered silk trousers were partially visible beneath his gown , thrust into black and white socks trimmed with brocade
0	at midday the tables were set out , and wine and food were served
0	at this bao-yu and dai-yu felt even more uncomfortable
0	at home , as soon as things are patched up in one place they break out in another - even mr zhen can ’ t keep order properly
0	he does not understand that all creation , including himself , is an image expressive of the divine will
0	bao-yu returned to green delights , where aroma was anxiously awaiting him
0	as the extent and intensity of usury have increased , money has learned to reproduce itself with less and less reference to the human labor it originally represents , and in a manner undirected by any human will or intelligence
0	the tree replied : midwinter marks the birth of light
0	but unlike blake and byron , nietzsche did not reserve his ire for the stern god of the old testament
0	it ’ s bad enough that i should make you angry , mamma ; but to have poor little sis , too , worrying her heart out—oh , i really am a louse !
0	her anger transferred itself to the junior maids :
0	it will be just the same as if you were to say it to her ladyship
0	jia zheng thought highly of him , regarding him as the brightest of the various young fellows he had patronized , and fu shi for his part was assiduous in sending message and compliments to the man¬sion in order to keep up the connection
0	besides , aunt xue had come on a social call and it would have been out of place
0	his mouth was open , his eyes were staring , and his head turned from side to side as he looked anxiously about him , for all the world like one of those little clapper drums that children twirl upon a stick
0	bao-yu , when he heard this , wanted to go to the naiad ’ s house at once
0	other of the slave , he represents hostile and alien power as conceived from the slave ’ s perspective
0	how is it , then , that when i do refer to it you get so excited ?
0	let there be no rowdy behaviour now !
0	but now wherever he turned he saw anguish and weeping
0	but before she could do so , dai-yu had picked them up again and dropped them in the flames
0	they can ’ t talk naturally while you are here
0	in a sermon preached in
0	then the young ladies may judge for themselves and correct me if anything i say conflicts with what they already know of her condition ’
0	i expect one of you young ladies had to go out for something in the dark and being still half-asleep , took the bough of a tree moving in the wind for a man , they said
0	she heard night¬ingale calling her :
0	li wan and tan-chun , after an early toilet , had attended her to the gate and seen her off
0	never at the best of times an energetic person , she attended to only the most important matters herself and left most of the routine business to li wan
0	that reminds me , grannie , of something that happened the other night , as i was going to bed
0	i don ’ t know myself what it was i said , but i know i must have talked a lot of silly non¬sense
0	because of the opportunities it offered for taking advantage of inexperience , often to the point of fraud , wholesale dealing in consumer commodities was frequently associated with usury
0	asks faust , to which the devil replies the instant thou thinkest of me ( )
0	i must insist , though , that i am entirely lacking in real learning and am acutely embarrassed to think that this will all too soon become apparent
0	but what about musk and the others , don ’ t they feel hard done by ?
0	at this bao-yu , muttering some incoherent excuse , walked rather sheepishly from the room
0	our young master always likes to have his say about these matters
0	aunt xue gave xue pan a furious dressing-down
0	em butler claims that goethe did not read marlowe ’ s play until , ten years after part one of his own faust was published ( ) , but this does not preclude the influence of the earlier version on him
0	where is master rong , then ?
0	but he was sorely dashed to the ground
0	most of her quilted bedding looked on the thin side too
0	no , don ’ t tell me !
0	this view had been kept alive by antinomian eccentrics like william blake , whose the marriage of heaven and hell rehearses many nietzschean themes , and it had been channeled into the romantic sympathy for satan expressed by byron in manfred and cain
0	they cost a silver tael apiece , said xi-feng , as grannie liu continued to praise the diminutive hen ’ s ’ eggs
0	the house was a tiny three-frame one , two parts latticed , the third part windowless
0	i ’ ll make sure i pick a good un to take them all home , carrying on her ladyship ’ s good work , so to speak
0	in the first place , if this is material that bao-qin gave you , it ’ s going to look rather bad if your skirt ’ s worn out before bao¬chai ’ s has even been worn
0	but that ’ s entirely up to you
0	aroma and bao-yu tried to dissuade them , but li wan and tan-chun were insistent
0	it ’ s so many years since i saw you last , i ’ d forgotten all about you !
0	fortunately it was fairly dark just now when i came back and neither grandmother nor mother noticed anything
0	we find a series of references to a contradiction between the money and the commodities ’ markets , in the repeated allusions to naïve gentlemen gulled by usurers into borrowing capital to set themselves up as merchants
0	xi-feng sent them on ahead to ask lady xing and lady wang for instructions
0	sometimes they push them over when they are walking
0	why , today his devotion was so touching , i felt really sorry for him
0	we shall see if he is still so eager for death tomorrow morning , when he has sobered up a bit
0	and later in the night i had such a fright !
0	in an explicit attack on the claims of natural magic , mephistopheles says that devils have never helped anyone unless they promise to be ours , ( ) and he repeatedly reminds the increasingly wretched magician that thou art mine
0	under these circumstances hostility to usury was not usually directed against a particular social class , but against a certain kind of antisocial and exploitative behavior
0	take the present instance
0	the page did as bidden and feng zi-ying was shortly to be observed walking in through the inner gateway
0	jia yuan-chun is selected for gorious promotion
0	seeing that jia zheng had nothing more to say , li gui and the other servants rose to their feet again and withdrew
0	i don ’ t know about mother and suncloud , said li wan , but what about this young gentleman here ?
0	there ’ s no need to make all this fuss
0	at least they wouldn ’ t do so much damage
0	shall i put your writing things away now ?
0	the first part , about going and having a look ’ , failed to reach the old woman ’ s ears
0	why ever should we go to any such trouble ?
0	carry on , mrs zhou , i must be going
0	in the late sun ’ s more infrequent warmth
0	he sent a servant to inquire , who came back to report that a fight had started between bao er and an adopted son of zhou rui ’ s
0	but now that your ladyship has spoken like this , it puts me in mind of something that ’ s been worrying me which i should like to have asked your ladyship ’ s advice about , only i was afraid you might take it amiss , and then not only should i have spoken to no purpose , but i should leave myself without even a grave to lie in
0	there are multiple ironies here ; don juan is not making a promise to a man but to a statue , and he swears by the name he has earlier disavowed
0	i told patience the other day too
0	i don ’ t mind if you drink a hogshead as long as your grandmother or your mother is there
0	if we hadn ’ t done that , you wouldn ’ t have had the chance to show off your poems i everyone says they were better than all the others
0	and a wise emperor loyally eulogize
0	jia huan had lately been making modest progress in his studies
0	he then said that he wanted one of the yellow things ’ to eat , and tan-chun selected a buddha ’ s hand from the dish and gave it to him
0	patience was amused , but shook her head doubtfully at lady xing ’ s optimism
0	nobleman of the first rank by imperial patent ,
0	fearing that grandmother jia might be fatigued , lady wang proposed that she should stop on the way back and sit down for a while in her apartment
0	nor , despite the claims of the usurers , could it be the use of money , for the use of fungibles could not be sold , being indistinguishable from the things themselves
0	cousin zhen was about to turn and go in again when he discovered old abbot zhang at his elbow , smiling somewhat unnaturally
0	but hyperius does not mean to suggest that satan has access to human souls ; on the contrary , the demons doe not perceive the thoughts of men , but they note the signes onely , and the wordes and speaches and the gestures of the bodies , wherewith the thoughts of the minde are after a sorte set forth : and by these and othere thinges concurring they judge as certainly as they can ( – )
0	it was empty and she threw it down again
0	we must lose no time in thinking of a way to provide them with funds
0	why don ’ t we wait until the first snowfall and have it then ?
0	she blushed fiercely and her heart missed a beat
0	whether it is or whether it isn ’ t , it ’ s of no concern to me
0	in aesthetics , this corruption was first manifested in modernism , and it is enhanced in postmodernism , which proclaims the total collapse of representation into reality
0	the prince was silent , and zhao continued :
0	also , this line has just that touch of charm and prettiness that the subject calls for
0	her entry provoked jia zheng to fresh transports of fury
0	bao-yu realized that he had said the wrong thing , and blushed
0	he also said he wanted the blocks for divine rewards to be cut as quickly as possible and ten thousand copies printed for free distribution
0	why , what will you give me ?
0	there was nothing sir she could do about that , of course , except swear all the -time at mr lian for being incompetent
0	the afternoon slid imperceptibly into a somber evening , blackened by lowering rain clouds and made yet more melancholy for dai-yu by the persistent drip of the rain on her bamboos
0	taking bao-yu by the hand and chatting to xi-feng , she conducted them both into tbe main reception room , where they all sat down and were served tea by qin-shi
0	xi-feng lowered her head for a moment , then replied :
0	bees and butterflies abound ;
0	if we believe him now , how are we going to deal with more serious cases later on ?
0	mephistopheles : the strategems that win all battles !
0	when he looked at the rents from the family estates in the eastern provinces , he could see that in recent years income had shrunk to less than half what it had been in his grandfather ’ s time , while the family ’ s expenses were ten times as great
0	they gave her a meaningful look , and she immediately fell silent
0	it was because i was feeling so desperate that i- ’
0	he reflected on their exceptionally boorish appearance , and the face of qin zhong came suddenly into his mind
0	i never thought faithful had it in her to do this !
0	bao-yu murmured a reply and retired , rather more slowly than was necessary
0	turning to steward lin ’ s wife she con¬tinued : go and tell mrs lian what you have just told us
0	that jade of yours is a very rare object
0	this , in itself , was enough to make everyone laugh
0	i don ’ t know the names of any of these dishes , said gran¬nie lin
0	some aspired as vines ,
0	since he rejects the ethical concept of the satanic , lyotard concludes that its expression in the death of the autonomous subject and the reign of the performative sign are not , finally , tragedies , but liberations from the constraints of logocentrism : the dissipation of subjectivity
0	you go along i ’ said bao-yu with a smile
0	from drunken dreaming one day you ’ ll recover :
0	next morning brought a reminder from the earl of lin¬an
0	though bao-yu promised to obey , she still wanted to have his pages whipped ; but the others all begged for a reprieve :
0	she said , laying a hand on tan-chun ’ s arm and speaking to her in an undertone
0	she rose to her feet as she said this and moved , with her sewing , into the house
0	oh , the usual things
0	it would only be a lot of extra trouble
0	no , i was merely thinking what a beautiful girl she is and how nice it would be if we could have her to live with us here
0	she was unable to do anything about it for the time being , because she was in the middle of serving ying-chun her dinner ; but as soon as ying-chun ’ s meal was over , she hurried off to the kitchen , taking several of the junior maids with her
0	the devil ’ s denial of his own autonomous existence can not be believed
0	on being told that it was , she asked the women to moor the boats there , and having disembarked , ascended from the landing-stage by a flight of cloud-shaped stone steps and proceeded , with the rest of the party , to the gateway of allspice court
0	jia lian seemed about to argue , but xiang-lian frustrated him by rising to his feet
0	i don ’ t know about their other friends , but that mayor jia you mentioned is a regular bounder !
0	these women lose all sense of proportion
0	no wonder she is so keen
0	you would have been at fault , if not for me ;
0	it was huan ’ s turn next
0	that will be splendid , said cousin zhen
0	i know what i ’ m capable of
0	i should like to consult them
0	they took leave of xi-chun then and made their way to ying-chun ’ s
0	when she answered it was in a gabble , to make up for the awkward pause
0	wang shan-bao ’ s wife knew nothing of the romantic history that lay behind this letter ; but she had already had an un¬comfortable feeling that all was not well when she saw the men ’ s socks and shoes ; and now , as she watched xi-feng reading the words on the pink notepaper and laughing at what she read , she became even more apprehensive
0	so there ’ s really no need to pay me back
0	at this she disappeared once more , to reappear , after considerable delay , carrying not only a burner but also a whole portion of incense and a set of garishly printed picture-offerings ’
0	what did happen to the girls in the end , and whether or not they ever reached home , our story does not relate , and it would be idle to speculate
0	he must have put us all to sleep !
0	some good might yet come of it , you never know
0	by this time xi-feng had slipped out on pretext of other business and faithful had gone off to her own room to nurse her anger alone
0	that ’ s no problem , said bao-yu
0	in respectable alchemy , the physical multiplication of metals was directed toward a spiritual end
0	after inspecting the yellow bag , cousin zhen had his lunch ; then , when he had washed his hands and rinsed his mouth out , he changed into formal hat and boots and , ordering jia rong to follow him with the bag , set off for the other mansion to report the arrival of the bounty-money , first to grandmother jia and lady wang and then to jia she and lady xing next door
0	some little time after that was devoted to praising it
0	i ’ m not surprised that father tells me i have a small capacity but a great self-conceit
0	taussig found that the introduction of wage labor into south american peasant cultures produced a demonology that recalls the obsession with the diabolical that attended the same process in early modern europe : the fabled devil contract is an indictment of an economic system which forces men to barter their souls for the destructive power of commodities
0	who put this footstool here ?
0	zhen shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totality unambitious person
0	having just wormed out the information that a motion put forward in the capital for the reinstatement of ex-officials had been approved , he had been dashing about ever since , pulling strings and soliciting help from potential backers , and was engaged in this activity when he unexpectedly ran into yu-cun
0	suddenly , as she hunted in her mind for some possible reason for her exclusion , she remembered the events of the morning and concluded that bao-yu must think she had told on him to his parents and was punishing her for her betrayal
0	he chatted with her for quite a bit longer before finally tearing himself away
0	it seems quite a time since you last came round here
0	but i am sorry the young
0	thank you for reminding me , mother , replied jia zheng rather stiffly
0	apart from pleasing her husband , her principal aim in life was to see how much she could squeeze out of the domestic economy and diver ?
0	he and the girls here have been seeing each other for years - since they were little children
0	he was indebted to the jia family for a number of past kindnesses and was only too pleased to be of service to them in a matter of such trifling importance
0	she smiled at him graciously before turning to her maid :
0	i can match your husbands and wives , he said , taking a purple skullcap from his bunch
0	i didn ’ t expect to see you here
0	and he grabbed at the inkstone intending to send it sailing back
0	if we ’ re going to end up with a bad name anyway , let ’ s at least get what we can out of them while we ’ ve got the chance !
0	patience noticed autumn ’ s disgruntled attitude , but paid no atten¬tion
0	jia zheng opened the envelope and examined its contents :
0	xi-feng accordingly gave orders for a short halt
0	she called out in the direction of the kitchen
0	and is summoned to the palace
0	now that mr bao has passed , he is sure to be found soon !
0	push them too soon and you can ruin them
0	learning that he had now moved to his study outside , she managed to find excuses for passing by that way three or four times in a day , provoking jia lian to a pitch of frantic eagerness only to be compared with that of a starving rat confronted by some food
0	you like to have your little joke , mrs lian
0	dostoevsky conceives of this man-god as the antichrist , and kirillov ’ s self-destruction is carried out in expectation of his advent ; his nihilistic concept of the superman strongly prefigures that of nietzsche
0	it ’ s just that once in a while she gets carried away
0	grandmother jia and lady wang presented themselves at the palace , and entered the imperial concubine ’ s bed-chamber , to find her choked with phlegm , with saliva dribbling from her mouth , no longer capable of speech
0	while , by a fisherman ’ s sad flute entranced ,
0	the thought of her trickery provoked a surge of hatred in his soul ; yet even as he hated her , the vision of her loveliness made him long to clasp her to his breast
0	yet born in time of twilight and decay ,
0	she went up to xi-feng and delivered her message :
0	the boys continued their discussion , and oriole made them some tea
0	they asked her , curious
0	the two tables in the place of honour at the back were occupied by aunt xue and mrs li
0	how can things possibly run smoothly when there ’ s no money ?
0	before i ’ ve been playing half an hour , my money in the chest begins calling to my money on the table to come and join it
0	s mephistopheles ( like the ladder image , it is not in spies ’ s german original ) that the lord cast [ lucifer ] down headlong , and where before he was an angel of light , now dwells he in darkness , not able to come near his first place without god send for him to appear before him as raphael ( )
0	i am your most oble-e-eged and humble servant , ma ’ am i ’
0	but for the rest of the account , please turn to the next chapter
0	now when the twenty-four buddhist and tabist novices first arrived at the temple , they had been put under the surveillance of the older sisters , who gave them their daily lessons and rehearsed them in their liturgies
0	father says as you ’ ve just got home he ’ s sure you must be tired , so don ’ t bother to come round tonight
0	obliged to do so at his uncle ’ s place next day and to make such small-talk as he was capable of , he was appalled , in the course of conversation , to discover just how soon the marriage was to be : it seemed that ying-chun would be going to her husband ’ s house before the end of that year
0	number-drawer chest of drawers
0	where bends the qi said one of them , no doubt hav¬ing in mind the song in the poetry classic which begins with the words
0	they ’ ve all been so cruel to me , and cousin wouldn ’ t see me
0	xi-feng would have liked to ask him for more details , but thought better of it when she saw the look on his face
0	they are prefigured in the antitheatrical discourse of the sixteenth century , which consistently connect the performative with commerce , and especially with sexual objectification
0	outside , on their high staging , with swinging of censers and scattering of little cakes for the hungry ghosts to feed on , zen monks were performing the great water penitential
0	lady jia and the others were also on the brink of tears
0	for at dead of night read on a stone bench , said dai-yu
0	are you now trying to say that it was no more than an accidental colli¬sion ?
0	she and her aspirations could not be contained in this way for ever
0	she said very good !
0	your exposition is certainly very learned , he commented
0	and now , after i ’ ve been to the trouble of getting the stuff and finding this girl to make the offering for me , it ’ s all wasted , because you saw her doing it
0	where courtiers once paid daily calls :
0	now what have you come for ?
0	well , at least they ’ ve stayed in the family
0	if you want to do something , why don ’ t you tell me ?
0	when i asked him how much it had been pawned for , he said he had one for three hundred taels and another for five hundred
0	faithful wanted to turn away , but chess clung to her tearfully and beseechingly
0	wailed jia huan in terror
0	li wan , bao-chai , tan-chun and bao-yu , hearing of this interesting sight , stood on a little hillock some distance away from her and watched with amusement
0	downstairs into the courtyard
0	let ’ s see : how can one answer a question like that ?
0	walking solemnly down the jetty , he sat at the water ’ s edge in the pose of the fisherman sage
0	stay indoors and keep an eye on things while i ’ m away
0	in the cold winter none smells sweet !
0	he summoned him and gave him a thorough dressing-down
0	but uncle dumbo was thoroughly out of temper at having lost the game , and the two cupfuls he drank now in rapid succession served merely to make him tipsily aggressive
0	we had a high old time , i can tell you that
0	thereupon you-shi invited lady wang , lady xing and old mrs you to accompany her to the all-scents garden , while xi-feng and bao-yu accompanied jia rong to qin-shi ’ s room
0	i know pan has often done business with merchants from overseas
0	your cough ’ s only just beginning to get better , and already you want to stop taking your medicine !
0	there was however by now a trace of a smile
0	after that she and skybright themselves settled down for the night , skybright on top of the clothes-warmer and musk outside the curtains which separ¬ated the alcove of the closet-bed from the rest of the room
0	you hear what your cousin says , said lady wang
0	strangers and brothers , and instead treat them as literal and therefore ethnic in purport
0	among the items confiscated earlier , there were promissory notes bearing exorbitant rates of interest - who is responsible for these ?
0	how much did you pay for it ?
0	this had finally found its expression in a violent outburst of grief as she was burying the latest collection of fallen blossoms in her flower-grave
0	this threw you-shi into another panic
0	how can she talk such nonsense ?
0	i lay awake worrying about it till two in the morning , and then i heard shouts coming from the house here
0	that ’ s her real trouble : she won ’ t eat anything
0	she moved on her way - having seen and heard quite as much as she wanted to - returned to her apartment , un¬dressed , and went to bed cousin zhen did not get to bed until after two
0	just then patience arrived back in the garden
0	please , mama , give yourself a moment ’ s respite
0	the news did not reach xi-chun for a few days
0	mamma song took up the boxes and went off to get herself ready
0	he has left his old , childish ways behind him now –haven ’ t you boy ?
0	after speaking a few more words to comfort her , faithful took her leave
0	the protests against this practice that poured from the presses often repeat march ,
0	when she realized that bao-yu must have heard everything that had been said , faithful lay face downwards on the rock and pretended to be asleep
0	look , why don ’ t you give her all of it ?
0	since jia she was away from home , jia zheng was acting head of the family
0	it was the custom for nuns from the various temples which the jia ladies patronized to visit the mansion over the mid¬autumn festival bringing the first-fruits of their offerings
0	if we can remain cool and carry out our investigations in secret , we are much more likely to get at the truth , and even if we don ’ t , no one outside is going to be any the wiser
0	what ’ s in this covered bowl ?
0	so doubly seconded with will and power ,
0	and so she ended up by refusing
0	the upshot was that those of jia she ’ s generation got into carriages and sedans , while cousin zhen and the younger men mounted on horseback
0	if you insist too hard , my master is likely to start getting angry with you , and frankly i wouldn ’ t give much for your chances if he does
0	and fancy saying a thing like that in front of a roomful of servants !
0	father dear and mother mild ,
0	if i hadn ’ t asked you to go and get it , she wouldn ’ t have been waiting , would she ?
0	don ’ t say what you don ’ t mean !
0	bao-yu once chanced to be sitting next to him when his mind was dwelling on this problem , and observing the gloomy and preoccupied expression on his cousin ’ s face , asked him why he should still be worried now that everything had been so excellently taken care of
0	there a channel is led off it which runs into the south-east corner of the garden
0	young and foolish i have heard her called
0	the metal wind-chimes started jangling under the eaves
0	she ’ s been cheat¬ing at cards !
0	after much shouting from moonbeam they tied her up , and left the door open so that the two suspects could be more conveniently watched over
0	i ’ ll see that he apologizes to you tomorrow
0	i expect that ’ s what it was about
0	but for the outcome , you must read the next chapter
0	see what a good girl my feng is to me !
0	i couldn ’ t do it with the same feeling as you
0	number four reddened , hearing from lady wang ’ s own lips the words she once said to bao-yu in private
0	it ’ s this cloak that grandmother gave me this morning
0	if jia lian married er-jie , she would have to live outside , and there would be unlimited opportunities for larks with her whenever jia lian was away
0	no , no , certainly not , said cousin zhen
0	the conceptual parallel arose from the fact that usury turned a naturally barren substance fertile , while sodomy march ,
0	it doesn ’ t really bother me very much
0	wise , quite apart from the fact that you will all laugh at us , how am i going to face mrs lian when i next see her ?
0	it had at first been no more than her embarrassment at being later than ladies xing and wang
0	inevitably , satan regards this image of himself in an
0	you know , it really doesn ’ t suit you to lower your eyes : it ’ s unnatural , ridiculous , and affected
0	if there is , get it all out ; give a length of it to our kins¬woman here ; i should like two lengths myself for a set of bed-hangings ; and any left over can be matched with suitable lining-material and made up into waistcoats for the girls
0	a few days ago , when they were here last , they said that mr fu wouldn ’ t look at any of his sis¬ter ’ s suitors ( and there are plenty of them ) , but had set his heart on her marrying into a family like ours
0	she can scarcely even bring herself to look you straight in the face
0	what is this happy event you speak of ?
0	so his majesty decreed that the offender in this case should be arrested and brought to trial
0	two travellers lost in the tiantai mountains
0	bao-yu repeated what dai-yu had told him
0	unless of course you want people to think the letter had something to do with you
0	there you are—take it or leave it !
0	perfecta drank her tea and went on to visit lady wang , before returning to her convent
0	in politics , the manipulation of images has long obscured discussion of substantive issues
0	well , if immortal , i ’ ll go seek old tao ,
0	under the circumstances it seemed most expedient to have 'brightie lai , servant of the above ' summoned before the court
0	though each carried the largest tea-tray she could find , it took four or five trips to carry them all over
0	anything you ask for will be refused
0	grandmother jia broke into a cold sweat
0	you ’ d best drink your tea and be off !
0	when lan mentioned bao-yu ’ s strange disappearance , zhen bao-yu sighed and offered a few words of consolation
0	she called one of the junior maids to her
0	she slipped a golden bracelet off her wrist and gave it to grannie liu
0	he nodded , but was too lost in thought to reply
0	and report them if they are disobedient
0	when did you ever see bao-yu willingly work at his books ?
0	how dare you touch me ?
0	it provoked varying reactions from the crowd numbering many thousands who lined the road to watch it , all the way from the temple of the iron threshold to the gates of ning-guo house
0	it was easy to see that she was blushing
0	suddenly it occurred to him that he had not seen xi-chun for several days , and he began strolling in the direction of smartweed loggia
0	surely i shan ’ t be made to spend another night in the cold ?
0	how many live here ?
0	what do you want to ask her ?
0	setting the tables down in the centre of the hall , they simultaneously undid the ends of the crimson cords with which the money was fastened and began pulling them out so that the coins tumbled in heaps upon the tables
0	how pretty she looked , in her wedding-gown !
0	this was followed by another low curtsey , which xi-feng , smiling graciously , returned
0	this kind of gauze looks very well on a window when it ’ s new , she said , but after a while it loses its greenness
0	everyone hates the mistress
0	cousin feng is to blame for not giving you one
0	musk handed him a cup of tea to moisten his lips with while he recited
0	you-shi came over well in advance , bringing two of cousin zhen ’ s little concubines , lovey and dove , with her from ning-guo house
0	it ’ s part of the rules of this household , she told tile old woman in conclusion
0	when xue pan had been helped into this , they had him carried into the city , themselves accompanying him on horseback
0	the dowager consort of the late emperor whose illness we referred to in an earlier chapter had now passed away and all noblewomen and wives of officials resident in the capital had to put on the mourning appropriate to their rank and present themselves at the palace
0	-to leave at the earliest opportunity in -order to escape from them
0	we ’ ll tell lady wang about it when she comes back and get her to confirm it
0	who is it by ?
0	that ’ s zhang chang painting his wife ’ s eyebrows
0	surely a few words on the subject are in order ?
0	the notion that a more profound , essential reality underlies superficial , empirical appearances is the most basic belief behind such worldviews , and it is precisely this belief that magic denies
0	why are you so ready to assume that other people are stupid ?
0	when he saw bao-yu he promptly saluted and said :
0	the ladies were delighted :
0	bao-yu withdrew and followed the servant through the back and across the courtyard to the main reception room
0	the irony to which mann points is that schoenbergian dissonance is produced by a rigid adherence to an absolutely rational technique of composition
0	not a partridge , gaily cavorting
0	the devils just took to their heels and vanished
0	what ’ s the point of having poetry meetings ?
0	a few more days and you ’ ll be hitting us , i shouldn ’ t wonder !
0	( ) exchange value is a representation of use value
0	and everything about her so distingue ’ !
0	we do hope you ’ ll come , for mother ’ s sake
0	i came here to return your jade
0	i had a terrible urge to grab hold of everything in sight and kill it
0	shortly after this bao-yu had to take temporary leave of the company to ease his bladder and jiang yu-han followed him outside
0	take someone else ’ s old left-overs ?
0	she looks so sickly !
0	in previous years , though i ’ ve always meant to do something about it , something or other has always cropped up which has pre¬vented me from celebrating it properly
0	on the ning-guo side even the internal running of the household was a problem , since you-shi was for the time being unable to get back at all
0	a few crooked trees bow in shame to the ground
0	now let me see , replied bao-yu , for virtue we have meng guang , the wife who wore a wooden hairpin and cotton skirts ; we have bao xuan ’ s wife , who drew her own water from the well , and tao kan ’ s mother , who cut off her hair to buy wine for her son ’ s guests
0	about noon next day one of the servants at the gate came in to report :
0	pres¬ently patience returned with grannie liu , who had brought a little girl with her and was asking :
0	grandmother jia was most distraught
0	all of us here are only maids ; none of us is supposed to be any higher than the rest , you know
0	what have you come for ?
0	another word from you , said the others , and you ’ ll be made to drink ten cups as a punishment
0	grandmother jia had sent someone round to tell her that she should ask mrs xue to stay with us here , so that we can all be close to one another
0	they were forcing him out and he had no choice but to leave
0	you ’ re sitting in a draught here as well
0	dai-yu was resolved that from this day forward she would deliberately destroy her health
0	he came rushing along in a great rage and made a most terrible scene
0	said grannie liu , and hav¬ing settled herself in her place , picked up her chopsticks
0	but don ’ t go to too much trouble
0	meanwhile dai-yu and xiang-yun agreed that willow floss ’ should be the subject of the poems and decided on the stanza-patterns that they should conform to
0	xiang-yun was so enthusiastic a comforter that dai-yu felt she could not show herself wholly unresponsive
0	xiang-yun put down her teacup in a hurry , before more ground could be lost :
0	what with all the uncertainty about the bond of gold and jade , and now this miss fu - i don ’ t know !
0	he dismissed the runner , and went in again to his private apartment , where he made no mention to his wife of shi-yin ’ s metamorphosis by fire , thinking she would fail to understand and would only be distressed ; instead he simply told her that no trace of the old man had been found , and that he had most probably escaped alive
0	tell mrs er , he said blandly , that mrs lian is here
0	i never heard of such a disgraceful business !
0	as such gentlemen liquified their assets , they became economically hostile to the class they left behind
0	they said he had just that minute left for home
0	next year the flowers will blossom as before ,
0	she began to cry again
0	bao-yu remembered , too late , that the viridian sash had been aroma ’ s and that he ought never to have given it away
0	omitting details of this convalescence , our story passes on to the return of aroma , which occurred shortly after her mother ’ s funeral
0	at first light next morning bao-yu , who in excited anticipa¬tion of the day ahead had barely slept all night , crawled from the covers and lifted up a corner of the bed-curtain to inspect the weather
0	as he thought this , he , too , began to cry
0	besides she is my cousin s wife and there number no need for her to go to such lengths
0	let her kotow to you , she said , laughing
0	one of them went in to report his arrival and deliver the letter to jia zheng
0	they followed his footsteps through the snow and when they saw him coming towards them in the distance hurried forward to meet him , and then all returned to the boat together
0	more recently , geschiere describes the emergence of
0	by the time these colours have been washed and ground and emulsified and graded , you should have enough there to last you a lifetime—messing about and practice-work in¬cluded
0	mr lian says he is extremely grateful
0	while she was in service her movements were restricted and it would be natural for-her to go running around everywhere during her first day or two outside
0	in england ’ s view ( ) gerard malynes demonstrates logically that the increase of value that comes with usury is the product of time rather than of any reproductive power possessed by money
0	not wishing to continue his meal after this , he washed his hands , drank some tea , and spoke a little longer with the old women , who then took their leave and were seen through the garden as far as the bridge by skybright and some of the other maids
0	when she had done so , she inquired what oriole was making and leaned forward to inspect it
0	the maids ran outside to look
0	this really isn ’ t my responsibility
0	unfortunately the others took such a fancy to them that they carried them off as loot and wouldn ’ t give them back to me again
0	however , since becoming lady xing ’ s chief confidante , wang shan¬bao ’ s wife had had little time for kinsfolk or former colleagues , and her treatment of mamma zhang had caused that matron to take umbrage
0	the distinction between essence and appearance is here refracted into an opposition between soul and body
0	furthermore , the fact that usury was primarily an attitude rather than a practice allowed it to extend its reach beyond moneylending , and usury was also identified as the driving force behind the rapid rise of the consumer marketplace
0	at this point in his reflections he became so upset that he began to shed tears , not bothering on this occasion to restrain them , because aroma was not there to disapprove
0	in their substantial form
0	by the time they returned , the maids informed them that the doctor was closeted with grandmother jia , and they all left and went their separate ways
0	in a very short time he was back again with his mother ’ s answer
0	they were also able to engage in the illegal clipping of surplus specie from coins , and to melt coin down into ornamental objects
0	he observed that they were laughing at him :
0	be¬cause this time it ’ s the real thing , and look at you !
0	if you haven ’ t , you ’ d better do so now , while you have the chance
0	tea was served , then doctor wang took up the brush and wrote :
0	he would engage the monkey in daily philosophical discussions and the two of them would practise meditation together
0	any departure from the straight or even causes things to give voice
0	the reading obtained was : white tiger ’ at the eleventh branch xu
0	just because i ’ ve mentioned the possibility , you don ’ t have to go rushing off straight away
0	that ’ s what i said , didn ’ t i ?
0	she hurriedly closed the door of the room and covered her lamp
0	there ’ s not much i can do nowadays except eat—what i can get my teeth into—and sleep
0	i thought something must have been detaining you
0	seeing jia yun , she made her attendants call to him to stop
0	in a way our master bao-¬yu is just like his father , very single-minded , very - how shall i say - dedicated
0	you may live locally , but i can see you ’ re rather out of touch
0	bao-yu blushed and laughed sheepishly
0	she sat at the other side of the table opposite bao-qin
0	the wretched girl spent the whole night in almost continuous weeping
0	said wang shan-bao ’ s wife
0	i ’ m no genius , as you all well know , and i have never been much of a poet
0	with these words faithful rose to leave , bidding the younger maid untie the little parcel , and exhibiting its contents to xi-chun
0	lan and i are sure to pass
0	i can ’ t have you staying away from your husband for my sake !
0	bao-yu stamped his foot and laughed delightedly
0	when i heard that there was someone suing us , i simply lost my head
0	we are most obliged to you
0	because he owed both branches of the family big favours himself , and because he was afraid he ’ d be suspected of covering up for his own friends , he went to the other extreme
0	i work for master bao , said crimson
0	the glory of autumn , being our destination :
0	have another look for it
0	the exception was dai-yu , who , ever since they were little children together , had never once spoken to him about the need to get on in the world ’ or make a name for oneself ’
0	your idleness goes from strength to strength
0	i ’ ve decided to stay up till dawn
0	the serpent is a natural creature , but satan-in-the-serpent is a performative sign
0	what a strange question !
0	the other day i heard something about his being engaged
0	i ’ d better go and check , he said promptly
0	how soon i ’ m stopped !
0	father is a great believer in filial piety ; but he doesn ’ t understand the practicalities
0	she began by giving jia she three thousand taels of silver
0	there , it ’ s all over !
0	it ’ s a good job it was only this you lost , she said
0	she found him with a mirror in his hand , examining the extent of the damage
0	i shall prescribe a medicine to check the yin , and to halt the flow of blood
0	at that very moment the object of their discussion walked in , smiling triumphantly , with a flowering plum-branch in his hand
0	in gumpert ’ s view , helen inspires a chrematistic economy—that is , a system of
0	grannie liu readily agreed
0	i should like a couple of dishes of those pickled vege¬tables that have just come up from the south , to go with it , , xi-feng said
0	if i openly stick up for qin zhong and they go and tell old xue , it ’ ll make things rather awkward between us
0	jia huan looked again
0	glancing up with a smile from his peeling he said ,
0	dunno where he is now , haven ’ t seen him these two or three years
0	zhang hua was induced to do this and the court , after further persuasions from wang xin , did in fact give judgement in his favour
0	dai-yu , they observed , had been too weary to stay up any longer , and had gone home on her own
0	do you still want to take her ?
0	if you have enjoyed it , we could come again tomorrow
0	until the late middle ages , the authoritative church doctrine on this matter was found in the canon episcopi
0	without pausing to reflect , she turned and struck patience twice before kicking open the door and striding into the room
0	impulsively picking up a writing-brush , and with the inspiration lent him by his tipsiness , he added the following lines in the margin :
0	it seemed such a fine thing , and made such fascinating reading
0	bao-chai went up to the lantern and looked at the riddle , which was in the form of a quatrain
0	but cousin lin ’ s and cousin xue ’ s poems are specially good , she said
0	i want to sleep , replied dai-yu
0	with this he burst into tears , and aroma , who thought it was another of his fits , en¬deavoured to comfort him with tender words of affection
0	you ought to encourage the boy , so that next time he tries even harder
0	when her old ladyship saw the flowers , she was so delighted you just can ’ t imagine
0	her languid master droops his raven head
0	he saw her sitting idly on her own by the lamp
0	for heaven ’ s sake don ’ t let aunt wang come over here !
0	it was in vain that my grandfather and my great-uncle served the throne so loyally , winning the family great honour and two hereditary titles
0	even if it means spending every penny we ’ ve got , we ought to be glad to do it
0	the years passed by and each grew up into a good-looking adolescent
0	i never wanted to keep them on in the first placeit was all your idea and xi-feng ’ s
0	where are you from , you great booby ?
0	bao-yu was quite taken in , and said to aroma :
0	just then she heard caltrop laugh and call out in her sleep :
0	but bao-chai was ignorant of ail this ; and fearing that bao-yu might embarrass them all by delivering a big brother ’ s telling-off , she hastened to jia huan ’ s defence
0	that would be the most terrible thing !
0	the master wishes to see bao-yu
0	in the biblical phrase , the soul must not be made merchandise ,
0	jia huan slip¬ped in xi-feng ’ s barbed little message , which made his mother more implacable than ever
0	surely you are not going to sleep again ?
0	the deliberate and systematic attempt to exploit the subjective agency of signs is traditionally known as magic
0	we get this from her all the time
0	jia lian tried to restrain him , saying :
0	grannie liu obediently held out her chopsticks and tried to take hold of one , but the egg eluded her
0	perhaps you had better wait a bit
0	are you quite out of your mind !
0	you shouldn ’ t go , mother
0	there ’ s plenty more , said xi-feng
0	three days she spent in her old apartment in the garden ; after that she had to go and stay with lady xing
0	come over here , granule , and have a look , said patience
0	thank goodness it ’ s not from the mag ( young scholars of that time were wont to use these affectionate abbreviations to refer to those two other venerable texts of scripture , the magna scientia or ( great learning and the medium immutabile or doc¬trine of the mean
0	of course , if you get the stuff through your nannies , there ’ s nothing the buyers can do about it ’
0	i ’ ll serve your ladyship until you leave this world for the next one ; and when that day comes , i shan ’ t go back to my brother and his wife ; i shall either take my own life or i shall cut my hair off arid become a nun
0	but if a man , by drifting and wasting his days , should reach the age of forty or fifty and still be unsuccessful and obscure , then it can fairly ’ be said that his youthful promise was an empty one
0	soon they too came out again , each carrying a wash-basin as before and also a spittoon
0	hegel therefore conceived of alienation in general terms , and failed to pay exclusive attention to the specific form of alienated human activity known to political economy as labor
0	but she did not pursue the subject
0	jia yun found this highly mortifying
0	the two brothers shook hands at home , and jia zheng then rode out ahead to beyond the city walls and there waited to drink the ritual farewell cup of wine
0	as he was dissatisfied with the numberuality of the wine , he ordered a fresh jug to be brought
0	and then , although you may be allowed to see your parents , you will certainly never see dai-yu again
0	they must study diligently and on no account must they be allowed to fritter their time away
0	grandmother jia and the others were dressed in full court rig to receive them
0	unsavoury in th ’ enjoyment of it self
0	jia she and cousin zhen wiped the tears from their eyes , and set off for their different destinations
0	i like the reckless winecups , said xiang-yun
0	you gave me quite a start , coming up suddenly like that !
0	the nun sent for the doctor , and several doctors came and took her pulses
0	are you sure she ’ s not hiding in there ?
0	i ’ d been over to miss xi-chun ’ s to see master bao , said aroma , but i got there a moment too late
0	we might have been burgled last night for all you ’ d have known about it—look at your trousers !
0	it all fell out as providence planned ;
0	it ’ s been worrying me for years
0	don ’ t upset yourself , mother , said jia zheng , with the same forced smile
0	that ’ s why you get them inside the house
0	it was more than she could bear
0	it doesn ’ t matter where from
0	but haven ’ t you heard , ma ’ am ?
0	adamantina is fond of saying that out of all the poems by all the poets of the han , jin , north-and-south , tang and song dynasties , a couple of lines in fan cheng-da ’ s walk in the cemetery are the only decent verses ever written :
0	then falling on one knee , he continued :
0	how old is she ?
0	and see debts everywhere they look
0	there ’ s no need for any of you to talk about suicide
0	there ’ s no occasion for us to get worked up about it
0	a three and six between them lie
0	you and li wan must have a word with her before she leaves , and try to cheer her up
0	bao-yu came forward and kotowed
0	one plaster wang clapped his hands and laughed
0	i made up two using quotations from the four books and the other two each made up one
0	i was on my way to ask cousin lin ’ s advice when i was fortunate enough to bump into you
0	one mustn ’ t underestimate this maid , she thought to her¬self
0	if her ladyship won ’ t , what about you , mrs lian ?
0	he arrived hack at green delights , to be interrogated by aroma :
0	as he came lurching into his courtyard , he saw that some¬one in quest of coolness had taken a bed outside and was lying down on it asleep
0	the cousin ’ s wife stared after them disconsolately :
0	this recalls the view taken by milton ’ s satan of the stairway to heaven , and as in paradise lost this literalist hermeneutic , resulting as it does from the denial of mediation , is both cause and effect of satanic alienation from god
0	here you are : slip your chain on !
0	i don ’ t blame her at all
0	a day or two after their return to green delights , crimson was sitting in her room , still brooding over this handkerchief business , when a voice outside the window inquired whether she was in
0	what have you got ?
0	so the nun was there with her at the very time the burglary took place
0	but then i found that in some old poems even the second , fourth and sixth syllables seemed to have -the wrong tones , and i ’ ve been puzzling about it ever since
0	ah , a living basket !
0	i ’ m very grateful to that stork , said xiang-yun
0	if i decide that i want to do something i do it , no matter what it is
0	i thought you were up to something , she said
0	like the story of don juan , the faust legend became a staple of the european puppet theater during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and the magician and his servant caspar traditionally spent faust ’ s final night arguing over unpaid wages
0	reside within my breast , and each is eager for a separation :
0	a birthday party held for sister allspice necessitates
0	this secretly enraged jin-gui , who could not forbear some jealous mutterings when she was on her own
0	bao-yu meanwhile had begun shambling around , searching for something one moment , fiddling with something else the next
0	the three you ladles , the mattress and the two maids all burst out laughing
0	how can principle hope to compete with de¬sire for the affections of men ?
0	what are you doing here , miss nightingale ?
0	think of all those new members !
0	let ’ s not sit up at the big table
0	the period ’ s drama offers many character sketches of those who origen calls philargyroi
0	and even then i caught my head on one of the wooden pegs on the way up
0	what was that a day or two ago about a mongol prince wanting to buy himself a concubine ?
0	oh , she wouldn ’ t want to do them , said aroma
0	i don ’ t mind being made a fool of ; ’ he said , but i think it was going a bit far to bring my father into it
0	there ’ s no point in keeping it until it gets mildewed
0	he claimed the ability to produce a homonculus from the pure form of sperm , without any need for the material , female body
0	which many londoners call vsurie ,
0	the officials at the prefecture , when notice that he was to be cashiered arrived from the ministry , rejoiced to a man
0	rub your eyes and have another look
0	at this a chorus of wailing filled the room
0	the others realized that this was a joke at xi-chun ’ s expense
0	and who knows what has become of our country estates in the eastern provinces
0	lady wang , glancing quickly round her , noticed silver standing near at hand and ordered her to carry a bowl of it to bao-yu together with the other things that xi-feng had just put out for him ; but xi-feng objected that there was too much for one person to carry
0	i know it ’ s only because you hate giving things away
0	as one of the official court purveyors they received money from the privy purse with which to make purchases for the imperial household
0	there ’ s nowhere for you to sit
0	did he have anything to say ?
0	what does father want me for ?
0	it is unlawful , because the means it employs for acquiring knowledge have not in themselves the power to cause science , consisting as they do in gazing on certain shapes , and muttering certain strange words , and so forth
0	silver , startled , though herself unhurt , gave a nervous laugh
0	be as quick as you can , mother , won ’ t you ?
0	i ’ m just an old crock !
0	when she saw her brother and his wife , there were more tears , but she could not bring herself to say what was on her mind
0	lady wang herself could no longer contain her tears
0	that was rather impressive
0	a tear-stained nenuphar crouched on the ground , holding the chafing-dish with which the recent blaze had been kindled , and gazing with a sorrowful expression at the charred , still smouldering remains of a pile of gold paper spirit money ’
0	well , whatever it is , every so often it takes on human shape and goes wandering abroad troubling people
0	he was still deliberating , when one of the gate-attendants came in with an official despatch summoning him to a conference with the viceroy , and he had to set out at once for the viceroy ’ s seat
0	cried bao-yu with glee before she could finish
0	he ’ s young , she said
0	how could a grown man like bao-yu be lost ?
0	now warm clothes to the frontier are dispatched—
0	this horse is in reality the devil
0	they both laughed , and jia rong disappeared for a while and presently came back leading a youth who , though some¬what thinner than bao-yu , was mote than his equal in freshness and liveliness of feature , in delicacy of complexion , hand¬someness of figure , and grace of deportment , but whose painful bashfulness created a somewhat girlish impression
0	don ’ t talk such rubbish
0	bao-yu , watching from where he sat , thought how much better it looked for bao-chai ’ s attention , and wished that he had not told dai-yu earlier to tidy the hair above her brows , for then bao-chai could have done that for her too
0	since you have been there and all is in order , i shall not go myself but leave it all to you
0	grandmother jia and the rest went round as soon as they had finished their breakfast
0	and mists about its mountain forests cling
0	grand¬mother jia was obviously much shaken by what she heard , but brightened up somewhat when you-shi and tan-chun arrived
0	first i must inspect the rest of the house
0	i ’ m a nihilist , but i love beauty
0	where is the money for this coming from ?
0	beat him to death
0	within a month or two he was a familiar and accepted member of the rong household
0	the question now is , what is she going to do this painting on ?
0	but i think we should all take time to think it over properly
0	well , obviously we couldn ’ t come inside here and search as we would have done if this had been anyone else ’ s house , so we had to go back and report the matter to his highness ; and his highness says that though he could view the loss of a hundred ordinary actors with equanimity , this bijou is so skilled in anticipating his wishes and so essential to his peace of mind that it would be utterly im¬possible for him to dispense with his services
0	aunt xue told them the whole story
0	where ’ ve they all got to now ?
0	i can give you proof
0	they said it was for me personally ; but i ’ m not to go over and kotow for it
0	the house of green delight
0	master bao has been asking if you could go over there to do some knotting for him , she told oriole , you might as well go with her and do it -now
0	as a matter of fact only yesterday mrs lin got told off by her old ladyship for calling him master bao
0	if a man stakes all on his attack ,
0	you mustn ’ t think you are being dutiful in tracking me down like this
0	yu-cun accepted the suggestion with eager deference
0	but the servants always referred to it simply as the jobs room ’
0	not all of du fu ’ s poems have the complexity of autumn thoughts
0	aunt xue came running out in answer to caltrop 's anguished cries and shouted to him to stop
0	a title like that is the most glorious thing there is - and your sir she could never hope to get it back , not after what he ’ s done
0	speaking to her in an urgent whisper , she nevertheless con¬trived to smile at her reassuringly :
0	she opened the casket , took out the key and opened the chest with it
0	i wouldn ’ t be a bit surprised if that doesn ’ t account for her old lady¬ship ’ s trouble as well
0	when all was ready , grandmother noticed that in addition to her own dishes there were two large food-boxes containing dishes from
0	when we asked them about you they said , there were two people talking outside on the covered verandah a while ago , then a third one came along and we heard them saying they were going to the hermitage
0	he sometimes comes round here and hangs about in the porter ’ s lodge
0	so they really aren ’ t up to commercial standards
0	an advance party , consisting of li gui and one other senior boy , went on horseback to make preliminary arrangements at the outer gate of the palace
0	she asked snowgoose where she was , and snowgoose replied :
0	approaches the old girl then , she ’ ll give him anything he asks for , no matter what it is
0	she wanted to tell lady wang and get her to have xiang-lian arrested , but was dissuaded from doing so by bao-chai
0	we ’ ve had nothing stolen
0	this is what leads him to conceive the absurd notion of challenging the force that brought him into existence
0	she ’ s certainly not short of money , said patience
0	the parallel between them is quite precise : both are human significances that are grafted onto the objective world , and both have the capacity to influence and determine that world , insofar as they are allowed to do so by human beings
0	at this point the doctor was announced and bao-yu barely had time to conceal himself behind a bookcase as he entered the outer doorway , conducted by two or three old women from the gate
0	wait till you meet her , and you ’ ll see what i mean
0	no apparition , no sound ; only the voice of one of the priests , ordering the deacons to bring on the jars ’
0	xiang-yun sat with the others at her own table for a while , but as soon as she had finished her first crab , got up to look after her guests
0	as she was speaking , jia lan came in
0	the dates make it impossible that he is the same person as the magician , but the two were closely associated in the popular mind , and are identified in print as early as
0	he ’ d put it together so badly , he said , that all the gunpowder had trickled away before they ’ d had a chance to let it off
0	a pair on the left then , three and three , said faithful
0	earlier that morning , after jia lian ’ s departure , the maids and serving-women had all gone back to sleep , and as none of them had expected him back so early the household was still in a state of complete disorder
0	did she mention me at all ?
0	she took over the winder from nightingale and let it run free , so that the kite could pull itself away in the wind
0	what are you doing here ?
0	in the opening scene , we
0	think for a moment : of all the maids , including all of lady jia ’ s and even your own patience , which would you say showed thieving tenden¬cies , or had a malicious disposition ?
0	in charles gibbon glossed deuteronomy as meaning that usury
0	jia zheng fondled his beard meditatively , then turned to bao-yu and asked him for his suggestion
0	to zhen and san-jie !
0	don ’ t always make excuses
0	i ’ ve got a good new drinking-game for you
0	when i ’ ve explained to everyone exactly what happened , jokey jin will be expelled
0	i ’ ve just been given the bird !
0	and it isn ’ t only picture that i don ’ t want to see any more , she told you-shi
0	confined for a month to her room by doctor ’ s orders and with two or three physicians in daily attendance on her , she was unable to keep up her usual management of the household ’ s affairs ; yet so confident was she of her powers of recovery that she continued , in spite of remonstrances , to plan things from her sick-room , despatching patience with messages to lady wang whenever she thought of something that needed doing
0	' i am not saying this to you because i have had too much to drink , but when she sees that you are both prettier and more popular than she is , she 's not going to let matters rest they call jealous people vinegar bottles , do not they ?
0	as soon as she had gone , tan-chun burst out angrily to the others
0	if you have any news , bring it as quickly as you can
0	but the main opponent of the arians , athanasius , established the fundamental role of the logos within christianity , explicitly identifying the concept with the historical person of jesus of nazareth , and arguing that it was the only means of overcoming the alienation caused by sin
0	in victoria silver ’ s reading of this episode , satan is excluded from heaven because he does not understand that the staircase is not an object but a meaning :
0	there was certainly plenty of chicken-meat on the table
0	he thought to himself
0	bao-chai was delighted to hear him saying this
0	but in my judgment , / since the gain has been so glorious , / not so dear has been the purchase
0	as karl marx put it in on the jewish question : human alienation was accomplished through turning everything into alienable , saleable objects in thrall to egoistic need and huckstering
0	the girl feels blest :
0	truly her lot was an unhappy one -mote unhappy even than dai-yu ’ s !
0	this return to religion entails the acknowledgment that theology never disappeared , but rather went underground , so that originally theological concepts continued to influence the ostensibly secular discourse of the early modern world
0	well , all poetry is only a lot of nonsense !
0	the novice presently arrived with ada¬mantina ’ s things , xi-chun made the tea , and the two of them were soon carried away in a spirited conversation that lasted until eight o ’ clock in the evening , when landscape laid out the go-board , and they settled down to play
0	how did it go ?
0	by this time bao-yu ’ s hundred days of convalescence had ended and he was allowed to go out
0	you-shi found her propped up on pillows and with the bedclothes pulled up round her , eager for conversation
0	and father has told you how important it is for you to succeed in life !
0	i kept telling him not to come
0	if i were you , mr jia , i ’ d go home now and come again tomorrow
0	he felt no great inclination to inspect any of these buildings closely , but hurried on in quest of faithful
0	now let me ask you something
0	at this rudimentary stage , creditworthiness was evaluated by personal acquaintance , and it was by no means above the usurers of early modern london to employ undercover agents to report on the financial status of their acquaintances , as well as to encourage prodigality and conspicuous consumption
0	caltrop carried the book back with her to allspice court , and sitting down under the lamp , began reading -the poems , oblivious to all around her
0	caltrop ( lily ) had moved out to live with bao-chai , and the only person left within range was moonbeam
0	that puts you in the clear then , said patience , smiling
0	if this were my own home , i should jump into a boat now immediately
0	out of consideration for miss xing , she announced , i shall let you off this once
0	in one sense that assumption was confirmed in the course of my research , but in another sense it was undermined
0	his verses , the only field in which he has acquired any competence , are for the most part turgid juvenilia , at their best romantic trifles devoid of substance
0	while bao-yu was inspecting the book , a servant announced the arrival of shiner , one of the boys who had accompanied jia lian to yangchow
0	cousin zhen thanked him profusely and at once gave orders for the planks to be sawn up and made into a coffin
0	as we shall see , the people of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century england referred to this embodied power
0	the coroner was now called upon to make public the results of his post-mortem
0	if you ask me , said ying-chun , i think that rather than always have the same two people to choose the titles and set the rhymes , it would be better to draw lots
0	in this wrapping here there are two lengths of silk for making up into a new year outfit
0	that ’ s something we can certainly take care of for you
0	hedderwick also argues that the german puppet-play sprang , directly or indirectly , from marlowe ’ s tragedy ( xliii )
0	you look like a party of down-and-outs , said dai-yu
0	i ’ ve written two poems using the rhymes you gave me
0	dai-yu has already returned to the land of illu¬sion and if you really want to find her you must cultivate your mind and strengthen your spiritual nature
0	which bears the fruit of immortality
0	but the kind of shamelessness ’ of which—in her view - golden had just been guilty was the one thing she had always most abhorred
0	she felt deeply for her , and resolved to keep a closer watch on her , for fear she might give in to despair
0	what a lot of things you can do , dai !
0	within the garden the moonlight seemed even brighter , and the trees cast deep pools of shadow
0	i ’ ve just had mrs zhu all over me to make me stay and talk to her
0	that ’ s easy , said the urchin
0	others filled their cups for them in readiness
0	how could i have lost bearings so quickly ?
0	after that grandmother jia invited them all to take lunch with her , with wine to celebrate
0	she ’ s think¬ing of giving you mrs liu ’ s daughter , fivey i think her name is , if you ’ re happy about it
0	i know it ( )
0	jia zheng was of the same opinion
0	aroma was opposed to the plan :
0	i am the only one to suffer , i who after so many years ’ service have no other reward than that of seeing with my own eyes my master ’ s impious behavior punished by the most horrible punishments imaginable
0	like usury itself , the deployment of the parable in support of usury depends upon the occlusion of essence by appearance , as the substance of the sense is obscured by the circumstance of the matter
0	yet , as my brow contracted with new care ,
0	he doesn ’ t seem at all interested in her , and she ’ s a very dependable girl
0	just then some of the women came in bringing a playbill with them
0	inside the gate a raised white marble walk shaded by an avenue of venerable pines and cypresses led up to a terrace on which ancient bronze tripods were ranged
0	breath¬ing a sigh of relief , she stood up at once and went to the doorway of the inner chamber , lifting the door-curtain in expectation
0	why on each flower do angry drops appear ?
0	after dinner , when she had washed her hands and rinsed her mouth , grandmother jia reclined on her couch and chatted idly with her granddaughter-in-law and great-grandson
0	these poems engage in obsessive wordplay around usury as a way of negotiating their intricate debate between hetero- and homosexuality , and the sequence deploys the conceptual relationship between usury and sodomy in order to advance its romantic action
0	just give the cup to me and i shall see to the rest
0	bao er ’ s wife has hanged herself
0	it ties in perfectly
0	at this point they pass also out of our narrative , which turns now to other matters
0	we ’ ll have to put on a show of talking xi-chun out of her decision , and then , when she refuses to listen , we ’ ll have to pass the matter back to the ladies , and meanwhile write a letter to uncle lian , absolving ourselves from any blame
0	let 's go to court together , the two of us , and state our cases ; and after that , let 's come back here and ask for a family council so that we can have it all out into the open , face to face
0	he says we can t keep mid-autumn properly on the fifteenth because we are in mourning still , but there would be no harm in having a little family party tonight
0	faithful continued to hang her head and say nothing
0	mr bao ’ s going mad again !
0	it was a bad day for this family when they got to know him
0	we must see that scholarship is suitably rewarded
0	her ladyship says you ’ re to weigh out the correct amount and take as much as you need
0	you ’ ve got to look after the common people , but you ’ ve got to look after the local mandarins as well
0	that evening , when things had quietened down a bit , he slipped out on his own to the tear corner gate of the garden and begged one of the old women there to take him to skybright ’ s house
0	as in moliere , the analogy between counterfeit currency and false promises is prominent in grabbe , especially in the comic subplot involving juan ’ s servant , here called leporello
0	i see , said grandmother jia , smiling
0	could have done this ?
0	but there is no such substratum ; there is no
0	if mr bao wants to have a look , we ’ ll go in with him
0	i saw him the other day and in the course of conversation he mentioned this new wife of his son ’ s
0	well , looking after madam ’ s room as we do , we hardly ever go out visiting with madam and miss bao-chai , so you wouldn ’ t recognize us
0	and a faithful maid vows faithfulness unto death
0	there ’ s something you probably don ’ t know about him , though
0	such parasitism is a relation of logical dependence ; it does not imply any moral judgment and certainly
0	mann ’ s ingenuous , bourgeois narrator , serenus zeitblom , writes the biography of his friend leverkuhn amid the demonic chaos and destruction of the final days of the third reich , and his constant references to this situation draw the reader ’ s attention to the cataclysmic resurgence of irrationalism which was the dominant feature of twentieth-century history
0	though the outcome may be uncertain ; they have taken a solemn vow ,
0	the sooner she and bao-yu are married the better
0	so saying , she walked into dai-yu ’ s bed-chamber , with tears on her cheeks
0	apart from jia she ’ s servants , who had been taken away , there were more than thirty families on the register , with a total of two hundred and twelve male and female servants
0	then , turning to bao-yu , she asked , in a zany tone of voice :
0	why yes , we are actually , said lady xing
0	bao-yu shot a quick glance in her direction ; but it was too late
0	it was my idea , said li wan hurriedly
0	jia zheng hurried away in great alarm
0	how can you be so sure that it wasn ’ t one of them who dropped this bag ?
0	shall i ask them tomorrow if you can have her for your wife ?
0	the flowers ’ aroma breathes of hotter days
0	it isn ’ t necessary , said you-shi
0	the monk is outside , ranting and raving
0	it was fastened with a pin embellished with a fying phoenixes , from whose beaks pearls were suspended on tiny chains
0	she closed the door behind her as she went , and rich and lively proceeded to bar it on the inside , preparatory to going to bed
0	she knew i ’ d be able to understand !
0	just then a maid came from grandmother jia ’ s apartment to fetch bao-yu and dai-yu to lunch
0	kindly mind your own business , would you ?
0	he ’ s a wicked liar !
0	we leave it to our clients to decide how much they want to give
0	when she heard this lady wang was more distressed than ever :
0	london ’ s goldsmiths were the first to introduce banknotes into the english economy , and this paper currency was in circulation throughout the early modern period
0	i suppose he ’ s so intent on enjoying the film that he has forgotten his former enthusiasm for these more civilized amusements ! —go and see what he ’ s doing , she said to one of the maids , and tell him to come here immediately
0	the others felt like telling him to stop playing the fool
0	now why don ’ t you send someone to nannie right away and ask her what she ’ s done with it ?
0	throughout this period , and even down to the dawn of the novel in john bunyan ’ s mr badman ( ) , allegorical personification is used to study the usurious mind
0	she was upset to think that those horrible boys at the school should be able to twist things round and say such ter¬rible things about him , but she was also angry with him , because she said he must have been getting into bad ways and not giving his mind properly to his studies to have got into trouble of this sort in the first place
0	and qin zhong discovers the pleasures that are to
0	economics that inspired the people of renaissance england ’ s impla-cable hostility toward it
0	grandmother jia nodded and sighed
0	i keep telling him how she is , but he won ’ t believe me
0	but why only stay outside until aunt is better ?
0	i ’ ve already memorized it
0	xi-feng eagerly ordered him in
0	his monyes slaue , till wretched life surcease
0	we ’ ve been wondering when we ’ re going to get them
0	said the literary gentlemen
0	and jia rui conceives an illicit passion
0	this work , ying-chun ’ s little maid lotus arrived with a message from chess
0	what is your wish ?
0	there were a few young pages at the gate of the courtyard who , when they saw lady wang coming , all stood to attention with their hands at their sides
0	that boy of brightie ’ s is only a lad , but already he ’ s drinking too much and gambling and getting up to all sorts of capers
0	but not for long
0	presently one of the zhen servants came to summon zhen bao-yu :
0	i say , he said after a while
0	look at all the trouble you give your¬self on account of these people , and they aren ’ t even your own household : it ’ s lady xing ’ s household that you really belong to
0	it has been a long while since we last met
0	mr rong ’ s first wife , from ning-¬guo house
0	and have a day ’ s rest
0	the mood was captured by stanley fish in a july , interview with the chronicle of higher
0	i know the weather and human life are both unpredic¬table , she said at last , but she ’ s only a child still
0	go wherever you like for your toilet !
0	nothing they did for her seemed to bring relief
0	do tell us one
0	why should they send you about such a great , important matter ?
0	renaissance england had not yet developed the kinds of financial technology with which perkins operated
0	then a murmuring voice began to chant :
0	i am hoping that everyone will now collaborate to make this
0	all those pieces of yours are dead , aren ’ t they ?
0	what have you seen that ’ s so funny ?
0	if girls are to live so austerely , what sort of a stable ought an old woman like me to live in ?
0	xue pan ’ s widowed mother was a younger half-sister of wang zi-teng , at that time commandant of the metropolitan barracks , and younger sister of lady wang , the wife of jia zheng of the rong mansion
0	he showed not the least sign of crying , and the mother decided his mind must have been deranged by the shock of his grief
0	retorted tan-chun with a crushing smile
0	finally , with a muttered entreaty , he re¬leased her :
0	an elegy ’ it would be called
0	used as nature intended , signs designated referents beyond themselves , whether things in the real world or concepts in the mind
0	mann notes the magical heritage of this discipline , noting of his shells and flasks that in the middle ages they had belonged to the standing inventory of the witches kitchen and alchemist ’ s vault ( )
0	the clock on the shelf chimed , and he glanced down at his watch
0	xiang-yun was only too willing to accede to her requests for instruction , and morning , noon and night the two of them were to be found together , always in ani¬mated discussion
0	i believe that , broadly speaking and with numerous caveats , when the people of renaissance england spoke of usury they meant what the postmodern world calls capitalism
0	that was the idea of this waiting three days before she came to him
0	while bao-yu was enjoying himself with bao-chai , a servant announced that miss shi had arrived , and he hurriedly got up to go
0	if the day ever comes when nothing remains of me but floating particles of ash - no , not ash
0	please sir , forgive me for being so blind
0	he insisted that the culprit responsible for calling in hu jun-rong should be discovered , and had him beaten within an inch of his life
0	said tan-chun as she took a seat
0	beautiful little piece of work !
0	let ’ s just say that it wasn ’ t my luck to see you then
0	'tonight is mid autumn night , said shi-yin
0	how do you come to be together now ?
0	the others were busy offering their con¬gratulations and trying to look on the cheerful side :
0	but bao-yu would not be gainsaid , so she gave instructions for a carriage to be made ready for him and a numerous retinue of servants to attend him there
0	where ’ s mr bao gone ?
0	the other day she made a point of asking about him
0	an actor ’ s appearance is different from his essence , and it is impossible to interpret his lines as expressions of his thoughts
0	she is already of age ; she has been constantly ill during the past year ; she gives much more trouble than any of the others ; and she is lazy
0	i don ’ t know what i can do in return
0	now , he said , do you know who i am ?
0	tall tiled pavilions cold and-empty stand—
0	if you ’ ve lost , you have to have a slap
0	one or two good , sharp shocks like this might bring him to his senses
0	while jia lian and lai da continued to haggle over the poor man ’ s fate , the servants standing in the doorway offered him their advice :
0	i ’ m sure you must have more important things to attend to
0	do you imagine that if there were really anything there he would let us look ?
0	aunt xue heard every word and was so furious that she fainted
0	but not for long
0	her mother ’ had already told her of her proposed betrothal to bao-yu , the day she discussed it with lady wang and all but consented
0	the servant set off with all speed for the capital
0	we ’ ve all been up for hours !
0	i ’ m sleepy , said aroma , unwilling to reply , for she had observed that his mad fit was on him again
0	she called to their little slavey to fetch it for him
0	it is true that the buddha ’ s gate is not to be entered lightly ; but it is also written that the buddha ’ s truth is for all sorts and conditions of men
0	those borrowed funds which did not go to service the already existing debt were frequently appropriated by corrupt governments , which had often been directly installed by the creditor nations
0	not a bird ’ s cheep was to be heard
0	on his way in he ran into xi-feng outside the main gate
0	she smiled graciously at crimson
0	jia huan came up with a line by the tang poet wang jian : a cold dew silently soaks the cassia flowers
0	you were four or five months away , at all events
0	take your hands off me !
0	drunken dime at large again –
0	it is to be assumed that a suitable person was then appointed to command operations against the rebels and that the rebel horde melted away at the first appearance of the imperial forces - we are not concerned with that
0	he resolved to have a word with aroma about it when he got back , but when he got back , only musk and ripple were in his room
0	are we to save him , or are we to do nothing and watch him fade away ?
0	some of them waited around so as to be on hand when she had finished resting
0	what i do know is that when sir she was telling mr lian how he had come by the fans at last , mr lian couldn ’ t help remarking that he didn ’ t see anything very competent about ruining a man and stripping him of all he possessed for so trifling a reason
0	but that is not the only purpose of my visit
0	we can have them put together to make one big table , then we can all squeeze up round it and keep each other warm
0	when the players had finished , one of these little girl-pages advanced to the foot of the steps leading up to the hail with a playbill in her hands
0	well , you menfolk go off and make your arrangements
0	you don ’ t want to believe everything those young girls tell you , miss
0	tell me , jia zheng began , what you have been doing recently in the way of work ?
0	but most of their contemporaries thought that such men had missed the point of the witchcraft allegations
0	you ’ ve been drinking again , child , said lady wang
0	your ladyship shouldn ’ t take it so hard
0	it was possible , dorian supposed , that this very corruption of the representational medium was helping to make him more embodied , more at home in the world
0	if you can really arrange this for me , dear boy , i ’ ll buy you a pair of the prettiest little girls who are to be had and make you a present of them !
0	i ’ m just the same as i always was
0	the circumstances under which usury is practiced today could hardly be more different
0	scorn learning , if you must , and reason , the highest faculty mankind possesses ,
0	actually , although you won ’ t know this yet , said dai-yu , that smoke-thread climbs line you admire so much is based on a line written by an earlier poet
0	he cut his face open in two places
0	at once he renewed his entreaties :
0	oh i do hope so !
0	and while she ’ s about it , she might give us a nice bottle of hair-oil each by way of compensation
0	in africa , this fear worsened under neocolonialism , when the rulers of nominally independent nations obviously derived their power from nebulous , impersonal external sources such as the global economy or the imf
0	don ’ t you think grandmother would feel that you were taking non-interference just a little far if she discovered that the girls were going without winter clothes simply for want of a word from you ?
0	the court has given instructions for the family to accompany the coffin en cortege to nanking , and all local mandarins have been instructed to look after them en route
0	from my reading of her pulse , i should expect your mistress to be a very highly strung , sensitive young woman
0	usurie hath vndone mee , and now he hates me to the death
0	she marked the firm , courteous protest , the well-phrased confident plan ,
0	jia huan obliged with a line by another tang poet , song zhi¬-wen :
0	now a great dressing-up began as each lady robed herself in the costume appropriate to her rank
0	it has caused quite a stir and everyone is hurrying over there to have a look
0	unscrupulous minions make use of their master ’ s virtue
0	seeing his nephew enter , he asked him what he had come about
0	now that nightingale ’ s words had recalled her attention to herself , dai-yu became aware that her legs were in fact rather tired
0	something to do with the novices
0	i ’ m not much good at this sort of thing , but i don ’ t mind making a fool of myself
0	- they were interrupted by a giggling young maid - miss yun must have been feeling drunk and gone out for some air
0	of course everything will be done in proper style
0	seeing that eve does not understand that the serpent was activated by an occult power , god curses the serpent
0	and what are you doing , a young master like you , coming to see us servants in our
0	a little maid , nodding sleepily on adamantina ’ s meditation mat , appeared to be the only person still up
0	her soul seemed transported to some distant region
0	smith , for example , is perfectly clear that
0	( – ) comus ’ s depiction of nature as a usurer recalls the seducer in shakespeare ’ s sonnets , who informs the object of his desire that
0	it wouldn ’ t interest me in the least , said aroma haughtily
0	jia she , jia zheng and the rest were taken completely by surprise , quite unable to guess what the meaning of this visitation could be
0	there was the door
0	he could see his mother standing there
0	now that evil should prevail over good , and be the true supreme power , is as unmeet as it is incredible
0	sir , put in zhou rui promptly , i have been in charge of farm rents and income here for years , and on average i should say around four hundred thousand taels ’ worth passes through my hands each year , and i have never had a word of complaint from the master or their ladyships or the young mistresses about anything , let alone such a small matter as this
0	you leave me utterly at a loss to know what i ’ m supposed to have done wrong , so that i ’ m driven half frantic wondering what i ought to do to make up for it
0	what our family has suffered was decreed by fate
0	now at last i ’ m going to pluck -up courage and tell you , and after that i don ’ -t care what becomes of me
0	i think you ought to go
0	a word , old san
0	then he asked me about ying-lian , and i said she was lost while out watching the lanterns
0	she says tell him i ’ m thinking of him
0	say i ’ ve gone to walk in the garden for a bit and shall be back again shortly
0	the others , knowing that when grandmother jia played drinking games it was generally faithful who helped her out , agreed readily to this proposal , whereupon xi-feng went to fetch faithful and drew her into their midst
0	that ’ s rich , said bao-yu , your asking me !
0	first , send young master ke with some money tonight to visit mr pan in prison
0	from the orthodox point of view , the manichean despair at creation leads to the attempt to obscure nature through the imposition of a legalistic and customary second nature , and also to the attempt to manipulate nature through magic
0	she broke off at once , and she and lady wang both called gently to her to wake up
0	its odours sweet a poet ’ s wine enrich ;
0	the old testament regards usury as obviously harmful , and it forbids hebrews from taking usury from other hebrews
0	i told him i ’ d got them to do that fan¬-case for him as a sample
0	come on , come over here and tuck this quilt in for me
0	she is the only one of us who could wear this cape , she said
0	as you live in the house of green delights , why don ’ t we simply call you green boy ?
0	it ’ s silly , really , because if they did but know it , even the maids in a household like ours are better than the wife ’ s daughters in many another household , let alone the daughters of concu¬bines
0	she merely scraped a few drams of broken bits together and sent them to dai-ru with a message that lady wang had instructed her to send this , and it was all they had
0	i think you will have to go along with her
0	nothing very remarkable about that !
0	then after a while nannie li came in and caught sight of them
0	at all levels of abstraction , and in every literary medium , the nature and scope of usury were matters of urgent public debate
0	it ’ s only today , because i over-slept , that i ’ m a bit late
0	in prospect garden a moonlit apparition
0	jia lian and jia rong held their fathers ’ hands and wept at their side
0	she arrived as the kitchen staff were having - their own dinner
0	you can beat away to your heart ’ s content
0	she came , and then , when she heard me talking with fivey , she decided to give us both a fright
0	all usury was a faustian bargain , blasphemously commodifying what could never be owned , let alone sold , by any human being
0	in the morning when mrs bao goes in to see her old ladyship i ’ ll have a word with nightingale
0	it was a natural courtesy to place them at your disposal
0	as i lie awake at night , tossing on my bed , unable to master this grief , my only consolation is the thought of a kindred spirit such as yours
0	we are all of us too bound by our commitments to the living to give in to any extreme display of grief
0	you ’ ll find it is much better for you than sitting cooped up indoors feeling miserable
0	why , i only let him be my foster-dad because his missus asked me to
0	when her coffin has been transported to the south , with any money that ’ s left over we can put up some buildings on the ancestral burial-ground , and buy a few hectares of land to provide for the sacrifices
0	won ’ t you tell one now for our young master ?
0	finally he gave a silly laugh and said :
0	sir she has been asking about you , uncle
0	what great burly fellows there are out there !
0	some were right and some were wrong , but even those whose riddles had been incorrectly answered deemed it prudent to pretend that the answers they had received were the right ones
0	it is also that which raises humanity to a qualitatively higher level of existence than the rest of sublunary creation
0	it isn ’ t money or jewellery i ’ m after , said jia lian
0	with a gentle smile he took her by the hand :
0	and she ’ s not the only one to have had such an experience
0	none , only a complete absence of knowledge , of consciousness , of greed , of envy
0	there are four senior maids on her ladyship ’ s establish¬ment who each get one tael a month , the rest only get a few hundred cash each ; and now that golden ’ s dead , one of the tael-a-month places is vacant
0	she quickly got up and went outside to look
0	any such notes referring to loans made at usurious rates of interest will be confiscated outright according to the relevant statute ; notes negotiated at permissible rates , together with title-deeds of houses and land , will all be returned
0	well , i ’ ve been looking at this list of yours
0	although this quietened things down a bit , there was still an atmosphere of great apprehension throughout both mansions , and more watchmen were taken on , which was an additional expense
0	when did he hear the news ?

0	the latter returned to his apartment and reported to xi-feng
0	this was a signal for the others present , including aunt xue , to rise from their seats as well ; but grandmother jia hurriedly gave orders for li wan and xi-feng to take over
0	what do you want me for ?
0	he had originally been thinking of organizing something for bao-chai ’ s birthday himself , but had said nothing to grandmother jia because of the general confusion of the past few weeks
0	a vain remorse that he and his money must perish together , he applied his energies to the destruction of the truth
0	it is called spring morning in the han palace
0	that ’ s one of your troubles
0	you ’ ve grown very good-looking since i saw you last , said bao-yu with a grin
0	she took her leave and went back to tell bao-chai what had been decided
0	qiao-jie ’ s nurse did some discreet prompting :
0	she saw bao-yu , clothed in little else but a thin , rose-coloured shirt , sprawled out asleep on the bed and bao-chai sitting beside him sewing , with a fly-whisk in readiness at her side
0	don ’ t you worry , she replied
0	as they drew near enough for him to make out their faces , jia lian saw with astonishment that the two leading horsemen were xue pan and liu xiang-lian and urged his horse forwards to meet them
0	first thing every morning you ought to take an ounce of the best quality bird ’ s nest and five drams of sugar-candy and heat them up in a silver skillet until they make a sort of syrup
0	cousin zhen and jia rong dismounted and lifted up their voices in loud walling
0	the three of them went in together , to find dai-yu lying wrapped up in bed
0	wang ren had already offended her with his remarks and she began to sob until she was almost choking with emotion
0	having concluded her little speech , she knelt down on the cushion and kotowed
0	cried all the servants on night-duty
0	who called him up : a worthy servaunte too serve a noble man , full well he rewarded hys maister in the ende ( no page number )

0	and faithful makes four calls on three dominoes in the
0	discussion of the poems continued a little longer , after which they called for another lot of hot crabs and sat down at the large round table to eat them

0	for qualitatively different objects to be exchanged , they must be expressed in terms of a common denominator
0	the fact that renaissance england could envisage usurers simultaneously as threadbare misers and gluttonous hogs indicates that such tropes were not understood as designating empirical characteristics of actual usurers , but rather as figural expressions of various theoretical features of usury : it denigrated march ,

0	you don ’ t seem to realize
0	when they got back he took out the money and ordered the bag to be carried into the hall of the ancestors and burnt there in the great incense-burner in front of the ancestral tablets
0	she walked off in a huff , giving him no opportunity to explain
0	your praise is alas undeserved , he said
0	this is your job !
0	as she was speaking a maid came into the room :
0	xue pan rolled about and bellowed :
0	presently lady wang began to examine the body she was clasping
0	the happy event she is referring to is one that will make all of us happy , i ’ m sure
0	it must be the cold fragrance pill i took this morning
0	a woman of fifty can not expect to bear any more children and bao-yu is now the only son i have
0	i see here that in your original deposition , as recorded at the inquest , you state that xue pan dealt zhang san a fatal blow on the head
0	on the rong-guo side xi-feng was still unable to see people because of her illness , li wan was fully occupied in looking after the young people , and bao-yu was too lacking in savoir-faire to be trusted
0	preoccupied with these reflections , she stood as motionless and unseeing numberas her master had done a few moments before
0	ensuing events will be dealt with in the following chapter
0	although he did not realize it at the time , the girl he purchased had been kidnapped by the man who was selling her
0	shi ding , marquis of zhong-jing , nephew of old lady jia ,
0	it ’ s no good , she said
0	on the contrary , she was an exceptionally lenient mistress
0	well , fancy calling you out for a piddling little thing like that !
0	but what ’ s all this about fol¬low me ’ at the end ?
0	they addressed him by name and asked him to come inside
0	it had occupied that position in ancient times , when the philosophical and ethical questions raised by alienated labor were fundamental to the disciplines of philosophy and ethics
0	he is to return at once to the capital
0	ah now , orchid and cassia are quite different , she began ; but before she could get any further , moonbeam was pointing a finger in her face and crowing over her in malicious triumph :
0	oh , i ’ m so worried about her , my dear !
0	but then he thought to himself :
0	we could find out the truth easily enough
0	she can exercise her discretion over the presents
0	he argued with himself
0	without your help miss qiao-jie would never have lived to see this happy day
0	horses and carriages thronged the main entrance , and in every corner important-looking gentlemen in starched official hats trimmed with sable sat waiting their turn
0	that means that though we now have two mistresses here in the place of one - with all the extra expenses that that entails - we are having to manage on less money a month instead of more
0	she therefore called out again , this time somewhat louder than before :
0	she and her mother ran after bao-yu to try and catch up with him
0	comfort , stepped forward , and tried to mask her own grief and urge moderation
0	you can put your feet down as hard as you like , grannie , she said
0	oh little ancestor , where can you have put it ?
0	the turn came for amber and grandmother jia ’ s other maids to lament and make their offering , and they would have looked for faithful then to join them , but thought she had probably worn herself out with weeping and gone to lie down somewhere , and decided to let her be
0	miss xi-chun ’ s died of fright !
0	i should have thought we had so much in common -but what ’ s the use ?
0	it ’ s no fun for the others if they are left with nothing to do
0	where is the other casket ?
0	she ’ s a holy terror this one
0	hearing that his grandmother and the other ladies were back , bao-yu put on an extra garment and shuffled off , walking-stick in hand , to greet them
0	while she was away , cousin zhen went ahead with arrange¬ments for an intimate family party
0	li wan feared that this scene might provoke bao-yu to one of his fits

0	the seventeenth-century chronicle of zacharias hogel , which is based on the mid-sixteenth century reichmann-wambach chronicle , reports that faust offered to bring back the lost works of terence and plautus for perusal by his faculty colleagues : the theologians and councilmen , however , did not take kindly to the proposal : for they said the devil might interpolate all sorts of offensive things into such newly found comedies
0	plants and trees obey a natural cycle
0	qiao-jie is only just on the mend , said xi-feng , so do you mind not crashing around in here ?
0	the other trunk is
0	by the order of her grace the imperial jia concubine i have come to save you !
0	and tell the kitchen to cook some extra dishes when they are pre¬paring lunch for the servants
0	you are absolutely right of course , said lady xing
0	the events of the last few days had taxed the energies of all the inmates of the ning-guo and rong-guo mansions to the utmost , and by now all of them were feeling both physically and mentally exhausted
0	her old ladyship ’ s maids are very hard to please , replied xi¬-feng
0	she says if it weren ’ t for her old ladyship , she ’ d have ordered her back long ago and made her stay where she belongs
0	as he spoke , nightingale appeared in the doorway
0	uncle dumbo proceeded to tell them how the two boys had forsaken him because he had no money
0	early next morning , a ceremony was performed in the ancestral shrine , in the presence of all the young male members of the family , and afterwards jia zheng received cousin zhen and jia lian in the gallery at the side of the shrine , where he asked them for a report of the household accounts , which cousin zhen supplied , albeit in a highly selective form
0	its marvels are not in one phrase expressed ,
0	the multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet had , without conscious direction , carried him to the naiad ’ s house

0	but the theory ’ s brief ascendancy left a lingering influence on neoclassical economis as a whole , especially on the widely accepted view of markets as self-regulating and infallible , even omniscient
0	i suppose i shall have to drink a forfeit
0	then yesterday she offered me some soup again , and though i didn ’ t think i ’ d ever be able to swallow any of it , i decided i ought to try

0	break all the bushels and snap a~ the steelyards , and they will have no further grounds for dispute
0	by rights , of course , callers and visitors has nothing to do with me
0	they told me i was too hasty and that i ought to tell grandmother and lady wang first
0	miss lin here didn ’ t know , so you can be quite sure the others wouldn ’ t
0	it ’ s because cousin feng hasn ’ t been very well during these last few months , she said
0	she cried , her voice choking with sobs
0	he rose to his feet in a dignified manner , and addressed his own attendants :
0	you lay on a little party here -i ’ ll help you get him drunk - and he ’ s yours !
0	that ’ s precisely what i do believe
0	let ’ s make a clean break from now on , you and i , and perhaps we ’ ll have a bit less of all this bickering and making ourselves ridiculous in front of the others
0	she also gave detailed instructions for the visit
0	and if you ask yourself what other two words be could have used instead of straight and round , you realize that there aren ’ t any
0	in of christian doctrine , augustine argues that images possess no power in themselves , citing paul to show that any power that seems to be exercised through images must in reality be demonic :
0	she laughed and simultaneously wiped the tears away with her knuckles :
0	they continued to inquire after him by messenger , however , throughout the course of the night
0	the others respected her determination and did not press her to abandon it
0	don ’ t let me be taken away !
0	then mrs zhang ( nee wang ) and zhang er , the deceased ’ s mother and uncle , were called to give evidence
0	but then my family fell on hard times , and we have all spent the past few years in greatly reduced circumstances
0	he ’ s such a rolling stone , it may be years before he comes back again
0	having uttered these comforting words , xi-feng re¬turned with jia lian to her own apartment , where she informed him of all that had been decided and told him to give instructions for the cleaning and refurbishing of the courtyard that was to be the couple ’ s new home
0	i ’ m sorry she didn ’ t come
0	you go with mr lai now , qin , ordered jia lian
0	they were made in the imperial palace , all in the latest fashion
0	one character remarks that a book is the product of a pact with the devil that inverts the faustian contract

0	but he would as soon have gone without
0	with the same unchanging
0	i remember quite clearly
0	his health would not allow it
0	it was as though the fire that smouldered in xi-feng had suddenly burst into flame
0	appropriately christianized , such passages provided the theoretical cornerstone of the neoplatonic tradition ’ s depiction of love as a kind of magic : plotinus claims that

0	whenever i had nothing else to do , i used to go inside the nuns ’ courtyard and spend my time with adamantina
0	by then the contractors had fulfilled their contracts and the various buildings in the garden been stocked with appropriate ornaments and antiques ; supplies of livestock—storks , deer , rabbits , chicken , geese , and so forth -had been purchased and distributed to the parts of the garden where they were to be reared ; jia qiang ’ s young ladies had rehearsed and were word-perfect in twenty or thirty operatic pieces ; and the little buddhist and taoist nuns had mastered the essential parts of their respective liturgies
0	how do you want mr bao to treat you ?
0	and when on top of all this jia lian ’ s young sister ying-chun fell ill and needed doctors ’ visits and medicines every day , it was xi-feng who had to puzzle over the diagnostic reports , discuss the patient ’ s symptoms with the learned physicians , and decide on the relative merits of rival prescriptions
0	you stick up for the little hussies !
0	observing the somewhat dazed manner in which bao-yu was conducting himself that evening , aroma urged him to go to bed early , and as soon as she had got him settled , went to bed herself
0	this comical allusion to the god of longevity ’ s enormous cranium set all of them laughing— including , of course , the old lady herself
0	orfie ’ s duties were normally of a rough and menial kind , but on this occasion she was employed by her mistress on a task requiring some finesse
0	you needn ’ t be bothered on my account
0	the little actresses might have remained locked in their grapple with aunt zhao indefinitely , but skybright had already sent swallow to bear word of what was happening to tan-chun , and you-shi , li wan and tan-chun , together with patience and a number of female domestics , now arrived upon the scene and shouted to them peremptorily to release her

0	they seemed to be trying to attract his attention , but at the same time were evidently too afraid to speak out , and could only whisper among them¬selves
0	everyone gearing them was incredulous
0	it gets very cold at this time of night , he said
0	you just allowed your imagination to run away with you and lead you astray
0	mind you , mrs lian , the things people will say !
0	i thought i ’ d better first wait and see what your old ladyship thought before saying anything to the family
0	let ’ s have a call then
0	a faint scent drifted into the room
0	and then there ’ s xi-chun
0	it was their own idea , i do assure you , said the abbot
0	ying-chun was still brooding disconsolately over her nurse ’ s guilt when her mother ’ s arrival was announced
0	to think how that poor girl goes out of her way to be nice to the old woman , yet still she manages to find fault with her !
0	she was crying weakly as she replied
0	she ’ s already been under guard now for two or three days
0	good hospitality therefore consisteth not in gluttonous diuersities , but rather in one kind of meat , in clothing the naked , and in giuing almes vnto the poore
0	i shall tell them about it then
0	this logic is hidden from immediate view in late capitalism , but it was quite visible to observers of early capitalism
0	that 's why the mistress always makes it up with her
0	if you don ’ t believe me , take a look for yourself
0	it ’ s nice that she ’ s got faithful with her to talk to
0	that ’ s not it at all
0	the question was continuing to trouble him when he entered his room
0	i promise never to talk that way again
0	precious jade isn ’ t a quota¬tion
0	how could merchants thrive , if gentlemen were not unthrift ?
0	xue pan tried to cover up his embarrassment by pretending that moonbeam had not handed him the cup properly , while moonbeam for her part said that the master had not taken a proper hold ’
0	wang shan-bao ’ s wife was at once all smiles
0	where do you get green waxen from ?
0	what the eye doesn ’ t see the heart doesn ’ t grieve !
0	suppose you were to meet the master ?
0	you ’ ll get cold , said bao-yu
0	we ’ re not afraid of going anywhere else in the garden , but just here the way is so dark and you never know we ’ ve heard tell that since miss lin died they ’ re always hearing sounds of weeping here
0	and i have to cut down on all my activities nowadays
0	a senior consultant and two orderlies from the college of physicians have been summoned to the palace , which indicates an illness in his majesty ’ s im¬mediate entourage
0	after that the new year ’ s eve wish-penny was distributed to servants and children—gold or silver medallions in little embroidered purses—and the new year ’ s love-feast was laid , tables on the east side of the hall for men and boys , tables on the west side for girls and women
0	he said , such glory can not endure
0	if wu refused to cooperate we were to try accusing him of being the murderer himself and of using an outsider as a scapegoat
0	so some of the time the side gate was closed , some of the time it was open - who could tell what was going on !
0	pamela g schmoll reaches a similar conclusion from her study of the hausa : soul-eating seems to have become a metaphor for the search for money
0	a feeling of pleasant anticipation filled him as he hurried forward with his father
0	though she was paralysed , her mind was still clear , and thinking that she was about to be murdered she steeled herself mentally to her fate and found herself surprisingly free of fear
0	she thought , after so terrible a beating and in spite of all the pain , to be still able to worry about the possibility of someone else ’ s being offended !
0	the menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or outer ’ part of the establishment included xue pan , cousin zhen , jia lian , jia rong and a number of the more closely related members of the jia clan outside the immediate family
0	how could i have intervened ?
0	a sickening embarrassment made her own heart beat faster and she could feel her face burning to the very tips of her ears
0	indeed , he joked and smiled as before , and when the business of handing over was completed , he took his wife and family and the loot he had accumulated during his years of office and having settled them all safely in his native hu-zhou , set off , free as the air , on an extended tour of some of the more celebrated places of scenic interest in our mighty empire
0	you will turn his head
0	if i get better , i shall set up a tablet with your name on it and kotow and burn incense to it every day and pray that you may have a long and happy life
0	you , sir , must have known this only too well , and must also have been aware of my presence in these parts
0	i promise never to say anything like that again
0	man proposes , god disposes
0	it might , however , be more precise to say that this is how faustus , rather than marlowe , sees helen , and that marlowe ’ s intent was to criticize such a platonic approach to erotic issues by connecting it to the demonic magic practiced by his hero
0	who has been talking about us ?
0	presently jia lian arrived with the doctor , announcing that as it was their regular practitioner there was no need for the maids to disappear
0	at discount , to be sure—for gold and silver coin which soon gets to the butcher ’ s , baker ’ s and the dramshop ; half the world seems obsessed with eating well , the other half with showing off new clothes
0	and on dry grasses gemlike crystallize
0	he soon thought of a way
0	all the same , i am a bit worried for you
0	in fact , i think that if anything she is even nicer to me now than she was before
0	an illiterate folk magician , on the other hand , would be easy prey for satan ’ s wiles , and would find themselves compelled to serve him
0	one can see at a glance that it is a poor commercial imitation of palace embroidery
0	don ’ t forget what i said just now though
0	if we don ’ t take this jin fellow down a peg , next time he is going to be quite insufferable
0	but still , it would be most unfortunate if this loathsome creature ’ s accusations ever reached sir zheng ’ s ears
0	when it became clear that her mistress was determined to say nothing and that there was to be no escape for her , chess fell down on her knees and reproached her tearfully
0	in paradise there grows a precious tree
0	has anyone an original idea for a name ?
0	all you have to do is keep an eye on the rest of us , and if you find anyone slacking or playing truant , decide how they ought to be punished
0	nine pairs of belt-buckles
0	the procession , needless to say , was of dazzling magnificence , and troops of mourners took part in it
0	even as she was saying this , casta arrived carrying a large dish of peacock-green glaze shaped like a lotuseaf , in which chrysanthemum-flowers of many different colours were being kept in moisture
0	the sight provoked a fresh outburst of grief from jia lian
0	then , after roughly checking through the numbers in the establishment ’ sheet and questioning lai sheng ’ s wife on a few points , she got into her carriage and drove back home
0	tears started from her eyes
0	it was you two who in the past were always fooling me that poems were the best
0	felicity came in with some tea
0	we see fit to show leniency to jia she , and hereby sentence him to penal service at a military post on the mongolian border , where he shall redeem himself by diligent service
0	patience smiled , but dared not say anything
0	it was also because of you that i wasn ’ t on hand when lady wang gave my little girl that piece of cake
0	and then again , of course , though we may look thriving enough from the out¬side , people don ’ t realize that being a big establishment like ours carries its own difficulties
0	come on , you must hurry back , mother , said jia lian
0	everyone laughed at the idea
0	why rather a pity ?
0	my mistress from the ning-guo is waiting for someone to give an order to
0	the point is that yesterday , be¬cause of something grandma said , i started asking them all their birthdays and ages , and it seems that on this birthday of hers on the twenty-first bao-chai is going to be fifteen
0	what do you want it for , ma ’ am ?
0	it ’ s true that he is a simple-hearted child ; but his cousin lin came here when they were both little and they have grown up together and are closer to each other than any of the other children
0	i do hope these men have not been creating too much havoc
0	she was not far from the naiad ’ s house , when she saw two junior maids stand¬ing at the gate , peeping out nervously
0	you ’ re an intelligent young woman , said bao-chai , having first looked to right and left of her to make sure that no one else was about , i should have thought you ’ d have sense enough to leave her a few moments in peace
0	my kinsman yu-cun has had a comparatively easy time of it
0	a great girl like her - you ’ d think she ’ d know better !
0	we ’ re not too badly off on this side
0	from the way cousin zhen spoke , jia zheng gathered that this was not his responsibility and sent someone to summon jia lian
0	liber rituum , book i : in canonicorum classicorumque librorum stu¬dus nomenclationum cessat prohibitio
0	in that case , why didn ’ t you come straight here afterwards ?
0	then they looked at bao-chai ’ s :
0	there is a motto on it which someone gave us once for luck and which we had engraved on it , she admitted
0	of that you shall hear more in the next chapter
0	besides , as brother and sister , they were obliged to maintain a certain distance
0	i was just thinking , said grandmother jia when they had gone , all these people enjoying themselves here tonight :
0	that ’ s exactly what i thought , mamma , said xue pan
0	in baudrillard ’ s work , however , hyper-reality loses some of the ethical stigma that his former situationist colleague guy debord attached to the spectacle

0	as she was speaking , who should come rushing up but musk , in a state of great excitement
0	at all events , said li wan , green boy ’ s is bottom
0	you must sleep like a corpse !
0	i still feel very angry
0	li wan took out one of them and set it down on grandmother jia ’ s table
0	i don ’ t expect bao-yu will want these , she said
0	to stare concentratedly at the go-board , one outstretched hand feeling for the spare pieces in the box while she contemplated her next move
0	really , a person of your age ought to have more sense !
0	you ’ re right , miss bao
0	i have had a lot of experience of these people
0	dai-yu nodded and asked nightingale to settle her down again
0	you ’ d never credit it
0	grannie liu looked at the silks and satins in which patience was dressed , the gold and silver ornaments in her hair , her beauty of feature which in every respect corresponded with what she had been told of wang xi-feng , and taking the maid for the mistress , was on the point of greeting her as gou-er ’ s aunt , when thou rui ’ s wife introduced her as miss patience
0	ever so many there was !
0	i am sure you are right , said dai-yu
0	that is just what we should do
0	dai-yu was there too
0	the old woman needed no second asking
0	an icy draught from a crack in the casement soon sent her shivering back under the covers again
0	tan-chun now invited bao-yu to accompany her to the jobs room ’ and break his fast there with some noodles
0	undoubtedly this poem is the best
0	haven ’ t you heard the saying i come from whence i come ?
0	i never heard of such a thing !
0	the door opened and she walked in , still dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief
0	in the cold wind ’ s more insistent blast
0	when all the arrangements had been completed , they shut up the house and accompanied the hearse outside the city to see the body cremated
0	remember , aroma is the only dependable maid in your apartment
0	lian , you know about such things
0	he began to feel more and more uneasy , and was deep in thought when li ten came in and said :
0	what kind of concentration is this ?
0	before they had reached the water ’ s edge , however , a number of elderly women ap¬proached , each bearing one of those large summer food-boxes of the kind they make in soochow , with tops and bottoms of varicoloured lacquer-work delicately patterned in needle-en¬graving of gold , and panels of gilded bamboo basket-work in their sides
0	from aunt zhao ’ s livid face and bloodshot eyes it was evident to the old nannie that she was in a very nasty temper
0	on which to stand
0	master ’ s orders , said lai da between breaths : will her old ladyship please bring their ladyships to the palace to give thanks to his majesty for the great favour he has shown us !
0	having reached the end of this suite , the singers showed signs of embarking on another one
0	lady xing ’ s brother , xing de-quan , himself a keen gambler , had lately become a frequenter of this establish¬ment ; so , inevitably , had xue pan , who was never so happy as when he was throwing away his money
0	returning south in tears she met calamity
0	his eyes filled with tears
0	but i can ’ t put a thing like this down in writing !
0	i ’ ve got an idea : pull down the red door , and use my belly to block up the doorway
0	now we may reek and raven ; but presently you will see us with the pure spirit of poetry in our breasts and the most delicate , silken phrases on our lips !
0	large bolsters of the same colour and with the same design on them had been placed as arm-rests at right-angles to it ; for extra warmth a black fox-fur had been draped around the top of it , and there was a white fox-fur mg between the bolsters , for sitting on
0	it has been a long while since we last met , said feng
0	for this brief moment to descend ( – )
0	this mr yu-cun is certainly an able enough fellow , and knows how to pull strings
0	that was a judgement , if ever there was one !
0	in that case all girls must be good and all women must be bad , they said
0	there were once four brothers , you-shi began
0	what a great baby !
0	grandmother jia , mrs li , lady xing and lady wang complied
0	the comic subplot dwells on the same issues as the main narrative ; auerhahn torments caspar with tricks involving disappearing money , and the clown readily accedes to the devil ’ s offer to find him a job as night-watchman in exchange for his soul , because he is convinced that
0	jia lian had never been on good terms with his brother-in-law , and , when he heard him blustering on like this , turned a deaf ear
0	what a determined young thing she must have been at heart
0	and the boudoir romances , those dreary stereotypes with their volume after volume all pitched on the same note and their different characters undistinguishable except by name ( all those ideally beautiful young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors ) — even they seem unable to avoid descending sooner or later into indecency
0	jia zheng sent a maid out at once with the following orders for li gui :
0	i was thinking how like skybright you looked - that ’ s the only reason i told you what she said
0	i ’ ll tell you something , mrs lian , said the knowledgeable nannie
0	i haven ’ t seen them
0	it doesn ’ t seem to say very much
0	come over here and i ’ ll explain
0	nightingale arranged dai-yu so that one of her hands was showing through the bed-curtains and resting on the diagnostic arm-rest , and gently slid back her bracelet and sleeve so as not to obstruct the pulse
0	said zhou rui ’ s wife
0	his mother and i shall go over and put the matter personally to mrs xue
0	still smiling , dai-yu allowed herself to be led , and fol¬lowed nightingale towards the naiad ’ s house
0	the fortune-sticks provide a strange omen
0	better go out and stop them
0	that was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery , remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves with their own affairs
0	the news that golden ’ s disgrace had driven her to take her own life had reached bao-yu as he was returning from his interview with jia yu-cun , and he was already in a state of shock when he went in to see his mother , only to be subjected by her to a string of accusations and reproaches , to which he was unable to reply
0	and please , aunt xue , do not be too critical about the arrange¬ments
0	you sit where you are !
0	but the antiessentialist philosophies of the late twentieth century have discredited the intellectual concept of an inherent human essence , while the forces that drive our everyday lives have gone a long way toward extinguishing it empirically , so that many people no longer experience themselves as having a soul at all
0	he got up and left the room , intending to go to xi-chun ’ s place to see how she was getting on with the painting ; but as he came out of the courtyard gate , he saw ba~qin~ little maid periwinkle hurrying across the pathway ahead of him and hurried forward to catch up with her
0	a wiser figure offers a more subtle theory , which explains the faustian delusion of power over the devil : yea , although he is lord , yet he is content to serve her turne , and the witches confesse , they call [ the demons ] forth and send them , and they hire them to hurt [ their enemies ]
0	if only my parents had settled it for us while they were still alive but suppose they had ?
0	that ’ s your nannie quarrelling with aroma , she said
0	her whole world seemed to be collapsing around her
0	as that left no one to get the lunch ready , i put qin xian ’ s wife temporarily in charge , so that the young ladies should get their meal on time
0	first came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners
0	xue pan appeared to be engaged in a species of mental effort so frightful that his eyes seemed about to pop out of his head
0	and she was very beautiful :
0	if only she could shake it off altogether !
0	as the famous magician agrippa put it in occult philosophy :
0	rhyming red ’ by xing xiu-yan
0	faithful was more mystified than ever
0	i feel ashamed that you should have come over just to see me
0	san-jie certainly put her precept into practice
0	if you ’ re not , then what about the rest of us ?
0	farmer sweet-rice may not be much good at writing poetry , said bao-yu , but she is jolly good at reading it
0	but you , sir , you know the wounds i had at my master ’ s side !
0	it only goes to show that there is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look
0	she ’ s admitted taking everything they ’ ve asked her about
0	let ’ s say for the sake of argument that our garden is only twice as big as theirs
0	mr lian had a terrible job even getting to see this man
0	it doesn ’ t leave us much face , does it , if she ’ s dismissed ?
0	i was laughing because you had got the generation wrong
0	nightingale knew what was happening , but judged the time not ripe for her to intervene ; so he continued to stand there like an idiot , until at last dai-yu thought he must have gone back to his own room , and opened the door again
0	suddenly there was a loud clunk !
0	come over and see what she ’ s been doing , the old aunt shouted back at her
0	mother ma was a wise woman
0	you-shi and lou-shi turned towards li wan , laughing :
0	unable in her agitated state to remain indoors , grandmother jia had been waiting outside in the loggia , whither the others -lady xing , lady wang , you-shi , li wan , xi-feng , aunt xue and the girls - had also congregated to await news of jia zheng
0	instead he had his side-hair done up in a number of little plaits which were looped round over his ears and brought together by means of red silk thread into a single large queue at the back
0	re¬entering bao-yu ’ s room , she found him lying back quietly , plunged in thought
0	misfortune pursues the family at every turn !
0	he just spends all his time playing around with a pack of maids
0	she said , i have to leave at half-past two to take up the job , and bao¬-yu won ’ t be home until a quarter to three , so we shall miss seeing each other by only a quarter of an hour
0	bao-yu could see that he had moved her
0	what sort of a life would she lead , asbao-yu ’ s concubine ?
0	tell me who it was
0	crimson believed every word that bao-chai had said , and as soon as the latter was at a distance ,
0	if they want to go , we can send for their parents to come and fetch them and give the money to their parents
0	i don ’ t see how that could be wrong
0	let ’ s be honest : none of us can compare with aroma
0	usurer : an honest fellow , ile warrant him
0	i see no reason to doubt that our crab-apple tree too was reacting to a human situation
0	tell her the needlework ’ s a bit on the rough side , but i ’ m sure she ’ ll understand
0	her cold , unweeping eyes with tears did spot ;
0	after you ’ ve planted them and the flowers have come out , you ’ ll want to stand and look at them ; so the fourth title will be admiring the chrysanthemums
0	how can she stand up to them if you come along and lend your weight to what they are saying ?
0	it was only a little burn , about the size of a finger-print , but clearly visible
0	it ’ s only because pan ’ s away , said bao-chai , that she has to go on suffering like this
0	this was clearly understood by friedrich nietzsche , who attempted to reevaluate the master/slave dialectic by giving ethical primacy to the standpoint of the master
0	she ’ s even less likely to listen to me on my own
0	i should think not , indeed !
0	denied having any puppets , spirits , maumettes , while another admitted keeping four imps called robin , jack , william , and puppet
0	bao-yu gave oriole a smile
0	james notes that the magician effects a contract with the devil , and that the form of appearance assumed by the devil varies according to the class of magician
0	so it pleaseth the holy ghost in scripture somtimes to resemble the workes of light to the workes of darknes : that wee might learne to gather wisedome euen from serpents , and to leaue the poyson behinde
0	observing her confusion and the halting nature of her reply , lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife remembered that silver had lately reported some things missing from lady wang ’ s apartment which none of the other maids would admit to having taken and wondered if fivey might be the thief
0	in chrematistics , however , money becomes an end in itself , depart-ing from its natural telos , so that trade in useful objects becomes the means to the end of accumulating exchange value
0	grandmother jia looked at aunt xue and smiled
0	when yu-cun received the gift of money from zhen shi-yin he had left for the capital on the day after the festival
0	from that time onwards her demeanour towards er-jie was affable in the extreme
0	like piles of dung
0	it ’ s too much pampering that causes this passion for variety : eggs one day , bean-curd the next , fried pickled turnips in gluten batter it ’ s all very well saying you want something different , but i ’ m afraid it won ’ t do
0	lady wang could not believe this , and asked tealeaf , who was still standing on the other side of the window , to verify bao-yu ’ s story
0	entering the door of the apartment , they tiptoed softly into the inner room
0	there were curses for the women on night-duty :
0	would rather have died !
0	for example , as satan contemplates the stairway to heaven in book three of paradise lost , the reader is explicitly informed of the image ’ s symbolic purpose as a material sign of res non apparens : each stair mysteriously was meant , nor stood / there always , but drawn up to heav ’ n sometimes / viewless ( : – )
0	meanwhile the attendants brought with them by the lady visitors were being entertained elsewhere
0	there must be some places left where you haven ’ t looked , lady wang continued , addressing the assem-bled maids
0	they soon arrived at the priory and were met by euergesia , who had brought her two little disciples benevolentia and sapientia to welcome them
0	they were delighted to see him , and immediately asked :
0	when she saw him still standing there , she had not the heart to shut the door on him a second time , and allowed him to follow her back into the room
0	it would be quite out of the question to cut her pay simply because she ’ s working for bao-yu
0	shi-yin went to receive caltrop ’ s soul across the threshold of death and to escort her to the land of illusion , there to be handed over to the fairy disenchantment and to have her name entered on the register
0	she nearly asked him about it , but in the end was too shy
0	she was tall and rather thin with a long oval face , and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress
0	dammit , it ’ s too bad that the two of you should be worried all the time because of me !
0	another consideration which predisposed them to let her stay was the well-known fact— already mentioned by aroma—that the jia household did not ill-treat its servants and relied more on kindness than coercion in its dealings with them
0	it specified the number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans , four small sedans , and four carriages , and the number of pounds of silk cord that would be required for that amount of network
0	it was fastened by a golden clasp at the end and by four pearl clips at regular intervals between the clasp and the crown of his head
0	henry smith ’ s the trial of usury ( ) details the various ways in which usurers commodify time :
0	the magpie has forsaken my chamber : it is in vain for the maidens to hang up their needles on seventh night and pray for nimble fingers
0	who are you going to make fun of now ?
0	i am only a servant , she said in the end , and it is very kind of you to think to speak to me like this , ma ’ am
0	and for another thing , we senior maids are constantly having -to take messages to her old ladyship and her lady-ship about him , and when we do , we always say bao-yu , never master bao
0	we can see here how calvin ’ s doctrine of total depravity informs his view of usury
0	they are in the main reception room
0	anyway , i told mamma song that she was under no cir¬cumstances to let bao-yu know about this
0	fruition of earthly fame , which he confuses with spiritual salvation in his hope to be eternized for some wondrous cure ( )
0	they lay a long time together when it was over , exchanging oaths and promises , unable to break apart
0	praise his holy name !
0	her jealous fury when she was informed that er-jie ’ s illness was due to her influence and when she was urged by xi-feng to move elsewhere for a few days in er-jie ’ s interest can be imagined
0	well , it ’ s the same name , said zi-xing
0	a day or two later , he began to feel a slight improve¬ment in himself , though his mental equilibrium was still easily disturbed by the least thought of dai-yu
0	yes , certainly , said bao-chai , turning back to reply
0	lady wang smiled back at her
0	they say that where mercy is possible , mercy should be shown
0	even when relations call , i said , i can see to them myself
0	but what am i to do with aroma ?
0	or is it merely to make me angry that you say them ?
0	thoughts , nietzsche claims , are not controlled by the will ; they come when they wish , as if from a power outside our minds
0	the jealousy and resentment that lady xing felt as a conse¬quence of this had recently been exacerbated by an imagined slight : the passing over of ying-chun when the dowager princess of nan-an asked to see the jia girls and tan-chun was the only one of the three to be called
0	why don ’ t you squat down to take off your underthings ?
0	this new wife of mr pan ’ s is a total eclipse if ever there was one !
0	tan-chun walked over and , peeping through the window , saw ying-chun half-reclining on the day-bed reading a book , oblivious to the noisy argu¬ment that was going on only a few feet away from her
0	as for liu xiang-lian , the human repinings felt by that somewhat cold young man when he realized the value of what he had lost were brought to an abrupt end ( as we have shown ) by the even colder words of the taoist , which , by breaking through the barrier of confusion and opening his eyes to the vanity of human affections , caused him to renounce the world by symbolically severing his hair and following the mad holy man in his wanderings
0	lady wang still had not the slightest idea what she was talking about
0	just let him come , then !
0	he drank half the contents of the cup while parfumee held it to his lips , then turned his head back again to address aroma
0	and it isn ’ t as if it was my own sewing i ’ ve asked you about : it ’ s only ever been his things that i ’ ve asked you to help me with
0	what ’ s this about wanting money ?
0	it all went in the raid last year , said qiao-jie
0	i don ’ t see why you should need to come bothering me about it ,
0	heaven knows how they would grieve for me if i were actually to die !
0	but it was still no good :
0	the hall of exalted felicity
0	meanwhile , back at the party , cousin zhen and the others , suddenly noticing that the two of them were missing , sought them for a while without success
0	the two young women then went their separate ways
0	it transpired that the tin kau players in the next room were in process of settling up after finishing the game and were in fact beginning to think about their dinner , but that the group at the big table playing driving the sheep had not yet reached a suitable point at which to break off
0	the present holder of the title , shui rong , was a youth still in his teens -a young man of great personal beauty and a modest and unaffected disposition
0	your use of puer betrays an inadequate comprehension of the theme
0	you ought to send him away
0	faithful , laughing , quickly filled a winecup and held it to xi-feng lips
0	during this muttered exchange the girl had begun spinning
0	said bao-yu , pushing him
0	he noticed that jia qin was among them
0	tracts such as the anonymous the ruinate fall of the pope usurie , derived from the pope idolatrie ( ) , argue that fetishistic economics and idolatrous religion are mutually determining
0	for in one moment they were consumed and spent by him that borowed them , and in place of them an idoll is conceaved , which idoll doth remain constantly , not any where in nature and truth , but in name and imagination
0	—and then proceed in like manner , by gradual degrees , to paint it
0	they can take their contracts with them , and that will be the end of that
0	grandmother jia then ordered lady wang to be seated
0	tan-chun gave a humourless laugh
0	but it ’ s like riding a tiger : i daren ’ t relax my grip for a single moment for fear of being eaten
0	or , if a newly-
0	he was back in his room like a flash , and communicated the substance of his interview to bao-chai , who seemed rather pleased to hear it
0	i ’ d rather we went short ourselves than risk her making another lot of trouble
0	west of imperial walls the garden lies ;
0	when he was satis¬fied that all this work was well in hand , he hurried into the inner apartments to meet his grandmother and two young aunts
0	ethical evaluation of them
0	don ’ t go yet , sir , said one of the old women when he had finished writing it
0	jia lian kotowed to receive his presents
0	you can only think what can be expressed in words
0	not of myself ; —by some great maker then , in goodness and in power pre-eminent :
0	that ’ s most unfair , said tealeaf in a deeply aggrieved tone of voice
0	with such good arguments in his favour , he ’ d be a fool not to sue ! well now , i ask you !
0	i will do what your ladyship has asked me to the utmost of my ability ’
0	cousin zhen , after reflecting on it , seemed well disposed
0	and so you should !
0	i ’ m going for the vase , said skybright
0	the two young women wept a while in silence
0	like the wardrobe master and the clerk of the ink-horn in a royal procession !
0	it was a little later that we heard this terrific hullabaloo coming from her apartment
0	i came across precious jade only the other day in a poem by cen shen , said caltrop :
0	it ’ s as i feared , father
0	ladies a chance of seeing the plays , and particularly for grandmother jia ’ s benefit ( as she was more enthusiastic about the whole venture than anyone else )
0	there ’ s no need to overdo it
0	ask your aunt , replied grandmother jia
0	i advise you to take things more gently
0	i know what i ’ m doing
0	what have you got to he discontented or displeased about ?
0	if anyone asks about me , you can tell them that i ’ m one of your pages , like tealeaf
0	the news had meanwhile reached xi-feng on her sick¬bed
0	xi-feng was not well enough to go over daily , but on days when there were sutra-readings and the callers were numerous , she would drag herself over and lend you-shi a hand in entertaining the wives
0	look at me , have i ever tried to profit from you ?
0	the centre part is detachable
0	look at this little creature , now !
0	you see at the end of the letter , uncle bao , grandfather urges us to get down to some serious work
0	now , just because i ’ ve lost a few taels , i ’ m not good enough for you
0	which mrs zhu is that ?
0	come on , hand it over !
0	someone not used to taking punishment , he concluded
0	ask your mistress to see to it , said cousin zhen
0	a meanes to purchase wealth , / though my state waste , and towring honours fall ( )
0	bao-yu followed her in alarm
0	it ’ s the sign of a real talent , they said , to be able to see a deeper , allegorical meaning in a frivolous subject—though the social satire is a trifle on the harsh side !
0	when all this was over , jia lian returned once more to the matrimonial couch
0	he was divesting himself of the rain-clothes while he asked these questions
0	better take these off , he said ( he was crying himself as he spoke )
0	hardly a fit place for the likes of master bao , i ’ m thinking
0	do not weep for me !
0	faithful might cry out and others get to know about it as well , which would be even more frightful : and as faithful had always been kind to her in the past , she resolved to throw herself on her mercy
0	the moon must be up by now , said grandmother jia
0	last night i promised i would go
0	i don ’ t know where you get this we from
0	tell her that i absolutely refuse to take responsibility for any change in the rules
0	after chatting with her for a few minutes about nothing in particular , she left on the pretext of visiting lady wang
0	later , when the time came for the wake proper , and over a hundred family and servants were gathered together for the ritual , faithful was nowhere to be seen , and in the general flurry of activity no one bothered to check where she was
0	he must have repeated those same two words in the same tone of passionate entreaty upwards of twenty times
0	it might be the son you want , though of course we can not know that until it comes
0	it ’ s so touching , she said , turning to jia zheng , the way her grace remembers bao-yu !
0	let ’ s take our outer clothes off
0	outside , meanwhile , periwinkle , caltrop , parfumee , etamine , nenuphar and cardamome , having been all over the garden collecting flowers , sat down , with their laps full of them , in a little semicircle of lawn enclosed by high banks of flowering shrubbery and began playing match-my-flower ’
0	sounds the midnight hour ,
0	the colour flew into dai-yu ’ s face and at first she was quite speechless with embarrassment
0	he opened it at the first page , and found himself looking at a picture , but one that was so blurred he could hardly tell what it represented
0	we ’ ve often drunk wine together in the past
0	my dazzling spells into the spungy air , of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion
0	he then went to call on you-shi , whom he found ill in bed , struck down by a sudden attack of some gastric trouble from which she had occasionally suffered in the past
0	and pick some reliable boys to go on this gate and the two posterns to pass word through to those outside if those inside need anything do you understand ?
0	i ’ ve found your handkerchief !
0	the two senior brothers saw them out as far as the main gate , and then went in to re¬port to grandmother jia
0	otherwise , by the time the mourning period is over , i shall have forgotten everything
0	i suppose you think we shall come and plead for you to be let off
0	whatever ’ s on your mind , just go ahead and say it
0	i should like to see them
0	suddenly she remembered dai-yu
0	because exchange value does not resemble allegorical representation ; exchange value is a form of allegorical representation
0	say it ’ s nothing very serious , and with aroma away we shall be even more short-handed if she goes back home to get better , so ¬we ’ d like to get a doctor in quietly through the back gate to have a look at her and not tell her ladyship about it
0	i prophesy for this child that when she ’ s a big girl and the others are all going off to get married , she may for a time find that things are not going her way ; but thanks to this name , all her misfortunes will turn into blessings , and what at first looked like bad luck will turn out to be good luck in the end
0	oh , is it by any chance the thing lady xing was talking about ?
0	grandmother jia stood firmly by her word
0	my rather knows nothing about it
0	the sacrament , in other words , was a performative sign
0	there ’ s something else i want to discuss with you , said bao-yu
0	now this wife of duo ’ s had a physical peculiarity which was that as soon as the man ’ s body came into contact with her own she felt a delicious melting sensation invading her limbs , rendering her body soft and yielding to that of her partner , so that he had the impression of lying on a heap of down ; and in addition to this natural endowment she knew more tricks of posture and more ways of exciting a man with murmured lewdnesses and amorous cries than a professional prostitute
0	bao-yu cleared his throat
0	holds the rank of a sub-perfect by purchase
0	once , the sound died away and she thought she could hear someone calling in the distance
0	oh , you mean them , said yu-cun
0	author , copyist and reader were alike in the dark !
0	i just hope that from now on he will learn to be more adult , and give up his old antics
0	but to watch the pike-drill he was fain of fair maids in a row
0	but of this no more
0	derrida ’ s critique of austin follows the same logic as his deconstruction of saussure , in which the signified is relegated to the status of a mere function of the free play of signifiers
0	when he first emerges out of the allegorical figure of avarice , the usurer already has a preordained appearance and personality
0	you are altogether too careless !
0	he doesn ’ t usually eat much anyway , commented the old lady
0	the puppets represent the artificial agency that he has spent his life creating
0	condemned because it comes from the mouth of the serpent
0	now it was all books and studying
0	go ahead : we ’ ll keep talking , don ’ t worry !
0	just as he reached the foot of her bed , he heard her cough a couple of times and spit out a mouthful of something
0	even i , who live in a century of enlightenment and cooly judge the errors of the past , even i , ten times a day , feel the temptation to believe in these absurdities
0	there were however many other ways of conceiving the usurer than as a miser
0	her skin was burning to the touch
0	amber was standing l fl front of the screen-wall waiting for him
0	she asked cousin zhen
0	or sip wine by your delicate display ?
0	send word to the inner apartments first , and give the ladies time to withdraw
0	from now on we are nothing to each other , you and i - nothing
0	bao-yu jumped to his feet and hurried out in alarm
0	if we accepted this form of the question , in its meaning and its syntax ( what is ?
0	in spite of their num¬bers , few of the rong-guo domestics concerned themselves much with jia lian ’ s activities , and even the few who had the time and curiosity to nose out what he had been up to were more anxious to win favours by playing up to him than to gamble on the uncertain advantages of giving away his secret
0	what is more , as austin proceeds to consider the various ways in which performative statements can be infelicitous , the opposition between performative and constative begins to break down
0	she sailed off cup in hand then to her brother ’ s , leaving fivey alone in the kitchen
0	as victor turner explains :
0	she stretched out an arm and slowly arranged it for him on the pillow
0	with reference to the first charge brought against jia zhen , that he forcefully took to his bed the betrothed of an innocent citizen and drove her to her death when she would not gratify his desires : upon consulting the original records at the censorate , we find that the lady in question , a certain miss you er-jie , was betrothed to a certain zhang hua when both were still in their mothers ’ wombs
0	jia zheng threw himself forward on his face
0	but i am afraid a precise diagnosis lies beyond the lim¬itations of even a more elaborate milfoil reading of the changes
0	the three of them now kotowed to grandmother jia , to lady xing and to lady wang ; then the old nannies , bidden once mote to escort them , stepped forward with cries of obedience and conducted them back to their room
0	will he really be all right ?
0	ever since the day they first met , bao-chai had felt sorry for xiu-yan
0	that is the sum of my knowledge concerning bao-yu and , as you put it , his present whereabouts
0	bao-yu himself was wearing a dark-red cotton tunic tied at the waist with a sash , and trousers in a black-and-green-patterned lined silk gauze , unconfined at the ankles
0	it is typical of her to be so thoughtful
0	the pity of it is , though , that the girls in that family are all exceptionally good
0	trust you to drag the buddha into it !
0	how cold it is !
0	clear as daylight , sir
0	why can ’ t they send him some proper food for a change ?
0	apart from all the money you ’ ve spent , you ’ ve never stopped asking for help and thinking of ways to get him out
0	and conclude the day ’ s work by reciting quietly to your¬self a few model compositions
0	presents itself as a merger of business and life cycles , as a means for the acquisition of self
0	the young banner-bearing deacons took up their positions in the hall , one group at each of the five cardinal points , north , east , south , west and centre , and awaited their orders
0	as you can see , it is extremely light and transparent
0	your dutifully and affected son ,
0	she handed her the sheet of paper containing bao-yu ’ s gatha and the clinging vine ’ poem
0	aroma went out a few minutes ago , said skybright
0	the problem with usury was that it enforced this decision in legal , objective form , reversing the natural master/servant dialectic , and making man into the slave of money
0	well , that was one piece of luck ; but that ’ s nothing to what fol¬lowed , because her old ladyship had overheard this and asked her who this grannie liu was , and when mrs lian told her , she said , oh , i ’ ve been just longing for someone with a bit of age and experience to talk to !
0	tan-chun ’ s proposal was followed by general discussion
0	one must look on the bright side , she said to thou rui ’ s wife
0	with these words patience took her leave
0	as she did so , she sighed and a flush began to spread across her face
0	news was suddenly brought that qin-shi ’ s little maid gem , on hearing that her mistress was dead , had taken her own life by dashing her head against a pillar
0	the days are so long now , and there ’ s nothing to do at home except go to sleep
0	on top of his disgrace in the qiao-jie affair , there was now the added humiliation of having to watch both his brother and nephew pass their examinations
0	she bent over him to examine it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger
0	why be like this ?
0	soon the maids had him lying down between covers
0	one day , after drinking rather more than was good for him , xue pan went to see jin-gui about something he wanted them both to do
0	lady wang made a reference to the supposed resemblance between their two sons , the two jades ’ , and expressed a desire to see zhen ba~yu for hersel£ he was sent for at once , but the answer returned that he was conversing with sir zheng in the outer study , and that they seemed to have struck up an immediate rapport
0	they had chair-backs and seat-covers of squirrel , and large copper foot-warmers in place of footstools
0	the minute qiao-jie entered the room the two palace ladies began subjecting her to a penetrating scrutiny , ogling her entire person , top to toe
0	she also gave him a few coppers to buy fireworks with
0	he bowed to her and entered
0	in a little while the paper-covered shutters were removed and he was able to see clearly through the silken gauze of the casement into the courtyard outside
0	she darted after swallow again , her hand upraised to strike her
0	jia yun and steward lin went out to execute these instructions
0	i learnt it specially for the occasion
0	she seized xi-feng by the hand and earnestly entreated-her to think of some lie which would obviate this necessity
0	but after watching her very carefully , i came to the conclusion that , although better qualified than the others in so many particulars , she is not really a very dependable person
0	written on it in large characters
0	after lunch the two of them went to see grandmother jia
0	not caring to call for anyone , however , he managed for himself as hest he could and spent the night there alone
0	usurer : what a world ’ s this ?
0	who was it cooked the soup that mrs pan drank before she died ?
0	said the young man who had asked the question
0	after coughing through most of the day , she had recently dozed off into a fitful sleep , and it was not until bao-yu had called her name for the second time that she opened her eyes
0	until we find it , bao¬yu ’ s life hangs in the balance !
0	it ’ s mean , tight-fisted people like you interfering that stop her being generous
0	faithful went over to aroma ’ s place hours ago !
0	you ’ re a good sort , sunset , i always knew you were , said bao-yu admiringly , but there ’ s really no need for you to tell her
0	he said , smiling strangely
0	she also sent someone into the garden to collect aroma ’ s bedding and toilet things
0	why , so it might , said the others
0	xi-feng turned and looked bard at patience
0	xiang-lian now rose to go and succeeded in slipping out of the main gate unobserved
0	the family was immensely wealthy
0	and by the time you ’ ve been living together for a year or two , you ought to be able to ride the storm out even if your secret is blown
0	xi-feng promised to attend to the matter and hurried back to her own apartment to do so
0	men all know that salvation should be won ,
0	when he reached the passage where jia zheng described his encounter with bao-yu , they all wept bitterly , lady wang , bao-chai and aroma most bitterly of all
0	i shall never forgive myself
0	i believe your old ladyship has heard this story before , said the blind woman , smiling
0	a former head of the family had placed himself under the patronage of the ning and rong brothers , so their claim to a special relationship with the jia family was a strong one
0	i calculated that you would be needing some by now , said xi-feng with a smile
0	usury affects the psyche , and it also influences the material operations of people ’ s daily lives , although it has an uncannily similar impact in each of these areas
0	now it was feng zi-ying ’ s turn :
0	tut , for one ’ s own kin !
0	she started screaming for help
0	a little later he went in , with the intention of talking this new proposal over with lady wang and asking her to sound out lady xing about the zhang family
0	she went in , and saw xi-feng lying on her couch with eyes closed , her face ashen-pale ; patience stood by her side , quietly weeping
0	jia lian , to tell the truth , had never taken much , notice of it while it hung round bao-yu ’ s neck
0	- oh , i must tell you , she said ’ changing the subject , i had rather a funny dream last night
0	crimson noticed xi-feng standing half-way up the rockery above the little grotto , beckoning
0	the phrase a man is his soul simultaneously unifies and distinguishes between subject and object : hence job can declare that my soul is weary of my life ( : ) and jonah can recall how my soul fainted within me ’ ( : )
0	let ’ s play pass the goblet , on the word moon , proposed jia qiang
0	bao-yu was delighted with the suggestion , and shouted several times for aroma to fetch the gold thread
0	what do you want this little claw for ?
0	the colour rose in aunt xue ’ s cheeks when she realized how much the maid must have overheard
0	dream and tearfully announce to them either that dai-yu had already gone or that people had come to take her away
0	brightie ’ s wife poured out a cup of tea for her to rinse her mouth with , and when she had sufficiently recovered herself she rose to her feet once more took leave of various members of the clan who were present , and went off to her office in the penthouse
0	he does not object to wage labor in secular life , nor does he object to the financial compensation of ministers
0	light ’ s harbingers begin with the dark to struggle ,
0	i had been thinking to write and send you my felicitations , when i received your letter
0	he found her , however , to his great relief sobbing but alive and well
0	one expects an actress to be a vampire , but one had hoped , after you turned down the opportunity to go free and insisted on staying here , that you would make some effort to behave
0	come on , what are you still kneeling down there for , you useless creature !
0	this is the only way we shall ever find it
0	for a young boy of his years to produce such a poem is proof of a highly cultured upbringing , they said
0	lady wang turned to the three foster-mothers :
0	he had done well in the triennial examination , passing out as a palace graduate , and had been selected for external service
0	why put the blame on nobodies like us ?
0	they were so funny , i had to stand and watch them
0	it can be bought , and sold , and bartered away
0	shall on these gifts shower down their salty rain
0	i ’ ll manage things so you don ’ t have to be personally involved
0	founded and constructed by
0	gentle reader , have patience !
0	unfortunately jia yun , having had his previous overtures rebuffed by xi-feng , had been too cowed to visit her again , and since that day had hardly set foot inside rong-guo house
0	after a few moments ’ thought :
0	it ’ s something i should very much like to do for you
0	from then on he took to calling her colonel winsome or the winsome colonel
0	one just goes wherever the inspiration takes one
0	we should tell her what is happening
0	no , no , it isn ’ t vulgar , said one of the literary gentlemen
0	bao-yu refused to believe her until she made sunshine look up the entry in his book and show it to him
0	if you ’ re afraid of the trouble , you ’ d better go back to grandmother and tell her to give the job to somebody else
0	ask one of the older men in the firm to find out what we owe and what we are owed , and see exactly how much we have left
0	observing what heavy weather bao-yu was making of his revision and foreseeing that if he wore himself out by staying up all night he would be in no condition for facing his ordeal in the morning , she had been casting about desperately for some means of rescuing him from it altogether
0	he read the report through to the end :
0	he had on a narrow-sleeved , full-skirted robe of white material and a silver belt inlaid with pearls
0	i couldn ’ t place her as any of the girls in our household , so in the course of conversation i asked aunt xue who she was
0	would you like the water now , miss ?
0	everyone agreed to his rules
0	bao-yu began gloomily walking off in the opposite direction
0	the old women pulled down the carriage blind and ordered the pages to take up the shafts , the pages drew the carriage into an open space and harnessed mules to it , and dai-yu and her aunt were driven out of the west gate , east¬wards past the main gate of the rong mansion , in again through a big blackacquered gate , and up to an inner gate , where they were set down again
0	catch me eating here with those clowns !
0	will you look after it for me , please ?
0	why isn ’ t he back yet ?
0	even in the case of a real daughter , not just a foster-daughter , once she ’ s left home and gone into service it ’ s for her master or mistress to punish her or the senior maids
0	nominal value still seems less substantial , less real than the content
0	there is a girl in bao-yu ’ s room called skybright , she said
0	the other answers : as an arrow
0	i shall never be able to manage with these
0	human invention increasingly makes natural resources obsolete
0	in the record of rites it says
0	you ’ re an educated young fellow : haven ’ t you heard the saying
0	it seems , then , from these two places , that usury is in itself unlawful
0	he sat down with the prince of bei-jing , and told zhao to take jia she with him and return to his yamen
0	talking of those slippers reminds me , said bao-yu
0	if you ’ re sensible , young man , you ’ ll be glad to hear me say this ; otherwise , though you may be too polite to say so , i expect you ’ ll think i ’ m an interfering old woman
0	i want you to tell me honestly , cousin , said bao-yu
0	jokey jin , now thoroughly cock-a-hoop , wagged his head and tutted in a most provoking manner and addressed wound¬ing remarks to no one in particular , which greatly upset darling and precious for whose ears they were intended
0	she turned to the servants :
0	con¬cerned at her critical condition , her attendant eunuchs reported again to his majesty , requesting that the neces¬sary precautions be taken
0	well , said mother ma , i don ’ t want to seem a trouble-maker , but if you don ’ t mind my saying so , you do all seem to have acted a hit helpless about her—not that i ’ m blaming you , mind
0	she had barely finished saying this when an old woman came rushing up to them in a state of great agitation
0	from every point of view - the special relationship between their two houses , the sun family ’ s wealth , and the personality of the young man himself - jia she regarded this as being the almost perfect match and informed grandmother jia of his choice
0	yes , i think i ’ ve still got some , said bao-yu
0	she stopped short , thinking it inadvisable to be so rude , and changing her tone somewhat , said :
0	once more he clung to her and wept
0	the doctor arrived presently , and the ladies withdrew
0	he ’ s in a good mood , she said to bao-yu
0	xue pan considered zhang ’ s behaviour insolent and raised his cup to throw the wine in his face
0	we all make mistakes sometimes
0	i am but a dull and foolish creature , a mere lump of senseless stone !
0	they ’ re trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet
0	bao-yu smiled at the idea , but seemed rather doubtful
0	witgood : else , my uncle ’ s house !
0	i thought lian was competent to handle these things !
0	if faithful were to leave me now , who would you get for me to put in her place ?
0	and the money they spent on you , i said ’ nursing you through all the fevers and calamities of youth ( for you were a sickly , ailing child ) : it would have been enough to have made you anew out of silver then , when you were twenty , the master , out of the kindness of his heart , undertook to buy you a place in the service , so that your future would be assured
0	theirs were not the only secret discussions on this sub¬ject
0	in the meantime she installed herself by the coffin and , comporting herself in the manner prescribed for an unmarried daughter , wept and wailed until she had almost lost her voice
0	bijou smiled and accepted it ceremoniously :
0	she posted moonbeam outside to keep watch for xue ke , and went in once more to her dressing-table
0	the next two are even harder , said nuageuse
0	if you ’ d sing me a nice new song - one of your specials , i ’ d drink a whole jarful for you
0	dai-yu had confidently expected that this night would give her an opportunity of deploying her talents to the full and amazing everyone with her genius
0	but what ’ s the point ?
0	beyond the flickering brilliance of many lights and the glint and sheen of drapes and hangings bao-qin could make out some of the spirit tablets of the ancestors , but not very clearly
0	do you not find her an admirable person ?
0	as long as you don ’ t drink too much , twill do you good
0	these are dresses given to her old ladyship by various people over the years as birthday or festival presents , but as she refuses to wear any clothes made by outsiders , they ’ ve none of them ever been worn
0	us ’ d by the tempter : on that prospect strange their earnest eyes they fix ’ d , imagining
0	it ’ s a bit morbid , though
0	she handed her a cup of tea , but xi-feng dashed it to the floor
0	jia lan and jia jun belonged to the rong-guo half of the clan and were in the same generation as the other jia lan , the little son of li wan and nephew of bao-yu
0	did not ye fa-shan compel li yong ’ s sleeping spirit to compose an epitaph ?
0	but what are the charges ?
0	and next to them i have missed my beloved amaryllis eyot
0	lady wang laughed at them both
0	this seemed plausible to the great lord , and he instructed his door-gods to call in builders and put up a wall
0	no comfort ’ brings to my afflicted mind
0	to the realm of primordial truth
0	i found the two of them together apolo¬gizing to each other
0	you ’ ll be able to get up to all sorts of mischief now , she said
0	now is the woodman ’ s axe no longer heard—
0	she told a maid to light some incense , and meditated for a while
0	let musk sleep beside the closet-bed
0	the only reason i haven ’ t mentioned it before is because i was afraid your ladyship might be angry with me
0	then two or three women bearing large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which she sat and stood there waiting to be called
0	aroma had been present when bao-yu received tan-chun ’ s letter and had seen him rush off excitedly with ebony as soon as he had finished reading it , but without having any idea what the cause of his excitement might be
0	he had been thinking to himself
0	hire of itself is neither a thing unlawful , nor a word of evil note , signifying no more than a due recompense or reward ; as when our saviour saith , the laborer is worthy of his hire
0	bao-chai blushed fiercely and said to ripple with a scornful pfui ’ :
0	we can ’ t possibly accept them
0	come back as soon as possible and let us know how things stand
0	if we shut the gate now , we shall be simply inviting suspicion
0	raising the cotton door-curtain he looked into the room
0	fearing that their presence might add to lady xing ’ s embarrassment , aunt xue , lady wang and the rest also , one after another , withdrew
0	he ’ d be thirteen or fourteen now—a very handsome lad , with skin as white as snow , and that sharp and clever you ’ d hardly credit it
0	do you think i ’ m mad enough to go rushin ’ off in pursuit of hideous hardships when i could be sittin ’ comfortably at home eatin ’ good food and drinkin ’ good wine and listenin ’ to the odd song or two ?
0	her awning ’ s relucent splendour outshines antares and his starry band ,
0	this was greeted with derision :
0	inner palace , northern capital division
0	even the minister of milton ’ s childhood parish church , richard stock , regularly preached and published against usury , calling it the cursed trade and declaring that an usurer is a reproach amongst men
0	i shall be round first thing tomorrow to report for duty , and the first thing i shall do will he to pay down fifty taels to be spent as and when you wish on the club ’ s entertain¬ment
0	after a little while the music stopped and aunt xue sugges¬ted that as everyone appeared to have had about as much to drink as was good for them , perhaps it would be a good idea to break up and walk around for a bit
0	this used at one time to be the case with me , and i suspect is now the case with your son
0	ying-chun said nothing and made no attempt to prevent her
0	this page intentionally left blank
0	next they heard shouting coming from the men on night-duty in the outer apartments
0	certainly , said dai-yu
0	embracing hills and streams , with skill they wrought :
0	i ’ m sure no one here would dream of making you feel uncomfortable
0	well , what are you waiting for ?
0	i ’ ve already made a collection for tonight and given the money to mrs liu : ten pennyweights of silver each from skybright , musk , ripple and me - that ’ s two taels - and six each from parfumee , emerald , swallow and number four ( i didn ’ t collect anything from the ones who are taking the evening off ) making three taels four pennyweights altogether
0	when the time comes for the tax-grain to be collected , the yamen staff will repeat your instructions , they ’ ll swear that they ’ re not allowed to take a penny ; and it will only mean a lot of unnecessary trouble and delay for the country people , who ’ d much rather have things the old way - pay up a bit and get the whole thing over and done with as quickly as possible
0	couldn ’ t you give it to the old woman ?
0	just be your own natural self
0	we all know that mrs zhao isn ’ t the most sensible of mortals
0	but i do assure you , sir , seeing that the time was running out and knowing how anxious you ’ d be , we made as much speed as we could
0	each lady is to be per-mitted a single maidservant in attendance
0	it ’ s a bad business
0	if clever tongues are all you want , i can do as much piddle for you as you like
0	it ’ ll make your hand shake
0	by resurrecting the popular , superstitious legend of faust , and by raising it to the level of high art , goethe seeks to reintegrate the critique of magic into intellectual culture
0	he gave orders for them to be removed and himself headed back to the main apart¬ment
0	if you don ’ t believe me , take a look : isn ’ t that master huan and young master lan on their way back now ?
0	that ’ s enough from you !
0	when they told me yesterday that i was being sued , i was panic-stricken
0	bao-yu glanced at the other two cupboards referred to by disenchantment
0	naturally tealeaf stuck up for us when he saw we were being bullied
0	if those are not portents , what are they ?
0	witches generally rode on a broomstick or an unlikely animal ; faust ’ s students ride to strasburg on a holly wand , while the magician himself favors a bear , a chariot pulled by dragons , and his swift horse mephistopheles
0	why , if i tell you , will you give those dresses back again ?
0	xi-feng sat for a long time chatting with her , and once more urged her to take a more optimistic view of her illness
0	s translation of spies ’ s historia
0	dai-yu burst out laughing :
0	and he stretched himself out again
0	if a good girl in this life , i might be reborn as a man , and i can ask you for her then !
0	all he needs to do now is to sit the ex¬aminations with lan , write his papers properly and come home early
0	fifth song : grief amidst gladness
0	shimmering splendour , jia zheng and the others repeated , trying out the words
0	and recently this selfish model of human life has increasingly been exported from its homeland in commodities markets and inflation rates , and offered as a path of insight into human life generally
0	if the entertainment is to be equally enjoyable for everyone , you don ’ t want it to be too much of a burden on you ; but on the other hand you don ’ t want the others to feel that they are being given short commons
0	even then they were able to see at a glance that their pursuers were nothing to be afraid of ; and therefore moved on to the west courtyard to in¬vestigate possibilities for burglary there
0	—all instances of exceptional goodness - were born under the influence of benign forces , and all sought to promote the well-being of the societies in which they lived ; whilst
0	and there we must leave him
0	that seems to me a very good suggestion , said jia zheng
0	he was followed by the smiling figure of the abbot , holding the tray in the same reverential manner as before
0	probably she had heard someone gossiping about her
0	when you see through the spring scene ’ s transient state , a nun ’ s black habit shall replace your own
0	shine first upon the chamber where she lies
0	you ’ re a clever young lady
0	if we all went off to play , said musk , who would look after this room ?
0	that ’ s only thirty mile from where i am , but my word , what a difference !
0	tell him that your father is in a precarious state of health , and that there are no menfolk left at home
0	a pair of threes upon the right , said faithful
0	that is a secret which may not be revealed to mortal ears
0	he tasted it dubiously
0	i ’ m not like you , said ripple loftily
0	they are all asleep
0	you ’ re like the dog that bit lü dong-bin : you don ’ t know a friend when you see one
0	it describes the way in which animate images expand their power beyond the money form , mutating into what debord calls the spectacle
0	tan-chun was in a towering rage
0	what ’ s probably happened is that bao er ’ s wife won ’ t oblige mr zhen as she did mr lian , so now he ’ s taken it out on the husband there were many differing interpretations
0	our farms haven ’ t been able to make up their quotas
0	she went on taking various remedies for seven or eight days with no real improvement ; it was only when she remem¬bered her own cold fragrance pills and took three of these that she began to recover
0	i shall be careful to keep away from you in future , in case your priceless reputation is sullied by my presence
0	he saw grandmother jia and lady wang sitting opposite him , and asked aroma in a whis¬per :
0	i don ’ t know what to make of it
0	see that great mansion in there ?
0	he remarked what perfect poise she had and what a soft and pleasing way of speaking
0	a few streets behind our place , said joker
0	the ones with the writing on
0	both had received favours from her in the past and were only too happy to comply with anything she asked them , and the girls themselves were of course delighted at the prospect of playing in the garden all day and not having to go home for the night
0	jia lian departed at once , and returned a few hours later
0	i suppose it was suicide ?
0	take no notice of them !
0	and my heart weeps and desolation feels
0	second song : hope betrayed
0	this was the heresy of the witches , as well as of the alchemists
0	in ’ s the usurer ’ s plea answered , roger turner pointed to the paradox whereby hee that forbids thee to be an usurer , commands thee to be an usurer in the dispensation of those spiritual gifts which god bestows upon us
0	he ’ s waiting for you in the larger study
0	then , with a cry of poor , worthless boy !
0	what about honey boy ?
0	please come on in
0	the rod crashed into a protruding rock and broke clean in two
0	zhou , qian , bao-yu called out from the saddle to the two in front , let ’ s go out of the side gate , otherwise it will mean going past my father ’ s door and i shall have to get down
0	and even though you are mine , you can do nothing to alter my fate
0	i know she ’ s only trying to stop me from wor¬rying
0	one has only to think how you and father are with lian
0	from then on bao-yu treated aroma with even greater consideration than before , whilst aroma for her part re¬doubled the devotion with which she served him
0	why on earth should he have chosen him today ?
0	your uncle is in retreat today , said lady wang
0	if i ’ m going to disturb anyone , let it be miss lin
0	the concept of lucrum cessans in particular provided the most porous loophole through which intellectual rationalizations of usury emerged
0	this kind of usurer is a money addict
0	you ’ ll have to leave in the end , and if you fall into his clutches then , you ’ ll be in real trouble
0	what about us then ?
0	but tell me about young lan , went on grandmother jia
0	what was it he sent us for ?
0	bells , drums , liturgical instruments and other paraphernalia were arrayed along both sides of the hall , and emblematic banners were hoisted at each of the five cardinal points ( the four corners and the centre )
0	pound , of which he will haue you receiue
0	which happies those that pay the willing loan ; that ’ s for thyself to breed another thee ,
0	bao-yu ’ s mind , by contrast , was still full of vibratos and glissandos , and as he left he said gaily :
0	why not let nenuphar come with us now and wait for her there ?
0	that ’ s quite enough from you !
0	it ’ s been snowing for some time , said one of the old women standing below the kang
0	grandmother jia ordered some of the old nannies present to go after him and see that he was all right
0	he could feel the sweat trickling all over his body and lower down in the bed a little pool of semen that he had just ejaculated
0	amber and sunset followed suit , and two more cupfuls went down in the same way
0	i wish you girls wouldn ’ t use my inkstone as a paper¬weight , he said
0	people all say what a big place jinling is , said bao-yu
0	he sighed several times and looked very despondent
0	all of them were impressed by this second couplet
0	aroma was constantly at his side , with such words of consolation as :
0	when water reaches its zenith and earth its nadir , be prepared for misfortune to strike
0	what about the sire leading his grandson ?
0	now , no gambling and no drinking !
0	never could any other person have stirred him to such depths of atrabilious rage
0	the novel frequently lapses into sixteenth-century dialect , and it veers wildly between naturalism and fantasy
0	why don ’ t you do that again this year ?
0	weidmann took advantage of the license permitted to writers of fiction by saving faust ’ s soul , an innovation he seems to have made independently of ge
0	i ’ m perfectly all right
0	xi-feng and patience quickly buttoned her up again and straightened out her dress , shouting angrily at wang shan¬bao ’ s wife as they did so
0	i am sure the rest of us would like to know too
0	at court levée my smoke is in your sleeve :
0	sooner or later we fully intend to redeem it for her
0	then , as they passed the window of the tea-room frequented by the domestics , she heard the sound of chattering coming from within
0	he feels impair ’ d by this knowledge , representing as he does the idolatrous human tendency to worship the products of our own labor :
0	she said this without turning back her head , and having said it , passed swiftly on her way
0	we ’ ve known each other now since we were little girls
0	dants as holders of commissions under the crown , but merely confirmed what the censor of the day had already decided : that jia rong should be summoned and should be required to answer the indictment
0	they greatly preferred her to their own foster-mothers
0	if you lie down as soon as you ’ ve eaten , you won ’ t digest your food
0	but on looking up she saw that it was bao-yu
0	i would have mentioned it myself , but you have so many burdens already and i didn ’ t want to add to them
0	snow wave is a good , ink-receptive paper for doing calligraphy or impres¬sionist style paintings on , and it will stand up to the wrinkle-and-wipe work in a southern school landscape ; but it is quite unsuitable for a painting like this one involving detailed colouring and layer upon layer of graded washes
0	i want to ask him about this new rule which says that a man may marry when he is in mourning , barely thirty-five days after his uncle 's death
0	you ’ ll need to wrap up well
0	no one will bring it in even if they do find it
0	weidmann ’ s play also reflects the direct influence of milton ; it features a good angel named ithuriel who warns faust against mephisto , just as the eponymous archangel chases satan away from eve in book iv of paradise lost
0	dai-yu rose to her feet laughing
0	what good will taking him to the yamen do ?
0	as if automatically , milton repeats the pro forma popular association of usury with the open stews of prostitution
0	said sky¬bright as soon as she saw who it was
0	that ’ s why i ’ ve come out to see you
0	he took it in his hands and inspected it
0	you ’ ve lust started to make progress with your studies , and this is no time to be thinking of letting up
0	and bring qiao-jie in here to me
0	the xue family and servants raised a cry of protest :
0	however much of an authority she may be , i ’ m sure she would never presume to compete with you , lady jia
0	i so seldom get a chance of seeing you
0	that will be the first of the month
0	in for a penny , in for a pound ’ was her motto
0	that ’ s wonderful , said musk
0	nannie liu teaches me embroidery , said qiao-jie
0	then there were words of comfort and congratula¬tion to exchange and bao-yu had an opportunity of studying dai-yu more carefully
0	i ’ ve finished the girl ’ s classic , and a fortnight ago i started on lives of noble women present and past
0	he was on his own and they therefore moved into the attack with short swords , only to find themselves quickly outmatched
0	she must first take a single dose of a combined anti-spasmodic and expectorant , and then i want you to give her a course of four prodigies powders
0	he gazed around him
0	she just swore at me
0	now they ’ ve got what they came for , and she ’ s gone off with them to enjoy it !
0	yesterday evening i saw cousin lin , and she told me she was going back to the south
0	come and have a look
0	certainly not , protested lady wang
0	these young people are the bane of my life !
0	it ’ s the least i owe you after being with you all these years
0	what were your first three themes ?
0	it was a foolish love , and i have paid for it with my life
0	while insubordination in the inner apartments
0	look , auntie : you give me this planting job now , then ; if you ’ re satisfied with the way i do it , you can give me the other job later on
0	qin ’ s already betrothed to academician mei ’ s son
0	bless you , i ’ m not offended !
0	we need at least two or three thousand taels to pay for these things
0	after that he made another bow and retired , eyes still on the floor , as they had been throughout the consultation
0	bao-yu contemplated the view for a moment
0	aristotle thus offers a teleological account of the soul ’ s alienation : the soul departs from its telos when it serves the ends of the body
0	his influence would surely secure pan ’ s release
0	of course you were right to question her
0	yu-cun had always been a smart fellow
0	so you get the hostess ’ s special brew ?
0	during this last year or two i haven ’ t had so much as a smell of it
0	than find one understanding heart
0	the men working on the awning and the pall-bearers had not been paid , nor had the extra kitchen expenses for the funeral reception been met
0	her heart sank as she turned to look
0	my great-uncles and all the other gentlemen have just finished their dinner
0	your stem grew from a noble lotus toot ,
0	she ’ s an official marriage-broker working for one of the yamens , said patience
0	there are no outsiders here
0	now my mistress , it so happens , was the only one who said she didn ’ t want a daily supply of flowers
0	oh no you don ’ t !
0	i hope you didn ’ t disgrace yourself , said lady wang anxiously
0	very well , said grandmother jia , and began to lead the way to the lotus pavilion
0	if i , martin luther , had given him even my hand , he would have destroyed me ; but i would not have been afraid of him , —with god as my protector , i would have given him my hand in the name of the lord
0	when i was younger , said bao-yu , ignoring her jibes , and dai-yu was rather more childish in her ways , some¬how i always managed to upset her by saying the wrong thing
0	bao-yu thought for a bit and then nodded
0	his spirits seemed greatly revived
0	if it ’ s not enough , we ’ ll ask them to bring you some more
0	there you are , my darling !

0	in bale ’ s play , however , the manifestly untrustworthy sodomismus asserts that idololatria does all this [ w ] ithought the helpe of the holye ghost : / in workynge she is alone ( ibid )
0	opposite the fifth fret
0	as she had predicted , the old lady was somewhat ruffled :
0	bao-chai begged her to take heart , and at the same time called out for the boy to set off with xue ke at once
0	li wan , xi-feng and aunt xue followed , each in a palanquin with four bearers
0	you can even use unclean foods- as long as they ’ re devoutly offered : that ’ s the important thing
0	bao-yu , greatly relieved at the news , walked out and asked tealeaf :
0	grandmother jia thought for a bit
0	go and tell her ladyship !
0	bao-chai entered the cabinet ’ and laughed softly at aroma
0	i know for a fact that she is a model of wifely behaviour
0	burying her in nanking indeed !
0	but she would not authorize zhang cai ’ s wife to pay for the tailoring until wang xing ’ s wife had returned the tally for the material used and the buyer ’ s receipt
0	a clear-eyed reader of the honest whore might , in turn , ask : which is the citizen here , and which the whore ?
0	in the end it was bao-chai who ordered them to set him free :
0	since she and aroma are both in mourning , why don ’ t we let her go and join aroma ?
0	with official families , there ’ s no telling where they may be posted , replied lady wang
0	this is exactly what goethe ’ s faust achieves in the paper money scene
0	now let us ask to receive the three lines of the upper trigram , and thus complete the hexagram
0	magic is not a means for faust to command mephistopheles , but vice versa , as the devil makes clear in several asides :
0	what dear , adorable , sweet , noble girls they are !
0	we ’ re all gathered here to witness a happy event
0	you already looked like a banshee to start with , with your ill face and your hair all over the place
0	what goes with viridian ?
0	whatever the girl ’ s like , she was given to you by sir she
0	yuan-chun gave orders that the words the house of reunion ’ should be substituted
0	as for colours : red ochre , canton indigo , gamboge and safflower red are the only four i ’ ve got
0	ask one of the stewards , they ’ re the ones who ought to know
0	why , have you heard something ?
0	she went up to them :
0	i ’ m fine , he wrote
0	but , in tea-making mysteries deep-skilled ,
0	this one begins next morning , when xiang-yun invited grandmother jia and the rest to a cassia-viewing party in the garden
0	i shall come again
0	it was so kind of you to think of him
0	in the name of the supreme ultimate , of the yin and of the yang , and of the generative powers of the cosmos ; in the name of the holy signs made manifest in the great river , which embody the myriad transformations of the universe , and of the saints who in their wisdom leave no sincere request unheeded : here , in good faith , mr jia , on the occasion of his mother ’ s illness , devoutly beseeches the four sages , fu xi , king wen , the duke of zhou and confucius , to look down from above and vouchsafe an efficacious response to this his earnest supplication
0	he is saved only by the arrival of her neighbors , whom she has invited to supper , in an ostentatious display of hospitality
0	in extreme heat it would make a perfect fly and mosquito-net for use in a large reception hall
0	it does not matter , in any ethical sense , whether stavrogin is dealing with a man of flesh and blood , an hallucination , or the devil in person
0	i remember that time uncle zheng beat him for doing something he shouldn ’ t have and old lady jia decided that cousin zhen was at the bottom of it
0	they may claim that they believe this , but this is only an attempt to conceal the true nature of their art , which is the invocation of evil spirits :
0	some people would tell you they indicated a pregnancy , but i am afraid i should have to disagree
0	i ’ ve just delivered the food to grandfather , and i told him that father was entertaining all the men of the family at home and had not presumed to visit him because of what he said
0	malynes seems to imply a bullionist view of value when he says that it is because the peeces of money
0	bao-chai alone was still plunged in gloom , though she felt it inappropriate to weep
0	it really won ’ t do to allow them to stay together indefinite¬ly
0	xi-feng departed as bidden
0	and there our narrative leaves him
0	i can tell her about it myself , if need be , next time i see her
0	well , who is lady wang going to send ?
0	my advice to you , madam , is to be a bit more patient
0	the door of the storeroom was then locked and the remaining maids came down
0	justina responds by denying the quantitative view of sin , its equation with a financial debt , that has obscured from cyprian the true nature of redemption : oh , there are not
0	for fifty miles around , the damage to crops and livestock—and houses and people as well , for that matter—was terrible
0	it ’ s also not good to eat food after being out in the cold with an empty stomach
0	by the time this whispered exchange was over , the calcula¬tions had been completed and it was announced that the amounts promised totalled a round sum of one hundred and fifty taels with a few taels left over
0	they related the story of dime ’ s arrest , and begged jia yun to help them secure his release
0	mr bao , please go ahead and rinse your mouth !
0	some of the promissory notes and documents were returned , and none of his other property had been officially confiscated , but his apartment had been ransacked and nothing but the bare furniture had been left in place
0	we should be able to get him off
0	their perfume lingering , but their gold hue dimmed
0	j ia zheng was miles away and heard none of this
0	slumbering amidst the roses , you shall dream fragrant dreams
0	as the lord and father , or that which is highest , even god , is the maker of the celestial gods , so man is the maker of the gods who are in the temples , content to dwell near to men
0	at once the pages led the horses out of the main stream of traffic and headed northwards down a small side-road
0	she rose and said to bao-chai with a smile :
0	having reached this conclusion in her own mind , she spoke to jia zheng again
0	jonathan dollimore will have none of this
0	what do you mean ?
0	the red sun in the sky so bright , said grandmother jia
0	i am sure that he at least will do well and bring some good out of all this
0	looks as if he left his signature !
0	bao-yu came tight up to her and held his face close to hers :
0	what a glorious mystery
0	by the way , that pair of identical vases that used to be on the very top of the dresser isn ’ t back yet , either
0	( ) we recognize here , once again , the voice of nietzsche , and leverkuhn ’ s personal life contains many echoes of nietzsche ’ s biography
0	not a word of her errand
0	what an extraordinary coincidence !
0	laxness which made her the way she is
0	please let me go
0	i want that painting ready by the end of the year
0	she turned to li wan again :
0	later on , when i heard more about her illness , i thought i under¬stood , but i don ’ t suppose i did really
0	there ’ s even a song about us :
0	when she was back , she told xi-feng and the rest of the young folk who had escorted her to go and have their dinner , and the cousins went back into the garden
0	it ’ s a whitecap , said jia qiang , smiling proudly
0	she presented the flowers and explained who they were from , and the two girls stopped their game for a moment to bow their thanks , and gave orders to the maids to take charge of them
0	the former term designates the ordered relations of a society based on blood and soil ; the latter refers to the amorphous , unfamiliar but formidable force that was visibly and rapidly destroying those relations
0	if you ’ d been much later , i ’ m afraid it would have gone badly for the jias
0	but it soon transpires that the main fault of these usurers has been to accuse mosse himself of practicing usury , a charge that he ruefully concedes , ascribing it to his thoughtless youth , and covering his retreat by casting the same aspersion on his opponents
0	tell me , auntie , said qin-shi , how is it that you who are such a paragon among women that even strong men find mote than their match in you can yet be ignorant of the simple truths expressed in homely proverbs ?
0	i ’ m rather tired just now
0	oriole and swallow invited her to come and sit down on the rock
0	if i tell a joke and it ’ s no good , he thought , he will say i ’ ve no invention
0	but all she said to aroma was :
0	one plaster wang thought for a bit
0	from the scene before her eyes and the word or two she had overheard , bao-chai was able to form a pretty good idea of what had been happening
0	nor need the stream ’ s source to investigate
0	then , when this is all over , i shall come round to your place to thank you properly
0	in this effort , the likes of gary becker and richard dawkins have been abetted by allegedly radical theorists like donna haraway and judith butler
0	i don ’ t under¬stand you
0	mammon , the least erected spirit that fell from heaven , for even in heaven his looks and thoughts were always downward bent , admiring more the riches of heaven ’ s pavement , trodden gold , then aught divine or holy else enjoy ’ d
0	jia zheng examined the extent of the damage , heaving many a silent sigh
0	the relationship between this virtual reality and divine creation is the subject of a lengthy debate between helen and meneleus
0	see what happens to you when mrs lian is better !
0	if we have , i shall tell them to send you a few ounces , so that you can get your own maids to prepare it for you every morning
0	our impression , which is very powerful in paradise lost , of satan as a power independent of god , is satan ’ s perception of himself , and also the perception he inculcates in humanity
0	i shall turn a blind eye
0	how do you know it doesn ’ t belong to one of them ?
0	jia lian , jia rong , bao-yu and the other boys got up while the chairs were rearranged and the girls were installed at the table
0	but then , after a few days had gone by , there was an unpleasant incident with mercy , the new maid whom xi-feng had given her in place of her own
0	crimson smiled vainly and took them from him
0	you may not know about some of these things , so perhaps it would be a good idea if cousin bao were to take them down at my dictation
0	remembered is that of the confession of the witch trial—in historical cases often forced out by judicial torture and made to conform to the judges preconceptions
0	the weeping continued all that night
0	then she asked grandmother jia if she would mind deputing two of her women to take er-jie round to see lady xing and lady wang , and whether it would be all right for them to say that er-jie was being installed on grandmother jia ’ s initiative
0	come now , the truth !
0	at home i shall have to keep my knowledge a secret of course
0	from his account of the state xue pan had been in when they found him cousin zhen deduced that he must have been beaten up by liu xiang-lian but appeared remarkably unconcerned , for he merely laughed and observed that he could do with the lesson ’
0	there are plenty of dirty-minded , gossiping busy¬bodies who would be only too pleased to go tattling about this sort of thing to the other mansion , and before you know where you are the gossips there will be passing round the most terrible stories about us
0	she called brightie ’ s wife to her
0	all the charm and colour which had once endeared the spot to him seemed now to have abandoned it
0	hua zi-fang and his mother had by now finished laying an elaborate tea
0	if material things can not move him , still less i suppose will any mention of his wife and child
0	she studied the floor thoughtfully for some moments ; then she had bao-chai summoned , explained to her what had happened , and assured her that she must not think herself under the least suspicion
0	we ’ ve got a garden too , you know , and we grow a certain amount of fruit in it
0	there ’ s all the difference in the world between doing this once in a while on a birthday or a holiday and doing it every night of one ’ s life
0	if it ’ s only a little thing he wants , we needn ’ t worry ; but if it ’ s something big he ’ s after , i think i know how to handle this
0	xi-feng made this the occasion for a little raillery
0	and why the round sun ?
0	red emperor rice number bushels
0	stepping out onto the waiting barge she saw an expanse of clear water curving between its banks like a sportive dragon
0	the wheel of karma turn ?
0	he had returned from perfunctory morning calls on his mother and grandmother and had just finished changing back into his everyday clothes , when tan-chun ’ s maid ebony arrived carrying a carefully-folded letter from her mistress
0	take no notice of her , said skybright
0	grandmother jia pondered her son ’ s words
0	can ’ t you even see each other without having words ?
0	but the old nurse was so bemused by all this talk of policy and high finance that she appeared to be in a sort of coma , which it took a sharp nudge from patience to rouse her from
0	jia qiang told him how jokey jin had been bullying qin zhong
0	for bao-yu the whole of the previous day had been spoilt by abbot zhang ’ s proposal to grandmother jia to arrange a match for him
0	the facility with which the form of the puppet medium was adapted to the two great themes of the faust myth—the performative power of representation and the objectification of the subject—enabled the legend to survive , underground but substantially unaltered , during the century and a half when it was considered beneath the interest of high aesthetics
0	i shall see grandmother and lady wang about this first thing tomorrow , and after that i shall call on lady xing and make whatever amends she likes to ask for
0	two lamps for earth , the moon and sun , said xiang-yun
0	the maids knelt down in terror and swore by the most sacred oaths that they had said nothing
0	but if you want to know what it was , you will have to wait for the next chapter
0	i asked him to hand it over , but he in¬sisted on having the pawn-ticket
0	patience gave a little laugh
0	in this play , however , cyprian reasons his way beyond the manichean temptation :
0	he was still not able to sit up for long periods , but often when he saw her sit¬ting by his bedside he would succumb to his old weakness for the fairer sex
0	why should i tell a lie ?
0	and ying-lian , after all those years of ill-treatment at the hands of her kidnapper , suddenly seeing a road to freedom opening in front of her - for she was a girl of feeling , and there is no doubt that they would have made a fine couple if they had succeeded in coming together—and then for this to have happened !
0	there was a loud creak as the casement yielded
0	the present misfortune is concatenated with water at the first branch zi and at the twelfth branch hai ; but when this element wanes , with the third branch yin comes wood and thence fire
0	then , noticing that bao-chai had not accompanied her mother , and trying to imagine what could be keeping her at home , he began to drift into one of his brown stud¬ies , and was only aroused and restored to a more cheer¬ful frame of mind by the unexpected arrival of dai-yu
0	she may write poetry if she likes as a diversion , but it is an accomplishment she could just as well do without
0	just an old red padded jacket of mine
0	never mind about him !
0	these are two lengths of wild-silk pongee
0	and it has to be dried until it ’ s quite brittle
0	your servant , my lady !
0	she has grown so terribly thin of late
0	there was a long pause , after which the second voice re¬plied :
0	you don ’ t know how to turn it properly , said the girl
0	bao-yu must have had some such feeling as he listened to xiu-yan , for he first of all gave a gasp of discovery and then laughed out loud
0	the devils are likened to
0	dai-yu ’ s curiosity got the better of her
0	but there is no need for us to pursue these matters in further detail
0	but now seeinge everie man is both our neighbour , and our brother : we may not take usurie of any man at al
0	over many generations our two families have estab¬lished closeness of friendship and mutual understanding
0	the sight of jia lian rushing agitatedly about , calling for doctors , ordering medicines , dispensing curses and floggings among the servants , and in general showing a most singular devotedness to er-jie , had already caused autumn 's system to
0	but i ’ m sure you know all about that
0	if you think there ’ s aot of work in this one , you ought to see the one he ’ s wearing !
0	then he felt it with his hand
0	her concern now was lest bao-yu should have been unduly dis¬tressed by his visit , or have failed to eat enough while he was away , or have been involved in some accident on the way there or back
0	but talk about books is important business , said bao-chai
0	no need at double ninth live flowers to pluck :
0	but yuan-chun , how¬ever hard it was to leave her family , dared not infringe the regulations of the imperial household , and steeled herself to re-enter the palanquin which was to carry her away
0	she was just beginning to doze off when the spar¬rows struck up their dawn-chorus from their nests in the bamboos
0	that which i am
0	wind-whorled , into trim fluff-balls forming –
0	hurry up and bring me my jacket
0	by the end of the nineteenth century , the conceit that modernity was a
0	though shaken by the unexpectedness of this onslaught , skybright realized at once that someone must have been saying things about her
0	only the greater freedom of the old style allows for the smoother , more flowing development that this subject calls for
0	jia rong kotowed and remained upon his knees
0	the supreme wrath is aroused by human folly in all forms - whether it be excessive ambition , premature death self-sought , or futile self-destruction through de¬bauchery and a life of overweening violence
0	he looks very upset too , ma ’ am
0	someone only has to go to him with a hard-luck story - especially if there ’ s a bit of flattery thrown in with it - and he ’ ll own up to anything in order to get them off
0	at this point our narrative abandons jia yun ’ s affairs and returns to bao-yu
0	he does keep his promise , however , scornfully asking catalinon , the servant who urges him to break the appointment didn ’ t you see me give my word , and rebuffing the lackey ’ s confused question , what does it matter if you break it ?
0	xiang-yun laughed excitedly as she hurried to complete the couplet :
0	i think that ’ s a fair judgement , said tan-chun
0	the girls and bao-yu crowded round to read it
0	there is the ( infamous ) simon of samaria in the acts of the apostles , who chaffered for the holy ghost : after his condemnation by him , and
0	whoever it was , there was no longer any doubt in his mind as to their in¬tentions
0	we ’ re waiting with our umbrellas up and we ’ ve got the lantern ready
0	that evening xi-feng summoned sunset ’ s mother to her in order to propose the marriage with brightie ’ s son
0	as soon as she arrived , she insisted that the young people should go off and have their dinner
0	crying so early in the morning
0	the conversation that evening turned to the xue family , and xiang-yun learned from grandmother jia how as the result of pan ’ s escapade the xues were now facing total ruin
0	is it possible that i might be allowed to see it ?
0	i ’ ve eaten one or two bits of that yam-cake with the date stuff inside that grand¬ma sent me yesterday
0	as they were speaking , a confused cry was heard from within :
0	uncer¬tain what it was that he had heard , he stopped to listen
0	don ’ t worry , it ’ s of no consequence !
0	the little maid went outside again
0	he said that if father really wanted to hear him play , he would come back another day with his own instrument
0	her hair was loosely coiled on top of her head
0	nightingale and snowgoose felt they could no longer deny her request
0	now , tell me what you really wanted to see zhou about ?
0	a faint yes ’ was heard from inside , and handing the soup back to snowgoose for the moment , nightingale climbed up and helped dai-yu into a comfortable sitting position
0	it ’ s only because of late years you have been too stiff-necked to approach them that they have become more distant with you
0	xi-feng laughed too , then , kneeling down , proceeded to repeat , more or less word for word , what she had told you-shi she would say
0	snowgoose said she would relay this message and car¬ried the soup into the room
0	in some cases he was able to grasp the hidden meaning at a first reading , others required a moment ’ s reflection , while some remained obstinately unintelligible
0	in the time of king henrie the third , the good citizens of london in one night slew fiue hundred iewes for that a iewe tooke of a christian a pennie in the shilling vsurie : and euer after got them banished the citie : if the like iustice were done vpon iuish christians , london would haue manie houses emptie , and her churches and churchyeardes would be too scant to receiue dead carrions
0	anyway , i ’ m afraid this planchette you mention is something i am not familiar with
0	cried aunt xue hysterically
0	he turned his attention to her appearance
0	you must explain to her how things really are
0	bao-yu was quite won over
0	don juan expands the illocutionary nature of promising to everything he says ; the truth-content of speech has no significance , and all that matters is the practical effects that his words produce
0	express his sense of injustice in poetic form
0	when dinner was over , the company conversed for a while and then retired to their various rooms for the night—xiang-yun to sleep with dai-yu in what had once , in the days when she lived with grandmother jia , been her own bedroom
0	but then the mid autumn festival arrived and , after the family cdnvivialities were over , shi-yin had a little dinner for two laid out in his study and went in person to invite yu-cun , walking to his temple lodgings in the moonlight
0	she gets on well with bao-chai too
0	i can ’ t possibly take both of these , she said
0	tan-chun and xi-chun were much amused
0	it seems that the question
0	he must be given a marriage as soon as possible to turn his luck
0	from father , just a minute ago
0	tan ’ s right , echoed xiang-yun
0	there was a retching sound and up it came , medicine , phlegm and all , much to xi-feng ’ s relief
0	bao-yu seized hold of her hand
0	i told them to look for it and when it didn ’ t turn up thought no more about it
0	the only clean things about that ning-guo house are the stone lions that stand outside the gate
0	let ’ s all go and see farmer sweetrice and discuss this business of reviving the poetry club with her , said the others
0	would you wait for two ?
0	what happened after that ?
0	the others all laughed
0	grandmother jia rested with her feet up on the settle and , after talking for a while with the company , took out the eyeglasses from their case and looked through them at the stage
0	xi-feng took the bill and told sunshine to enter the figures from it in his book
0	aunt xue made him lie down again
0	by straining her eyes she could make out two human shapes
0	dai-yu took a sip , and nightingale was about to remove the cup when she saw that dai-yu wanted some more
0	she was unaware that bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of him
0	but the con¬cubines were too scared to take them
0	oh that wasn ’ t real !
0	she spoke first to grandmother jia :
0	corded silk-crepe , thirty-two bolts
0	this is a court of law we are in and one of the emperor ’ s judges you are speaking to
0	he was a few years older than aroma but had never married and was exceptionally goodooking
0	they represented scholarly diligence in the person of the han philosopher liu xiang at his book , obligingly illuminated for him by a supernatural being holding a large flaming torch
0	in qing-zhou the civil and military authorities were in a panic
0	the question , then , of who is accountable for a given injury precedes and initiates the subject , and the subject itself is formed through being nominated to inhabit that grammatical and juridical site
0	what a brilliant prediction !
0	she had been looking for him everywhere , she said
0	you ought to be waiting outside
0	yu-cun turned to look
0	ebony now asked ciggy to go to the garden gatehouse and get one of the pages there to run out and buy her a sweet-cake
0	but what if he were to marry someone like mrs lian or mr pan ’ s new wife ?
0	it was the uncontrollable anger of the morally out¬raged that had caused her to strike golden and call her names ; and though golden now begged and pleaded , she refused to retract her dismissal
0	someone is bringing some workmen in tomorrow to plant trees , so you have all got to be extra careful
0	all my best people you take away from me
0	the inner room , where a slightly more intellectual group were playing tin kau , was devoted to dominoes
0	the inscription graved upon her tomb shall be :
0	look , said xue pan
0	in the burning-ground by the old temple , green ghost-fires flicker when the west wind blows
0	leaves but dead lotus-leaves for the rain to play on
0	she turned back and asked the young woman if she had seen him
0	all three were dressed in identical skirts and dresses and wore identical sets of bracelets and hair ornaments
0	a ballet based on the legend was performed in vienna in , and palmer and more trace the predominance of its comic and spectacular aspects to viennese influence , especially that of the actor stranitzky
0	it ’ s funny the board hasn ’ t mentioned that in its report
0	but we must leave them and follow aunt xue , who on her arrival at home saw two yamen runners waiting in the inner gate¬way
0	the bad spirit said to
0	this mingled in his mind with another vivid memory , that of the moon goddess in the play he had seen the previous year
0	however , they eventually managed to concoct a list of sorts , which they handed to a servant to deliver to the authorities
0	jokey jin ’ s aunt was married to one jia huang , a member of the jia clan in the same generation as cousin zhen and jia lian
0	the one to suffer most during all this was aroma , although she tried to remain quiet and calm , and to com-fort bao-yu and minister to his needs
0	that way no one need know
0	you others go in and get on with your poetry
0	i suppose there ’ ll be more plays after today , won ’ t there ?
0	you ’ ve been away too long , said aroma
0	red inkstone restored the original title when he recopied the book and added his second set of annotations to it
0	i assure you , it is precisely those families i am speaking of
0	it is quieter here , that is all , and there are plently of sutras for him to , read , to help settle his mind
0	he set off for school greatly perplexed by what had happened
0	i begin to wonder if this illness of his is genuine or just a pretence
0	after sitting for a while in silence she sighed
0	cried jia zheng angrily
0	fourth month yuan-feng era anno number
0	her mother was terribly rude to him when she saw him , swearing that he ’ d been her daughter ’ s ruin
0	but li wan would not see them
0	her dress , though not shabby , was far from new
0	patience whispered to aroma :
0	she increased the guard around bao-yu ’ s apartment and had it constantly watched and patrolled
0	he may not even be alive , but we ’ d better try to get him out !
0	just curtsey for me and say i ’ m not feeling very well but it ’ s nothing serious and she ’ s not to worry
0	a staff of carved aloeswood
0	dai-yu waited on her in person ; offering her tea in a covered cup which she carried on a little tray
0	but of my fair cousins , most have been scattered to the four winds
0	no , said lady wang , it was none of those
0	i can see for myself how they ’ ve changed
0	what you ought to have said is : no , aunt , you are our guest since you honour us by staying in our house , it is we who should be inviting you
0	how have you been managing ?
0	the two reasons tealeaf had given corresponded well enough with aroma ’ s own observations , and she was more than half inclined to believe them
0	he smiled dutifully , and hastened to reply :
0	while he sipped it , bao-yu took the opportunity of asking her if he might borrow an incense-burner
0	but in practice , by the late sixteenth century the two activities had much in common , and they were often referred to by the same term ,
0	this father wang had knocked about the world in his rime as an itinerant vendor of panaceas and even now had his name-plate hung up outside the temple with an impressive list of the pills , powders , plasters and potions that he was prepared , for a consideration , to dispense
0	i told you , mother , again and again , but you wouldn ’ t believe me
0	i ’ ll tell you what , said dai-yu
0	the rapid expansion of consumer debt and credit , the growing personal investment in the stock market , in short , the practical and ideological translation of life into financial terms , all interpolate a new kind of individual
0	the elder of mrs zhen ’ s two sisters
0	if i didn ’ t go with her , it would seem like a betrayal after what we ’ ve been to each other all these years
0	with these words he set off
0	possible cause encounter with spirit of hanged person or flower spirit
0	not far from him a taoist with a crippled leg sat catching and killing his lice
0	ye think me called to this art , and give me to understand that the step aside to her were no long one
0	throughout the whole of this last year there have been i don ’ t know how many alarms and excursions between him and poor aunt xue because she wouldn ’ t let him get his hands on caltrop
0	in goethe ’ s faust , the emperor ’ s lament for his realm ’ s financial woe bespeaks a crisis in the nature of value that parallels faust ’ s despair of attaining philosophical truth in part one
0	you want to put them out on plates when you ’ re having someone to tea : you ’ ll find they ’ re a bit better than the ones you can buy in the shops

0	it was ages before she sent them , and even then there was a message to say that she ’ d only been able to do them roughly
0	he reflected that he had only acted in the first place from a desire to keep the peace between them : yet the only outcome of his good intentions had been a telling-off by either party
0	but surely that was a young lady i examined just now ?
0	you would always be finding that this one had too much and that one too little
0	poets lean on railings , seeking inspiration –
0	but why is it that every-thing else has yin and yang but we haven ’ t ?
0	wang shan-bao ’ s wife heartily wished that it were possible to slip through some crack and disappear into the ground
0	his mind was clear now , but because he did not wish to lose nightingale yet , he pretended that it was still affected
0	grandmother jia asked her
0	why do you laugh , cousin bao ?
0	i am still very young , she explained to xi-feng
0	and just at that moment you came back
0	and quite cast down
0	ever since your uncle zheng has been at this post , replied lady wang , not a penny has been remitted
0	poor miss shi is quite lost without her !
0	over would go dishes , table and all !
0	the door-gods summoned the village god and complained : you guaranteed our security if we built a wall , but look what ’ s happened !
0	actually it ’ s rather hard to sell stuff like this , confess¬ed feng
0	adamantina busied herself at the stove , fanning the charcoal until the water was boiling vigorously and brewing them a fresh pot of tea
0	with adamantina on his back , the man made his way to the garden wall , which he scaled with a rope-ladder , climbing down to where some of his accomplices were waiting with the getaway cart
0	when he comes back we ought to make him do some other kind of verses for us by himself
0	and the bottle-gourd monk settles a
0	what do you mean by coming here and making this racket ?
0	swallow , you can come with me
0	the weaver ’ s glowing art combined
0	and went off home
0	all right , all right !
0	it ’ s cold - please don ’ t bother to see me out
0	who ’ s putting on a little girl act now ?
0	i hope you don ’ t imagine it ’ s some exotic perfume given me by the immortals of the isles
0	i don ’ t think we need bother going over the written characters for all those names , said bao-yu
0	what ’ s the name of this temple then ?
0	when they came to the entrance , dai-yu seemed to feel clearer in mind
0	mother , pleaded jia zheng on behalf of the others , whatever you want , you have only to tell us ; but please don ’ t exhaust yourself by trying to sit up
0	she told one of the lay-sisters to light some incense , and went herself to fetch the tray of sand and the planchette-wand from a chest
0	grandmother , auntie , what is troubling you ?
0	oh , she ’ s seeing ghosts now !
0	that blind , defenceless love with which nature has filled your being is what we call here lust of the mind
0	you may as well strangle me instead you shameless slut !
0	she knows about our troubles ; in fact the slightest mention of your name brings tears to her eyes
0	following a patristic tradition reaching back to clement of alexandria , good usury was understood symbolically , to march ,
0	the other day when we were making up a new lot of pills for grandmother , said xi-feng , you told me to keep any of the remaining whole roots for a medicine you were sending to general yang ’ s wife
0	he saw no hint of luxury or show ,
0	he was wearing a narrow-sleeved , full-skirted robe of dark red material with a pattern of flowers and butterflies in two shades of gold
0	later i was at mrs lian ’ s myself , and heard her say to patience that the whole thing was something the master ’ s literary gentlemen had thought up , to please him and provide themselves with a connection
0	the two men departed for aunt xue ’ s apartment at the head of a contingent of servants bearing the presents
0	he came immediately , and on leaving her apartment sent at once for a doctor to take her pulses and give a diagnosis
0	first guess who wrote it , said bao-qin mischievously
0	i know you ’ re not a fool !
0	the others can carry the horn lantern in front of you , and you can carry this glass lamp , which is handier and brighter and specially made for going out in the rain with , yourself
0	and from fear of reprisal the reluctant playboy makes a
0	dai-yu clung to lady wang
0	it was nearly three in the morning before she was properly asleep
0	peach pink on sleepy face the morning colours glow
0	bao-yu did not stop running until he was inside the garden gate
0	we got through a whole two-gallon jar of wine
0	when he came round , he said that he had been through a great archway , where he met a lady , who showed him a temple full of cabinets
0	a bit on the weak side , though
0	replied the maid , amid fresh tears
0	isn ’ t your name nella something or other ?
0	this is what they read :
0	then you can go ahead and invite all the others to move in and look after you
0	but the jacket is too plain
0	i ’ ll be surprised if we haven ’ t got some bird ’ s nest of our own at home
0	if bao-yu can keep her with him always , he ’ ll he a very lucky boy
0	after a while bao-yu showed signs of flagging , and when jia yun , observing what appeared to be fatigue , rose to take his leave , he did not very strongly press him to stay
0	tan-chun offered the rod to li wen , but she declined
0	and now i am going to give you my little sister two-in-one—ke-qing to her friends—to be your bride
0	and shady activities are revealed
0	their arrival was so quiet and discreet that they managed to get inside it unobserved
0	what did you call it ?
0	you are trying to make out that it was my fault because you have taken his side against me
0	you couldn ’ t get him to look at what was really real ( )
0	jia zheng was beginning to age now , and the worries and responsibilities of office had taken their toll of his health
0	take a look at this !
0	aroma called after him
0	what , you may ask , was the origin of this book ?
0	they were almost home again when they met one of aunt xue ’ s women
0	you ’ ve only just been sweating after the medicine , she said
0	'the jewel in the casket bides till one shall come to buy
0	it was a very life-like portrait of a beautiful woman
0	so that i need no longer toil and sweat to speak of what i do not know ,
0	i ’ m sure she didn ’ t mean anything by it
0	she was taken in by dumbo ’ s story and invited wang ren to come and talk the matter over with her
0	suddenly there was a horrible retching noise and up came the tisane of elsholtzia leaves she had taken only a short while before
0	i think you ’ re making it up
0	you call people here to discuss important business , said li wan , but all we have had so far is talk about books !
0	it is our earnest prayer that his sacred majesty may con¬tinue long to reign over us , a blessing to all his peoples ; and that your grace should feel no anxiety concerning the welfare of my wife and myself during our now declining years , but should rather cherish and sustain your own precious person , in order to be the better able to serve his sacred majesty with care and diligence , seeking by that service to be worthy of the tender regard and loving favour which he has been graciously pleased to bestow upon you
0	remember : scriptural exegesis is exempt from the normal rules of verbal prohibition
0	no , i ’ m still here
0	let us now turn to the affairs of jia yu-cun , newly installed in the yamen at ying-tian-fu
0	dai-yu , seeing how morose bao-yu looked assumed that it was because bao-chai was offended with him and , feeling resent¬ful that he should care , at once became as morose as he was
0	the autumn flowers are dead , the leaves are sere ;
0	i notice you ’ ve got several mirrors in your vanity box , said bao-yu
0	marlowe describes the psychological effect of idolatry with great precision ; faustus alienates his soul at the moment that he deifies the image
0	the other day when mr zhou came home from town , he told me how people are all talking about us , trying to guess just how rich the family is
0	her face reddened as she said this , and for a moment she seemed on the point of tears
0	yes ma ’ am , said wu xin-deng ’ s wife , and taking up a tally , went hurrying off to collect the money
0	patience is far¬seeing enough to realize this and , in her own inimitable way , without fear or flattery , she gives us warning
0	if that magistrate had now been cashiered , and an enquiry had been held , he could be implicated himself
0	leaving his private apartment , yu-cun went to his study , and was sitting there pondering the few words zhen shi-yin had spoken during their brief encounter , when one of his attendants came in to convey an imperial summons to the palace , to peruse certain state papers
0	with the death of the zhou ’ concubine the family is away every day and they must be rather lonely at home
0	if you want to make such a request , that ’ s your business , but kindly leave others out of it !
0	she hurried him on his way once more
0	if ever you ’ re at a loose end , you can always jump in your chair and have yourself carried round here for a game of cards and a chat with her old ladyship
0	it isn ’ t like the open river here , but it ’ s still quite deep
0	in that case , said aunt xue , will you tell lady jia when you have a chance ?
0	i see , said bao-yu to himself
0	although i am living there , i dare not ask them to do very
0	aroma ’ s low reply , in which she merely repeated what tealeaf had told her , was his first inkling of the part that jia huan had played in his misfortune
0	that harpy aunt zhao evidently left behind her a son every bit as vile as herself !
0	if you ’ ve something to say , then go ahead and say it
0	this is a bad time of the year for me , and i was afraid of becoming seriously ill so i started deliberately looking for things to do and forcing myself to do them ; and do you know , during the last day or two i really have begun to feel better
0	each glossy leaf breathes coolness on the air
0	as she entered the courtyard , she could hear the sound of xi-feng ’ s raised voice coming from inside the house
0	the time had come round for the triennial review of civil servants stationed in the capital
0	thirty years it is since you were born , i said , and all that time , in actual fact , you ’ ve : been a bondservant
0	i think you would expect him to be upset , suddenly out of the blue like that being told that she was going away
0	perhaps he ’ s gone mental
0	if there is no one able to share your music ’ s true delight , then sit alone , and
0	xue pan gradually calmed down when his mother told him that xiang-lian had fled

0	those delicate wits then , who haue from hence extracted conclusions , as if god , by such parables and allusions , did somewhat fauour vsurie ; they must by the same reason iustifie vnrighteousnes , because the example of the vniust steward is commended vnto vs ; and withall conclude that euen theft it selfe is therefore sanctified , because christ hath compared himselfe vnto a theefe in the night
0	he went out to superintend the practical arrangements for the convicts ’ departure and instructed jia lian to choose some servants to accompany them
0	what about old sir she ?
0	it won ’ t be so funny if you catch cold
0	it so happened that when they arrived , lady wang , aunt xue , li wan , xi-feng , bao-yu and the girls , and some of the senior stewardesses from outside were all - there with the old lady sharing a joke
0	all way he was still plying bao-yu with questions
0	so it was you up to your tricks , you little monkey !
0	usury reversed these roles , in an objectification of the subject that was also a subjectification of the object , and this was often likened to a revolt of the servile
0	how can you suggest such a thing ?
0	don ’ t make me sick , said xiang-yun
0	it ’ s only a bit of nonsense to stop you sleeping in the middle of the day
0	immediately her eyes and nose began to stream
0	do whatever you must
0	all tight , said the others good-humouredly
0	having found grandmother jia , cousin zhen ducked and smiled deferentially
0	evil manifestations thrive on such superstition
0	but i have already asked if as a personal favour brother she and cousin zhen could be allowed home to make preparations for their departure , and the board of punishments has most graciously agreed to make this concession
0	sun shao-zu is an out-and-out libertine
0	when you think of the amount of land that goes with them , it seems a pity that all-spice court and green delights don ’ t produce anything marketable , said tan-chun
0	now , now , faithful , don ’ t take it so much to heart
0	significantly , calderon ’ s justina is the last virgin to repel the seducer ; in subsequent versions of the myth don juan ’ s strategems are invariably successful

0	now , the good cosmic fluid with which the natures of the exceptionally good arecompounded is a pure , quintessential humour ; whilst the evil fluid which infuses the natures of the exceptionally bad is a cruel , perverse humour
0	she was having an afternoon nap , too
0	fetch me some paper , he said , still in some agitation , and himself began grinding the ink
0	despite his access to unlimited money , some of faustus ’ s tricks are motivated by the archetypal witch ’ s resentment at charity denied
0	oh , nothing , said ying-chun , pleasantly
0	they gave him the name bao-yu as a consequence
0	but better their remains in silk to lay
0	sunset clenched her teeth
0	later , when the statue of the commander nods grimly at sganarelle ’ s invitation to dinner , the servant perceives this as a sign : heaven is scandalized at your way of life ; and has brought about this miracle , to convert you
0	go and fetch your cousin shi and the two xue girls and your cousin lin , will you ?
0	qiao-jie was feeling very miserable
0	ah , that sounds very ingenious !
0	then she wept a little
0	she stamped with impatience
0	in the play he becomes the hog of the title : is his name hog ?
0	she ’ s a good person , is our miss bao , said oriole , much more than you realize
0	only a few short steps the flowery forms divide
0	if it had been me , i should never have let you off !
0	for some moments she goggled incredulously at this touch¬ing domestic scene , then , fearful of disturbing it , she tore herself away to stifle her mounting giggles
0	i did watch for quite a while , said bao-yu , but i got rather deafened and came out to walk around for a bit
0	do what you like with him !
0	but it ’ s the truth i ’ m telling you
0	precinct of the celestial visitant
0	didn ’ t you catch the words of her aria ?
0	the second girl was rather tall , with sloping shoulders and a slender waist
0	worried that she might come out and overhear them , she took snowgoose by the hand and motioned to her to be silent
0	jia zheng smiled anxiously
0	the various gifts to be taken and the journey-money were , it goes without saying , duly prepared
0	it is extraordinary that bao¬-yu came into the world with the stone in his mouth !
0	mrs zhu is such a holy buddha , she ’ s no good
0	bao-yu turned to dai-yu
0	father is still at the party , he said
0	not only do you hate studying -that ’ s already enough to make him feel angry and upset - but on top of that you have to be forever making rude remarks about it - and not only behind his back but even when he ’ s there
0	ripple went , too , and fetched the onyx saucer from tan-¬chun ’ s room , after which aroma made ready the things that were to go to xiang-yun , and called in old mamma song one of the nannies attached to green delights—to give her in¬structions for their delivery
0	although no one knew what to do themselves , there were a great many opinions about what ought to be done
0	i ’ m not cold , said bao-yu
0	grandmother jia , xi-feng and bao-chai settled down to a con¬versation , but had barely exchanged three sentences when ripple appeared :
0	if you wish for further details , you may learn them in the following chapter
0	are still pining for your nunnery ?
0	you positively look for ways of making yourself miserable
0	patience was at this time in prospect garden , whither she had been carried off at the earliest opportunity by li wan and where , as soon as they were indoors , she had collapse in a sobbing heap , resisting all attempts at lifting her
0	aroma and skybright were immediately on the defensive
0	at first when i heard the words of the little maid touching this appointment , i thought them fantastical ; but now that i have pondered them in my heart , i know them to be worthy of perfect credence
0	cousin zhen sent for a doctor at once , who pronounced that she had caught a chill , which had developed complications and had entered into the yang-ming stomach meridian
0	yes , she said lightly , the red of the trousers goes very well with the dark green of the gown
0	he punningly haggles for your fairest jewel , be it not too deare ( ) , denies that her husband knows her true woorth ( ) , draws from her the response that i see you come to cheape and not to buy
0	xiang-yun blushed and wished she had never opened her mouth
0	a straightforward breed you are certainly not ,
0	bao-yu felt no such inhibition :
0	the only way of raising money i could think of was by pawning my winter clothes
0	brightie pretended to be indignant
0	one of these days i ’ ll rip that nasty little tongue of yours out of your mouth for good !
0	are you bao-yu then ?
0	and in this way she continued , alternately reading and composing by fits and starts , too excited to think about eating or drinking or to sit still in the same place for two or three minutes together
0	i ’ ll sleep here by your side , she said
0	where was she born , and from whence descended ?
0	he must have watched her write several dozen qiang ’ s in succession
0	jia zheng , for his part , was perfectly well aware that he was being driven away so that the younger people could feel freer to enjoy themselves and , smiling forcedly , appealed against his banishment :
0	but just at that moment caltrop , advent , chess and scribe were seen approaching the pavilion , and crimson and trinket had to drop the subject in a hurry and join in a general conver¬sation
0	thomas heywood ’ s apology for actors ( ) sees nothing amiss when the spectator becomes so enraptured with a heroic actor that he offers to him in his hart all prosperous performance , as if the personator were the man personated , so bewitching a thing is lively and well spirited action , that it hath power to new mold the harts of the spectators
0	i am sure if her father were at home he would never have found her such a good match !
0	it was such a long piece , i could barely make out what most of it was about
0	i don ’ t want to sound critical of mother , but all the time sister yuan-chun was an imperial concubine , it didn ’ t prevent them from treating some of us very shoddily
0	my boy , you must promise to do your very best for the family !
0	not like the members of this happy family - all glaring at each other like angry fighting-cocks , wondering which will be the first one to strike !
0	i didn ’ t realize that she had so powerful a protector
0	yes madam , said crimson , and hurried off
0	and high winding galleries
0	i said go and ask how she was , not go barging in !
0	if you come out now , you might catch a chill
0	they cursed the taoist for a necromancer and ordered the servants to heap up a fire and cast the mirror upon the flames
0	she said , turning to rebuke picture , who was standing by
0	i also sent someone to inquire about wang shan-bao ’ s wife
0	why does he keep coming like this ?
0	when his guest came , he sent the waiter zhang san to bring them the wine
0	when she said she didn ’ t know , she really didn ’ t know : she wasn ’ t giving me the lie
0	and you must tell me if any of the maids or the old nannies are nasty to you
0	why that ’ s bao-chai ’ s surname !
0	with xiang-yun ’ s words about the south still ringing in her ears , dai-yu drifted into a daydream
0	produce things like that !
0	we could do with another two hundred ourselves
0	suddenly on the mountainside above his head , he noticed a white rock whose surface had been polished to mirror smothness and realized that this must be one of the places which had been prepared for an inscription
0	if not , then he deserves a good spanking from the preceptor
0	how does she know which of all those trunks and boxes she put it in ?
0	grandmother jia remained until the players ’ mid-day interval before retiring to rest in her own room
0	then turning from bao er to zhou rui :
0	she need not have done so
0	musk and ripple , who were standing behind him , suppressed a giggle :
0	grandmother jia was endlessly diverted by her and always allowed her mistakes to go unreproved
0	the sooner i ’ m dead the better !
0	the others all know how sensitive cousin lin is , and they wouldn ’ t answer because they were afraid of upsetting her
0	if feng finds out , i shall take full responsibility myself
0	the zhens were , it will be remembered , like the jias , an illustrious old family from nanking , and the two families had a long-standing family connection and had always seen a good deal of each other
0	dai-yu got into her chair and was soon carried through the city walls
0	he is the living likeness of my own son !
0	it was the fact that ba-chai had thought of it in the first place
0	to lady wang this made as little sense as it had to the pages ; but it seemed to have a startling effect on bao-chai , who stared dumb¬founded in front of her
0	so they ’ ve finally broken in my frisky colt !

0	when i asked what it was , she started questioning me all about it that ’ s no cause for you to lose your temper , retorted
0	i haven ’ t seen miss lin , said trinket
0	why don ’ t we just say :
0	some haue vowed the answere of my booke before it commeth forth : some are sayd to haue many a reason alreadie deuised against it in their braine , some haue threatned that i shall neuer borrowe : some haue slandered mee behinde my backe : some haue spoken foule things to my face : yea , i haue been bitten and backbitten , as one sayd of me publikelie of late , in mine owne pulpit

0	the illusion that the economy is an autonomous sphere is shared by marxist and neoclassical economists
0	having lit a stick of incense and arranged - the fruit on the table , he dismissed all the maids and closed the door
0	after drinking all that wine , i don ’ t feel hungry , said grandmother jia
0	eventually she stammered out , bring him to me !
0	the dawn wind could not dry those pearly tears
0	law is the lord of all
0	this prince is a very important man
0	they meant by this that there is no ruddy individual with horns and hooves , goatee and widow ’ s peak , who makes it his business to tempt and betray the human race
0	if it does , a great many people will be implicated
0	i had always understood from what i had heard of you that you condemned vulgar and commonplace notions , and had formed your own personal view of the world

0	according to thomas carlyle , goethe ’ s achievement was that he purged the incredible , supernatural elements from the story : goethe ’ s conception , both of faust and mephistopheles , bears not only far more relation to the habits of a refined and intellectual age , but is also far more ingenious and poetical in itself
0	bao-yu saw that he could do nothing , and might as well accept with a good grace
0	jia lian frowned when he heard the announcement
0	nightingale stood by , not daring to utter a single comfort¬ing word , for fear that she would say the wrong thing and cause further anguish

0	no problem there , said jia qiang

0	he ’ s to put the girls in the garden for the time being , and tomorrow when the master gets back we ’ ll see about sending them to the palace
0	jin-gui paid more and more frequent visits to her family , taking with her presents of money to pave the way for xia san ’ s eventual capitulation
0	the guests learned from this that both mansions were in some sort of trouble , and began to fear that they themselves were trapped as well
0	what have you been raving to that monk about now ?
0	i ’ m sure of it
0	no one would ever press you into it
0	that tealeaf may be a cheeky little devil , but there ’ s something in what he says , agreed the maids
0	just at that moment a figure stepped out from behind the spur of rock beyond the tailings
0	as they entered the main reception hall , a number of heavily made-up and expensively dressed maids and concubines , who had been waiting in readiness , came forward to greet them
0	there is one in the zhen family in nanking—i am referring to the family of the zhen who is imperial deputy director-general of the nanking secretariat
0	bao-yu made appreciative noises
0	you young people just don ’ t know what ’ s good for you
0	it was only the top ones that got one or two crabs to themselves
0	let ’ s all move over to sweet-rice village , then
0	well all right then , if you are sure you have nothing to say
0	in the scholastic tradition this meant any sexual activity that was not directed toward the natural telos of sex , which is reproduction
0	while she was wondering who else to get , wang shan-bao ’ s wife walked in
0	i am glad you are so ready to obey her
0	the three young women sat cross-legged on the wooden settle around the low lunch-table which had been placed upon it , bao-chai facing south , towards the doorway , tan-chun facing west and li wan facing east
0	bao-yu could not help blurting out
0	what brings you here , sir ?
0	i would , to possess this woman , / give my soul ( )
0	in no time at all we shall see you up among the clouds !
0	he saw dai-yu slowly walking on ahead of him and , judging by her appearance from behind , wiping her eyes
0	they heard a plop and saw the distorted image of the moon expand and contract as concentric ripples travelled outwards from the shattered surface
0	younger then and there wasn ’ t so much that needed doing at home
0	ripple poured him a cup of tea
0	lady wang saw that his eyes were moist , and knew that he was genuinely concerned
0	bao-yu having now taken his place amongst the girls , they and the rest of the company were once more able to give their undivided attention to the players
0	aunt xue had been working herself into a state of great indig¬nation with the old woman , and had become so distraught she could do nothing but weep
0	what can we do now ?
0	i was thinking of taking half a cupful to your uncle ’ s boy , said cook liu
0	if you ask for a hundred things , one after the other , the answer will be no every time
0	that applies to most of us , you know , not only to generals
0	this was the most difficult and exhausting part of the work
0	this is no time for false modesty , said bao-yu
0	oh , aroma , said skybright
0	bao-yu thought for a moment :
0	bao-yu gave her another shake
0	it seems such a waste of everyone ’ s time , to send all these things from here to the garden , and then have them brought all the way back , when it ’ s all in the family any¬way !

0	in the transition from the avarice of the morality plays to the usurer of naturalistic drama , the nature of usury itself influences the form taken by the characters , particularly the stage usurer , as he emerges from the allegorical vice
0	i really know nothing about any other reason , your lady¬ship , said aroma
0	this sally was greeted with a burst of laughter from grand¬mother jia and all the others present
0	he paid his morning respects and stood to attention
0	he sent me to fetch you a long time ago

0	isn ’ t miss lin up yet ?
0	she greeted them , and pati¬ence asked her where she was going
0	i ’ m sure i always try to show respect where it is due , but no one ever told me that i ought to think of zhao guo-ji as my uncleif so , how is it that he always stood up for huan and walked behind him on his way to school in the mornings ?
0	ah yes , now , let ’ s see !
0	tell her that i ’ m getting old and that she is not to be upset by what i said to her
0	he had to shout for some minutes and pound the gate till it shook before anyone heard him inside
0	i tell you they had it all worked out
0	i couldn ’ t help it , i wasn ’ t there
0	enough of this foolery !
0	a page hurried forward and handed jia lian a silver kettle of freshly-heated wine on a tray
0	the day yi mao ( wood + wood ) , com¬mencement of spring , wood at its zenith
0	now although i am no poet myself , i am privileged to live midst rocks and streams ’ and in the company of such gifted practitioners of the poetic art
0	bao-yu , she said , turning to her grandson , why didn ’ t you speak up when i falsely accused your mother ?
0	were yet more sound
0	a few days ago we were having a lot of trouble with mice , and when mrs pan went on one of her trips home , she asked her brother to buy some poison
0	her audience were already laughing
0	xi-feng spat with great force
0	anyway , they said , you can hardly blame him for trying
0	i really don ’ t mind one way or the other
0	at last mrs xia begged aunt xue :
0	before the reformation , ecclesiastical writers often regarded magicians as serious rivals for control of the metaphysical sphere , and the idea that witches participated in sacrilegious parodies of sacred rituals such as the so-called black mass suggests an awareness on the part of the churchmen that their own ceremonial practices were essentially magical
0	it is much more rare and precious than all the rarest beasts and birds and plants in the world
0	'your kind¬ness is more than i deserve , he said
0	dai-yu , brooding on her bed , had heard them whisper¬ing outside and had crept to the door to eavesdrop
0	you have only to ask mr and mrs zhen
0	it was lin dai-yu
0	but she knew adamantina ; surely a person of such chastity and pride would have died rather than submit to such indignity ?
0	this set the ladies weeping all over again
0	each of these two forces builds a heart that reflects the nature of its clan
0	come on , give it to me
0	it was others outside who started it
0	when he refused to listen , some of them resigned , others decided to stay on for friendship ’ s sake
0	if , however , we elide the distinction between phenomena and noumena , we will take the world as it is immediately presented to us as reality
0	he objected to the catholic mass , not because of its belief in the real presence , which he shared , but because of its claim that the priest ’ s liturgical actions had caused a transubstantiation
0	a famous philosopher wrote that
0	since there was to be no respite , chess , struggling to hold back her tears , made a last kotow to her mistress and said good-bye to the other maids
0	after sitting there very quietly for several minutes , they got up to take their leave , requesting aroma as they did so that she would inform bao-yu when he waked that they had been round to ask about him
0	labor is now reified : it has become a thing which can be divided , quantified , and exchanged for other things , such as food
0	your arnplificatio totius was passably clear , com¬mented dai-ru with a dry smile
0	what mason means by imaginarie time is the abstract , quantitative representation of human life that takes the form of autonomously reproducing money
0	may as well pull the wool over their eyes !
0	what has who got up to that doesn ’ t bear investigating ?
0	choose a suitable day in the almanac for travelling
0	grandmother jia , abandoning any attempt at self-control , was now actually weeping with laughter
0	come and have a drink then , said happy
0	you knew exactly which casket and which trunk
0	anyway , if you will tell your mistress when you get back , i won ’ t bother to send anyone about it myself
0	faithful slipped out and presently returned with patience ,
0	as to stumble into the expression of a desire that men should always continue in subjection to those gods which he confesses to be made by men , and to bewail their future removal ; as if there could be anything more wretched than mankind tyrannized over by the work of his own hands , since man , by
0	rong has been acquitted , so i assume that he will be set free
0	to be truthful , she said , aiming for another laugh , i ’ m but a clumsy body at the best of times , and having drunk so much , i ’ m scared of breaking this pretty cup you ’ ve given me
0	even if you are tho perfect yourthelf , i don ’ t thee why you have to go making fun of everyone elthe
0	my only wish is that men in the world below may some¬times pick up this tale when they are recovering from sleep or drunkenness , or when they wish to escape from business worries or a fit of the dumps , and in doing so find not only mental refreshment but even perhaps , if they will heed its lesson and abandon their vain and frivolous pursuits , some small arrest in the deterioration of their vital forces
0	only in those conditions could she get through her life without trouble
0	they can go through the garden
0	by way of emphasizing her point , musk ordered one of the junior maids to fetch a floor-cloth and begin wiping the floor
0	he was five days on duty there and not a single tip all the time
0	presently bao-chai strolled up and helped herself to the samshoo
0	please , i beg of you , don ’ t speak so loud !
0	she had just been telling the others
0	with that she darted off once more
0	yu-cun ’ s instant dismissal was commanded
0	swallow relieved her of it and brought it inside
0	a group of maids had fetched some water from the well and were watching the white-eyes in the gallery giving themselves a bath
0	we used to play level , but he always lost , so i gave him a handicap of two
0	his column of brass bade the nations obey :
0	take you two girls , now : we don ’ t know whether at this moment the two young men you will marry are right here under our noses or somewhere south of the mountains and north of the sea !
0	the huge continents of africa , asia , and south america , which contain the vast majority of the world ’ s natural resources , consume only a small proportion of those resources , while the relatively small areas of western europe and north america , which have far less natural resources , consume the vast majority
0	if there was no obvious external body of opinion is favor of usury , however , the very prevalence of the vice implied that some element within or influence on the collective psyche must have acted as its advocate
0	i know what we could do , master , though i don ’ t know what you ’ ll think of the idea
0	early that morning when she had heard him reciting the poem , bao-chai knew it was the memory of dai-yu that had inspired it
0	tomorrow you must proceed to the imperial treasury to receive your compensation
0	but what are we going to do now ?
0	he went on to say :
0	hoots of laughter from grandmother jia and lady wang
0	it ’ s our niece number birthday !
0	everyone else around here seems to go about with bated breath , thought dai-yu
0	in due time men built a temple there , and fashioned a statue of the saint , before which they make offerings
0	i must have another look at them tomorrow and touch them up a bit , said adamantina smiling
0	jia zheng replied with a detailed account of his misfortunes
0	aside and fasten the blame for it on someone else
0	and as for length of acquaintance : it was you who came here first
0	reader , you will , of course , remember that this jade was a transformation of that same great stone block which once lay at the foot of greensickness peak in the great fable mountains
0	her mistress did indeed seem beyond hope of re¬covery , and to make matters worse , jia lian had recently made it plain that he had no scrap of affection left for his wife
0	come along now , miss , what ’ s the sense in looking at things like that ?
0	ying-chun sobbed bittely while she told them this and the others wept as they listened
0	you know they did
0	bao-yu crossed his legs , brought the palms of his hands together , closed his eyes , pursed his lips and said :
0	what is a beautiful creature like that doing in such a desolate place as this ?
0	if you have to do these shameful things , she said , you might at least leave me out of it
0	when grandmother jia came in , she saw that the old lady ’ s face was wet with tears
0	i must ask bao-qin to call on you later and wish you happy returns properly
0	then tomorrow i can make a copy and send it to chai
0	the intervention of the censor in this case can be easily explained , countered another
0	it ’ s bad enough for a person in your position to even listen to such drunken filth , but to go asking questions about it , really !
0	a couple of food-boxes followed
0	all right , i forgive you
0	i don ’ t care who it ’ s for , said ripple , but if you won ’ t pour that water out for her , i shall come and do it my-self
0	i have a grandson , but that is not the same
0	why has it been so long since you last came to see us ?
0	but jia zheng ’ s feelings were running along very different lines
0	i shall have to begin my journey today without you to see me off
0	all this saving trouble !
0	the woman had come straight to xi-feng ’ s apartment and had not notified the main mansion of her pres¬ence
0	meanwhile a quite different thought was running through bao-yu ’ s mind
0	i always said you were too soft with people , said xi-feng
0	xi-chun had heard and understood bao yong only too clearly , and felt more wretched than ever as a consequence
0	dai-yu herself hung her head and said nothing
0	but you must make jokey jin apologize
0	nightingale also kowtowed to bao-yu and bao-chai
0	( ) here it is specifically the stampe or impression in the coin that is idolized ; hall wants to call attention to the difference between the inherent value of precious metals and financial value , which is created by the sign of the coin ’ s stamp
0	i just happened to hear joker and happy talking a lot of nonsense , so i shouted to them to be quiet ; but i really couldn ’ t tell you the exact circumstances they were talking about ; i should only be making it up if i tried
0	now off to bed with you !
0	but dai-yu now saw herself as bao-yu ’ s future bride , and felt a need to behave towards
0	two will be enough , said aroma , otherwise it will only get wasted
0	but that ’ s another story
0	we only came to try and help
0	they had not been speaking for more than a few minutes when , mindful that he was still convales¬cent , she urged him to go back and rest and he felt obliged to obey her
0	it wilted and began to die , but was revived and given im¬mortal life through the intervention of the divine luminescent page-in-waiting , who generously watered it with sweet dew
0	by chastising two unruly servants
0	what way could there be of laying my hands on some money ?
0	mohammed , to whom rushdie refers by the derogatory christian appellation mahound ,
0	if mamma is there , she will be able to keep an eye on things
0	just at that moment they heard xi-feng coming
0	if we continue to abandon reality and go chasing after the bizarre and the supernatural , we shall be guilty not only of unmaidenliness but also of losing sight of our subject
0	come up on the kang and have some !
0	she took my money fast enough when she won , but now that i ’ ve won she won ’ t let go of a penny
0	a table and chairs had been laid for li wan and xi-feng between the inner and outer mosquito screens which protected those inside the room from the insects of the lake
0	one we must consider good ,
0	we should be relieving our parents of an anxiety and having the pleasure of each other ’ s company at one and the same time ; so it would be a good arrangement from every point of view
0	lian , taking a laughing farewell of the old lady and her daughters , went out after him , he stopped in the hall again on his way out to admonish the servants : not to gamble , not to drink , and so forth
0	what about this birthday party he ’ s giving for uncle zi¬sheng ?
0	because of the seniority of this group , it would have been difficult for xi-eng to refuse them , so with each of them too she had to take a couple of sips
0	i ’ m only a slave
0	with greater fury than the plague
0	he ’ s the one that wears the thing - ask him , not me !
0	so if i didn ’ t eat this venison , i shouldn ’ t be able to write any poetry for you
0	bao-chai , listening outside , gave a start
0	when i was eight i went with my father on one of his trips to buy foreign merchandise to one of the western sea-ports and while we were there we saw a girl from the country of ebenash
0	i ought to have had more sense , he told himself
0	i could hear you coughing half the night
0	faust and don juan
0	it ’ s a good job i noticed
0	a few minutes later , when she returned with jia huan , the others pretended hardly to notice his arrival
0	two wooden couches covered with woven grass mats and embroidered cushions had been placed side by side at the head
0	there is only one drawback in possessing such charm , said the prince
0	they had not been driving very long when two horse¬men galloped up beside them , dismounted , and leaning into the carriage , informed xi-feng that they were now near her stopping-place , in case she wished to get out and stretch her legs ’
0	she narrowed her eyes at him suggestively , and her cheeks began to glow
0	as a matter of fact it was feng ’ s idea
0	aquinas cites augustine ’ s of christian doctrine here , and he follows that tract ’ s identification of the performative sign with the invocation of demons
0	if you ask me , you would much better pretend you have not heard about it and let the matter drop
0	i was going to send someone over to see how you were , but then i heard that you were feeling better so i thought no more about it
0	my mistress may be called the river queen , but she is nothing like your earthly queens and consorts
0	no one will come near the place
0	as if two dozen legs were mine
0	earlier , because of her hus¬band ’ s illness , she had only been able to come once to mourn for grandmother jia
0	bao-yu , you are very unkind to your cousin , said lady wang
0	i wonder what he ’ s after this time ?
0	why should you start being afraid of her all of a sudden ?
0	just get the boys to move out your boxes and bags for you
0	you ’ ve no father or mother or brothers : there ’ s no one else who will concern themselves about it
0	john rastell ’ s exposition of certain difficult words ( ) claimed that the deuteronomic statute permitting usury was made vpon like cause that moued moyses to giue a byll of dyuorce to ye isralites , as namely to auoyd a greater mischiefe , & for the hardnesse of their harts
0	the unitary human subject is predicated on , and in this sense created by , an ultimate , transcendent , unitary logos
0	she mustn ’ t do that , i am much too young !
0	see if you can exhaust the rhyme , yun
0	it is surprisingly common for playwrights to present sympathetic accounts of antitheatrical arguments , and marlowe ’ s view of such spectacles concurs with the antitheatricalists ’ description of theatrical re-creation as the work of the devil
0	a group of stewards ’ wives were waiting for her under the eaves in the narrow alley-way at the back to report to her on various household matters
0	from what they ’ ve been saying , it seems as if
0	what a disgraceful way to behave !
0	it wasn ’ t his fault
0	i ’ ve thought of something , replied bao-yu somewhat unexpectedly
0	said xi-feng as he was going
0	the next they knew , jia lian came running in , panting :
0	san-jie , too - a young woman who never did anything by halves - had continued as good as her word
0	if i hadn ’ t got faithful , how could the other two avoid overlooking some¬thing once in a while ?
0	dynes shows how this figure combines the characteristics of the new comedy ’ s servus callidus with those of the morality drama ’ s vice , but notes that the playwrights of the renaissance added a unique dimension to the character , an unrelenting distrust of the economic imperatives by which society was organized
0	jia lian accepted the money and handed it to er-jie to spend on san-jie ’ s trousseau
0	back in his quarters , yu-cun quickly hunted out a copy of the gazette , and having satisfied himself that the news was authentic , broached the matter next day with lin ru-hai
0	he said it was because the maids didn ’ t know how to do it properly and insisted on flying it himself ; but after a good deal of manoeuvring he could get her no higher than the roof , and even then it was only to flop down weakly again upon the ground
0	being younger and more immature than the other cousins , xi-chun was much more frightened by this visitation and at first seemed to be quite bewildered by it
0	as she was on her way out she heard lady wang say :
0	yellow satin , twelve bolts
0	what shall we do ?
0	never mind that , dear boy i ’ said jia lian eagerly
0	the breviated names of holy saints ,
0	besides , aroma has spent all day traipsing about with me , and she ’ s tired
0	horrified by the crudity of these expressions , zhou rui ’ s wife , who was standing by , was meanwhile signaling fran¬tically to the old lady to stop
0	when hermes prophesies , and laments , the displacement of pagan idolatry by monotheism , augustine adduces the man-made nature of the idols as obvious proof of the absurdity of hermes ’ s position :
0	no , we ’ ve had nothing stolen
0	she railed and wept
0	her young man ’ s rich and beautifully dressed
0	true enchantment , that is , magic is properly understood and practiced as a means to unite matter and spirit , while lust is associated with black magic
0	she kept all this to herself , however
0	delighted to have found someone who , besides being so amusing , had so evident a relish for her food , grandmother jia insisted on making all her own portion over to grannie liu and ordered one of the older women to go round with a pair of chopsticks and a bowl and make a selection from all the dishes to give to little ban-er
0	mann follows dostoevsky closely in leverkuhn ’ s encounter with satan , which precisely replicates ivan karamazov ’ s interview with the devil , and as in dostoevsky , the physicians who attend leverkuhn are comically inadequate : one dies before the appointment , one is found in the process of being arrested , another offers ludicrously inappropriate remedies
0	it didn ’ t go away until i ’ d brought it all up again , and it ’ s put me off it ever since
0	at the moment the numbers of their establishment and the activities they engage in are , if anything , on the increase
0	she insisted that those of them who had escorted her there should go back and enjoy themselves , and asked xi-feng to arrange for xi-luan and si-jie to stay on for a couple of nights after the party
0	magic in any literal sense , as was charged by opponents of his
0	purses and did them up again
0	she began to cough again and brought up another mouthful of blood
0	don ’ t waste your breath on him , replied jia lian
0	you ’ d better keep it on
0	drink as much as you like ; i ’ ll look after you !
0	but fourth sister lin ’ s reaction to the grim news was to gather her fellow-officers together and address them as follows :
0	if that happens and you don ’ t succeed in finding anything , i shan ’ t consider myself responsible
0	that evening he told his mother
0	to think that a cheap bit of goods like you that they only paid a few taels of silver for should come along here and turn the whole place upside down i the best thing they could do with you would be to marry you off to one of the boys and send you packing
0	you ’ re taller than i am
0	it ’ s your fault for being so comical , said xiang-yun
0	a boy ’ s proper business is to read books in order to gain an understanding of things , so that when he grows up he can play his part in governing the country
0	precious jade does come from a quotation , said caltrop
0	the girls cried with a single voice ; and that night , under the cover of darkness , they rode out from the walls of qing-zhou into the midst of the rebel camp
0	if in one sense early modern christians conceived of everyone as a brother , there was another sense in which they were coming to regard everyone as a stranger
0	if you ’ ll just wait until you ’ re better , you can punish her as much as you like
0	he certainly hasn ’ t asked for me
0	why are you being so industrious today ?
0	first he gave an order to his page almond , who was waiting there :
0	and by claiming that it has been arranged by satan , the king of hell
0	faust tells the emperor that he can not raise departed human spirits , but that the devils can replicate their external form perfectly : your majesty shall know that their dead bodies are not able substantially to be brought before you , but such spirits as have seen alexander and his paramour alive , shall appear unto you in manner and form as they both lived in their most flourishing time
0	but the play ’ s ideology is not christian
0	they deem it idle mimicry of youth
0	he and jia she talked a little longer and then both left for their apartments , jia she accompanied by servants bearing lanterns
0	but at present , as his master was away , he asked us as a special favour to be dis¬creet and not bother him with it
0	and my poor lamb !
0	the words a mirror for the romantic were inscribed on the back
0	i thought of bringing her in to work for me , and her mother seemed agreeable to the idea
0	i don ’ t need you to tell me
0	this is enough to drive a fellow mad !
0	perhaps it would be better if bao-yu took all the blame
0	she also promised to sort out all faithful ’ s private effects and give them to her as soon as she had time
0	dumbo , who was already a sheet or so in the wind , willingly complied
0	but there was little chance of a knock being heard above the excited laughter of the maids
0	today they have gone to the palace to offer their felicitations
0	any way , i ’ m sure you can ’ t really be short of money
0	nowadays i think more about what i say , and she takes offence less easily
0	why do you call her names ?
0	she tried again , smiling breezily :
0	though lady xing was wife of the elder son of the deceased , she was able to justify her own indifference towards the practical arrange¬ments with the handy text : grief is the essence of devotion
0	if you ’ d been born a boy and your family had been poor and un-educated people , i dread to think what sort of a calculating monster you would have grown up into !
0	no one would ever have guessed that i was her mother !
0	mr jia of rich street is here
0	bao-yu drank about half the soup , ate a few pieces of bamboo-shoot , consumed half a bowlful of the gruel , and declared himself satisfied
0	i ’ ve just got wind of the fact that someone at court is ill , jia she explained
0	the monk said the pills are £alled cold fragrance pills
0	when jia lian returned to the temple of the iron threshold , he reported t jia zheng that he had interrogated the men on night-duty and had seen to it that an inventory was prepared and delivered to the authorities
0	the very thought of it gives me a headache !
0	the liberal scope of the law on these matters was a con-cessum propter duritiem cordis , an exemption granted to the chosen people while their behavior was constricted by the law
0	bao-yu had not actually seen her ; hut he had formed a picture of her in his imagination and worshipped her from afar
0	she ’ s only a silly old woman
0	it was wang shan-bao ’ s wife who spoke
0	tan-chun promptly began to write down what she had composed
0	i ’ d pay a lot
0	on second thoughts i think i ’ ll hang on to them for the time being
0	i should think the likeliest place for them to be is the tea-room
0	they can keep up the seasonal offerings and sweep the graves at regular intervals
0	have all those souls involved been duly returned and entered in the registers ?
0	we must bide our time
0	the autumn moonlight through the garden steals ,
0	about half way along their road they came upon a group of horsemen riding hell-for-leather towards them who turned out to be jia bin and jia guang at the head of a party of jia family domestics
0	bao yong had no sense of direction , but he saw the other watchmen in the distance and followed them to the main apartment , where he found doors and windows thrown open and the women on night-duty sobbing
0	she must spend the rest of her days a slave to her husband ’ s will
0	here we are overstaffed ourselves , he mused aloud to himself , and the zhens must send us one of theirs
0	she caught up with him as she was speaking , and held him tightly
0	enough i ’ said jia zheng
0	i want you to ask your husband to chase after all the people
0	without heaven ’ s laws , my workings bear no fruit
0	as a consequence , what should have been a jolly , intimate family party was painfully unnatural and restrained
0	there is no evidence of torches or anything that would point to armed robbery
0	the rains this year were excessive
0	out of habit , a seven-thousand-year-old habit , shared by all mankind
0	for vsury this scripture i haue found , / of him that hid his talent in the ground , / and did not put it out to make a gaine , / as did his fellowes
0	the maid relayed this to the old women outside , cousin zhen was informed , an returned to ning-guo house
0	we must never mention it again !
0	what is interesting here is the close association of satan with the global market as the source and target of desire
0	if you have any difficulties , you can either ask miss bao about them or else get me to explain them to you next time you see me
0	this building seems rather out of place here , said jia zheng
0	the family and all the staff knew , but were under orders from xi-feng to maintain abslute secrecy , and no one dared disobey
0	the best place for enjoying the moon from is the top of a hill , she told them when they had finished
0	if his relationship with dai-yu was exceptional , it was because greater proximity—since she was living with him in his grandmother ’ s quarters—made her more familiar to him than the rest ; and greater familiarity bred greater intimacy
0	having first drawn her down into a seat and handed her some tea , she began , very gently , to address her in the following manner :
0	she ’ ll never catch up with you now !
0	the lively intelligence that shone in the boy ’ s every feature , his almost breath-taking beauty of countenance contrasted strikingly with jia huan ’ s cringing , hang-dog looks and loutish demeanour , and jia zheng thought suddenly of his other son , jia zhu , his firstborn , whom he had lost
0	a few minutes later the first contingent arrived : li wan and her two cousins wen and qi , tan-chun , xi-chun , shi xiang-yun and lin dai-yu
0	the consumer desires arising within london ’ s gallants and cavaliers caused them to raise rents and enclose their lands , which in turn drove the peasants to abandon independent agri-culture and become sellers of their own labor
0	what wrong had she done in a previous incarnation to deserve this lonely existence ?
0	by borrowing a bit here and a bit there he was able to get to¬gether a sum of twenty-four taels of silver which he made up into a packet and laid reverently before jia dai-ru when he took qin zhong to the old teacher ’ s house to make his kotow
0	this was beginning to seem less and less like a summons from the palace
0	the influence of witch trials on the faust-book go beyond the anecdotal
0	he used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple , permanent , reliable , and of one essence
0	the weakness in the line began with jing ;
0	t ’ other for ten a hundred takes agen
0	he told the man to invite the prince ’ s messenger to sit-in the hall , while he himself hurried inside and changed into court dress
0	still blooming flowers i see outside my window growing
0	it is a long story , said jia zheng
0	unless they ’ re downright misshapen , just about no one is safe from him
0	i said we should have to wait until pan comes home
0	he ’ s old enough to have seen a pig run , even if he ’ s not old enough to have eaten pork !
0	a language that is performative
0	you only say that to humour me , said bao-yu bitterly
0	for if the proposition be but particular or singular ; then we want other proofes to clear why it should be true of money , more than other things
0	take it back and throw it in her face , that ’ s what you ought to do
0	if i don ’ t get it right and make a mess of it , it will be up to you to punish me
0	the usurer ’ s influence reaches beyond the marketplace into the soul and thus he spoiles all with over-using it
0	what about when the men of kuang mistook confucius for yang huo ?
0	now i want you all to sit down again and go on talking , said grandmother jia
0	this time the count was more than the number of players and ended , the second time round , at li wan
0	i hate to think how much you ’ ve suffered on his account , mama , how many tears you ’ ve shed
0	and personally i doubt if mrs xue will agree to the idea
0	no more dilly~dallying now , or you ’ ll be late
0	you-shi and li wan , decreasing their call by a like amount , came next :
0	don ’ t try that sort of talk with me !
0	accordin ’ to them , this country ’ s crawling with jias of one breed or another , and a few days back there was a fair number of jia servants taken in
0	you haven ’ t had much practice
0	you can take it to her inside
0	i think even bao-chai is not quite as beautiful as her
0	stir them all up a bit
0	patience dressed qiao-jie to look like grannie liu ’ s granddaughter qing-er , and hurried out with her
0	i would be greatly honoured , she replied
0	yes , said qiao-jie , and bao-yu went on :
0	faust and don juan
0	although the story of faust was largely relegated to the popular sphere between marlowe and goethe , its contention that performative representation leads to the death of the soul remained a prominent concern in european high culture
0	they were arranged in a fan shape , with the two central tables in the place of honour at the back and the rest of them raying out forwards to left and right of them
0	we must find out what is going on
0	aunt xue found this quite heart-rending , while bao-chai had already wept herself into a faint
0	my own family ’ s dosest relatives are the jias and the wangs
0	art thou not made in the similitude of man ?
0	they can give and take a bit if they like
0	goethe also reintroduced the element of the satanic , and thus the explicit moral judgment of the protagonist , that had been prominent in calderon but faint in moliere
0	bao-yu used to go every year
0	her ladyship says she isn ’ t free today , but that if you will entertain them for her , it will be just the same as if she were to receive them herself
0	no man can put off death till four— ?
0	she searched everywhere but could see no sign of it
0	they begged her to be seated and offered her their congratulations
0	they were just about to leave for the second time when lai da ’ s mother , old mrs lai , came in , leaning on the shoulder of a little maid
0	if her own brother talks about her in that way , you can hardly wonder that other people complain about her
0	so do try and get better !
0	a cupful of cool water freshly
0	since father is dead , the decision is entirely yours
0	tell me , and i ’ ll send some¬one to fetch it
0	it happened that lady xing had come over that day to pay her respects to grandmother jia
0	you mustn ’ t worry , said jia lian , weeping himself
0	borne by the wind a thousand miles away
0	the last thing girls of good family need is a literary reputation
0	so i thought about it for a bit , and i thought to myself , well , it ’ s thanks to the masters that this great honour has come our way , so we must do what we can to show our appreciation
0	in the golden-grove ( ) william vaughan reflected that [ m ] oe gentlemen heere in england haue vsurers , banquers , and marchants driuen to despaire , then either warres or sicknesse ( ibid )
0	it is true , i have spent far too little time at home , said jia zheng
0	slipping behind the tall mirror and through the elaborately carved partition , she passed into the inner room where bao-yu lay inside his protective summer cabinet ’ of net
0	i think we ought to pick out a few experienced trustworthy old women from among the ones who work in the garden - women who know something about gardening already - and put the upkeep of the garden into their hands
0	why do you ask ?
0	whatever has brought you to this place ?
0	even we are melted
0	i remember reading in some old book , said bao-yu , that to recall old things is better than to invent new ones ; and to recut an ancient text is better than to engrave a modern
0	the day before yesterday i heard that one of the sisters at the hermitage had a dream in which she saw adamantina being killed
0	she opened the door and went outside , to discover the old woman , with a stick in her hand , chasing a scruffy little maid
0	as she turned her head to do so , she caught sight of grannie liu and smiled at her in welcome
0	the play ’ s eighteenth-century reputation is summed up by an advertisement from the same city in , which calls it a grand mechanical comedy
0	see where it flies !
0	she said i couldn ’ t have learnt them because all i do all day long is play
0	he said it was a piece of flagrant corruption and extortion on the part of the scum in the highway-patrol
0	look what i ’ ve brought for you , said jia qiang , full of smiles
0	i can ’ t think what made me forget ! —how ’ s your mother ?
0	i mustn ’ t keep them for my own enjoyment
0	you ? old aroma , mother
0	albertus is forced to recognize a kinship between his rationalism and mephistopheles ’ s enchantment , and this deals a fatal blow to his faith in progress
0	however , on hearing that xiang-lian had come , xue pan insisted on having him brought into his bedroom
0	he did , however , from that day onwards , discontinue all duty calls on his mother on the pretext of being ill lady xing and jia lian weresent to make the mandatory calls on her in his stead
0	the actions performed on stage were already alienated , in the sense that they did not belong to the person who performed them , but to the character he played
0	jia qin thought for a while , but could think of no par¬ticular enemies
0	but what then ensued will be told in the following chapter
0	there was certainly no question of his being able to remember them
0	and on top of it all , she ’ s a very fair person
0	knowing how generously you treat your staff , i find it hard to believe that such a thing could have happened
0	she greeted mrs li , then grandmother jia , then exchanged a few words with her mother and said hello to the li sisters
0	they were of one heart , one mind
0	jia lian nodded appreciatively
0	as in the odyssey , where she is able to imitate the voices of all the other greek women , euripides attributes supernatural powers , including that of flight , to the heroine
0	aunt zhao would have gone on trying , but just at that moment there was a loud crash outside which made them both jump
0	you see , she told bao-yu , even bao-chai and i know more about it than you do
0	go and tell lian to get confirmation of the news , and to see me as soon as he has
0	tan-chun would now be able to visit home , although there was no indication when she would be travelling
0	said musk , touching her cheek at aroma in a saucy fashion
0	i want to have a word with her
0	patience smiled and nodded :
0	shortly after he had finished exchanging greetings with them , er-jie herself appeared and made him welcome
0	but i ’ m not an object
0	there has been a massive , coordinated campaign to bring intellectual respectability to the notion that market behavior is the authentic expression of human nature , by applying microeconomic theory and related quantitative techniques to the human sciences
0	she thought crossly , supposing that the talebearer had been sent to them by nightingale ; while nightingale for her part was angry with aroma , thinking that the talebearer must have been one of aroma ’ s minions
0	there are plenty of examples from history : the juniper tree in front of the temple of confucius , the milfoil that grows beside his tomb , the cypress in front of zhu-ge liang ’ s shrine , the pine-tree that grows in front of yue fei ’ s grave : all those paragons of the vegetable world , mightily endowed with vital essence and able to withstand the ravages of the centuries , have withered and dried up in times of disorder , only to flourish once more when times were prosperous
0	qin bang-ye fathered qin zhong when he was fifty-three and the boy was now twelve years old
0	leave them to it , aroma yu and i don ’ t want to get mixed up in this
0	when it is time for you to see her , we shall come in and fetch you ’ ; and they went off with the other servants to greet their mistress
0	by the time the thirty-three days ’ convalescence had ended , not only were bao-yu ’ s health and strength completely restored , but even the burn-marks on his face had vanished , and he was allowed to move back into the garden
0	unlike satan , adam instinctively looks beyond himself , to the a priori conditions of his possibility :
0	i can ’ t stand by and let an innocent person take the blame
0	niu ji-zong ( earl , hereditary first rank ) , grandson of niu qing , duke of zhen-guo ,
0	she plied the maids with questions which they answered either cheekily or not at all
0	she flicked her long handkerchief as she said this in the direction of bao-yu ’ s face
0	it ’ s quite wrong of her to think she can disregard such things
0	being a sharp-witted young man who knew how to make the most of an opportunity , jia yun was quick to turn bao¬-yu ’ s jest to good account
0	mrs lin , will you be so kind as to leave now ?
0	how would you like to come and work for me and be my god-daughter ?
0	robert mason ’ s a mirror for merchants ( ) laments that
0	lady xing was afraid she might say something even more indiscreet
0	the postmodern condition has certainly had a deleterious effect on such notions as absolute truth , referential meaning , the autonomous subject , and on the logos that guarantees them
0	your brother has survived this year , and if he can only receive an imperial pardon and have his sentence reduced , he may still be able to pay his fine and be set free
0	faust also tried this at venice
0	money laments that it is mistreated by man , and defends itself by attempting an analogy : money is to man what man is to god
0	jia lian turned and looked at xi-feng , standing at his grandmother ’ s side
0	i ’ ll ask mrs lian about it later on , she ’ ll be sure to know
0	only xi-feng and faithful remained straight-faced through¬out this outburst , politely urging grannie liu to begin
0	tell her to be on her guard
0	it was a very different style we used to live in when i was a little girl
0	this year they ’ re not paying it at the board of rites any longer but at the treasury of the imperial victuallers ; so having first gone to the board of rites , i had to go from there all the way to the imperial victuallers to draw the money
0	bao-yu nodded his head and sighed
0	i will , he replied , and departed
0	ignorance excuses all , they said
0	xi-feng turned to lady wang and said :
0	he married a girl from a very old nanking family , the daughter of marquis shi , who bore him two sons , jia she and jia zheng
0	’ fraid i didn ’ t notice , said chess
0	how easy life was for the maids now that he was away all day !
0	dai-yu , it will be re¬membered , had lost consciousness while it was still light , and was holding onto life by the slenderest thread
0	he calls it the lamentation of doctor faustus ,
0	in fact , because the commodity in which he trades is properly the medium of exchange , not an object of exchange , he is often described as practicing a perverted abuse of natural trading
0	she took down a copy of tao yuan-ming ’ s works , hunted out the couplet she had in mind , and handed it to her to look at :
0	you-shi had always been in charge of ning-guo house , and apart from cousin zhen she was the only one of the family to have earned the respect of the domestic staff
0	jia lan handed the letter to his mother , who read it herself and said :
0	let ’ s see how he manages to develop this in his second stanza
0	you are well-covered like her , and they always say that plump people fear the heat
0	and the first thing i found , of course , was that the one doing all the accusing was actually the thief
0	chess clung to bao-yu and wept
0	he mistakes the devil ’ s representation of helen for the real woman , and his properly spiritual aspirations are idolatrously focused on this image
0	you have a cruel heart , miss !
0	we do our very best to serve you , and that ’ s all the thanks we get
0	she shook the bamboo-box of tallies kept by the altar , and on consulting the relevant passage in the divination-book read that the yin spirit of the south-west corner had been offended
0	the entire household , masters and servants alike , still waited anxi¬ously day and night for news of bao-yu
0	then later someone else told me it wasn ’ t ) ’ our side of the family after all - i was so relieved !
0	it isn ’ t pennies for a laying-out i ’ m after
0	she told the old woman to follow them
0	now look what ’ s happened !
0	you ’ ve got the spring in your face , miss
0	but now that you are bao-yu ’ s wife , i must tell you the truth
0	isn ’ t there any message from master bao ?
0	there were several entries revealing irregular loans raised outside
0	while they were doing so , bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by his cousin zhen ’ s wife that he had eaten at the ning mansion only two days previously
0	and now today he ’ s started making up to someone else and i happen to have found him out
0	the third day is much too soon , said jia lian
0	what two matters ?
0	there , in the light of the innumerable lanterns , all kinds of spectacles had been prepared for her entertainment
0	that was very thoughtful of you
0	motor of trancelike behavior
0	hearing what she wanted to hear , lady xing ’ s good humour returned and she proceeded to tell xi-feng what she had already decided to do
0	of passion and illusion
0	xi-feng , who had just learnt from one of her maids that mr zhen and mr lian were in a temper and beating the servants ’ , was on the point of sending someone to discover the details when she saw jia lian himself walk in , and was able to hear the full story from him
0	some people from the zhen family have just arrived there , madam , with a lot of things
0	as soon as her defences were relaxed he made a quick grab and snatched it from her
0	suppose i were to do some of it for you ?
0	meanwhile , in the xue household , things were going from bad to worse
0	to breakfast i to breakfast !
0	he sent for lai da , and told him to make whatever preparations were necessary for the funeral
0	then bao-yu asked qin zhong about his reading , and qin zbong replied—a full , frank reply , without the trappings of polite¬ness : and presently they were in the midst of a delightful conversation and were already like old friends
0	once you get a bit excited you are capable of saying anything , regardless of who else is around
0	just write any-thing that comes into your heads
0	back at green delights , aroma , seeing that the others had now gone , led oriole into bao-yu ’ s room to ask what it was that he wanted done
0	don ’ t argue with me !
0	just give a few strings of cash to one of the boys and he ’ ll bring you back a whole cartload of them
0	you shouldn ’ t speak about them in that way , you know
0	looking out from drenched blossoms pavilion while he was crossing over the bridge , he caught sight of his sister tan-chun emerging from autumn studio
0	xi-feng and wang shan-bao ’ s wife now conducted their little party to tan-chun ’ s place
0	ah yes , of course !
0	'it is not often that one has the opportunity of listening to a discussion of the operations of karma such as the one i have just been privileged to overhear , said shi-yin
0	patience burst into tears
0	xiang-yun was the first to ques-tion them :
0	hearing the laughter outside , grandmother jia eagerly asked to know its cause
0	only , as yet , in dreams of night appears
0	bao yong : it is not my place to say such things but i think the master is far too good a man , far too honest in his dealings with people
0	when he had finished speaking , the man took a stone from within his sleeve and threw it at bao-yu ’ s chest
0	in refusing to make use of that stale old convention and telling my story of the stone exactly as it occurred , it seems to me that , far from depriving it of anything , i have given it a freshness these other books do not have
0	i shall sleep out there tonight , announced aroma , and we ’ ll see if i talk in my sleep
0	that might bring him back to his senses
0	i wish i were dead
0	it was all i needed
0	let ’ s hear what you have got to say first , then perhaps we can hear from cousin lin
0	maybe not so much the sturgeon and the sucking-pig
0	you ’ re asking for it , saying such dreadful things !
0	but she dared not show her feelings in the presence of grandmother jia and xi-feng
0	the enthusiastic participation of the children in this butchery is emphasized , presumably to stress the fact that they have been cheated out of their rightful inheritance
0	unlike the loan of a house or a horse , the loan of a fungible is quantitative , and its repayment is figural rather than literal
0	jia rui thought to himself when the taoist gave him the mirror
0	if we remain conscious of the distinction between the natural and the artificial significance of things—between the serpent and satan-in-the-serpent—we will be aware that the world as we perceive it is mediated , and we will understand that phenomena are the result of antecedent conditions of possibility
0	look how quick caltrop has been
0	grandmother jia smiled proprietorially at the distant figure
0	they would do better to leave books alone and take up business or agriculture
0	the others thought caltrop ’ s plight a great joke , but fearing that , with cardamome gone , she might vent her anger upon them , they ran off also , amidst peals of laughter
0	the first proposition seems quite plausible , but the second does not follow from it as naturally as is often assumed
0	considering the broker ’ s mastery of such arts , it is no surprise when we are introduced to usurie , his nearest kinne
0	department op the ill-fated fair
0	i don ’ t suppose i get more than ten really good nights ’ sleep in a year
0	bao-chai acquiesced in the charade out of a sense of conjugal duty , while bao-yu in his moro¬nic state was easily manipulated
0	we shan ’ t ever have numbers like that again
0	there was a lin xiang-ru in the warring states period and a si-ma xiang-ru under the former han , said xiang-yun
0	yes , said bao-yu
0	she replied testily , and that i ’ m an interfering old busybody !
0	that ’ s the truth , sir
0	it must be that the zhens wanted to proceed with the wedding , and old mrs li had come to discuss some last-minute details
0	shouldn ’ t you tell mrs lian ?
0	a moment or two later , bao-chai was busy giving cal¬trop sme instructions when suddenly aunt xue cried out :
0	but though it is a year since i first brought this charge , no one has yet done anything to help me
0	lady xing and lady wang are sitting upstairs watching , said one of the maids
0	knight would clearly prefer it if usurers could be discerned by theyr apparel , and the idea that usurers ought to carry some identifying mark was frequently mooted
0	either they weren ’ t good-looking enough , or their looks were all right hut their characters wouldn ’ t do , or whatever it was there was always something wrong with them
0	he ’ s no fool , said nannie li
0	with so much material you ought to be just the person for making up riddles—especially as you ’ re so good at verse-making as well
0	from the tone of this reply zhou rui ’ s wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman ’ s visit ; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from gou-er ’ s father in a dispute over the purchase of some land , she could not very well reject grannie iiu now , when she came to her as a suppliant
0	perfecta and the other nuns welcomed her , ushered her in and offered her tea , and then after she had washed her hands they all proceeded to the main hall of worship to burn incense
0	in one of the most intriguing ideological processes of the period , however , they were compelled to radically restructure that framework , in order to encompass the new questions recently thrown up by economic innovations
0	but the fates have decreed her an early death
0	i suppose since i don ’ t meet with your approval , it ’ s hardly surprising that you should be dissatisfied with my servants
0	it is the only way of making progress
0	said grandmother jia with some amusement
0	i should never have opened my mouth !
0	ying-chun and xi-chun might have kept dai-yu company , but since they did not as a rule get on with her very well , it would not have occurred to them to do so
0	but it is not with details such as these that our narrative is concerned
0	don ’ t you understand anything— ?
0	isn ’ t there a verse somewhere , though your sins be as scarlet , yet i will make them as white as snow ’ ?
0	now , thanks to you , we have got someone suing us : so even the people in the law-courts know what a jealous shrew i am and i have to sit by as helpless as a crab with no legs while total strangers discuss my character and wonder why my husband does not divorce me
0	i heard that one of the customers in a private room had ordered some wine
0	you have obviously given the matter more thought than i there ’ s only one thing , though
0	ning-guo mansion on the nineteenth , lin zhi-xiao ’ s on the twentieth , widow shan ’ s on the twenty-first and wu xin¬deng ’ s on the twenty-second
0	this was no she
0	within it he saw a number of albums , and a thrill of excited delight ran through him
0	the garden ’ s chives are ready to prepare ;
0	when that time comes and you ’ re safely landed , she said eventually , you won ’ t want to have anything more to do with me , dearie—not when i ’ ve got no proof to show what i done for you
0	it was gloomy on his own , with nothing but reading and a little writing for amusement , but he refused to make use of any of his usual attendants and would have only number four to wait on him
0	it might prove hard to fold again
0	i feel almost like giving up
0	usury was an act of murderous hostility , warfare by other means , licensed against the peoples who the israelites were attempting to destroy , but unthinkable among people who had to live amicably together
0	in the loan of a fungible , a quantitative equivalent or representation of the thing must be restored , not the thing itself
0	how is mr zhen over at ning-guo house by the way ?
0	it ’ s sure to work - no question of that
0	does it , said er-jie
0	such treatment violated nature by making the medium of exchange into an object of exchange , and such an egregious assault on nature could only have disastrous consequences
0	i promise never to mention it again !
0	more puzzled than ever ( for what could she be doing here ?
0	but they could see he was not displeased
0	you will never find a better one elsewhere
0	bao-yu could not bring himself to obey the fairy ’ s command
0	she didn ’ t ask for anything before she went
0	observing that qin zhong ’ s good looks and gentle demeanour admirably qualified him to become bao-yu ’ s study-companion , grandmother jia was pleased , and made him stay for tea and then dinner , after which she sent him to be introduced to lady wang and the rest
0	you feel that she ’ s left herself nothing else to say
0	but she turned away and seemed bent on taking no notice of him whatsoever
0	li wan protested laughingly
0	he used to come in once in a while , but these last few years all we ’ ve seen of him has been his visiting-card at new years and birthdays
0	a certain jesting poet has written these verses about it :
0	the preceptor ’ s severe expression as he walked into the schoolroom did not bode well
0	a junior maid hurried in to tell bao-yu
0	the name meant nothing to ripple and emerald , who went on to ask about other matters ; but crimson knew it must be the young man she had met the day before in the outer study
0	possession then shades into prosopopeia , as burton deduces that
0	bao-yu ’ s heart was already thumping
0	the devil ’ s aim is to capture faust ’ s heart : my business is with your heart , my dear philosopher ; when i have killed it , your brain will function according to my will ( )
0	nightingale was already waiting with the bamboo blind raised for them to enter
0	now where would these have come from ?
0	fine clothes like these ?
0	come on , sit down !
0	i suppose you don ’ t happen to know of a good doctor , do you ?
0	put in a word for me , there ’ s a good child !
0	grannie liu , not a whit perturbed , good-humouredly joined in the laughter
0	which they received according to his promise , but soon lost it again
0	i suppose he was too lazy to make a note of it at the time
0	don ’ t start the day off on such a gloomy note !
0	faustus is proposing to discover the aristotelian telos , the end or final cause , of every art
0	grandmother jia set aside an apartment for them next to xi-chun ’ s , designated four old serving-ladies and two maids to wait on them , and ordered that their food and other daily requirements should be provided from the main kitchens
0	in shakespeare ’ s measure for measure , the pimp pompey laments that financial usury has displaced the sexual kind : twas never merrie world since , of the two usuries , the merriest was put down , and the worser allowed by order of law
0	it drives the plots of many of them , and it shapes his portrayal of virtually every kind of human interaction
0	there 's hair-oil , cos¬metics , incense , paper : every mistress and her maids get a fixed amount of those every month
0	just what did you mean by that ?
0	two members of this family have , indeed , fallen victims to some kind of witchcraft , said jia zheng
0	when they were back again , they gave orders for the tables to be cleared and a new set of places to be laid ; but bao-yu objected
0	if you stay away much longer , there ’ ll be a riot !
0	if she ’ s not feeling well , she needn ’ t bother to come at all , said grandmother jia
0	bao-yu arrived , therefore , to find the house locked up and nobody at home
0	you brought us the devil himself , so that we could witness the workings of the evil one , and his overthrow by the right ( )
0	his position is that only those instances that are harmful should be stigmatized : [ t ] he gain which he who lends his money upon interest acquires , without doing injury to any one , is not to be included under the head of unlawful usury
0	jia zheng remained standing throughout , and in¬sisted on waiting until dai-ru was seated before sitting down himself
0	as for all that stuff about immortality , that ’ s just a lot of hot air
0	he was different from other boys
0	grandmother jia knew that ying-chun must not delay her departure and she did not try to detain her
0	said the others approvingly
0	the image itself has no vertue to do harm
0	but as things stand , no one is going to lend us a penny
0	it ’ s funny you should say that , mrs lian
0	she invited zhou rui ’ s wife and zhang cai ’ s wife to be seated as well , and ordered one of the junior maids to pour tea
0	how can you still need to go flirting , with two such beautiful ladies as mrs bao and aroma by your side !
0	she found the sight of him carrying it both pathetic but also a trifle ludicrous
0	he was extremely mischievous and completely fearless
0	who have you got in there ?
0	steward lai ’ s here , from rong-guo house !
0	i shall wait for an opportunity to tell her old ladyship , and we will dis¬cuss what to do
0	the ferrit answered , i am satan , feare me not , my coming to thee is to doo thee no hurt but to obtaine thy soule , which i must and wil have before i depart from thee
0	i need a guaran¬tor
0	the older of the two already betrothed , but the younger is not and would make an excellent bride for your son
0	faith¬ful deposited the little package on the table , and sat down with xi-chun , while landscape poured her a cup of tea
0	let the younger women wait on us , said grandmother jia to lady wang
0	and xi-feng makes a disturbance
0	this evoked admiring murmurs from bao-chai and the rest
0	last month , replied perfecta , the household of the late excellency wang was afflicted with a possession of spirits
0	he turned to one of the old women in attendance
0	now there ’ ll be trouble , they said
0	what have i left to live for ?
0	she felt an in¬voluntary racing of the heart , her ears burned
0	if anyone else should ask , you will be quite free to say no
0	she ca not see anything of the boy , of course , but surely there 's no harm in her con¬tinuing to see mrs xue and bao-chai and little qin ?
0	how could you bear to leave me like this when you knew how much i cared for you ?
0	patience fetched a brush and inkstone for her to write with
0	that only leaves us a few days
0	yu-cun strolled out to receive the runner , who dropped one knee to the ground and said :
0	this reveals , he claims , that they actually believe the sign to be the
0	bao-yu shrank back and said no more
0	the front of the fan is yang ; the back of the fan is yin
0	i don ’ t expect you would remember me !
0	i don ’ t know what my poor old head can have done to deserve so much honour , she said
0	hang dangling about his pissing place
0	you can ’ t have failed !
0	trinket ’ s request now gave him just the opening he required
0	it ’ s getting really good i when are you going to give us a few sheets for ourselves , to put up on the wall ?
0	to count their money
0	then off they set , with jia qin on his donkey at the head of the procession , to the temple of the iron threshold outside the city
0	reagan angrily denied that he meant the term
0	the others , seeing that he was too drunk to reason with , blew the lamp out and settled themselves on either side of him as best they could
0	she said , addressing herself to bao-yu
0	he saw him to the study door , where jia lian and bao-yu were waiting to escort him out ( in the absence of a summons from jia zheng they had not ventured into the study )
0	for many generations we have done no wrong , we have not trodden in the ways of violence or arrogance
0	turn your maid ’ s offence into an occasion for making a completely unwarranted attack upon me , and when i bear your ridiculous attacks with patience , it seems merely t encourage you to indulge in further insults
0	and what ’ s more he refuses outright to live at home and spends his time fooling around with a pack of taoists somewhere outside the city walls
0	while i am away , i am counting on you to be diligent here at home , and keep things firmly under control
0	the priests in all their churches should preach with all insistence to the people that they may know this to be in every way false
0	he still felt that in view of his connection with the zhens it would be wrong to punish him too severely , and instead transferred him to caretaking duties in the garden , with strict instructions not to go wandering outside again
0	where was cousin bao rushing off to just now , all dressed up for going out ?
0	they won ’ t get away now !
0	here all his doctors , and his proctors , and his aduocates leaue him
0	as they hesitated , wondering what to do , they suddenly became aware that disenchantment was running up behind them
0	'what 's the good of flogging anyone ?
0	they climbed into their carriages and were soon at the earl ’ s palace
0	night¬ingale climbed up onto the kang by her side and , holding the cup in her hand , first tested the water to make sure it was not too hot , then raised it to dai-yu ’ s mouth , sup¬porting her head until the rim of the cup reached her lips
0	whether it ’ s big things or little things or pleasant ones or unpleasant ones , it ’ s only natural that you should try them out first on me
0	that was a long time ago , and i am sure he has got much worse since then
0	it has been described by judith butler : if the explicit claim that a promise makes is not only to represent an intention , and to represent it continuously through time ( i will do this , and i will do it despite what happens tomorrow or the next day ) , then the promise assumes that language can and does represent intention or , in this instance , will in a transparent , adequate , and sustaining way

0	xi-chun thought silently to herself :
0	there ’ s no sense in harming an innocent person like this
0	and yet xi-chun was unlikely to be enter¬taining an outsider
0	you can tell from that , she said , how much he must care for you
0	i ’ m going off to sleep , too
0	while they were speaking , a succession of different sorts of fireworks were going off outside : golden rain , nine dragon ’ rockets , thunderflashes , cloud-hoppers , and many other sorts
0	jia yun however knew that this was something xi-chun had resolved to do long ago , at least since the fateful night of the burglary when she had been left in charge of the house , and to him there seemed little hope in trying to dissuade her now
0	i spoke only in general terms , for your future guidance
0	the magician tries to extend the repertoire of performative representation to include , for example , the ability to cause harm to people by damaging images of them , or the power to effect changes in the weather by the manipulation of icons and diagrams
0	now master rong , he is her real nephew
0	soon after , when he was back in his own room , aroma came in to pour him some tea and noticed that all the little objects he usually carried about his waist had disappeared
0	who vnder colour of a friendly lending ,
0	by the second day of the month , the arrangements jointly agreed on by jia lian , cousin zhen and jia rong had been completed and mrs you and san-jie moved into the new house
0	i am a silly old woman !
0	quite suddenly , it seems that we are no longer talking about cold philosophy : an opposition of metaphysical concepts ( for example , speech/writing , presence/absence , etc )
0	i feel sorry for caltrop
0	it ’ s from merry , ma ’ am
0	lady xing and lady wang stood in attendance behind grandmother jia ’ s chair , with you-shi , xi-feng and a number of other jia ladies fanning out to left and right behind them
0	she made her way across the courtyard , still ignoring him
0	it ’ s because i made her look silly , said faithful
0	but that part of his mission is omitted from our story
0	poor snowy rushes retreat , polluted by butcher yun and her reeking carnivores !
0	accordingly it was settled that they should stay for one more night
0	faithful , i beg of you , for god ’ s sake don ’ t cry out !
0	this involves the transference of his human essence onto his own pictorial representation : was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on
0	cousin zhen inquired when these last two had been attended to
0	jia zheng saw how emaciated his face had grown , how lifeless his eyes were
0	said bao-yu with a laugh
0	she placed her next piece to link up with one she already had on the edge of the board , and then pounced on one of xi-chun ’ s pieces and annihilated her entire corner
0	trying to keep me in the dark , are you ?
0	the walpurgis night scene evokes the atmosphere of the witch-craze , or as faust and mephistopheles call it , the sphere of dreams and magic , in arcane detail
0	if each of us contributes what he is best at , and if we then select the better attempts and reject the ones that are not so good , we should be able to manage all right
0	the fish unto him came
0	what ’ s the point in my being alive ?
0	his efforts to identify the girl made him study her more closely
0	witch ( dancing ) : its more than my poor mind can grasp , seeing here squire satan again !
0	bao-yu looked at the brick-and-mud-built stove against the wall
0	it ’ s nothing to do with you , she said , smiling grimly
0	bao-chai angrily cut her short , telling her to mind her busi¬ness and pour the tea
0	they clustered round him as he made his way up to the hall
0	there they bolted a hurried supper and then slipped back to the other house , where aroma profited from the absence of the nurses and the other maids to take out a clean under¬garment for bao-yu to change into
0	you get up as well , bao-yu said to lovey , who was pushing
0	he was awoken from this rapture by jia she , who had had enough and this time left before his host had another chance to detain him
0	xi-feng ordered the servants to fetch a little bamboo carrying-chair , which grandmother jia got into
0	i ’ m afraid i was a bit hasty just now , miss
0	now that we ’ re all beginning to grow up , it creates such a bad impression
0	there was a whoosh !
0	you can have some easily enough if you really want to , bao-yu said
0	and in the midst of this pandemonium one of lady wang ’ s senior maids arrived , to ask if there was any news ’
0	how could i ever compare with her ?
0	jia zheng admires a mother pearl
0	if it weren ’ t for your help , ma ’ am , she began , pointing at qing-er , her ma and pa would have starved to death by now
0	as they were talking , grandmother jia and the rest of the family arrived back from their visit of condolence
0	she turned the cup round a good while in her hands and contemplated it with great attention before pronouncing :
0	don ’ t take it to heart so , miss !
0	surely this is a thing unparalleled in any former age ?
0	you ’ ll find each kind wrapped up separately inside its own prescription
0	liu xiang-lian ’ s conversion and subsequent disappearance , san-jie ’ s suicide , er-jie ’ s hounding to death by xi-feng , the grave deterioration in fivey ’ s health caused by the hardships of her night ’ s imprisonment - all these shocks and distresses following hard upon one another had eventually reduced him to a state of mental collapse
0	augustine comes close to equating these two forms of apostasy , and in city of god he ascribes their origin to a single historical figure :
0	he nearly died of shock , and made the most terri¬ble scene
0	if you like it , i ’ ll get-you one the same
0	inspired by her words , bao-yu bolted his supper , had his reading-lamp lit and sat down straight away to revise his basic texts , the four books of confucian scripture
0	you ’ d best be going in to see the viceroy now , sir
0	thus jean and john comaroff report that the elite class in malawi are suspected of having struck a faustian deal with the whites

0	let one of the maids massage it for you
0	the usual tonics are too violent in their action
0	i had heard of the charges brought against ning-guo house , said xue ke , but i had no idea things were so bad on this side too
0	we must see how she responds to medication
0	she managed to get as far as the gate of the courtyard without being stopped by anyone , but , not daring to go inside , retreated to the cover of some rose bushes and lurked there until someone should come out
0	if you don ’ t want either of them , said aroma , then if you ask me i think your best plan would be to get her to tell him that she ’ s promised you to master bao
0	dai-yu smiled somewhat scornfully
0	he described how kindly the prince had treated him , and took out the jade he had been given , which was passed round and commented on with some amusement
0	let me go and lie down in the jobs room
0	the first cause of every cause ,
0	talking of scandals , continued the same nun , is it true , what we heard the other day , that sister adamantina from green bower hermitage has run off with a man ?
0	do you have to embarrass me by reminding me of my youthful indiscretions ?
0	why isn ’ t she sitting at the head ?
0	and all night long a confused hubbub of talking and shouting and laughter arose , punctuated by the continual , unceasing pops and bangs of exploding firecrackers
0	ying-chun was hiding in a side-room and wouldn ’ t come out to see them
0	i have known of his strange destiny for many years
0	and open them on sundayes : a familist ;
0	if we assume that all one can do with money is exchange it for useful objects , then to amass a greater amount of money than one can exchange for use value is pointless , and crosses aristotle ’ s ethical boundary between economic and chrematistic activity
0	she split her skull open , the blood came pouring out and in a moment she was dead !
0	he continued to amble round the room , inspecting it in a leisurely fashion , and snowgoose brought him a cup of tea
0	for another person i might have been content with something uninspired
0	for pity ’ s sake tell us where you lost it !
0	attention to the lower aspect of the soul is thus not merely , as it was for plato , an internal alienation of the soul from its own nature , but reflects the more fundamental alienation of the creation from the creator
0	when they had finished , monkey stamped his foot and sighed sympathetically
0	finding himself once more ignored , bao-yu nevertheless attempted to remain jovial
0	she was moving outside , even as she said this , regardless of her mistress s injunction
0	i heard today that xiang-yun is going home , said aunt xue
0	it isn ’ t good to eat
0	caltrop has been using it to fool them with
0	there ’ s her sick inside
0	and now that i ’ ve lost the baby , there ’ s nothing much left for me to live for
0	what did he have to say ?
0	in the second of these the prince himself died fighting
0	then you have to mix them with the powder i told you about and pound them all up together in a mortar
0	among these servants was a porter by the name of li shi ( ten ) , who soon took a prominent part in the debate
0	we like to have a bit of law and order
0	be very careful with him , won ’ t you ?
0	the influence of dostoevsky is especially prominent , and in the story of a novel , mann recalls that under the sign of faustus , i was greatly drawn to dostoevsky ’ s grotesque , apocalyptic realm of suffering ( )
0	staring into the flames and nodding thoughtfully to herself , she dropped them into the brazier
0	what ’ s come over my staff ?
0	aunt zhao dated not say a word
0	said flowers ’ aroma , laughing in spite of herself , taking my name in vain !
0	to insist on the homologies between these spheres is not economic determinism ; on the contrary , it is a challenge to the very concept of the economy
0	i can ’ t say it to your face
0	lady wang served her mother-in-law with some tea before withdrawing to her own apartment
0	but let ’ s talk about that child ’ s illness
0	out of the question !
0	the contributions from her old ladyship and the other ladies are still to come
0	whereas if we space ourselves out so that he comes one day and i come the next , it will never get either too lonely or too noisy for you
0	dai-yu had turned back to see who it was
0	shall we fix it up when i get back to the capital in about a month ’ s time , when i have finished seeing my aunt ?
0	and the great booby began to cry
0	she didn ’ t know what to say
0	embroidering in coloured silks ,
0	indeed many tracts , such as roger bieston ’ s the bait and snare of fortune ( ) , appear to assume an easy familiarity with these arguments
0	the idea that all signs are performative is soul-destroying in christian thought
0	tea was served , and they began to talk things over as they sipped their tea
0	and i don ’ t suppose your present supply of paint-saucers and brushes is likely to be adequate
0	it was objective in the sense that it had real effects , although it was not itself materially or physically perceptible
0	li wan and you-shi exchanged smiles and glances
0	in no time at all the festival of lanterns seemed to be almost upon them
0	and of course give my regards to your aunts
0	she found you-shi standing at the top waiting for her
0	you will be able to come back later on nearer the time
0	it must be cold out¬side
0	cried the others , and began shouting for the older servants to go and look
0	bao-yu walked slowly up to the gate and , having confirmed for himself that it was open , made as if to go in ; but aroma held him back anxiously
0	nannie , nannie , have another look at him and tell us how serious it is , so that we know what to say to their ladyships
0	bao-chai wanted to look at a gawping goose , and i accidentally flicked you while i was showing her how it went
0	it will help having lian in charge of his side of the reception , too
0	how much nicer it would be than living under the daily restraint of my parents and teachers !
0	but nature rebels against this violation , and faustus ’ s blood congeals , drawing from him the protest :
0	all you need do is make your kotow and drink a cup of tea , and then you can come back again
0	she made a confused movement as if to rise to her feet , welcomed the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence , and al-most in the same breath said rather crossly to zhou rui ’ s wife , why didn ’ t you tell me ?
0	i can ’ t at the moment , said caltrop
0	parent , these are thy magnifick deeds , / thy trophies !
0	if possible we should get her to let them live in the garden
0	blooming so steadfast , fallen so hard to find !
0	in some cases it ’ s because the writer is envious of people so much better off than himself , or disappointed because he has tried to obtain their patronage and failed , and deliberately portrays them in this unfavourable light as a means of getting his own back on them
0	aunt xue hugged her niece , laughing :
0	bao-chai ’ s voice could be heard through the door-curtain :
0	the maids were eager
0	that doesn ’ t matter , said bao-yu
0	if there are vajra pills , i suppose there must be buddha boluses !
0	if a sacrament were to give me grace just because i receive that sacrament , then surely i should obtain the grace , not by faith , but by my works
0	as regards face , it makes no difference to me whether lady wang gives him everything
0	i never thought it would all turn out like this
0	you ’ ve not long to live anyway so just shut up and go to sleep , instead of carrying on as if your mother was dead , bawling at this ungodly hour !
0	the person who put my master
0	a chilly radiance bright , a fair round shape ,
0	how is bao-yu coming along ?
0	i really don ’ t understand you
0	i suppose you don ’ t know what he wants to see me about ?
0	you want him to die , don ’ t you ?
0	i ’ m sure she ’ s most anxious to give you all the help she can ; but you could hardly expect her to say so
0	furthermore , because so many people participated in small-scale usury , it was difficult to associate the vice with a particular group of individuals
0	i wouldn ’ t expect you to know about this ring , replied grand¬mother jia
0	we shall have her back in no time
0	you really can ’ t go on mauling me about like this all the time
0	he observes that money naturally ceases to exist when spent , so that the coins loaned by a usurer be no where at al
0	this time it was the crab-trees that occu¬pied her thoughts
0	but then it suddenly struck him that her question might not be as straightforward as it sounded
0	so i thought it best for him to stay here with me
0	she asked in a voice of horror
0	tell the kitchen to take as many chickens and other in¬gredients as they ’ ll need to make ten bowlfuls with
0	gracious goodness , that would be the death of me !
0	ying-chun treated the matter as a joke and rapidly dismissed it from her mind , but jia huan was very much put out
0	under that peach-tree behind drenched blossoms pavi¬lion
0	surely it ’ s much better ail round if everyone will give and take a bit ?
0	one shouldn ’ t believe everything that people say about other people behind their backs
0	ever since your ladyship was good enough to let me take parfumee home with me , said parfumee ’ s foster-mother , she ’ s been refusing to eat and drink and behaving like a crazy girl , and now nenuphar and etamine are the same
0	have you seen faithful ?
0	meant public condemnation and ruin
0	as moonlight mirrored in the water
0	i ’ ve got husbands and wives , said caltrop
0	after some discussion it was decided unanimously that the first meeting of the revived poetry club should be held the very next day , which as it happened , would be the second of the third month
0	she ’ s been in a terrible state
0	said xi-feng with a laugh
0	my sister has already expressed her agreement , replied lady wang
0	at once xi-feng came bearing down on her
0	although i am young in years and weak in body , i am eloquent and resourceful and possess unlimited magic powers
0	grandmother jia sat at the head of one of the tables with jia she , cousin zhen , jia lian and jia rong on her left hand and jia zheng , bao-yu , jia huan and jia lan on her right
0	soon he was very drunk indeed
0	i ’ ve just been in to see uncle zheng , and this is what he said : we ’ d like to lay on something grand for mother ’ s funeral , but although some people will understand that it ’ s her money we ’ re using , less well-informed observers may suspect us of secretly holding on to some of our own resources
0	some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the malignant spirits , some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out , some offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the heavenly master and issued under the hand of the taoist pontiff ; yet in spite of prayers , incantations , divin¬ation , and all the expedients that faith and physic could pro¬vide , there was no visible improvement in the condition of the patients
0	i gave the last of it to qin a few days ago , said bao-chai
0	i ’ m afraid she is near the end
0	if i find out that you ’ ve been lying , i ’ ll have every tooth in your head broken
0	jia zheng suddenly thought :
0	and besides , there ’ s a nasty wind at this time of night
0	a household like yours wouldn ’ t have anything cheap in it , she said , so anything wooden you ’ ve got would be made from a wood that ’ s not very easy to come by
0	excuse me if i have clumsily tres¬passed on your fairy domain
0	why did fate have to bring together a sweet child like ying and this monster sun !
0	your trouble is , though , as i ’ m always telling your aunt , you won ’ t think ahead
0	what was it about the status of a
0	jia qiang realized that the confectionery was a present for the little actress , and taking the salver from the eunuch , made mademoiselle charmante come forward and kotow her thanks
0	he stood up to go
0	bao-yu heard about the fracas created in his apartment by aunt zhao while he was at all-spice court visiting the girls
0	fancy her dying , just like that !
0	quite right , sir , said li gui and qian sheng approvingly
0	xiang-yun was struggling to hold back her tears , for she dared not show her distress openly in front of her uncle ’ s people
0	he sat there for a while
0	but gibreel insists that the good and evil verses sprang from the same source : it was me both times , baba , me first and second also me ( )
0	the total this time was nine , which meant that musk was to draw
0	as soon as he reached the moon-gate , however , and had placed its large protective screen between himself and the study , he broke into a run and raced ahead towards grandmother jia ’ s apartment
0	she made him turn his back and look away while she crossed her arms and inserted her hands under her dress in order to undo the fastenings of the dirty skirt
0	she did visit him once or twice , but he seemed indifferent to her presence and she made no further efforts
0	and at first , he describes his attraction to helen in platonic terms , claiming that he does not desire her physical beauty , but the inner beauty which it represents : if i admire your brow and your eyes and your long hair , it is because through these external signs called physical beauty i contemplate your intellectual beauty , your immaculate soul ( )
0	guy debord ’ s the society of the spectacle is an antitheatrical tract apres la lettre , and the most cogent exposition of the development of the commodity form into the autonomous image
0	but gradually mao impressed him as a man who knew what he was talking about , and when he went on to predict misfortune for cousin zhen , jia rong began to take him rather more seriously
0	i forbid you to let him in , said dai-yu
0	i ’ m afraid just now i was too shocked by dai ’ s state to think what i was doing
0	'go and fetch your father
0	with the money they get every year for the produce , they manage to keep body and soul together
0	as soon as she was back , xi-feng went into the garden to tell er-jie about these latest developments
0	all you can do is sit there eating sweets !
0	so she and xiang-yun and bao-qin each cut their kite-strings and watched their kites fly away , after which all of cousins went back to their own apartments
0	the prince of bei-jing selected two of the more honest-looking officers and a dozen or so of the older constables to stay behind , and dismissed all the others
0	is this where miss lin lives ?
0	oh well , if i must have a drink , fetch some decent-sized cups and i ’ ll just put down a couple of quick ones !
0	at this level , too , the faust myth has provided an appropriate vehicle for literary treatments
0	brought by xue ke , younger cousin of and proxy for the defen¬dant , xue pan , wrongfully convicted of the intentional homi¬cide by blows of zhang san , late of this county
0	she told me that he was one year older than me and that his name was bao-yu
0	i have just heard the good news , my boy
0	but unless that scripture take root in our hearts , where it is brought to reality by the heat of life , as it were , it remains a dead letter even if it be hung around our necks a thousand times
0	true , there was a time when i should have been scared to come , because people always told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you ; but now i know that in reality you are all gentleness and flin , there is nothing that could stop me coming
0	fourth sister lin was the winsome colonel ’ s name :
0	we can immediately appreciate how deeply foreign the concept of capital investment is to this worldview
0	ying-chun was asleep when they arrived and the maids had already gone to bed
0	it would have been a needless humiliation for bao-yu
0	and seizing bao-yu by the hand , he excused himself to the company and hurried round to the reception room in his own apartment
0	the dowager princess of nan-an and the prince of bei¬jing ’ s consort sat at the two central tables at the back of the hall ; the two rows of tables arranged at right-angles to left and right of theirs were occupied in order of precedence , the marchioness of jin-xiang and the countess of lin-an heading the row upon the left , while grandmother jia , as hostess ,
0	i certainly will , said the old woman
0	it ’ s all very well for you to talk , said bao-yu , mopping the perspiration from his brow , but at this particular moment i can ’ t think of any allusion that would do
0	she coloured and hung her head in silence while lady xing continued
0	not at all well today , replied lady wang on felicity ’ s behalf
0	postcolonial witch-hunters frequently fight witches by using their own magical methods against them ; the european and north american witch-hunts were , in contrast , designed to enforce the law that the devil can only be fought by invoking the aid of god
0	they were content that cousin zhen and san-jie should enjoy themselves in any way they chose , provided that they did not have to stay and watch
0	and it ’ s hard for me to give orders to their ladyships ’ maids
0	exchange for a symbol of that portion
0	aroma had not , on the day previous to this , openly criticized bao-yu for disporting himself at all hours of the day and night with his girl cousins because she knew from experience that criticism was powerless to change him
0	she was squatting down over here playing with something in the water
0	remarking that since the boats were al¬ready out they might just as well use them , grandmother jia conducted her little party in the general direction of amaryllis eyot and flowery harbour
0	just as the rumpus was at its height , you-shi arrived with a crowd of others
0	i shall say nothing of cousin huan ’ s conduct in this matter
0	do you know what made him ill ?
0	just wait while i slip over and find out what the mistress is up to , said zhou rui ’ s wife
0	incredulous , with one hand holding the lantern , he rubbed his eyes with the other and looked again
0	who ’ s that trying to give us a scare ?
0	of course not , grannie
0	your highness ’ s beneficent aura has preserved us from misfortune
0	it isn ’ t that , said xiang-yun
0	is miss lin asleep ?
0	he was weeping despite himself
0	i am going to tell great-uncle dai-ru about this
0	call our own troupe over and let them do something on this stage
0	i should become a monk , said bao-yu
0	considering what he ’ d been up to , even bao-yu ought not to have sided with him to that extent
0	and the board whose go-stones clicked the long day through
0	he was a confirmed queer and not interested in girls
0	jia zheng at once withdrew to fetch bao-yu
0	but if you will really keep your promise about these three things i ’ ve mentioned , i will promise never to leave you - even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry me away !
0	ngugi and rushdie thus both point to the postmodern degeneration of the autonomous subject
0	he turned to the assembled family and reproached them :
0	and , it is morally undesirable because it violates logic , being incompatible with the essence of money
0	if the worst happens , we won ’ t be able to get away for quite a while
0	buy another half a pound , woman , and put it in with the rest !
0	a noble and aspiring mind
0	the doctor says it ’ s bad for me
0	is no true test
0	the wake of the other two to see what they could achieve
0	not hang on to it and cry
0	if he should show the least sign of being a recalcitrant pupil , i earnestly beseech you to take him in hand , and in so doing to save him from a shallow and wasted life
0	bao-yu heard her with astonishment
0	don ’ t go rushing off in this burning heat
0	all i can offer you is this rosary made of the aromatic seeds of some indian plant
0	but tell me faustus , shall i have thy soul ?
0	so that is the truth of the matter
0	her old ladyship has been in quite a tizzy this morning , but thanks to the mistress , who ’ s been all this time humouring her , she ’ s gradually beginning to calm down a bit
0	however did they get them to grow so big ?
0	she got into her carriage then and drove back home
0	by this time bao-yu was already asleep , having dropped off as soon as his head touched the pillow
0	i only wanted to make you all jump
0	bao-yu had in fact written a few lines of one , but , feeling dissatisfied with what he had written , had crossed it all out and begun again , by which time the incense had almost burned itself out
0	aroma must have been pretty miserable on her own
0	you ’ re all afraid of him
0	patience was about to sit down when two women from the tea-kitchen rushed up to her with a rug :
0	the servants who were with bao-chai in the inner room heard this rumpus break out and came hurrying in to see what was happening
0	yu xin , said zhou rui ’ s wife
0	xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling , and again he went in after her
0	you-shi was quite put out when the maids announced her arrival
0	i just want the funeral to be done properly , that ’ s all
0	i ’ ve got her clothes and all her other things piled up over there , ready to send her
0	it was made with red emperor ’ rice , she told her
0	the sun ’ s not long set and the ground must still be very hot underfoot
0	when bao-yu had finished combing her hair , he asked musk to help him get to bed—very quietly , so as not to disturb aroma
0	the only thing is , it ’ s a bit late for a party today , but if we wait until tomorrow , the snow may have stopped by then and it won ’ t be so much fun
0	i was under the impression that you had been brought up in an educated household
0	that ’ s the old way of witchcraft : my apollo offers innocent aid with sacred song
0	tan-chun and xiang-yun stayed on at grandmother jia ’ s for dinner , and then re¬turned to the garden together
0	don ’ t you remember , the year before last when he sent me that white autumn crab-blossom , he signed himself my dutiful and affectionate son ?
0	she told nightingale to let down the curtains around her bed
0	i think she ’ s inside
0	now qi ’ s riddle is just a single word :
0	beyond the clouds there wafts a heavenly fragrance
0	having first decreed that they should dispense with court etiquette—which would have prevented the older ladies from sitting down at all—she took her place at the main table , while grandmother jia and the rest sat at little tables on either side , and you-shi , li wan and xi-feng moved to and fro , dispensing wine and helping with the service
0	bao-yu took it ; and there we must leave ’ them , for the ’ present
0	as patrick cheney remarks , not simply does marlowe link magic and poetry ; he also links magic and theatre
0	there is no need for you to send our wine over there , she told xue ke
0	on the contrary , i was saying it for your sake , dear
0	he was to observe carefully whether or not his grandfather was pleased , and having made his kotow , was to deliver the following message :
0	idolatry , magic , and commodification are parts of a single wider enterprise , which is the representation of human life in a symbolic , alien , and potent form
0	the usurer ’ s power over men ’ s bodies was a local instance of the general political and economic power wielded by finance :
0	the other day when i had to open the silk-store , said xi-feng , i came across a lot of rose-coloured cicada wing gauze in a long wooden chest
0	i ’ d like to have taken a couple of lengths of it for facing quilts with
0	but spottiswood argues that the story ’ s metaphorical imagery must be understood as part of its substantive meaning ,
0	such reluctance to give up trade secrets recalls the reticence of the magical initiate , and the producers of faust plays seem to have retained the sense that they constituted an occult craft
0	for a long time he sat thinking , but no inspira¬tion was forthcoming
0	nothing brilliant about it of course , but for a first attempt not at all bad , i must say
0	by rock and rivulet ,
0	fancy a grown man like him passing himself off as your son !
0	but they can ’ t bring themselves to economize or make any adjustment in their ac¬customed style of living
0	meanwhile bao-chai had persuaded her mother to come indoors
0	even though she ’ s so easily put upon , i ’ m surprised you don ’ t show her a little consideration , if only for appearance ’ s sake
0	why you little strumpet !
0	what i ’ d like to know is , if you ’ ve got something to say to each other , why can ’ t you say it out openly ?
0	having taken his leave of lady wang earlier , bao-yu had returned to his apartment , where he picked up his copy of the autumn floods ’ chapter from zhuan-zi and began reading it with fascination
0	at that very moment tealeaf walked back into the courtyard
0	to see you , grannie , and also i heard that aunt xue was here and wanted to pay my respects
0	if he felt bored , he would take a nap , and on waking would practise with sword and stave in the garden
0	it was originally to have been of the garden alone , said xi-chun , but afterwards grandmother said that that would make it look too much like an architect ’ s drawing and told me to put in some people
0	if zhou rui ’ s adopted son is involved , then everyone - from her ladyship downwards - men and women , masters and servants , is under suspicion
0	i was so scared that for two nights i didn ’ t sleep a wink
0	dime ’ s wife and daughter could see that they were wasting their time with him
0	cried the mad , lame taoist , clapping his hands delightedly
0	next it was the turn of nuageuse :
0	of these vngracious men i write , who hauing nothing of themselues , yet greedelye graspe all things into their owne handes
0	large size raft brushes
0	i ’ m afraid i can ’ t , said xiang-yun
0	i only said that because i wanted you to stay and have dinner here with me and the girls
0	i ’ d be embarrassed to take them
0	i thought that as master bao had nothing to eat last night- and as he spent most of the night tossing in bed , he ’ d feel rather empty this morning , so i sent the younger maids to order this specially from the kitchen
0	there is no worse species of usury than an unjust way of making bargains , where equity is disregarded on both sides
0	now you settle down , ma ’ am
0	you seem to think that you have only got to sit tight and do nothing and people will praise you for your virtue !
0	mrs zhu ’ s waiting for you
0	please don ’ t trouble yourself , she said hastily
0	oh , this one is ill and that one is weakly and the other is too shy to see anyone
0	as she came within sight of the water near drenched blossoms bridge , she saw that the lotuses were all dead and ragged-looking ; but the hibiscus-bushes along the banks were just coming into flower , the pink budding clusters making a brilliant contrast with the bright green of the leaves
0	under this she was wearing a short riding-skirt of pale-red satin damask lined with white fox belly-fur
0	you must have been misinformed
0	and do whatever he tells you
0	the things she had given away to others - pointlessly , it now appeared - had to be made good , in some cases by selling her own possessions
0	she ’ ll only fret about it ; and then all you ’ ll have done will be to have made her feel miserable for nothing
0	this is a demand that the matter , which modern linguistics calls the
0	so he ’ s decided to ask lady jia if he can have you for his concubine
0	i wonder what it is this time , said bao-chai
0	you get on with your searching
0	i ’ ll go and find out what they ’ re talking about , said bao-yu
0	there was a maid in attendance , and bao-yu saw to his surprise that it was snowgoose
0	aroma looked up , startled , hurriedly put down her sewing , and rose to her feet
0	by a stroke of bad luck some relations came on a visit and stayed to supper
0	thank you for asking
0	he knew how much the boy meant to her
0	if you want my opinion of mr bao , i think it ’ s high time we forgot about his reputation , and looked at what he really is
0	then suddenly you come along
0	the name on the slip she picked out was guess-fingers ’
0	in token of my appreciation of the noble way in which you have served lady jia and lady wang and me during the past year , please accept this cup of wine that i have poured out for you with my own fair hand !
0	what happened after that will be told in the following chapter
0	at first she tried to ignore the questions with which he plied her ; but he was so patient and persistent , meet¬ing her unyielding stiffness with such warmth and gentleness , that in the end her heart misgave her and a faintly pleased expression began to steal over her face
0	the whole idea ’ s a crazy one
0	that would guarantee what i call the indifference to harmony and melody
0	dai-yu ’ s other maid , snowgoose , was kept busy running to and fro for news of bao-yu ’ s condition
0	of course , he receives sixty pounds ’ worth of useless cloth instead of his money
0	and so , far from complaining , she covered up for mercy and the other servants and insisted that the service they gave her was satisfactory
0	there are many other thematic connections between the two heroes
0	i really don ’ t know what to think
0	at last there came the sound of some¬one at the gate and a messenger came in to report :
0	if she has , get the office to make out a good , clear list of the dates , so that we don ’ t have any duplicating this year
0	and it sounds as if my aunt li must have decided to bring her two daughters to the capital , said li wan
0	i know father does care , she was thinking to herself
0	she told felicity and a couple of other maids to accompany her , and sent one of them on ahead with a lantern
0	bao-yu was struck dumb by the fairy ’ s words and became painfully conscious of his own uncleanliness
0	we were sent some bottles of flavouring the other day that i could have let you have
0	please come in and sit down , miss
0	the stork upon the dam makes his habitation
0	so it is you !
0	some believed that the usurious impulse was internal in origin , some that it had been implanted in the mind of the individual by the agency of an evil spirit
0	her ladyship is a very thoughtful lady
0	lie down , lie down !
0	when he got to grandmother jia ’ s apartment , they had all
0	it ’ s waste paper she ’ s been burning for miss lin
0	labor-power , or as herbert marcuse put it , hegel comes close to the marxian doctrine of abstract and universal labour
0	it ’ s because grandmother spoils her so much that she has become the way she is , said jia lian , leering at them through bloodshot eyes
0	now this affair has come to light , the people involved must all be busy covering up for each other
0	don ’ t have it done in the kitchen
0	considering the idea of cooking outdoors a great lark , she entered into the spirit of the thing , and taking off her bracelets , joined the other two round the brazier and asked for three of the cut-up pieces of venison to roast
0	patience was disgusted by their callousness and reproached them bitterly
0	wine has an exceptionally fiery nature , and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be quickly digested
0	since the very first moment i left i have been longing every minute of the day and night to be back here with the girls , said ying-chun
0	subjected to such cogent philosophical and political critiques that few people would endorse it unequivocally
0	in the old days , when her family were so well off ; she never used to put on airs ; and since they ’ ve fallen on hard times she has been quite unshaken by it all
0	the pages were too frightened not to comply
0	as we saw in the introduction , augustine equates the mind ( mens ) with the immortal element of the soul , and the concept of the immortal soul stands or falls with the proposition that language is denotative
0	i ’ m only a common little wall-flower !
0	bao er and his wife could not do enough for them
0	the hebrews and the greeks concurred that to be made merchandise
0	and lastly , although we three officers don ’ t have to do any versifying , we should not be precluded from trying our hand at it if we want to
0	but bao-yu ’ s spirit had already quit its mortal frame
0	at this point , lai da came into the room
0	she snatched the paper from him and burned it over the lamp
0	the usher smiled again
0	musk handed it to him , and as he carefully wrapped the cape , she turned to give aroma a wink
0	the flowers ’ last fragrant resting-place to find
0	enough talking , said xi-feng
0	why don ’ t you get on your horse and go back home and tell your mother and that new wife of yours that her old ladyship is here with all the rong-guo girls
0	to cool his tea they plunged the tea-pot into a basin of water freshly drawn from the well
0	they were joined a little later by li wan , and finally by xi-feng , who stood in the bows and said she was going to punt
0	that night , when the young folk had finished paying their evening duty and were standing round her laughing and talking a while before retiring to their own apartments , grandmother jia asked bao-chai what sort of plays she liked hest and what her favourite dishes were
0	we can ’ t afford to visit
0	i can remember how it started
0	aunt xue greeted her daughter with a smile of surprise
0	however , owing to the present hot weather i did not like to call in person as the young ladies are outside in the garden a lot owing to the heat , and not wishing to give inconvenience
0	she turned again to the girl : another one
0	i shall be having my vegetables at home
0	she ’ s never cared much for that sort of thing
0	what are your poems to be about this time ?
0	who is this bodnisattva of the scattered flowers ?
0	but that has not meant happiness for her
0	just a lot of yins and yangs indeed !
0	i care for no other goddess but you !
0	again he was surprised :
0	to the yamen of the lciangsi grain intendant
0	it will be her own silly fault if she is ill tomorrow
0	interesting , all these coincidences , said tan-chun
0	jia ian , whose resolution seemed temporarily to have deserted him , let go of xiang-lian automatically : but xiang lian made no attempt to escape
0	if she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning , when she first started her courses , there is every reason to suppose that she would by now be completely cured
0	he hurled them from the pot with all his might
0	she would have been glad enough to go along with this had not bao-qin already been promised to the meis ; however , since grandmother jia had not asked her outright , she could do no more than hint at a prior attach¬ment
0	one of the thieves managed to escape altogether !
0	as to what followed , that must be looked for in the follow¬ing chapter
0	aroma could see that parfumee was extremely drunk
0	the garden of spices
0	just take everything i have—everything !
0	since the intervention of a benign deity was not to be looked for , the things of this world could be manipulated by propitiating or attempting to control the devil
0	it ’ s probably one of the servants , said you-shi
0	there is a line in an old poem i happened to remember
0	but aristotle is not trying to define the sort of person who is a slave , he is defining slavery per se
0	bao-yu sat up on the couch with his grandmother and massaged her legs for her
0	that is what her ladyship says you are to do , he said
0	although i shall be talking to her father , you ’ ll still have to persuade your mistress to send ’ for the mother and have a word with her , otherwise it will seem too much like coercion
0	and left it at that
0	she wanted to go to the garden to mourn , but was torn between that and her concern for bao-yu
0	i only hope that you ’ ll see to it that you are learning when you are meant to be and that , when you are not , you will be thinking about home and not getting into scrapes with the other boys ; because then you would be in real trouble with your father
0	come in , she told nightingale
0	i suppose it ’ s just that i couldn ’ t produce anything quite as good as river queen ’ s acrid-sweet line , or cloud maiden ’ s bare-headed by your wintry bed , or plaintain lover ’ s reeking head-cloth or few poor , tattered leaves , or lady allspice ’ s autumn guest in dreams of night appears
0	meanwhile jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband
0	a little after that jin-gui called to her to come and massage her legs
0	when xi-¬feng and you-shi had eaten , a maid served them with tea to rinse their mouths with and then with a better tea to drink
0	i make an occasional pair of slippers just for something to do in my spare time ; and if i give a pair to someone i particularly like , that ’ s my own affair
0	it is the purpose of signs , declares augustine , not to be anything in themselves , but to designate a referent
0	the ladies all welcomed adamantina , and she went up to the bedside , enquired after the old lady ’ s health and chatted with her for a while
0	forgetful what from him i still receiv ’ d ,
0	left on their own jia huan , jia yun and lady xing began to indulge in mutual recrimination , until finally one of them said :
0	this is going to mean a lot of extra admin¬istrative work for the senior officials at the ministry , and they wished to inform sir zheng at once
0	she opened her mirror and looked herself up and down
0	if this point could be carried , the art of magic as a whole would be discredited , for the most eloquent advocates of magic admitted that it worked through efficacious signs
0	this did nothing to lessen his grief , and he often wept inconsolably
0	dai-yu was about to retort when they heard someone at the courtyard gate calling to be let in
0	you people aren ’ t very resourceful , said xi-feng crossly
0	thus did the connection between satan and usury , which was both conceptual and figurative , provide a fertile field of imagery , as march ,
0	she came hurrying out
0	that has the all-spice touch all right !
0	your job will be serving tea and meals to the family
0	she did not answer him , therefore , but merely raised him up with a sigh and , wiping her eyes , addressed herself once more to you-shi
0	xi-feng ’ s sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little game he was playing , and feigning an interest she did not feel , she answered him with a smile
0	the witch-finders argued that natural magic was in reality a degraded subspecies of ritual magic
0	in this work , the flesh asks , [ a ] re none usurers but those men and women that occupy money ?
0	apart from the flowers there were only a few books and some tea¬-things on the table
0	though bao-yu was a married man , as grannie ’ s favourite he was allowed to join in the fun
0	as soon as he heard this , bao-yu twined himself round xi-feng and began coaxing and wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work on his study
0	she handed xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written
0	i just want to be alone and lie down for a bit
0	that ’ s why i was so long
0	i should have made them open the gate and not gone to open it myself
0	so after that i had to go
0	you ’ ve come at last !
0	wasn ’ t sister adamantina from green bower hermitage abducted in similar circumstances ?
0	jin-gui ’ s mother spotted it and picked it up to inspect it more closely
0	don ’ t try to fool me , said xi-feng
0	as the judge was leaving , mrs zhang broke into another untimely bout of wailing and sobbing , and he ordered the court lictors to send her packing
0	instead of giving them a lengthy description of the seance , xiu-yan handed her transcript straight to li wan
0	of course , jia lian hastily concurred , and withdrew to make his own financial calculations
0	i meant to try and find out who she was afterwards , but i forgot
0	i ’ ll come over with some this evening then
0	so saying , he took from his satchel a mirror which had reflecting surfaces on both its sides
0	i admit i was in the wrong ; but if you tell me what to do , i ’ m willing to learn
0	for they doe not meane to doe any thing by the divell
0	that must have been at least two months ago
0	on the twenty-second of the second month everyone moved in
0	i meant no harm , said nightingale
0	xi-feng stared thoughtfully for a moment
0	both the white in the claws and the pink in the shell ;
0	where have you come from ?
0	i don ’ t see why you used that image when there is a much better one to hand
0	bao-yu was greatly relieved
0	aunt xue herself , when she wit¬nessed bao-yu ’ s pitiful condition , began to regret having ever given her consent , and could only bring herself to play a perfunctory part in the proceedings
0	the girls and i are always holding each other and pulling each other about , so that ifi were wearing a thing like this , it would very quickly get noticed , and what should i feel like then , if one of the girls or one of the maids were to look at it ?
0	from what i ’ ve seen of it , he ’ s all right with you when you allow him to be ; it ’ s because you ’ re so prickly with him and always trying to put him in the wrong that he gets worked up
0	bao-yu laughed : why ever should i do that ?
0	the two men stood in stiffly deferential attitudes beside her while she drank some , then , having completed their little pantomime , resumed their places
0	where time is lost in one eternal spring
0	just listen to that !
0	such as the hot whore , the courtesans innumerable , alexander ’ s paramour and helen herself but , as deats remarks , these represent male fantasies of the female rather than either gender principles or actual women
0	let us rather consider how this case is to be settled !
0	yourself impure , shall end up in the mud
0	that would save you the trouble of arranging it yourself and also avoid the danger of your forgetting
0	'he said no one had ever approached him about breaking off the engagement
0	he drew closer to her ear and went on in a lower voice
0	i ’ ve never seen any before
0	we have more players than we need , so i thought we might as well let them have a troupe to themselves
0	it must have been fated that i should do so
0	may god 's lightning strike you and the devils tear your carcase !
0	he stood and gazed at the tree
0	li gui thought for a moment
0	bao-yu asked for his watch and looked
0	suppose i was at your place and some of your people insulted me ?
0	he was somewhat surprised when xiang-lian merely bowed to the old lady instead of making her a kotow and addressed her formally as mrs you ’
0	i know how you bully the gentle ones
0	there ’ s no point in your giving him a lot of things he won ’ t be able to eat
0	tell her that the pain is a little better than it was and that she is not to worry
0	i should be so pleased to know a little about his family
0	two ’ makes my riddle with a man and tree :
0	i ’ ve come to ask you what you ’ ve done with one of our teacups , said the woman , and you ask me about your mistress !
0	if ever you want any¬thing here , contact me
0	but when faithful and the maids came trooping up , it was more than flesh and blood could bear and she begged to be excused
0	if all the men of old had been hermits like those four you mention , then there would never have been sages like yao , shun , the duke of zhou and confucius
0	his wife and daughter dismissed his threats as the ravings of a drunkard , and early the next morning dime set off once more for his gambling haunts , where we must leave him
0	please calm yourself , mother
0	nuageuse , too , stood up and attempted to push him back into his seat :
0	xi-feng had what was left on the four dishes heaped together onto two of them and put into a single box , and sent it over to the lotus pavilion for élégante and the eleven other little actresses to eat
0	she ’ s ill she ’ s having to take medicine , he said
0	if she does , i must be sure to ask her where she has gone , so that i can make offerings to her regularly
0	what ’ s been keeping you all this time ?
0	the name of this unpromising youth was , as joker had said , zhang hua
0	there was a cry of yes ma ’ am ’ from the assembled maids , and two of them went off to do her bidding
0	her old ladyship ’ s funeral has been placed entirely in your hands and mr lian ’ s , sobbed faithful
0	that makes you much the closer kin
0	just now mrs xue was trying to get hold of mrs lian and they told her that she was in the garden
0	just right for this time of year , too
0	it ’ s quite simple , said monkey with a laugh
0	i ’ m supposed to go along like an innocent and eat and drink myself silly so that next day i can be made to foot the bill
0	i heard that you were having a family share-out , uncle , so i came along without waiting to be called
0	it ’ s only natural that we should suspect moonbeam , but they might ask what moonbeam would have stood to gain by poisoning her own mistress
0	xiang-yun , gazing up at the moon , also nodded
0	though good , yet having no memorial ?
0	what a wil¬derness it has become in that time !
0	why can ’ t you tell me ?
0	says that there are some gods made by the supreme god , and some made by men
0	there was nothing exceptionable in her behaviour or appearance on the occasion when he saw her : she seemed to be just the same sort of delicate , flowerlike creature as all the other girls
0	the others looked at him open-mouthed :
0	this put your brother in a bit of a spot
0	by the seventeenth of the first month , when lady wang was expecting her brother to arrive in the capital any day , she had an unannounced visit from xi-feng :
0	see if they know any more about it
0	but by the time he had finished saying this , shi-yin was already out of the study and on his way to the guest-room
0	how can you be so
0	the problem for him arises when an insubstantial , quantitative concept is used to divide a substantial , qualitative object , as when time is measured by money
0	the letter was full of tales of woe of one sort or another , and enclosed fifty taels of silver
0	xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something , and called to him through the window , rong , come back !
0	but cooped up as he was in his room , his depression grew almost intolerable and he began to suffer from his old fits again
0	she has young ke living with her now
0	no , of course not ; that ’ s why i ’ m reading it
0	to some place , where they celebrate strange rites with others , which is not only forbidden to be done , but even to be believed in
0	these things are there for our use
0	he also slipped bao er some money of his own and consoled him with a promise that he would pick a good wife for him at the earliest opportunity to replace the one he had just lost
0	it ’ s aventurin , she said , giving parfumee the name that bao-yu had insisted on
0	all his thought was on his writing , he meant he had made it too filthy in writing it with his owne blood ( )
0	thomas taylor shows a clear understanding of this connection between economic and liturgical fetishism when he asks the anglicans : do you indeed believe , as in words you say , that you regenerate the little infant , by sprinkling a little water on its face , and speaking a few
0	he will have it go on , and take for time , that was never his to sell : yet he will have use for all his money , for all the time he prayed , heard sermons , received the communion : for all the time of eating sleeping & c when , nor he nor his client could or ought to be otherwise busied
0	i ’ ll just say that lady jia wants a word with her , hire a carriage , and bring her along myself
0	some of the servants decided to take advantage of the situation and replied :
0	caltrop had persuaded herself that when there was another woman in the house - someone who would take a share of the responsibilities and whose authority she herself could fall back on - life would be somehow easier for her than it was at present
0	faithful now came over to say that dinner was ready
0	perfumed was the dust that fell
0	those two little words since when particularly intrigue me
0	miss lin is back !
0	it ’ s the devil who wins
0	alarmed , but not daring to make a sound , jia rui stealthily crept out and tried it
0	that only leaves the old lady to square , and you should be able to do that easily enough with a bit of coaxing
0	they would have gone to inform the ladies , but were afraid of a repetition of the last occasion , when xi¬feng had rebuked them for creating a false alarm
0	under his supervision a team of pages set up a number of framework stands in the courtyard on which fireworks were then fastened or hung
0	oriole cheated me and bao-yu turned me out
0	someone must have gone gossiping to lady wang , or she would never have dealt with the poor girl so harshly and driven her to such an early death
0	bao-yu visited her whenever he could after school , but although there were a million things she wanted to tell him , her consciousness that they were no longer children inhibited her from showing her affection by teasing him in the old way , and rendered her powerless to express what was preying on her mind
0	i think we ’ d better take another little turn in the boats now , and then it will be just about time to go and have our drinks
0	along the face of each mould were rows of very finely cut dies , each about the size of a bean , thirty or forty on each mould
0	it ’ s not for the likes of me to get into rages
0	i ’ ve got the rice accounts to go over ; i ’ ve got to see lady xing about something ( number don ’ t know what , but she ’ s just sent over to say that she wants me ) ; and i ’ ve got the new year ’ s clothes to see about
0	it was already lighting-up time when they got there , but the courtyard gate was still open
0	as i said before , in actuall things there must be a substantiall , naturall , and present diuidend and diuisor , numerator , and denominator , as in these examples are apparant
0	the feeble force that was life ’ s starting point
0	of course she will !
0	if you stay up any longer , you ’ ll have rings under your eyes in the morning , and that will never dot ’
0	if i were to eat any , i should be afraid of some frightful nemesis overtaking me
0	memories of xi-feng ’ s cruelty still rankled in jia huan ’ s mind ; and with jia lian away , he was more than ready to vent some of his spleen on qiao-jie
0	oh please save me !
0	tell them to slaughter some fresh meat for her dinner
0	nightingale sat down companionably at his side
0	whetra you jus ’ come from ?
0	and golden shows an unconquerable spirit by ending her
0	the things his mother had charged the maids with showed so uncanny a knowledge of even his most intimate conversations with them that there seemed little point in denial
0	grandmother jia laughed too , though trying her hardest to sound cross
0	so aunt zhao , who had been so cock-a-hoop when she came , had got nothing for her pains but a smutty nose
0	one form of autonomously reproductive symbolic labor power gains legitimacy at the expense of the other
0	left on her own , she sank onto her couch in tears
0	what ’ s the good of being alive ?
0	the two girls and bao-yu saw xiang-yun as far as the inner gate
0	i had been meaning to ask her for some , but as i haven ’ t had any trouble with my own cheeks this year , i forgot about it
0	she ’ s got or nothing at all
0	the realization that what he was about to say was probably something that ought not to be said caused the words to stick in his throat
0	one of the two maids , who had now been persuaded to resume their duties , came over from the kitchen to wait on them
0	talk of the devil !
0	the prince ’ s aide took his leave
0	he bellowed at the unfortu¬nate boy
0	shortly afterwards jia lan returned with a broad smile on his face :
0	you-shi called in at xi-feng ’ s place to chat , but finding xi-feng too much out of sorts for conversation , went into the garden to talk to li wan and the girls
0	let him drink his tea first
0	i only want to do it to keep myself occupied anyway
0	unable to contain herself any longer , she burst out angrily
0	with the arrival of strangers , silver had been obliged to drop the bantering tone she had begun to adopt with bao-yu and stood , holding the soup-bowl in both her hands , listening in silence
0	what do you all think of lady all-spice ?
0	the thieves and robbers introduce themselves by listing the commodities they own , and the master of ceremonies declares that it is not easy to recognize a man without his car
0	by the way , it ’ s the sixteenth today
0	no sooner had her mother said this than she took a run at the wall and dashed her head against it
0	if you see the others in difficulties , you must lend a hand
0	dostoevsky had already depicted the effects of this doctrine in figures like raskolnikov , and in the geneology of morals nietzsche called dostoevsky the only psychologist
0	she ’ s certainly not in the least like huan
0	some said that their parents were alive but did not care for them
0	how can i look you and auntie in the face again ?
0	bao-qin had sent for her kite , a large red bat , and bao-chai , beginning to share the excitement herself , had had hers fetched too : it was a line of seven large geese flying one behind the other
0	good one , the self of the slave that he constructs in opposition to the
0	done , in short , to ensure that the security of the mansion was maintained
0	we have some , said bao-yu , and quickly ordered a kettle of special mimosa-flavoured samshoo to be heated for her
0	a growl of disapproval rippled through the ranks of the court underlings
0	words from the western chamber ’ supply
0	may my mouth rot and my tongue decay if i dot ’
0	i know nightingale is a bright girl and will understand what i mean
0	none of these seemed conclusive
0	this place here is not convenient
0	the prince told two more junior eunuchs to accompany him out , he rejoined the other members of the family , and they all returned home
0	bao-yu was keen to hear the whole story
0	where have you been , missus ?
0	the rules of drinking are as strict as the rules of war
0	bao-yu was beside himself with joy
0	in the end he decided that perhaps the best thing would be simply to ask for his pledge back
0	but still , we have rather played into moonbeam ’ s hands
0	i think some of your young ladies could do with a good talking-to , said dai-yu , —though it ’ s not really for me to say so
0	don ’ t worry , mrs zhu !
0	it will have to be the seventh
0	i ’ d gladly die if i could only spend one day with master ke !
0	grandmother j ia and lady wang agreed that her pro¬posal was a good one , and said :
0	the twenty-four little buddhist and taoist nuns having now been moved out of the two miniature temples in the garden , jia zheng had been thinking of dispersing them among various temples and convents about the city , when a certain zhou-shi , the widow of a poor relation of the rong-guo jias who lived near by in north dukes street , chanced to get wind of this matter and saw in it the possibility of some employment
0	take that one there - all i can make numberut is hook , with big on top and five in the middle
0	tan is one of the very best of us
0	this latter is the magic of circe and bacchus , which kills the soul and turns men into beasts , as opposed to that of orpheus and apollo , which vivifies dead matter
0	cousin zhen had of late been feeling far from well
0	and the ailing naiad , in a nightmare , confronts the
0	patience was about to answer when there was a laugh from behind the rocks on which they were sitting and a voice called out
0	if you will go on talking like that , how can you possibly get better ?
0	asserts that there is nothing outside of representation ; as jacques derrida put it , il n ’ y pas de hor- texte
0	and a cypress-smoked siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from siam
0	ning-guo house has been set in order , said cousin zhen , and with your consent we intend to take up residence there again
0	jia zheng ’ s previous experience as an official had been mainly in the capital , and had been restricted moreover to the theoretical aspects of the metropolitan bureaucracy
0	if you ’ d weakened and coughed up the fifty taels , she ’ d have been quite willing to go halves with me and pocket twenty-five of them herself ; but having gauged that you probably won ’ t , she adopts a holier-than-thou attitude and makes an example of me , even though she was the one who suggested it
0	at first i thought it was the priory , replied patience
0	mrs lian was worried , and sent me to see how things were
0	not long after that came news of ying-chun ’ s wedding , and bao-yu realized with a pang that the affectionate , brother-and-sister-like relationship of their childhood years was now at an end : from now on , even if they ever met , they would have to be formal and distant with each other
0	and young feng is really to be pitied !
0	these sort of gewgaws are really for the daughters of mandarins and noblemen
0	don ’ t imagine it ’ s enough for a funeral if people dress in mourning and keep the wake
0	there ’ s no need for you to come in with me
0	he reflected to himself
0	blurted out the old woman at last
0	you ’ re the ones who caused this trouble in the first place
0	many and many ’ s the time i have given you a look or made some sign to warn you , but you never notice
0	i was pretty fed up , that caltrop should be thought important enough for me to have to wait on her
0	tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is immaterial , said grandmother jia , as long as it gets done
0	she ’ s always thinking about you and meaning to pay a call , but when it ’ s come to it , she just hasn ’ t been able to get out
0	i fed the birds when you were still fast asleep in bed
0	those words mean nothing to me now
0	concerned about the fate of a few entertainers
0	nowadays her father worked as a farm-bailiff on the family ’ s estates
0	the bed-curtains were drawn back a few inches and er-jie thrust her head out through the slit
0	the first thing he did on arrival was to go and look at the autumn crab-flowers
0	bao-chai obliged ; and when she had finished reciting the divination verse for him , she commented :
0	he said with a smile
0	where is he , anyway ?
0	she said they don ’ t really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office
0	we work for mrs zhu and i won ’ t be called a thief !
0	she smiled when he said this
0	the woman threw the bits of paper to the ground and addressed herself beseechingly to bao-yu , a sickly smile on her face :
0	just then her little maid advent came up to tell her that bao-qin wanted to talk to her
0	i had a terrible job finding it
0	i didn ’ t say anything
0	and inspires bitter resentment
0	yu-cun went first to the palace to report on his tour , and then returned to his yamen , where daily business soon engulfed him
0	the devil responds : he but woke one / in those he spake to with his forky tongue
0	trust you for sound planning , mother !
0	in the part of the room below the kang there was a row of four big chairs against the east wall
0	she ran off on her way
0	there were tears on her cheeks as she bent down and raised the girl to her feet
0	there were lights burning everywhere and hardly anyone slept at all
0	i did go to the counting-house , sir , said yu lu , but since sir jing passed away they have already paid out so much that they ’ ve barely got enough left to pay for the hundred days services and the expenses of your stay here in the temple
0	i know your auntie huang , jokey jin !
0	we learn that he arrived in london in a state of destitution , but that he has enriched himself beyond the dreams of avarice through his unri-valled ability to cozen naïve country gentlemen
0	it isn ’ t very convenient , talking about it in here
0	the internal constellation is not the lifeless thing—
0	xue pan stamped his foot and shouted at jin-gui despair¬ingly
0	we are invited to consider the relationship between faust and his familiar in the pictorial terms used by our ancestors ; the opening line of this scene is mephistopheles ’ s inquiry to faust do you not wish you had a broomstick ?
0	since early youth aroma had always been aware that bao-yu ’ s character was peculiar
0	for radical protestants of the mid-seventeenth century , the fact that one ’ s conscience belonged to oneself meant precisely that it must never be sold—esau ’ s sale of his birthright provided the biblical referent most often used to establish this point
0	he differed from the radicals , however , in claiming that the sacrament was not merely a memorial but had a real , objective effect on the mind of the communicant
0	come , let ’ s be going , said another
0	nightingale was puzzled to see her cry
0	he brooded morosely , while amber and the other maids went into grandmother jia ’ s inner rooms and broke into a renewed fit of sobbing as they surveyed the havoc
0	forsooth , usury is one of the chief causes , for they rob all men that deal with them , and undo them in the end
0	he could see several girls there sweeping , all of them heavily made-up and with flowers and ornaments in their hair , but no sign of the quiet , neat girl of the day before
0	you mustn ’ t wear yourself out so with your painting
0	at the end of the last chapter our story had reached a point at which , just as bao-yu and the little maid were beginning to walk away after completing the sacrifice to skybright , they were startled by the sound of a human voice coming from the direction of the flowering hibiscus bushes
0	does this mean that there are sinister frenchmen
0	the others , still laughing , assured bao-chai that she excelled as a commentator no less than dai-yu and xi-feng , in their different ways , as wits
0	the wind has dropped , but snow still wetly falls—
0	what did happen then ?
0	from that point on , however , the notion became progressively established that such malignant persons were not acting independently but were confederate in an enormous conspiracy , membership of which involved a formal pledge of allegiance to the devil
0	tell her not to go burning that paper stuff any more
0	patience bowed and took the cup , then , shaking a reproving finger at the women , she admonished them in a voice that she kept low so as not to be audible inside :
0	among the domestic staff at the rong-guo mansion was a certain drunken , dilapidated cook , by surname duo , who , because of his weakness of character and general uselessness , had acquired the nickname of droopy duo ’
0	get hold of the names of some good doctors in town and send for one immediately
0	that must be nightingale now !
0	first of all she was so poor
0	the mre money we hand out the more trouble we ’ ll cause in the long run
0	concerned that ying-chun might still be feeling distressed about her nurse , they had met together by pre-arrangement and come over to try and cheer her up
0	the narrowing of free political choice to
0	i ’ ll give you one , cousin
0	if i do find him there , you will hear no more from me ; if not , i shall be back again for further instructions
0	for the edification of zhao quan , commissioner of the em¬broidered jackets
0	once more yuan-chun feasted them ; once more , on their return from the palace , they made offer¬ings to the ancestors in their shrine in the ning-guo mansion ; and once more , on returning to her own apartment in rong-¬guo house , grandmother jia received the prostrations of theassembled family
0	( on the left-hand side )
0	faithful had heard from amber about xi-feng ’ s crying and had been over to xi-feng ’ s apartment herself to find out the reason for it from patience
0	i know , said dai-yu
0	he led grannie lin into a rear courtyard
0	they say that the man sentenced to death by a thousand cuts will dare to pull the emperor off his horse
0	the jia menfolk , in full dress , entertained their relatives in the open courtyard , where more than ten tables had been laid
0	to the anti-usury campaigners , placing a human value on time was bad enough , but to evaluate mere potential in financial terms seemed to reach newly absurd heights of arrogant presumption
0	for these three reasons he concluded that it was an altogether more satisfactory fruit than the buddha ’ s hand and abandoned all interest in the latter
0	the iewes spoile not one an other , but christians , whom they esteeme as dogges , when these counterfets make no difference of persons
0	if her old ladyship has forgotten to have a party , we can always have one here instead
0	i ’ ve only just got back from visiting the children
0	bao-yu had never met sun shao-zu before
0	the clouds of gaoang faded ,
0	you should go and rest now , uncle , he said to jia zheng
0	her grace ’ s own riddle was correctly guessed by everyone except miss ying and master huan
0	come in here with us !
0	in point of fact qin zhong ’ s soul had already left his body and the few faint gasps of breath in his failing lungs were the only life that now remained in it
0	snowgoose went out and returned with a bundle of fur-lined clothes , wrapped in a piece of felt
0	tan-chun went white , and for a moment anger deprived her of her breath
0	as soon as she had washed and done her hair , she set about teaching ban-er a few words to say to the ladies at the great house—an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough , as would any little boy of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city
0	there was some laughter from the assembled company and someone complimented grandmother jia on her perceptive¬ness in exposing the underlying falseness of these stories
0	if she gave it to your mistress , said jia lian , how is it that i don ’ t know anything about it ?
0	the wife said to her , mr feng ’ s insistence on waiting three days before taking you in shows that he doesn ’ t intend to treat you like a servant
0	that means arranging the chrysanthemums for number five
0	she was wearing only a quilted red silk tunic
0	what was wrong with this place ?
0	goethe considered byron , who is also recalled in the figure of euphorion , the offspring of faust and helen , to be the living embodiment of infinite aspiration , both sensual and intellectual
0	this spirit is none other than the devil who undertook to seduce faust ( )
0	what works , is not truth experience and feeling ?
0	the matron protested indignantly
0	considered good by virtue of wishing to remain , for all his vicissitudes , at bottom at untranslated man
0	and , whichever way we answer the question , a difficulty arises ; for , if they have virtue , in what will they differ from freemen ?
0	patience turned round to see qiao-jie huddled up and weeping disconsolately to herself
0	i expect she has noticed how much they have been spending
0	as she said this snowgoose shot her lips out in the direction of dai-yu ’ s bedroom , then began walking away , nodding to nightingale to follow her
0	then we can make a proper report on the matter
0	why not sweet-rice village from the words of the old poem :
0	her lampwick ’ s got a lucky crest
0	to think that you ’ ve been here all along , standing out on your own under the eaves !
0	a daughter of the jias ends her days
0	i know , said fivey , but i ’ m too impatient to wait that long
0	xiang-yun , unable to think of a reply , took the easy way out
0	the pips on the faces uppermost made a total of five
0	then read no more , thou hast attained the end
0	mr bao had a very peaceful night , apart from talking in his sleep
0	i think i ’ d like to try some of that
0	at this point several of the maids and women servants came forward and attempted to raise bao-yu to his feet
0	rain is seldom so obliging
0	a gentle breeze had arisen and the plant fluttered its leaves with long drawn-out trembling motion
0	doing time : debtor ’ s prison
0	quite apart from the fact that the poems aren ’ t good enough , you have no business to go showing our stuff to people outside
0	if you look around at the other apartments in this household , you ’ ll find that there isn ’ t a single one in which the nannies don ’ t take some advantage of their position to get a few perks
0	we are friends , aren ’ t we , and have been ever since you came ?
0	your improvement on cousin bao ’ s gatha is on very much the same lines , dai
0	spring ’ s dream-time will like drifting clouds disperse ,
0	their two pairs of eyes met and briefly skirmished ; then crimson felt herself blushing , and turning away abruptly , she made off for allspice court
0	they invoked the biblical description of satan as the prince of this world to support their theory , but orthodox christians replied that satan ’ s power was only illusory , and that the final cause of material events was a benign and omnipotent deity
0	her grace says that she enjoyed mademoiselle charmante ’ s performance the most and would like to see her in two more pieces , said the eunuch
0	a turnip and a garlic-head
0	kotow to mr lian and mr lai , and clear off !
0	were you aware that your elder brother had connived with a provincial official for personal gain ?
0	you only have to be a bit more forebearing with them and they ’ d give you no trouble
0	patience and felicity wept piteously to see their mistress in such a state
0	zhang er , will you tell the court how many wounds there were on your nephew ’ s corpse ?
0	she and her husband are paupers
0	i found her and these two maids shouting at each other in miss ying ’ s bedroom while miss ying sat by helpless
0	i had to borrow money to have it made , but please keep it and give it to the young master of the house with my humble compli¬ments , to play with !
0	i brought her here first thing , lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife told patience in reference to her prisoner
0	i think the title becomes her very well , said tan-chun
0	what are you talking about ?
0	i think it ’ s merely ignorance that nowadays leads people to dismiss them as unpoetical
0	but now that they are older and more mature , the time has come for them to observe a certain distance
0	tan-chun and li wan told the maids to put up her hair and dress her in her ~ and to be quick about it
0	not only was usury of money irrational , it was guaranteed to spread irrationality through every area of economic , social , and sexual intercourse
0	then he sang this song :
0	in that case you and i might just as well split the money between us , said grandmother jia
0	don ’ t be taken in by miss shi ’ s nonsense , my dear amber
0	bao-yu : i ’ ve wanted to ever since i ’ ve been better
0	i ’ ll explain it all to mrs lian tomorrow , and we ’ ll see what we can do
0	i cooked it and served it , said moonbeam , but then i had to go out on an errand
0	i think the day before yesterday you were too hasty , miss
0	all i can say is that i can ’ t do anything to get their punishment reduced and i
0	we ’ ve got our orders from her ladyship , that ’ s all we ’ re concerned about
0	how could we forget ourselves like this and make matters worse !
0	when the time came for him to tell her about autumn , he was unable to prevent a certain pleased smugness from stealing over his face
0	dai-yu realized that he must have thought of something upsetting to go off like this
0	what i meant by careless , prevaricated the village god , was that your temple must have been badly sited - you know , the dragon lines must be at fault… i had no idea you could read fengshui , commented the great lord in a tone of disbelief
0	the crowds are outside the gate
0	why can ’ t you have a normal conversation about ordinary things , or discuss something nice like poetry ?
0	it ’ s easy enough now , said nightingale , but where will she find the money for it next year , when she goes home ?
0	so gradually i cast off the intractable theories and foolish passions of my youth
0	now aunt zhao had always got on well with sunset and had been longing for the day when sunset could become jia huan ’ s concubine , thus providing her at the same time with an ally
0	but folks like us have to be more careful
0	we ’ ve been given orders not to let any of you know
0	later , when the lamps were lit , nightingale peeped through the curtains and saw that she had fallen asleep with her covers in a crumpled heap at her feet
0	this is an extremely precise description of what the witch-hunters of the sixteenth century called satan
0	i have , of course , got evidence for what i am saying and i ’ m afraid you are doing yourself little good by forcing me to mention it in front of your father
0	one of the old nuns who had her quarters to the rear of adamantina ’ s meditation chamber slept that night until four in the morning , when she was awakened by the sound of voices from the front room
0	is this the thanks i get for praising you ?
0	apparently it ’ s because cousin feng is ill again
0	come with me , and i shall give you some hot tea to drink
0	tealeaf , also laughing , fell on his knees
0	remember that anything you do for him you will be doing also for me
0	the picture was of a spray of almond blossom with the caption spirit of the afterglow ’
0	she is so unassuming , in spite of her rank
0	but jin-gui ’ s infatuation blinded her to the truth , so that xue ke ’ s courteous manner only fanned the flames of her desire
0	from the highest source of all an order was received by the board of rites authorizing the bestowal of the following :
0	the news finally arrived that yuan-chun had recovered , and everyone in the jia family was greatly relieved
0	i ’ ve been sent to fetch mr yun , said trinket
0	next day he was off long before daylight to look up ni er and pay him back the loan
0	bright ’ s name instead of her own from force of habit
0	said bao-yu in surprise
0	after a pause , she continued : even if that ’ s how you feel , please try to do what you can for my family , for my sake
0	i suppose i shall have to tell you
0	if i don ’ t open up ,
0	the old women promised , and went back into the garden
0	lady wang looked startled and clutched aroma ’ s hand in some alarm
0	there was little bao-yu could say in answer to this
0	he had not been there long when a maid came in to announce that steward lin was waiting outside with something to report
0	please go and ask your husband to con¬sult this man for us !
0	they were afraid it might be dangerous , coming so soon after his illness , and all tried to console him
0	she would step in first and become xue ke ’ s mistress , and jin-gui would have no choice but to accept the fait accompli
0	yet instead of looking after herself she has to go playing pranks on people outside
0	clearly a favourable omen
0	she took him gently by the hand :
0	you really make me angry , she said , comparing skybright with all those famous people !
0	i ’ ve already put you to so much inconvenience these last few days , i should feel even more uncomfortable carrying a lot of things back with me
0	they ’ re not meant for occasions like this ; they ’ re for using at formal banquets
0	you come and ask me for wine , you don ’ t invite me to your party , and now you have the nerve to tell me what a wonderful time you had
0	yes , madam , said the spokeswoman
0	similarly , in literary criticism one effect of the expansion of performative statements into the generalized concept of performativity has been to question the validity of the autonomous subject as an interpretative category
0	at a time like this , you should be comforting lady jia , not making matters worse with all this crying
0	it would be hard to overstate how differently people felt on the subject four centuries ago
0	as soon as i arrive at my post , i shall write to ask how you are
0	oh , it is you
0	sure enough , it was he
0	which brings us to number eight questioning the chrysanthemums
0	the great yang su in her eyes was finished from that hour :
0	and because when false meets false the truth will oft-times out , there was the constant possibility that the innumerable little frustrations that were engendered by all this concealment would eventually erupt into a quarrel
0	bao-yu : but what about miss lin ?
0	the etymological root of the hebrew word for usury is nesach , or serpent ,
0	that just shows how little you know about poetry , said bao-qin
0	fancy not thinking of that !
0	all your troubles are , in short , the doing of the servants
0	i wasn ’ t thinking about that , said bao-yu
0	well , perhaps not , said bao-yu , but her face seems number familiar that i have the impression of meeting her again after a long separation
0	these girls are trained only for our own private amusement , not as an investment
0	what a pity , in that case , that she was born into a family like yours !
0	might seem to savour of duplicity ; but she herself saw in conformity
0	in my more than four score years i ’ ve tied men aplenty for my master : but let em do it to me - never !
0	never mind about feng , said aunt xue , i ’ ve never heard about this kind of gauze before either
0	he doesn ’ t seem the least bit bothered
0	of the luo ever existed
0	according to benjamin nelson ’ s famous hypothesis , it was calvin ’ s reinterpretation of deuteronomy that self-consciously and hesitantly , charted the path to the world of universal otherhood , where all become
0	sometimes , when drink had made him bold , xue pan would try to assert himself
0	it was that toad jia yu-cun ’ s doing , said patience bitterly
0	how hard it is to predict the vicissitudes of human life , commented feng zi-ying
0	there is nothing very special to eat today , continued the prince pleasantly
0	you mustn ’ t think that for a great household like yours to retrench would be undignified
0	i suppose there are no limits to what a maid may be called , said jia zheng , but who would have picked an outlandish name like that to give her ?
0	said one of them
0	her jealousy was further inflamed
0	madam is waiting for me
0	allusions to the faust myth pepper the anti-usury pamphlets
0	i put it on , the pledge of truth , and i will follow you unto death !
0	he told her all his news , and when she asked about tan-chun , gave her a detailed account of the wedding
0	come on , grannie , that ’ s enough !
0	she was still holding forth when xi-feng , who had slipped out some time previously , sent someone round to invite her back for dinner
0	you talk of virtue and the sages of ancient times
0	in that case i won ’ t try to keep her , said grandmother jia
0	this was the junior clansmen ’ s day
0	when snowgoose saw the wedding preparations in full swing and thought of dai-yu lying at death ’ s door , she felt a pang of grief
0	very much out of countenance , bao-yu went off to look for dai-yu
0	bao-yu understood and was duly grateful
0	as if to prove that this was so , one of li wan ’ s little maids arrived at that very moment :
0	when one plaster wang arrived , bao-yu was reclining on the kang looking half-asleep and li gui and the others were doing their best to keep him awake
0	i don ’ t see why not , said dai-yu
0	bao-yu told him of his fever the night before , then crossed over to his desk and sat down to his work
0	obviously the tradition that he was buried in those places was invented by people—living long after guan yu ’ s death who loved and admired guan yu and all that he had stood for and wanted to claim him for themselves
0	when bao-yu looked , he saw that the person who had called out was dai-yu
0	since our parents went to live in the south , our uncle and aunt have been looking after us
0	he gave instructions for the medicine to be made up immediately
0	presently the servants came back to report that the mountain-top pavilion was now ready
0	well , if it ’ s only one question , go ahead
0	she had merely glanced at the toys in saying this and then turned away again
0	the devil ’ s reply , that was the cause , but yet per accidens ( ) , gives some idea of the issue ’ s complexity
0	the truth was , he already fancied this new missis of his !
0	we really can ’ t let this one go
0	slipping in a dig here and a dig there
0	what a sweet little girl !
0	on the eleventh of the month jia she entertained grand-mother jia and the rest of the family and on the twelfth it was cousin zhen ’ s turn to play host , while for several days run¬ning lady wang and wang xi-feng were most of the time out visiting one or other of the innumerable families from whom they bad received invitations
0	with that he released the bird , which promptly flew away , and stamped on the cage until it was smashed to pieces
0	¬een guardians of the sangha , the warlike
0	he coughed a couple of times
0	qiao-jie turned her little head to take another peep at him and immediately burst out crying again
0	her husband ’ s ill and she ’ s in debt
0	jin-gui smiled , somewhat unpleasantly
0	her first impulse was to argue it out with him
0	the others , still laughing , shouted at her to stop
0	a confused hubbub of laughter and chatter rose from the line of carriages while they were doing so , punctuated by an occasional louder and more dis¬tinctly audible protest , such as :
0	shortly after he had done so , jin wen-xiang was sent for
0	pale moonbeams on an opened mirror fall ,
0	and what brings you here today ?
0	dare i hope for your consent if i now propose this alliance once more ?
0	these are exactly the same as the ones you sent us the other day by messenger
0	you really have made progress i ’ she said
0	all you think about is amusing yourself with the girls , eating when you are hungry and sleeping when you are tired
0	never mind two or three : i would promise if it were two or three hundred all i ask is that you shouldn ’ t leave me
0	all those water-jars and chests of drawers and things to paint a picture !
0	but today we were told that her old ladyship might be wanting some fruit from the garden , so it ’ s to be kept open in case
0	the more you say , the sil¬lier you get
0	because of the injury to his face , bao-yu had stopped going out of doors since his accident and dai-yu spent a good deal numberf time in his apartment talking to him
0	there ’ s only fifteen taels and six pennyweights of silver here
0	today i wanted to do it properly , so i invited you and mrs li over
0	apart from that , all i have is a couple of colouring brushes
0	he has gone off to the temple today in fulfillment of a vow and is not yet back ; but you will see what i mean this evening
0	all the lins in this place have been sent away
0	a shapely nose , and eyes clear as limpid pools ,
0	he also sent me a letter of recommendation , asking me to put in a good word for him where i could
0	generally when number tell you to do anything it goes in one ear and out the other ; yet anything she tells you to do is followed out more promptly than an imperial edict !
0	'sweet and pretty and everyone loves her , but she has a thorn , said joker
0	there ’ s no wife like a chamber-wife
0	we ’ ve got no other man in the family but you and you ’ re not as bright as you might be
0	it is human subjective activity considered as a whole , rather than individual acts of production or consumption , that the usurer steals and exploits
0	the others took pity on her distress and did what they could to comfort her ; li wan sent a servant to prepare temporary accommodation while lady wang deputed some of her own maids and serving-women to wait on her
0	the -servants made a show of compliance
0	this was done with such silent concentration that , from five-frame hall and three-frame vestibule , from portico and terrace , terrace steps and courtyard , for some minutes nothing could be heard but the faint tinkling made by jade girdle-pendants and tiny golden bells and the soft scrape and scuffle of cloth-soled boots and shoes
0	how many generations must this feud go on for ?
0	and earthen pottes to praunce ,
0	in fact , i said , you ’ d better not tell anyone
0	what nice little snack have we got that we could offer mrs zhen ?
0	what do you make of that then ?

0	i haven ’ t heard anything about that , said aroma

0	i ’ m sure there isn ’ t a day goes by without their giving me some fresh cause for anxiety
0	you-shi , whom all this time she had not let go of , was so mauled and crumpled that she was beginning to take on some of the aspects of a piece of well-kneaded dough and various parts of her clothing had become damp and discoloured with the moisture from xi-feng 's eyes and nose
0	he replied to jia bao-yu ’ s remarks in what he deemed to be a fitting vein :
0	imperial use palace taffetas lengths
0	and now you ’ ve found this means of getting her away from me , so that you can have me at your mercy
0	aroma , beside herself with anxiety , tugged imploringly at her sleeve :
0	it ’ s really a game for men to play , outside
0	in that case , said ripple , the rest of us may as well clear off and let her have him all to herself !

0	let him be called for tomorrow and given forty strokes with the heavy bamboo
0	if my reading of the lady ’ s pulse is correct , she ought to be showing all these symptoms
0	after some discussion it was

0	so for all her fastidious purity , addie ’ s worldly karma is still not complete
0	you-shi , feeling that - in spite of what had been agreed - she could hardly stay away when her own step-sister was being formally presented to the family , went along with them , on the express understanding that she herself would say nothing and that , in the event of there being any opposi¬tion , xi-feng would take sole responsibility

0	he was still racking his brains to recall what it reminded him of ; when jia zheng ordered him to produce a name and couplet for the arch , and he was quite unable to give his mind to the task of composi¬tion
0	i couldn ’ t make head or tail of what he said , and it seemed best not to argue with him

0	bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly
0	the man was down in a flash , kotowed to jia lian and lai da , wrapped his hands round the back of his head and fled like a rat
0	you ’ d better be quick , advised lady xing ’ s maid , or it will be too late
0	there ’ s nothing very ex¬ceptional about that

0	all right , ignore me then !
0	it soon became clear to them all that so far from being his normal self , he was now little more than a halfwit

0	after that i would have had her back again
0	i have another appointment , so i hope you ’ ll excuse me
0	if that produces no results , then we should send them to search the older serving-women and cleaners
0	that evening , when dai-yu went into her side-room to undress for the night , she caught sight of the lychees again
0	why don ’ t we have just two or three of them taken inside ?

0	the president was an old friend of xi-feng ’ s uncle , wang zi-teng
0	then yu-cun learned of the general reinstatement for dis¬missed officials and planned to come up to the capital to take advantage of it
0	i remembered how fond you are of those things and asked mrs zhen if i could have some to eat in the evening
0	dai-yu gave an unnatural little laugh
0	about the theme for tomorrow ’ s poems , she said
0	i haven ’ t seen you over our side these last two or three days
0	because usury brought into existence an imaginary subjective agent , it naturally raised profound questions about the nature of subjectivity itself
0	he says he left a message to pass on to you
0	as he spoke , they passed through a tunnel of rock in ~e mountain ’ s shoulder into an artificial ravine ablaze with the van-coloured flowers and foliage of many varieties of tree and shrub which grew there in great profusion

0	not having prepared herself for such a question , wu xin¬deng ’ s wife was unable to answer it
0	they continued to sit a while longer , chatting about this and that
0	you ’ ve got your mother and your brother for a start
0	after their departure jia zheng managed to compose himself somewhat , though he was still suffering from a deep sense of shock
0	we thought being so poor and not used to seeing things like that lying around she might have been tempted
0	never mind the whys and wherefores !
0	that ’ s why i hurried you out
0	she also told lady wang to see to lady xing ’ s needs
0	shakespeare describes the interpenetration of subjective appetite
0	even as she said the words , she looked around her , noticed the all too obvious absence of lady xing and you-shi , and fell silent

0	lady wang informed him that bao-chai was with child , and that all bao-yu ’ s maids would be dismissed
0	in the course of a thousand or more years all of them have died and come
0	from your point of view that ’ s an advantage , because i can give all my attention to serving you
0	i wonder what i shall be , said tan-chun , and reached out
0	when she got there , she found that bao-chai was not in the garden , having gone round to her mother ’ s place outside
0	this is getting rather complicated
0	who would have thought on earth such scenes to find
0	if you persist in this folly , how can the family fortunes ever hope to improve ?
0	what he was saying just now was simpleton ’ s talk , but this is raging lunacy !
0	and i don ’ t think auntie would really mind if i didn ’ t go
0	bao-yu ’ s grief for dai-yu and his general state of gloom were further compounded when he considered this dispersal of the re¬maining occupants of the naiad ’ s house
0	in any case , perhaps i ’ m none too clean myself
0	no wonder the master gets so angry with you
0	she ’ s ask¬ing for a year ’ s leave of absence
0	now that you ’ ve made me your m c , any of you who doesn ’ t do exactly as i say , no matter who it is , has to pay a forfeit
0	he noticed that erie was eating cardamums and made a grab at them intending to take some for himself
0	we ’ d like to hear something a bit quieter now
0	the birds were returning to their nests ; the sun was setting
0	now things have come to this , you must put me out of your mind
0	he had shone his light ( a little hand-mirror ) for the souls in darkness
0	you really must give it more of your attention
0	there ’ s no need to upset yourself
0	then the men-servants retired and xi-feng ’ s own women hurried forward and raised the curtain of the carriage for her to descend
0	that ’ s what you think !
0	after the years you have spent seeing to my every need , i had hoped the two of us could always be together
0	he was somewhat displeased to see his son-in-law arriving like a refugee on his doorstep ; but fortunately shi- yin had on him the money he had realized from the sale of the farm , and this he now entrusted to his father-in-law to buy for him , as and when he could , a house and land on which he could depend for his future livelihood
0	that night he performed his conjugal duties with exemplary thoroughness
0	he had seized the demon torturers who resisted his progress
0	if lady wang should choose to question us , there ’ s plenty we could tell
0	he ’ s already said he won ’ t do it again
0	finding that she was not to be taken with cunning , jin-gui began looking for occasions for a direct confrontation with her ; but as bao-chai was equally careful not to give her any , she was for the time being obliged , albeit reluctantly , to treat her with respect
0	she says her husband is an absolute monster
0	it only goes to show
0	nietzsche did a great deal of mischief by acting as though it were our moral consciousness which , like mephistopheles , raises an icy , satanic fist [ faust in german ] against life
0	there ’ s a favour i want to ask too , by the bye , so we ’ ll be able to talk about that then as well
0	five major abuses , long habitual in the ning-guo establishment , presented themselves to her mind as being specially in need of attention , viz :

0	her name orfie ’ was simply a convenient contraction of this
0	let the two of us die together
0	besides , there would be terrible trouble if they found out
0	bao-yu moved over again and , drawing a chair up beside dai-yu , recommenced his scrutiny
0	few western observers today would regard such opinions with the amused condescension of the victorians
0	after grandmother jia and her four grandchildren , the next along on the east side was lady xing ; after her came lady wang , then you-shi , then li wan , then xi-feng , and lastly jia rong ’ s wife , hu-shi
0	this is not a rational but a magical attitude to truth , and therefore it constitutes for greene a satanic wilfull striving against knowne truth ( ibid
0	bao-yu went straight past her and saluted his grandmother , who told him to come after he had seen his mother , whereupon he turned round and walked straight out again
0	in fact , they protested against the idea that signs could do anything at all independently of human intervention
0	aroma had heard all this from the adjoining room and now came hurrying in
0	mrs xue sent caltrop over to ask me about something
0	but you ’ re most definitely mrs rong , protested faithful
0	oh , it was a passing -fit of anger , said aroma
0	some of the guests had seen them before , some had not ; but all alike exclaimed admiringly at their beauty
0	the fact of the matter is that all these noble ladies to whom you refer hail from the skies of passion and the seas of retribution
0	those who are used to working with me at the other place always have a watch handy , and everything they do , no matter how small a thing it is , is done at a fixed time
0	jia rui , by now a mere automaton in the hands of his cap¬tors , obediently crouched down beneath the steps and was just beginning a series of calculations respecting his present financial predicament when a sudden slosh !
0	you certainly have no cause to worry for the future , mrs zhu !
0	but what ’ s the good ?
0	then she too went back into the garden
0	after that she went to look for dai-yu and showed it to her
0	it is also worth asking whether the postmodern condition deserves such criticism
0	they dared not deny her this request , and promptly brought her a cup of real tea
0	we can question him at leisure there
0	just then parfumee peered in the gateway of the kitchen courtyard and called across to mrs liu , the cook , who was still banging about inside the kitchen
0	as much distressed by his mother ’ s words as he was alarmed by her arrival , jia zheng hurried out to meet her , she was leaning on the shoulder of a little maid , her old head swaying from side to side with the effort of running , and pant¬ing as she ran
0	it ’ s too late to stop it now , isn ’ t it ?
0	but when she looked , his eyes were closed as before and he was still pretending to be asleep

0	and how exquisitely thoughtful to have sent your maid-servant shortly after¬wards with solicitous inquiries and with those delicious lychees and the calligraphy by yan zhen-qing !
0	she called snowgoose and the other juniors in and told them to mount watch , while she went to report to grandmother jia
0	and being able to come out with it so pat !
0	all those girls for just one bod -
0	qiao-jie , who was little more than a child , and too young to suspect anything , went with her old nanny and patience , who felt a little uneasy and insisted on accompanying her charge
0	well , in that case he ought to behave himself , then no one would have any cause to complain
0	she smiled at him reassuringly
0	look how well she treats you normally
0	even with the greatly increased coming and going occasioned by the bereavement , it was quieter now than it had been before , when muddle and confusion still pre¬vailed
0	i ’ d had too much to drink last night
0	can ’ t you get to sleep either ?
0	such a wonderful disposition !
0	bao-chai tried to comfort her , but bao-yu only laughed and said :
0	but faust has been associated with the theatrical even before spies ’ s historia
0	the characters it traced with a rapid motion in the sand read as follows :
0	jia zheng , who had heard her with a sigh , sank into a chair and himself broke down in a fit of weeping
0	she sent the remaining three hundred back home for grandmother you to take care of
0	among them were some of the double-headed kind , and looking at these , she had a strange sensation that they meant something
0	thinkers differ , though , on how this situation is to be evaluated ethically , and on the closely connected question of its political implications
0	has miss lin had her lunch yet ?
0	the words astounded her
0	he exerted himself on his behalf to such good effect that on the very day his petition was presented yu-cun ’ s reinstatement was approved , and before two months were out he was appointed to the magistracy of ying-tian-fu in nanking
0	as he stood gaz¬ing sorrowfully at the bushes , an idea suddenly came to him
0	are you going to let your authority be challenged now by these maids ?
0	paper money , on the other hand , does appear to be a symbol entirely disassociated from the commodity that it symbolizes
0	you needn ’ t stay with me any longer , she said
0	two old women lifted it up , and then off they all went , xi-feng and li wan one on either side of it and a little cohort of maids and older servants bringing up the rear
0	was it some phlegm that got into your heart ?
0	i ’ m going on ahead
0	it would have been hard to say whether the water below or the banks above presented the more brilliant spectacle

0	there ’ s something else i want to say to you
0	something i ’ ve forgotten about that you may perhaps remember
0	we have a private school in our family to which any members of the clan who can ’ t manage private tuition may send their children , and boys from related families who aren ’ t in the clan can also be admitted
0	this is no wild postmodernist theory but an empirically observable fact
0	it is never too late , dorian
0	what do you mean ?
0	aroma put her hand over his mouth :
0	sometimes when san-jie felt in the mood , she would send one of the boys round to
0	see that you get someone thoroughly dependable to sit up and keep an eye on the candles tonight , grandmother jia said by way of parting admonition
0	the allusion to lucifer indicates that manfred has definitively transgressed the bounds of permitted knowledge
0	i do hope you will forgive me
0	the old man ’ s eyes grew moist , and grandmother jia her¬self showed a disposition to be tearful
0	before she could do so , grannie liu , waving her hand in protest , got up and began to go
0	she turned to felicity
0	i have never before liked to ask for your opinions about poetry because i have never before seen you show so much interest , she said ; but since you now obviously are in the mood for discussing it , won ’ t you please favour us with some criticism ?
0	bao-yu asked her anxiously
0	alas , i am as be¬nighted as ever , as you can see from my present condition
0	coming from other lips , her words would scarcely have touched him
0	fancy making a fuss like that about losing a few coppers !
0	just then the little maid came back with a message
0	that ’ s what i can ’ t stand because that ’ s what i ’ ve been seeing ever since , almost every day
0	as a result , the self-transformations in which middleton ’ s characters are forced to engage do not bespeak a transgressive freedom from constricting class or gender roles
0	very handsome of you , and very resourceful , too
0	these now drew their swords in defence of the returning party , and seeing there was only one man following them , they closed in on him
0	he ’ s gone into the country to see father , said you-shi
0	in the end he did though , and eventually , after a great deal of persuasion , managed to get himself invited into the house to have a look at the fans
0	i can not deny the gravity of what has happened
0	dworkin concludes that objectification is an imprecise term
0	we thought you said the jias could get anything they wanted out of anyone !
0	and take two of the junior maids with you as well
0	since he first encountered them , xue ke had done his utmost to avoid these un¬savoury elements , but was aware that by openly rebuffing them he might create further trouble for himself
0	the brain is the vehicle of the mind , in the same sense that the eye is the vehicle of sight
0	an old serving-woman raised the portiere , jia lian ushered the doctor into dai-yu ’ s room and the two men sat down
0	one can see how fond of you she must be
0	i honestly know nothing about this , he said
0	to learn if aunt zhao survived or not , please turn to the next chapter
0	before he could finish , xue pan was on his feet , protesting vigorously :
0	but of this , more later
0	the mattress had a few drinks herself now with the pages and the two girls , anxious to make herself as agreeable as possible so that the pages would give a good report of her to cousin zhen
0	she did so , leaning on the shoulder of her maid felicity , and the two women with the lanterns led her in , lighting the way for her as they went , while her other women closed in behind her and the women of the ning-guo household advanced to meet her , curtseyed , and chorused their morning greetings
0	of course i do !
0	if that woman doesn ’ t end up by carrying off every stick of property belonging to this family to line her own nest with , my name ’ s not zhao !
0	patience did her best to be cheerful with xi-¬feng ; but ladies xing and wang , although they had been back from the temple for several days , had neither of them paid her a personal visit , and had only sent a maid to enquire after her health
0	after pausing long enough to ascertain that lady wang had nothing more to say , xi-feng turned and went
0	say he ’ ll be over when he ’ s had a little lie-down
0	i thought i ’ d find you here
0	let none the checkered shade with violence rude
0	it is true , however , that social explanations for the new power of usury were also being offered
0	jia zheng was totally at a loss to imagine what the purpose of the man ’ s visit might be ; nevertheless he rose to his feet out of respect for the prince and smiled politely
0	but each time he thought of putting an end to his life , he remembered the words of the stranger in his dream ; and then he thought of the distress his death would cause his mother and grandmother and knew that he could not tear himself away from them
0	the jias did send someone to put in a word for dime , but i ’ m afraid mayor jia won ’ t set him free
0	our story continues in the following chapter
0	the audience listened throughout with rapt attention
0	there ’ s hardly a minute of the day when i haven ’ t got a medicine-skillet on the stove , said dai-yu
0	he found jia zheng discussing the highlights of the chrysanthemum-viewing party with his literary gentlemen
0	the religion of the putative merchant is no longer within himself ; it has been alienated to another , transferred to the very person of that man
0	her attempts to puzzle out what could have happened were cut short by the arrival of aroma
0	but unfortunately this argument is too often adduced by sons and statesmen who find themselves out of favour , or by faithful widows and widowers , as an excuse for moral torpor
0	it is such a long time since we last met , he said politely , that i have quite forgotten your names
0	don ’ t ask now , replied skybright

0	he had never settled down to the serious analytical examination of even a single essay
0	so what would you have me do then ?
0	shall we do as she says and stay put ?
0	all the aces , one and one
0	he hasn ’ t lost his prick !
0	come along now , your father will be expecting to see you i ’ m sure
0	bao-yu finds zen enlightenment
0	quite right , said grandmother jia
0	now that we are here , even though uncle wang is busy getting ready to go , auntie jia will probably be only too glad to have us
0	where have you been ?
0	yes mother , we have , replied lady wang

0	this hobbesian reading of deuteronomy produces homo economicus , the abstract , self-seeking , individualist actor of political economy

0	a word to xi-feng in the evening , and it would be as good as settled
0	all i am asking for is a little sympathy
0	the big one is like a man blessed with fortune ; the little ones are his dependants , sheltering in the shade of his influence
0	the sight of these newcomers - particularly as tan-chun was one of them - caused the woman to stop of her own accord and she took the opportunity of slipping quietly outside
0	what a mean , grasping young woman you are !
0	surely you ’ re not going to set yourself up against the whole apartment ?
0	admittedly , we don ’ t know exactly how they played it then and our modern cover-ups is a comparatively recent invention ; but it ’ s still very , very difficult
0	in the interval thus created , you-shi addressed xi-feng in a scornful whisper
0	joker kotowed several times , scrambled to his feet , and retreated as far as the threshold of the outer room , not daring to leave altogether
0	i that now am but a shade ,
0	don ’ t talk about dying , cousin bao , said little xi-luan

0	mrs bao was going to come over and tell you , only she didn ’ t want you to scold us for making a fuss about nothing
0	next , patience hurried into the room , her hair dishevelled , dragging qiao-jie by the hand and sobbing hysterically :
0	i hope i am going to be paid something for my services
0	the relation here between myself and the exercise of my abilities is the same as that between the substance of a thing and its use
0	those are the things our servants are so good at
0	the wild geese from the north are now returning ;
0	it ’ s nothing to worry about
0	yes , do stop all this monkeying around , said aunt xue , laughing in spite of herself , and get on with your story
0	he had mislaid something , and would she go over after dinner and help him find it ?
0	it was she , yesterday ’ s girl , standing there on her own , apparently lost in thought
0	she ’ s been keeping very well on the journey
0	it made me want to laugh and cry all at the same time
0	i thought you ’ d be a bit quiet here with me away , he said
0	when i read this couplet last night , it suddenly took me back to that very spot
0	here am i going to all this trouble to entertain you and all you do is keep interrupting
0	wouldn ’ t it be a politeness to ask them if they would like to contribute as well ?

0	but in the end , as it turned out , bao-chai was extremely reasonable
0	she pointed to bao-yu
0	besides , as you know , with so many expenses and so little coming in to pay for them , things are extremely tight at present
0	the sister superior does not feel she can make the decision herself , and would like someone in the family to take charge
0	after all , she had never been particularly fond of jia she , and cousin zhen was not her own grandson
0	bao-chai ’ s strictures about fooling around ’ and his mother ’ s insistence that he had brought about bao-yu ’ s beating by means of a deliberate indiscretion had exasperated him beyond endurance
0	he breaks the first bar of his earthly cage
0	what time is it ?
0	yours is yours , wherever it be , as they said to the lady when she dropped her gold comb in the well

0	listen , dasha , i see apparitions all the time now
0	we were discussing cousin feng
0	everyone said she was good-looking , and not only that , but literate and able to write a tolerable hand

0	go on , be a dear !
0	ahead was an airy building with roofs of tile , whose elegant surrounding wall was of grey-plastered brick pierced by ornamental grilles made of semi-circular tiles laid together in openwork patterns
0	i was laughing to myself , thinking what a rough palate caltrop must have
0	he arrived just as a number of womenservants who had been reporting on household matters were leaving
0	the soldiers among them lacked generalship ; as a consequence , they had nothing but their physical courage to rely on
0	she and oriole then sauntered along empty-handed in the direction of green delights , while the old woman trotted along behind them carrying everything
0	graham hammill has pointed out that the play is a tragedy because of the relation that it establishes between faustus and
0	xi-feng hurriedly curtseyed back
0	then there was her interview with jia zheng , which had to take place with her father standing outside the door-curtain of the room in which she was sitting
0	even as they were speaking , jia zheng was summoned to the imperial presence , and hurried in
0	aunt zhao ’ s face assumed an expression of terror
0	he was expelled from ingolstadt and told to spend his penny elsewhere ( ) , but the city council was sufficiently respectful of his powers that he was induced to pledge not to take vengeance or make fools of the authorities for this order ( )
0	she was back in a very short time , however
0	no wonder you have such a reputation
0	bully and spendthrift , reckless in debauch ,
0	he listened for a while but there was no further sound
0	lots of them didn ’ t , said patience
0	now do be sensible !
0	would adamantina consult the planchette for them ?
0	he has corrupted practically every maid and young woman in the house
0	and what of the garden , the rocks , the flowers , the trees ?
0	at one time and another they must have covered well over half the provinces of the empire in that way
0	exactly i you know the old saying : he that eats shall live ?
0	he may not need the rest of us , said aroma , but he certainly couldn ’ t do without you
0	the nuns feigned alarm :
0	cottons , assorted colours , thirty bundles
0	mamma , what a surprise !
0	aunt was very worried and sent me to find out what was going on and to give you a hand
0	in the white devil ( ) adams declares that
0	hearing no call from her next morning , the maids xi-feng and autumn having gone off to grandmother jia ’ s place for their morning duty - were only too pleased to get on with their toilets undisturbed
0	none of these tendencies is more superstitious than witchcraft
0	she can ’ t be lost
0	feng shall have whatever troupe she prefers , said grand¬mother jia
0	of course , not all aristocrats were gullible debtors
0	how can you accuse us of driving qiao-jie to her death ?
0	one has seen plenty of crab-apple blossom before ) but never anything as beautiful as this
0	her family and ours have always abided by the old southern marriage customs , and that is why none of us have set eyes on the groom to this day
0	i heard you had some of that bezoar stuff in here
0	the curse laid upon both adam and eve is that they will experience their essential subjective activity—their labor—as alien , hostile , and unpleasant
0	it was only a joke , you know
0	this was dearly the most he would concede and the others perforce acquiesced
0	on the left-hand one was a small , square , fouregged ding , together with a bronze ladle , metal chop¬sticks , and an incense container
0	i ’ ve seen her taking silver from the little pearl-inlaid cabinet , said bao-yu
0	you-shi did as she was instructed , but her efforts had the very opposite effect , and only elicited more threats of suicide from xi-chun
0	i must see if i can ’ t get one of these under me belt !
0	its deeds that count , not words
0	he remembered some of the words , such as dispels the harms of witchcraft
0	deducing that adamantina must have been offended by bao yong , and knowing that she was on intimate terms with the ladies of the house , especially miss xi-chun , the women feared that at some later date she might report them for not letting her through , and thereby get them into serious trouble
0	it ’ s very thoughtful of her
0	while these thoughts were passing through his mind , a junior maid came in to announce the arrival of ying-chun
0	she smiled at crimson again
0	xi-feng ’ s mock-lugubriousness set the old lady off in another squall of laughter
0	ravished ( ) by the images , thus anticipating the effect that helen of troy will have on faustus himself
0	i ’ m sure mr zhen and mr lian and the other menfolk will be unwilling to pass over this in silence
0	( ) the scene culminates in dorian ’ s declaration of faustian despair that his sins can not be forgiven
0	even if it is true , we must behave as if we know nothing until sir zheng and lady wang come home
0	everyone present knew that xi-feng was a wonderful raconteuse with a seemingly inexhaustible stock of new and funny stories
0	i ’ m scared to meet them when they come visiting , for fear they might laugh at me
0	give grandma and auntie wang my regards , won ’ t you
0	when i heard what sort of an unpleasant affair it was , i told all the servants to keep quiet about it
0	today ’ s meeting is just a preliminary discussion
0	he watched her with tears running down his cheeks , suddenly ashamed of his own fastidiousness
0	he felt enormously pleased with himself ; but there was a slightly hang-dog expression on his face when , after he had seen grandmother jia and the rest , he appeared once more before his wife
0	if i had known he was coming , i shouldn ’ t have come myself
0	at this stage , the slightly stuffy analytics of austin explode into a radical manifesto for ideological revolution , the destruction of western philosophy , and the abolition of any and all hierarchical
0	said tan-chun , herself gulping down a little wine , i ’ m your mc
0	she was naturally flattered , and said to him :
0	they could see from this reply that he was beside himself
0	i may not be very clever , but i ’ ve got a reasonably good memory
0	she covered her burning face with her sleeve , and turning over towards the wall , pretended to be asleep
0	he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , follow similar logic
0	nding ’ uri substitutes an appreciation for human essence for a love of
0	then we ’ d see how you managed to play the siren and lead young gentlemen astray !
0	their gold , they with their gold in hell shall burne
0	up to this moment aroma had never had so much as a harsh word from bao-yu , and the combination of shame , anger and pain she now felt on being kicked and shouted at by him in front of so many people was well-nigh insupport¬able
0	a delicate young wife of gentle stock
0	you are altogether too modest , sir
0	she can sit below me
0	the monk seemed to find this suggestion hysterically funny , and after a good deal of laughter he held the jade out in one hand , bent down and whispered in bao-yu ’ s ear :
0	the only difficulty is that lady wang doesn ’ t touch this kind of thing any more
0	i had a stomach-ache , and went for a bit of a stroll
0	if you don ’ t want it , i ’ ll keep it for myself , then , said bao¬-yu , and popped it once more inside his jacket
0	she begs you not to worry about her
0	aunt xue gave a little laugh
0	now , it can not be said that these significative words uttered by magicians derive efficacy from the intellect of the speaker
0	just listen to her !
0	i have brought you your month ’ s allowance
0	telling the servants at the gate not to breathe a word of this , he gave secret orders to search every alley¬way in the neighbourhood for any further posters , and sent at once for jia lian , who came hurrying over
0	aroma is getting quite expert in the art of stirring up trouble between other people , said skybright
0	how many girls were there working for him altogether ?
0	you ’ re not used to wearing patterns , so it ’ s important to see where you ’ re going
0	( crimson herself , was the secret hope )
0	ask fishy if you don ’ t believe me
0	if he still holds out against it , i ’ ll have him over and talk to him myself
0	we ’ ve been here practically all day !
0	nowadays , we are nothing to boast about ourselves
0	happily disregarded all strictures against usury , and the lombards in particular became a byword for moneylending
0	where the signs appear to be efficacious , therefore , this is evidence that a demon is at work , and hence that an agreement or covenant has been effected between the demon
0	from dai-yu and her handkerchiefs let us return to aroma , who , it will be remembered , bad been sent off to bao-chai ’ s for a book
0	now you just all go on enjoying yourselves exactly as you were before i came , said the old lady when she had settled herself on the rug
0	and you-shi from the other mansion
0	lady wang followed suit , as did all the other ladies of the family - with the single exception of li wan
0	so costly a remedy was far beyond dai¬-ru ’ s resources and he was obliged to go to the rong-guo man¬sion to beg
0	but when they found they couldn ’ t beat our bao yong , they fled !
0	aunt zhao could only curse helplessly
0	you ’ re supposed to laugh ; don ’ t be a sober-sided prig !
0	now grannie liu was seven or eight parts drunk and thoroughly worn out from all her walking
0	bao-yu held jia lian ’ s hand and sobbed loudly , which set jia lian off again
0	when he and his sister had formally thanked her , the company sat down to lunch , after which you-shi , xi-feng and qin¬shi settled down to a game of cards , while bao-yu and qin zhong left the table to converse elsewhere
0	they were already in the doorway
0	you should be trying to catch the thief , not accusing my door-gods of being careless !
0	they will tell you
0	it ’ s sir she , said lady xing
0	the flowering almond ’ s blossoms seen on high
0	tears started from his eyes and rolled down his cheeks un¬heeded
0	when are you going to begin studying at night ?
0	they laughed excitedly when they saw him enter
0	and now he had been promoted to the magistracy of this district
0	bring them here , will you ?
0	that ’ ll be what she wants to see you about
0	now that ’ s all right as far as it goes , but it doesn ’ t go far enough
0	and tell her to bring that other poetry maniac with her when she comes
0	tell him not to bother !
0	only excesse is lawfull in his chest ,
0	no , not yet , xi-feng told her , because she was still taking the infusions ; but her aunt was not to worry , because she was now feeling completely better
0	he told me to put it away for good
0	zhu-er ’ s wife was now in a panic
0	most part of the four continents of the earth ,
0	with miss chai here i ’ ll be able to unload a lot of my responsibilities
0	quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below
0	nowadays it ’ s all divided up among the garden-women ; and there isn ’ t one of them , either , that wouldn ’ t just as soon scratch your eyes out as look at you
0	what about your own things ?
0	that ’ s what has been making her fall ill all the time too
0	the reason i have come here today is that recently there has been a heavy concen-tration of love-karma in this area , and i hope to be able to find an opportunity of distributing a quantity of a amorous thoughts by implanting them in the appropriate breasts
0	the shock of the day ’ s events had finally taken its toll , and she was unconscious again and breathing fitfully
0	a consequence of this latest exposure to the cold and of the accompanying emotional upset was that skybright was now feeling bad again
0	just as , when your puppy-dog bites you or your kitten scratches you , you can either ignore it or have it punished , so with these
0	she got up herself as she said this , and after taking a sip or two of green tea , climbed into her bamboo carrying-chair and was borne out of the garden by two women , the rest walking beside her or following close behind
0	he got one of the women to take it into the garden for them
0	if he still wants me , i ’ ll make you my farewell kotow and you can forget that i ever existed
0	he knows his way around , though , and has a great gift of the gab , so at present he stays at home with his uncle zheng and helps him manage the family ’ s affairs
0	well , have you been to see mrs xue , and put it to her yet ?
0	by the light of post-structuralist theory , as a metacritical theatre of the all-conquering word
0	we can ’ t communicate with our friends and relatives
0	xue pan was almost beside himself
0	but if you wish to know the outcome , you must turn to the next chapter
0	startled , she asked him what he was doing there
0	one of my maids was talking only the other day about someone called lily , and i couldn ’ t for the life of me think who she meant
0	there ’ s something else i want to tell you !
0	none of these is really a problem , said jia rong
0	very kind of them , i am sure
0	if in lesse noble and almost mechanik arts
0	grandmother jia felt a little awkward about expressing her grati¬tude to these serving-women
0	i ’ ve been sent for by king yama of the nether world
0	the girl looked up , startled , when she heard the voice
0	i don ’ t see why not , said xi-feng
0	and frost the river ’ s motion petrifies
0	who knows what will happen to any of us ?
0	after not speaking to me for so long , here you are lecturing me
0	the very day that xue pan started on his journey , aunt xue went into his study , had all the small fur¬niture , blinds , curtains and other movables carried out and stored in her own apartment , and ordered the wives of the absent menservants to move in with her to sleep
0	i am also con¬stantly hearing of some new ailment of yours , or shall we rather say ingenious pretext to play truant
0	he did not take kindly to being bumped into , and it would have gone badly with jia yun if he had not immediately identified himself :
0	clocks and watches , eighteen
0	i can ’ t make out what these two here are
0	i really can ’ t understand why sir zheng is concerned that the boy doesn ’ t study enough
0	the maids , when questioned , said that it had been caused by an outer casement of one of the windows falling
0	but we ’ ve had no contact with them for years now , so i ’ ve no notion what this miss zhang is like
0	the romantic sympathy for the devil is anachronistic
0	one doesn ’ t want this sort of thing to become a precedent
0	still smarting with resentment , she heard the old woman say that jia yun was coming next day into the garden
0	bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea , and made straight for the west courtyard where his grandmother jia ’ s apartment was
0	there are twelve artificial flowers in here , said aunt xue
0	xi-feng smiled , and added a few more words of explanation
0	he flung himself on the ground in a fit of weeping , scattering the earth all about him with the flowers he had been carrying in the skirt of his gown
0	i mean excellent from a purely poetic point of view , because it ’ s so original
0	he claims that the suppression of subjectivity and the peformative power of signs are in fact progressive tendencies , to be applauded rather than denounced in what lyotard regards as obsolescent theological terms
0	burning of precious incense find
0	for philo of alexandria , however , it was the word of god revealed in and to the soul , and thus the means by which the soul might ascend from the baser appetites and passions described by plato and aristotle toward reason and nous
0	the hand was pointing exactly midway between the sign of the dog and the sign of the pig : nine o ’ clock at night
0	i ’ ll cheer you up , lady jia , said you-shi
0	that would be to charge twice for the same thing , for the loaf realizes its telos by being eaten
0	my dear friend , said the prince of bei-jing , your excessive modesty does us both an injustice
0	if they give me a plausible answer to my question , i shall embrace your faith
0	well , you don ’ t want to give too little , said the old woman
0	more recently , with talk of fivey going into service in the garden , they had been less inclined than ever to look on qian huai as a possible son-in-law , for it now seemed probable that after four or five years ’ service as a maid , fivey would be at liberty to marry someone of their own choice from outside
0	on the contrary , said grandmother jia , it is you who have rejected me ’
0	by now they had reached the kitchen and some of them , led by lotus , went inside to look
0	presumably we aren ’ t going to ask each of them to produce a poem for every one of the titles ?
0	don ’ t you go taking sides against her as well !
0	i had a peep when they ’ d gone , but i couldn ’ t make out what it was , and as i knew you were both here , i thought i would come over and see if either of you could make anything of it
0	if lady wang gets to hear of it , she will probably conclude that the job is too hard for me and take it away again
0	the master and her ladyship have given him quite a few thrashings , all to no effect
0	xi-feng laughed and turned to address patience behind her
0	i shouldn ’ t have thought myself that it was worth mentioning even
0	she now ascended the terraces and entered the open-fronted hall of audience
0	that set you with the test at odds
0	i ’ m sure you know them
0	a slave is alienated by definition , because his activity does not serve his own ends but those of another
0	it was a purely disinterested present
0	her family are talking about taking it to court
0	oh , frowner ’ s in a rage !
0	whenever i want to remember someone dear to me - it doesn ’ t necessarily have to be on a feast-day or any particular day , by the way - i light some incense in it and put out a cup of fresh tea or water , or sometimes some flowers or fruit if i have any
0	the year before last her father died quite suddenly
0	terrified of the humiliation that awaited her , she now made a childish attempt to resist going
0	that would be very kind
0	then if it ’ s not him you mean , it must be her , said amber , pointing now at dai -- yu
0	the monarch is interested in the source of magical efficacy , noting faustus ’ s reputation for rare effects of magic
0	as soon as ever they get together there is some kind of mischief afoot
0	he was just going to hand it back to her when the two maids came in again with the tea
0	the monastery at pu-dong
0	i suppose i ought to have realized that that sharp little nose of yours would soon ferret me out again
0	moonbeam blushed in reply , piled the sweetmeats onto one plate and went out holding it in both hands
0	it seemed natural to marlowe and his audience to see catholic sacramental theology as a form of magic , as valdes suggests when he predicts that their facility with magic shall make all nations to canonize us , / as indian moores obey their spanish lords
0	its theological purpose is manifest in the information that edward alleyn ’ s costume for the role of faustus was a surplis/ with a crosse upon his breast , in mephistopheles ’ s initial disguise as a franciscan friar ( that holy shape becomes a devil best ( ) ) , and in the mockery of the pope and his monks
0	i felt sure that someone of her qualities would have work to do in the world
0	that ’ s no way for an educated , well-brought-up young gentleman to behave , they ’ ll say
0	it really wrung my heart when she said that
0	day at xi-chun ’ s place helping her
0	she gave xue ke a saucy smile and continued :
0	at first adamantina was reluctant
0	all these people you and i have been talking about are probably examples of that mixture of good and evil humours i was describing to you
0	everyone in the world has to become the object of your calculations
0	there ’ s no need to tell miss lin though
0	the girl ’ s father was a tax-collector in one of the provinces , the family owned several pawnshops , and the girl herself was an absolute peach
0	do you think i could ask you to go in now and have a look at my daughter-inaw ?
0	he stretched his neck out in readiness ; but the blackcoats declined
0	it 's a good job lian has not slept with the girl yet
0	we were a big family in those days
0	xi-feng was by now shaking all over with anger
0	clerk : oh , that was it the reminders
0	in a short while tealeaf returned with the book , which he handed to bao-yu who presented it to his father
0	at last the two ladies and their two jades ’ were face to face
0	aroma put him to bed and it goes without saying that he spent a sleepless night
0	if the flowers could understand , surely they would grieve ?
0	as long as we let feng know , it should be sufficient
0	qiao-jie ’ s expectorant was now prepared and poured down her throat
0	it did in fact have a slightly pinkish tinge , and when he sniffed it , he found that it had a sweet , almost sickly perfume , quite unlike the clean , fresh scent of the orris
0	where i used to dwell
0	with that he went off to bed in a huff
0	as soon as that was over , she changed out of her court clothes and declared that she was going to rest , refusing to see any of the friends and relations who now began arriving in great numbers to offer their new year felicitations , and spending her time either quietly conversing with aunt xue and mrs li or , as an occasional diversion , playing games of cards or racing go with bao-yu and the girls
0	bao-yu must have gone away with that monk
0	you know the rule :
0	dai-yu was deeply moved
0	when uncle zheng and aunt wang come home , how am i to face them ?
0	de¬tails of their conversation eluded her but the main sub¬stance was clear
0	the appellant came hither in all haste , to discover that the above-mentioned mr zhang had indeed met his death at the hand of the defendant , but that it was a case of fatal bodily harm by mischance and not of intentional homicide by blows , as previously alleged
0	he was trembling all over
0	well , having found some , you will want to plant them ; so planting the chrysanthemums will be the third title
0	oh , and i feel so ashamed when i think how i am forever crying and quarrelling , she thought , and all the time he has understood !
0	thundered the judge impressively
0	and so it got put off
0	i ’ m old enough to take what ’ s happened in my stride , said grand-mother jia
0	at the conclusion of the last chapter we mentioned the unexpected summons which he received towards the end of this period from grandmother jia
0	the four girls went their way , and bao-yu set off for grandmother jia ’ s apartment
0	it was trinket who stole it
0	dai-yu now remembered what had passed between them on the previous day
0	when the three of them arrived in grandmother jia ’ s apartment , the old lady was talking to bao-yu and the girls -such conversations , enlivened by much joking and laughter , being nowadays her principal source of amusement
0	sometimes in the intervals between quarrelling , if she was feeling cheerful , jin-gui would gather a few people together to play at dice or cards
0	simultaneously with this arrival , lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife had come to announce that the selection and purchase of twenty-four little nuns—twelve buddhist and twelve taoist—had been successfully accomplished
0	his rebuff came as a disappointment to crimson too ,
0	can you really not tell the difference ?
0	i ’ ll be all right , said bao-yu
0	when he entered the hall were the others were assembled and went up to greet his grandmother and his mother , it really was as if a phoenix had appeared
0	really , you should be ashamed of yourself !
0	having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction , she served him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup
0	the old lady blazed
0	ke-qing was the name they called me back at home when i was a little girl
0	you don ’ t know the histry of our xing family , dear boy
0	before turning to the myth itself , it will therefore be necessary to define these terms
0	patience was obliged to take the money from her
0	this impression is immediately undermined , however
0	it won ’ t be clean there , she said , with her scarcely yet cold
0	it seems to me that if the maids i ’ ve got are adequate , i might as well do without the other one
0	of course i wasn ’ t too hasty
0	it was reported meanwhile that amber and the other maids had arrived from the temple , and they entered and amid much weeping exchanged greetings with the rest of the household
0	tell me , said the judge , were you sitting drinking with the defendant at the time of the crime ?
0	then after an interval of twelve years or more she suddenly had another son
0	best not encourage him
0	no wonder they say venery and thievery sharpen the wits , she thought
0	but would you believe it , before a fortnight had gone by he had completely lost inter¬est
0	but looking back , i can see that it ’ s brought him nothing but bad luck
0	i shan ’ t be able to treat you like a sister any more , i shall have to say sir when i speak to you i ’
0	the day two earths shall bear a single tree ,
0	i ’ m not surprised you are cross
0	that ’ s a much bigger job
0	this is the satanic , the manichean , and the magical error , which believes in the possibility of an artificial life—etymologically we could call it a technological life—beyond and apart from the creator : yet art thou still but faustus , and a man
0	don ’ t forget : wait a bit after i ’ ve gone before going yourself ; then -no one should suspect anything
0	she ’ s waiting to ask you about something
0	after some moments it came back to her
0	she knew that the south numberranch likens the world to an ant-heap and tells a tale of power and glory which turns out in the end to have been a dream

0	when this worthy had elicited the information that the hae¬morrhage inquired about had been caused by a blow , he seemed less disposed to take a serious view of the case , merely naming some pills and giving perfunctory instructions for taking them internally and for applying them in solution as a poultice
0	stay in the room while i ’ m gone , will you ?
0	since you have grown up here in the capital , you have never had a chance to visit your old home in nanking
0	she said with a smile
0	jia zheng : well : what precisely are you suggesting ?
0	tell our buyer to pick out ginseng of the very best quality
0	in both cases , as in postmodernist philosophy as a whole , the objective world dissolves in a sea of representation
0	oh , anyhow , said bao-yu
0	oh mrs lian , put in a good word for me with lord yama !
0	the only thing now is for you to send someone to the local yamen and demand our goods back
0	the most striking difference between their view of the subject and ours is ethical
0	why should this rapt enjoyment end in sorrow ,
0	do you really believe your undoubted charms meant so very much to him ?
0	if you go on from there , the danger is that you may produce something forced and mechanical , which instead of offsetting the beauty of your line will merely spoil it
0	do you think i want you to be any less close to her because of me ?
0	by coincidence it happened that about this time a dozen or more important events - promotions , demotions , marriages , deaths and the like - occurred in rapid succession among the group of aristocratic and official families connected by matrimonial or other ties with the ning-guo and rong-guo jias , and for days on end lady wang ’ s time was taken up with visits of condolence or felicitation
0	he arrived to find her in the middle of a game of cards with lady wang , and real¬ized to his relief that it could be nothing as serious as he had feared
0	you ’ d better not imitate her , said bao-yu
0	mr lian is a busy man , and not all the people in his household are to be trusted
0	he approached and looked more closely
0	the family has not got any friends or relations as poor as that
0	lin told them to open up , and asked them what had happened
0	in view of the mitigating circum¬stances of family loyalty , your offence will be overlooked in this instance
0	we can ’ t have you mooning around like this !

0	she had got no farther than the

0	she collapsed on to a near-by rockery and crouched there , the words turning over and over in her mind :
0	she pre¬tended to be seeing the liu family ’ off , and then at the last minute jumped into the carriage herself
0	i loved you for five years , she said
0	however , lessing ’ s note reveals that
0	even if she did , what would all the other people in the garden say ?
0	the reason for the summons will be revealed in the chapter
0	its power has now been restored
0	the point was taken and tan-chun sat down again , where¬upon the blind ballad-singers , who had tagged along with the others , began tuning their instruments for a birthday ode
0	the two of them busied themselves for some minutes grinding ink and softening a brush
0	unmindful of your master ’ s doom
0	throughout this jia zheng said nothing , though he was cut to the quick by the old man ’ s words
0	neoplatonists like pico della mirandola and marsiglio ficino also contended that ritual magic could release the hidden powers of nature without diabolical assistance
0	chai is absolutely right
0	feeling somewhat superfluous , she left the apartment and went out to the inner gate , where she asked the pages to look for tealeaf , so that she could find out what had hap¬pened
0	not all the girls can be called to court like your elder sis¬ter , you know
0	the other day , when they were making up a present for one of her ladyship ’ s relations that had just had a baby , there were four or five of our buyers out scouring the markets for eggs
0	on this occasion , her conclusions were more gratifying than usual
0	a distinct little tap !
0	unfortunate caltrop is battered by
0	bao-yu did not seem keen to pursue the matter :
0	one of the imperial concubines has passed away , and there ’ s to be a three-day recess at court
0	said the literary gentlemen
0	i said we should have no truck with such women
0	why did he let you come today then ?
0	and look at all the things that grandmother has
0	jia qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance
0	as it turned out , some local loafers had already pulled them down
0	now that he ’ s older , he ’ s given that up and turned manager
0	the words were for tealeaf , but the look which accom¬panied them was directed at the soft-voiced maid , who was still standing there
0	lady wang again reflected for some moments
0	turn and turn about
0	ying-chun pays her debt to fate , and returns
0	the other day i sent out lai sheng ’ s wife to have the boy ’ s fortune told
0	if you feel like bringing a largesse , twenty or thirty thousand taels would do very nicely !
0	to tell you the truth , it was i who gave these two pavilions their names
0	dai-yu , then , as she stood plunged in her own private sor¬rowing , suddenly heard the sound of another person crying bitterly on the rocks above her
0	she herself was most anxious to know the latest news , and while she lay , awake that night she decided to go and see nightingale first thing in the morning
0	by evening however , she seemed easier again
0	i sent the money back to her , but she wouldn ’ t take it - said i should keep it to buy myself a drink with
0	i ’ ll kotow to you - if she finds the answer , i ’ ll be indebted to you for a lifetime !
0	what really worries me is the possibility of one or two large items of expenditure turning up which we hadn ’ t been expecting

0	mrs lian said her old ladyship wants bao-yu to marry one of his cousins , and her mind is quite made up , so any other proposals are a waste of time
0	grandmother jia told xi-feng about the zhang pro¬posal
0	who is this friend of yours ?
0	bao-yu noticed that her eyes were red from crying
0	so saying , he called for a servant to take the child indoors , while he himself took yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study , where his boy served them both with tea
0	he merely laughed , therefore , and answered nightingale with a jest
0	i told her straight out that she couldn ’ t , but then the old women on the side gate turned round and gave me some cheek , and begged her to come in
0	i shall have to do as the cicada does when he jumps out of his skin : give them something to put them off the scent— ’
0	she had evidently found this a place where her eccentricities would be tolerated and where she would be safe from molestation by those having the power to persecute her

0	her mother , continuing the pursuit , slipped on the moss and fell over , to the great delight of oriole and the other two
0	without this hill , jia zheng somewhat otiosely observed , the whole garden would be visible as one entered , and all its mystery would be lost
0	his arrival at the ning mansion had been reported some time ago and he was expected any moment at rong-guo house
0	then she ’ ll be able to cook the colours and eat them

0	what am i going to do then ?

0	lady wang nodded , smiled and said :
0	dai-yu was now wide awake again and started coughing
0	outwardly she seems kind and virtuous , but she is treacherous and cunning under¬neath
0	now that the weather was getting warmer , it did not need a great deal doing to it - beyond moving in one or two pieces of furniture - to turn it into a comfortable office for the young managers
0	xi-feng ’ s failure to take adequate steps for procuring her husband an heir had for some time now been a source of anxiety to lady wang , for she knew that her niece ’ s reputation must be suffering as a consequence
0	this notion retains some of its novelty when marlowe ’ s barabas expresses it : i hope our credit in the custome-house / will serve as well as i were present there ( – )
0	she selected me for night duty in the outer room at green delights because she thought that , going to live in the big , empty garden he might get frightened at night
0	you see that burner on the table over there ?
0	if it wasn ’ t any of them , it was probably dr cui ’ s adenophora kidney pills
0	does your father mind what friends you have ?
0	oh , if only you knew !
0	he thought he would write a couple of introductory letters for yu-cun to take with him to the capital , and arrange for him to call on the family of an official be was acquainted with who might be able to put him up ; but when he sent a servant to invite him over , the servant brought back word from the temple as follows :
0	where is the party ?
0	after the twelfth day the smallpox goddess was ceremoniously ushered off the premises , the entire family joined in a service of thanks¬giving to heaven and the ancestors , and there was much burn¬ing of incense in discharge of vows made on the child ’ s behalf by various of its members , and much exchanging of congratulations and paying out of rewards
0	there was a general outcry , pleas for mercy , women down on their knees begging
0	you know , we country folk like to get a picture at the new year that we can stick up on the wall
0	she was very upset
0	bound demons seem to writhe in the tortured rock-shapes ; in the trees ’ black shadows wild things pullulate
0	in the absence of conclusive evidence as to her ultimate fate , it would be futile for us to speculate on that subject
0	er-jie advanced to meet her as she entered the courtyard and dropped her a low curtsey , adopting , in the first words
0	there ’ s no need to look for it any longer , she told patience
0	but her family must not be offended
0	when they had finished eating , they sat talking over their tea or playing games
0	each day nightingale went over three or four times to tell grand¬mother jia , but faithful , judging the old lady ’ s attitude towards dai-yu to have hardened of late , intercepted her reports and hardly mentioned dai-yu to her mistress
0	and , a little later ,
0	faustus ’ s opening monologue gives a precise and exhaustive location of magic within sixteenth-century academic discourse
0	presently a little maid arrived from xi-feng summoning patience to return ; but patience told the girl to go back without her and tell her mistress that she was being detained by miss shi
0	jia lian cursed hu jun-rong bitterly when they told him
0	she is my sister-in-law
0	now look here , said grandmother jia , i shan ’ t want you to stand and wait on me
0	just see what she ’ s doing , and if she asks about me , tell her i ’ m all right
0	it is certainly true , said li wan , that since ancient times many men have renounced worldly rank and riches to become buddhas or saints
0	there is no need for you to expose yourself to any further upsets
0	well then , said grannie liu , let us agree on a time , and then i ’ ll tell my son-inaw to send a cart for you both
0	bao-yu glanced back and saw that it was caltrop
0	it would be better to die than that such a thing should happen
0	not long afterwards dai-ru came over to say that as this was his first day he could leave early
0	and if you have any enemies , you will be in a position now to make them look very silly
0	of course not , sir , said feng , with her grace to pro¬tect your interests at court , with such enviable connec¬tions and such a host of relations , and with a family that from lady jia down to the younger generation has such an impeccable record
0	along with the rest , had been invited to stay on for a few days and happened to be at hand during this interview
0	don juan : i believe that two and two make four , sganarelle , and four and four make eight
0	the catholics denied this allegation , pointing out that they regard the ceremony as only the instrumental and not the principal cause of grace , but luther believed this defense was refuted by their practice of not administering the sign of the wine to the laity
0	as for herself , although jia zheng and lady wang were not directly affected by recent events , bao-chai could see that the jia family was nevertheless crumbling around her , while her own husband continued to behave in as moronic and helpless a fashion as ever
0	passing round the screen and through a small reception hall beyond it , they entered the large courtyard of the man¬sion ’ s principal apartments
0	i am afraid it is not as you imagine
0	li wan was just bracing herself to intervene and make the peace when a maid came rushing in and announced :
0	number a vase ( each one a collector ’ s piece and each different from the rest ) containing the three friendswinter ’ or riches in a jade hall ’ or some other flower arrangement , mostly of fresh flowers that had been specially forced for the occasion
0	think of lao lai-zi in the twenty-four patterns of filial piety , dressing up in children ’ s clothes at the age of seventy and playing at dicky-bird in front of his aged parents to keep them amused
0	when he gets back from school lie settles straight down to his texts and compositions all on his own , and never goes to bed till the small hours
0	if you see any of the servants misbehaving , let me know
0	i would give my soul for that !
0	she picked up a brush and proceeded , writing rapidly and without a pause , to set down the poem that was already com¬pleted in her mind
0	you could do that by making up verb-object or concrete-abstract tides in which chrysanthemums was the concrete noun or the object of the verb as the case might be
0	when , with all due respect for his years and distinction , he was invited to be more explicit , despite the fact that he was unable to present any evidence except that he felt it in his bones , he nevertheless stuck firmly to his statement
0	after run¬ning his eye over it , cousin zhen handed it to a servant
0	but bao-chai was impatient of punctilio
0	bao-yu was still able to get about , and managed to greet his grandmother presentably , with aroma at his side prompting him at every turn
0	mr lian has got it firmly fixed in his mind that i am the sort of jealous woman who can not tolerate a rival
0	then , first thing tomor¬row , master ke must get himself a good scrivener , some¬one well-versed in legal terminology
0	it ’ s nothing to do with me
0	well , did mr bao talk in his sleep last night ?
0	said jia zheng with a scornful smile
0	you never know , tan , said dai-yu
0	the first eight of these poems have historically verifiable subjects , but what about the last two ?
0	you-shi could see at a glance that the monastery ’ s accommodation was far too cramped for the lying-in-state ; on the
0	tell them to bring it here
0	since satanic consciousness thinks in such literalistic , magical terms , god reveals the involvement of sign and referent to satan by literally , magically , transforming him into a serpent
0	it ’ s just that you destroy your health by carrying on in this way
0	it ’ s very overcast again , said musk , when bao-yu ’ s toilet had been completed
0	let ’ s all have two more cups of wine and then eat our dirmer
0	you may think it ’ s the poverty that appals me
0	as regards the lycoperdon snow , that was something that bao-yu had got from outside
0	aroma filled some extra large cups with wine and put a selection of the delicacies on the little dishes on to a large plate to give to the old women who had been all this time on duty
0	i never for one moment imagined that we were in such a precarious state
0	the spectacle is an independent image that grows out of a market in commodities and , according to claude levi-strauss , the objectification of women grows from a similar system of exchange
0	dostoevsky is unequivocal , however , in his insistence that such ideas are satanic , and that to succumb to them is to commit the fatal error of faust
0	when she heard that he was at lady wang ’ s she became most anxious and sent a maid to eavesdrop , who returned to inform her that qiao-jie and grannie liu were both there talking , having just arrived back together
0	this hollow under the steps will do
0	where friends are met your feast to celebrate
0	that ’ s why nightingale has set herself so violently against me - out of loyalty to her mistress
0	no , i ’ m afraid whatever jobs there might have been at the ministry have nearly all gone
0	don ’ t forget , if you change your minds , i ’ m sure we can come to some agreement about the price
0	was ordained ; so now this parting
0	jia rong ’ s sole task was to supervise the making of objects in gold and silver
0	a word from you and i know i should be completely cured !
0	she got up and , leaning on bao-yu ’ s shoulder , led the way
0	it was too well-reasoned
0	i know they ’ re only slaves , but marriage is for a lifetime , after all
0	tomorrow at dawn bell you can start leaving town at intervals and wait for me at seven mile bank
0	grandmother jia ordered some of the servants to go back to the house with him and get him comfortably settled , adding that they might return with him later when he was rested ; but qin-shi , the little wife of jia rong , smilingly proposed an alternative
0	you don ’ t deceive me with your goings-on
0	your love for me has been in vain
0	when they were all in the old lady ’ s pre¬sence ; but you wouldn ’ t believe me , would you ?
0	the farm at sweet-rice village may be only a plaything and not meant for serious cultivation , but if she were in charge of all those vegetable and paddy strips and doing the things that needed doing at the proper times , we should probably get a lot more out of it
0	we have seen how dai-yu , on reaching the entrance of the naiad ’ s house , and on hearing nightingale ’ s cry of relief , slumped forward , vomited blood and almost fainted
0	any doubts xi-feng still harboured about the favourable reading of the omen were dispelled by their unanimous acceptance of it
0	it ’ s time to go home and rest
0	bao-chai had her own cause for grief
0	it wasn ’ t me they had offended
0	i ’ ve no hold over her any more than you now , it seems
0	iron crutch li , replied adamantlna
0	were it not better done as others use
0	my real job
0	and jia rui looks into the wrong side of the mirror
0	i heard that these trees had already been struck by the blight for almost a year how do you explain the fact that half-dead trees should start flowering now , at such an odd time of the year ?
0	dai-yu lowered her head in silence
0	i saw your mother go out of the garden just now ; that ’ s why i shut the gate
0	you can leave that to the menfolk
0	one by one the others who had heard the news began to arrive , among them tan-chun , who immediately gave orders for the garden gate to be shut and sent an old serv¬ing-woman and two maids on another comprehensive search , announcing to everyone present
0	in the middle of the tenth month , jia qin arrived as usual with the monthly allowance
0	one bends this-a-way , one turns that-a-way one
0	no matter , said granule lin
0	mrs lian ’ s condition is critical , but she is still alive , and mr and mrs bao should wait a while
0	this identity was shad-owy , and still in the process of formation
0	all we want from you is a few words
0	if ; thanks to your en¬couragement , he turns out as you say , we shall count ourselves truly fortunate
0	of course you are right , said lady wang promptly
0	he thought that the eucharist ’ s value was innate , rather than symbolic
0	i have come especially to bring you this news , aunt
0	the painter did not merit death who botched that lovely face
0	aroma and the maids could see that a confrontation was
0	he ’ d be too scared then not to play along
0	in something big like a funeral , you have to spend money if you want things done properly
0	is one only allowed to play with you , said bao-yu , and keep you amused ?
0	bao-chai argued with herself that the cause lay in the loss of his magic jade , but aroma was less philosophical , and frequently took him to task :
0	in the colonies , therefore , witches were prosecuted for fraud but not for witchcraft
0	oh there ’ s very little the matter with him
0	well , if it ’ s as you say , grannie , and being as you ’ ve al¬ready seen this lady , why not go there yourself and spy out the land for us ?
0	certainly we keep it for you , said aroma
0	this generalized conception of labor power as subjective interaction with the objective environment includes the psychological processes of desire and demand , as well as the physical activity of productive labor
0	to xue pan she explained that xiang-lian was in any case beyond the reach of his vengeance
0	i didn ’ t say anything , said nightingale
0	as soon as i ’ ve finished this cord for it , you can take the old one off and put it on
0	i can ’ t think of anything , said bao-yu , unless i did quite like that soup we had once with the little lotus-leaves and lotus-pods in it
0	what is your errand , boy ?
0	she asked me what master bao was doing , said the nannie , so i told her that he and the young ladies were starting a poetry club or some such
0	he could not remember any of the other classics at all ; but fortunately his father had so far never asked him to study them , so probably it would not matter
0	never mind about all that !
0	you can ’ t make them run to and fro fetching and carrying things for you
0	this patience agreed to do and went on her way
0	grandmother jia then questioned nightingale , but she had no idea who it was that had upset dai-yu
0	i need to have a few eggs by me in case of emergency
0	but it seems that i was wrong
0	she asked , turning away from the offender but giving her no indication that she might go
0	miss patience is mrs lian ’ s number one
0	you said it had something to do with a pawnshop
0	come over and pour some in this basin , will you ?
0	i wouldn ’ t say this as a rule because i don ’ t want to make her conceited , and in any case the younger ones might not agree with me : but tell me now—as older married women you have all had a good deal to do with her - have you ever met anyone quite as thoughtful as feng ?
0	i might as well be a widow !
0	far from advocating a coherent and unambiguous religious position , he claims , faust is situated at the centre of a violently divided universe
0	she had already left when patience looked in to see what the trouble was
0	we weren ’ t all that far away from you , either , and you certainly aren ’ t deaf
0	whereas the bible asserts that providence may override human prediction , bestowing on events an ulterior significance that demands interpretation , juan takes a purely mechanical and quantified view of time as credit , giving it the calculability of a financial debt , and scorning the subjective intentionality that guarantees a promise
0	when faustus hears he is to see a parade of the seven deadly sins , he exclaims [ t ] hat sight will be as pleasing unto me as paradise was to adam the first day of his creation ( )
0	we can ’ t allow you to go spending money on us
0	he goes about constructing this framework quite mechanically , beginning with the names of his pair of young lovers and invariably adding a third character , a servant or the like , to make mischief between them , like the chou in a comedy
0	looking at her , bao-yu could almost imagine skybright come back from the dead
0	there ’ s something important i have to tell you
0	it came as a great relief to bao-yu that she should speak to him at all , and he was grateful of the chance to remedy his earlier blunder
0	that ’ s rather a strange way to talk , said you-shi , laughing
0	it is always hard when a daughter goes out into the world and gets married
0	soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of aroma ’ s medicine
0	one by one all my sisters and cousins have been taken away from me !
0	i must claim the quoter ’ s privilege of giving only as much of the text as will suit my purpose , said tan-chun
0	i ’ ve never even heard of such terrible goings-on as these
0	the young mistresses ’ maids are by no means the worst , said wang shan-bao ’ s wife
0	bao-yu moved over from his seat and sat down beside her on the bed
0	grannie liu invoked the lord buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view
0	in the end i had to hand in my notice
0	i think much the most satisfactory arrangement would be to betroth him to your cousin lin here
0	but when they looked at the poems , this is what they read
0	why didn ’ t you get him to bring these too and save yourself some trouble ?
0	then jia zheng went in to see the womenfolk
0	the outcome was that a set of planks costing five hundred taels and obtained by him on credit were delivered from the timber-merchant ’ s that evening
0	we ’ re much obliged to you for all the trouble you ’ ve gone to , mr yun , they muttered sarcastically
0	bao-yu hurriedly sent someone off to fetching zhong , who was riding along behind his father ’ s sedan
0	in its anxious civic nationalism , the play labors to remove from the london shopkeeper the stigma of emasculation and self-prostitution
0	bao-yu of an imagined friend
0	she should be too scared to take advantage of the wife
0	obviously that wretched , worthless lian must have got hold of it from somewhere ; and you , treating it , i suppose , as a great joke , were only too happy to receive it from him
0	as a consequence of all this , vanitas , starting off in the void ( which is truth ) came to the contemplation of form ( which is illusion ) ; and from form engendered passion ; and by communicating passion , entered again into form ; and from form awoke to the void ( which is truth )
0	you ’ d better hurry up and send this unspeakable creature about his business , said xi-feng to jia rong from her carriage
0	their walk seemed to take them quite suddenly to a place where only thorn-trees grew and wolves and tigers prowled around in pairs
0	usury is a kind of lending of money , or corne , or oyle , or wine , or of any other thing , wherein , upon covenant and bargaine , we receive againe the whole principall which we delivered , and somewhat more , for the use and occupying of the same ; as if i lend pound , and for it covenant to receive pound , or any other summe , greater then was the summe which i did lend : this is that which we call usury : such a kind of bargaining as no good man , or godly man ever used
0	to an image , which i know ,
0	of course he ’ ll meet his commitments
0	are you going to leave it till it is too late ?
0	of course it ’ s not being held here
0	don ’ t worry about anything here
0	as she was speaking , several of the girls arrived to see qiao-jie
0	the two younger men stepped forward to salute him
0	edward : coler to see the traitors gree so well made me think the shadows substances
0	the two of them can keep each other company
0	you ’ ve led us a fine old dance !
0	you keep to the path , though , with the rest
0	he and his mother , whose earlier resentment against xiang-lian had been completely banished by her gratitude to him for saving her son ’ s life , spoke eloquently of their indebtedness , and when the conversation turned to the subject of xiang-lian ’ s marri-
0	if you can think who it might have been , i should go and ask them
0	the necessary funds were simply not forthcoming
0	he deemed it safest not to dispute with her , however , but merely to agree with everything she said
0	in this play , the yeallow toothd , sunck-eyde , gowtie shankt vsurer mammon gives shrewd but selfish advice to sir edward fortune , whose daughter he aspires to marry : i am your friend , in hope your sonne in lawe , / and from my loue i speake , you keep too great a house , / go too you do , yon same dry throated huskes / will suck you vp
0	it tells the story of chang e , who comes down to earth from her palace in the moon and is about to give her hand to her mortal lover when the goddess of mercy opens her eyes to the truth , and she dies before the marriage can take place
0	don ’ t judge me too harshly
0	get along with you , little monkey i ’ said aunt xue , laugh¬ing
0	we ’ re only enjoying ourselves : the wine has been a very small part of it
0	let dr faustus do his worst
0	wild-fig ’ and wistaria ’ was all the literary gentlemen would venture
0	it would look pretty stupid if you were to send them off for something they have already got
0	silent , they seem to pray
0	mr zhen wants you , sir
0	how de¬lightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates !
0	jia lian , also in a small , plain carrying-chair , arrived shortly afterwards
0	i already know you well enough—that is how i ’ ll achieve my goal ( )
0	bassanio does not understand that shylock is employing the term march ,
0	take him back his money this instant !
0	but what about you ?
0	a little better , ma ’ am
0	when she and the cousins entered lady wang ’ s main recep¬tion room , they found it packed with people
0	and by applying the whip he made his horse shoot on ahead , and presently , after a couple of turns , had left the city gate behind him
0	aroma : i don ’ t understand
0	it was smelling your beautiful perfume that put me in mind of the allusion
0	pebble or pearl - to shi chong it was only a rich man ’ s whim :
0	isn ’ t it time you grew up and ac¬quired a little self-esteem ?
0	dai-yu , still crying , saw what he was going to do
0	i thought old mother ma could help me get my own back but that was all money wasted : it didn ’ t work , nobody died
0	said grannie liu in some surprise
0	dai-yu rose and fled
0	i did not want to do it , says patience , you made me
0	of all the mean
0	consequently , the cruel and perverse humours , unable to circulate freely in the air and sunlight , subside , by a process of incrassation and coagulation , into the bottoms of ditches and ravines
0	but you seem to be saying that we may not even last another year !
0	if jia lian loved her and her brother-in-law was prepared to give her away , what possible objection could she have to the marriage ?
0	you ’ re the one who should stop and think a minute
0	cousin zhen and jia lian withdrew
0	i don ’ t know whether i ought to tell you , said aroma
0	musk threw nineteen with the dice , which made it caltrop ’ s turn to draw
0	shortly after this , when bao-chai and bao-qin had gone off to aunt xue ’ s place and xiang-yun had gone to see grand¬mother jia and dai-yu had gone back to her own room to rest , bao-yu went after dai-yu to question her
0	just say what comes naturally
0	but can you be so sure , miss ?
0	if you insist on making an example of him , i dare not do much to dissuade you
0	his new feeling of happy anticipation had caused a general improvement in his health , though his manner of speech remained rather eccentric at times
0	practice , and now my fingers are all overgrown with brambles , as they say !
0	mwaura takes a materialist view of the subject , equating the soul with the physical organ of the heart
0	surely they can ’ t all have gone to bed ?
0	after a few preliminary words of reprimand jia lian called forward lai da , the chief steward
0	i do not wish to sound gloomy or bring her bad luck , but i fear she has small hope of recovery , poor child
0	what could be better than dewy orchids ?
0	and do not mock the reader ’ s tearsscrivener : th ’ have bin so bit already with taking up commodities of browne paper , buttons past fashion , silkes , and sattins , babies , and childrens fiddles , with like trash tooke up at a deare rate , and sold for trifles that now scarce one will bite
0	luckily word of the disaster had as yet reached neither grandmother jia nor jia zheng
0	from the superior quality of her dress and general air of refinement er-jie could guess who she was and hurriedly rose to prevent her
0	although tan-chun would not be travelling with a complete trousseau , they should nevertheless provide her with all the personal effects she might need
0	tell him that if he wants to be a dutiful son , he ’ ll be doing more for me by leaving me my faithful , to serve me during the few years that yet remain , than if he were to come over and wait on me in person , morn¬ing , noon and night
0	she calculated now that there were two days left before the funeral procession was due to set off ; and since her hus¬band ’ s condition had been positively diagnosed as a consumption , and he was therefore in no immediate danger , she decided she must call once more
0	from her seat inside it grandmother jia could see the terrifying painted images of the temple guardians , one on each side of the inner gate , flanked by that equally ferocious pair , thousand league eye with his blue face and favourable wind ear with his green one , and farther on , the benigner forms of the city god and the little local gods
0	but just as this little party in the kitchen was beginning to warm up , it was interrupted by a sudden knocking at the gate
0	developing later than , and probably out of , the plethora of syncretic neoplatonism known to history as gnosticism , manicheanism emphasizes one gnostic idea in particular : it views matter as evil
0	it was now broad daylight , and the sun was shining in at the window
0	anyway , i don ’ t see why you need drag other people into it
0	she had not been with yu-cun more than a year when she gave birth to a son ; and a mere six months later yu-cun ’ s first wife died , whereupon lucky was promoted to fill her place and became her lady ship
0	the other eunuchs then withdrew , leaving yuan-chun ’ s ladies-in-waiting to help her from the palanquin
0	finally , just before dawn , he dozed off , only to awake again half an hour later
0	the whole affair is over and best forgotten
0	i can ’ t see that it makes any difference , said bao-chai
0	if that turns out to be true , i really have come to the end of the road !
0	they have measured off an area just over a quarter of a mile square which takes in a part of our grounds , including the all-scents garden , on the east side , and the north-west corner of your grounds on the west , to be turned into a separate residence for the visitation
0	dai-yu continued , laughing so much herself that she had to clutch her chest with both hands :
0	not that one should entirely neglect poetic composition
0	ah , dr wang and dr zhang are our regular doctors
0	before he could begin his story , however , she saw fit to give him notice that he must expect to be punished if he did not make her laugh
0	and someone go and get skybright ’ s cousin and
0	i do believe you must be one of the holy spirits born in a human shape !
0	of course , said grandmother jia
0	bao-chai saw this clearly , but pretended not to notice and hurried by with lowered eyes
0	i didn ’ t expect a thing like this to happen , she said
0	such an opportunity was altogether too tempting
0	bao-yu came running after
0	the master however is insistent that plays would be inappropriate on this occasion ; instead he will give a simple party at home , to which all family and friends are invited
0	i ’ ve already told lady wang i ’ m going , so if you others won ’ t come with me ,
0	he asked me for three roubles in advance , but made it clear that the whole operation would cost no less than fifteen hundred roubles
0	she pressed after him , casting aside her inhibitions and crying as she ran :
0	all members of the clan holding official posts were expected to contribute towards its expenses and mem¬bers of advanced years and known integrity were chosen to be its masters
0	the old woman laughed
0	i acted too hastily
0	three people is quite enough to lose in one day !
0	i will put them up
0	to refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our present prosperity is going to last for ever would be extremely short-sighted
0	he bowed before her and said :
0	she had no recollection of what they contained and could not identify the contents , but she could tell at a glance that none of them contained any ginseng
0	at the pavilion-gate you-shi and the other ladies hid them-selves behind the gate-screen from the eyes of the waiting menservants while grandmother jia got into her palanquin
0	you ’ d have to face an explosion from sir she , of course ; but you can tell him that you did it for the family , because aunt feng is unable to have a
0	well , said jia rui , i am always free
0	william burton ’ s the rowsing of the sluggard ( ) emphasizes this aspect of the vice , arguing that idleness contradicts the definitive human activity of productive interaction with the objective environment , and therefore relegates people to the status of beasts
0	jia lian laughed reassuringly
0	the two girls smiled at each other and each took a sip of wine in celebration of a successful turn
0	aunt zhao came hurtling in and clapped a hand over his mouth
0	and i ’ ve still two pots of lychees to deliver to master bao-yu from miss bao-chai
0	now look what you ’ ve done !
0	xi-feng spat in her face
0	it ’ s a shame that he looks like me ; now that i know what he ’ s like , i wish i could look different
0	we are much more conscious than our forbears of the complicity between reason and magic , and many would argue that the postmodern era—with its virtual reality , its faith in the image , its electronic money , its new age religions—is witnessing a return to the kinds of overtly magical thinking that imperialism unsuccessfully tried to stamp out in the southern hemisphere
0	judging from the long sigh he gave when he heard this , bao-yu appeared to be very much distressed
0	those two should never be allowed together , said dai-yu
0	jin-gui was the only person he feared , and as jin-gui had given her consent , he cared nothing about what anyone else might thinkhe had not even bothered to shut the door
0	when he had finished doing so , he handed it back again and kotowed
0	but if ye wil faine any person with such features , qualities or conditions , or if ye wil attribute to any humane quality , as reason or speech to dombe creatures or other insensible things , it is not prosopographia but prosopopeia , because it is by way of fiction , and no prettier examples can be given to you thereof , than in the romant of the rose , translated out of french by chaucer , describing the persons of avarice , envie , old age , and many others , wherein much moralitie is taught
0	that may be so ; but your own acrid-sweet couplet is more than a match for it
0	cousin zhen went out to meet them and conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall
0	i confesse it , yet it followeth not it should be improbable
0	i knew that their ladyships would be very angry if the got to hear of it and then it would be very unpleasant for aroma and the rest of you
0	a moment ago everyone was enjoying themselves , and now here you all are shouting at each other !
0	he finished it at one draught and immediately declared that he felt better and that his head seemed somewhat clearer
0	she ’ s waiting for her medicine to be warmed up
0	by the raindrop pavilion
0	is master bao in bed yet ?
0	no , your ladyship , please !
0	vanitas lifted his head and guffawed at this , dropped the manu¬script to the ground and went breezily on his way
0	and with prompt waterings dew the mossy pot !
0	just then bao-yu came in
0	soon they had finished their tea
0	bao-yu ’ s bride-price and miss lin ’ s dowry won ’ t involve us in any expense because
0	how would it be if i were to come every day to help you pass the time ?
0	bao yong was a straightforward sort of fellow
0	yun and i had better go over to grannie ’ s
0	this ( not because anyone understood it , but because it sounded funny ) provoked general laughter
0	i vaguely remember seeing moonbeam clear the soup away , and thinking to myself what a relief it was not to have to drink any
0	/ it is an idol , a lifeless counterfeit ( – )
0	we don ’ t need all these tables now
0	don ’ t write any more
0	just at that moment some other old women came hurrying up to them
0	with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words written for our beloved subject , jia yuan , duke of rong-guo ’ , followed by the emperor ’ s private seal , a device containing the words kingly cares ’ and royal brush ’ in archaic seal-script
0	in my home people knew their place
0	assume the dig¬nified manner of the ancients , a manner in keeping with the chosen instrument of the sages
0	that ’ s the countryman ’ s idea of a treat , said grannie liu
0	aunt xue shouted to them that they were to do no such thing
0	but he ’ s always carrying on in such a sneaky , underhand way with bao-yu , as though he thought the rest of us were all blind and couldn ’ t see what he was up to
0	i wouldn ’ t be surprised if there were more profit to be had out of them than out of anything else that this garden produces
0	you ’ re a real sport , diamond !
0	aroma was naturally alarmed to see bao-yu come back in such a state , but attributed it to the weather : it was an in-clement spring and he had gone out while overheated and exposed himself to the wind
0	the spirit tells him :
0	once inside the room , she curtseyed to dai-yu , then screwed up her eyes and peered at her curiously
0	like helen , the boy immediately disappears , as satan causes him to die an agonizing death from spinal meningitis , and the novel describes the child ’ s suffering in prolonged and excruciating detail
0	look at yourself in the mirror !
0	what unites these surrogate vices is the determination of their characters by their positions in the economic marketplace
0	have you all finished ?
0	she eventually hailed a rickety old cart
0	grandmother jia , too , left bao¬yu sound asleep and returned to her apartment for a brief rest
0	unlike the heroes of marlowe and spies , goethe ’ s faust famously soliloquizes about his sensual as well as his intellectual temptations : two souls , alas !
0	soothed by such flatteries , xi-feng forgot her weariness , and the conversation continued with animation
0	they ’ re only curious to know the latest news
0	observing the condition that bao-yu was in , she therefore had more than an inkling of what had happened
0	i can tell that something has upset her greatly
0	more obviously than even a human actor , a stage puppet is a mobile sign , the embodiment of performative representation
0	she found this interview with xi-feng acutely embarrassing
0	department op late night sobbing
0	and you a gentleman and member of a distinguished family !
0	each head , wept very bitterly herself , jia she and jia lian did their best to comfort her , and at last , when her grief had some¬what abated , she moved on , to the right of the coffin-screens , where you-shi and her daughter-in-law were waiting for her
0	although i say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past , of course i don ’ t mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average government official
0	evil spirits don ’ t behave like that at all
0	they said it had something wrong with it and they were taking it outside to be mended
0	your proposal is a very sensible one
0	then to his horror he saw that his cousins ’ had been transformed into strange ghoulish monsters and were pursuing him too
0	i ’ m sure it would be wonder¬ful experience
0	as soon as they were all inside again , bao-yu began ques¬tioning grannie liu about her interrupted story
0	surely we can do better than that !
0	and now this poem all of a sudden !
0	grandmother jia sent for xi-¬feng , told her of jia zheng ’ s decision and placed these arrangements in her hands
0	with that he walked off : but whither , or to whom , our narrative does not disclose ,
0	try again , said li wan
0	her boots were of deerskin
0	bao-yu still did not understand
0	no one made any further comment
0	you have done this , you and the others of your kind
0	the monk placed the jade in bao-yu ’ s hand
0	you are the most lustful person i have ever known in the whole world number ’
0	i asked her if she knew about bao-chai
0	as in most treatments of the legend from goethe on , the faust-figure embodies the magical elements lurking within the rational thought of the enlightenment
0	the parties were now required to affix their signature or mark to the docu¬ment , xue pan was detained until confirmation of his sentence was received , and wu liang and his guarantor were released
0	she tore the paper into tiny pieces and gave them to one of the maids :
0	he was in such a state when i got there that i didn ’ t like to leave im¬mediately
0	thought bao-yu ; but he hid his embarrassment in a stupid laugh
0	jia rui clung to him tenaciously
0	fate has brought this on us , said xi-feng , struggling for breath
0	i ’ ve got an old poetry-book that i look at once in a while when i can find the time , and i long ago noticed that in some of the poems the tone-contrast is very strict , while in others it ’ s not
0	such distinctions made no sense in sixteenth-century europe any more than they do in contemporary africa
0	any person or thing , according to aristotle , fulfills its essence by progressing toward its natural end , or telos
0	i begged her not to make me do all these things , but she insisted
0	which room would you prefer ?
0	you walked straight into the net , didn ’ t you ?
0	the other day when the question of engaging a tutor came up , father mentioned this school of yours as a possible alternative , said qin zhong
0	the historia is a direct assault on such glory
0	but if you wish to know the outcome of jia rui ’ s visit , you will have to read the next chapter
0	it ’ s true that i haven ’ t got any , said li wan , but you ought to have borrowed some from one of the young ladies to lend her
0	she turned to patience : go on , patience , your place is over there with them—with that whoremaster of yours and his other whore !
0	naturally she never expected that all this trouble would break out before she ’ d had a chance to put it back
0	so you ’ ve fallen for him have you , and think you can use me as a cover for your goings-on , is that it ?
0	in heywood ’ s play the association between usury and magic is quite explicit , as they combine to undermine the traditional social order
0	as expressed by me , the burden
0	i shall know , nevertheless , how to vanquish these silly terrors
0	this is his invariable response to the threat of divine retribution
0	d ’ you think i haven ’ t got any good lines of my own ?
0	bao-yu saw that he had hurt his feelings , and hastened to comfort him
0	everyone knows that he is a regular visitor here
0	remember , even if the worst comes to the worst , you ’ ll manage somehow or other
0	you can tell mrs liu that fivey definitely will be coming to work here
0	in the course of my duties i observed that each one of the distinguished gentlemen whom i met had in one way or another brought honour and glory to his family name
0	since you haven ’ t got any silver-shears , i should keep that piece if i were you and pick out a smaller one
0	doesn ’ t anyone love me ?
0	marlowe ’ s play closely follows spies ’ s historia in its depiction of the absurdity of this creature ’ s revolt against the creator
0	surely so small an extra expense as that is hardly going to bother them ?
0	she was just like the foreign girls you see in paint¬ings : long , yellow hair done into plaits , and her head was smothered in jewels : carnelians , cat ’ s-eyes and emeralds
0	you wait till you ’ ve seen it !
0	but then old feng arrived and it put it out of my mind ,
0	are you prepared to stand by and watch me and my huan being made mincemeat of by that scheming woman ?
0	oh , nothing much , replied aroma pointedly
0	about four hours later lai da , the chief steward of the rong-guo mansion , and three or four other stewards came panting into the inner gate and gasped out congratulations
0	i know , said jia yun
0	that ’ s the two words for the framed board on top , said jia zheng
0	they began urging bao-yu to start
0	some time was now spent in trying to guess answers to the riddles concealed in these poems , but all of their guesses were wrong
0	what ’ s it to do with you whether they want service in there or not ?
0	i ’ ll come again tomorrow , then
0	she attempted to distract attention from it by applying herself , with somewhat unnatural vigour , to the game of guess-fingers
0	in goethe , as in spies and marlowe , the apotheosis of the hyper-real spectacle is faust ’ s image of helen of troy
0	he is becoming quite a cultured young fellow
0	going ahead to inform xi-feng of his approach , she returned to usher him in , lifting the door-curtain and beckoning to him , while announcing in her most formal tone of voice :
0	just a few things for you to take back with you and show off to the neighbours
0	it had more character ’ she said
0	how fine it would be if only men would feel for virtue the devo¬tion they feel towards beauty
0	it ’ s only because of mrs lian ’ s unheard of generosity that you have been treated so well
0	the satanic perspective is the creature ’ s denial of the creator
0	you don ’ t understand , replied the other
0	on his arrival in the city he called in first at the new house in order to see er-jie , but he found the place locked and empty with only an aged caretaker in occupation
0	as in cain and manfred , byron ’ s sympathy for the diabolical shows that he has failed to understand its nature
0	suppose you were to run into someone ?
0	she said as they entered it
0	before there was always granny jia , i knew i could count on her for affection
0	you might even pick up one or two decent , respect¬able friends that way
0	lady xing thought xi-feng must be already dead and broke down again
0	bao-yu may behave foolishly in com¬pany , but when he is with our girls , or even the maids , he is always extremely considerate
0	come , we are wasting our time
0	all their written works or spoken words were of lyalty and filial piety , their entire lives were devoted to virtue and truth and were indeed a fitting tribute to the enlightened rule under which we live and a due token of gratitude for the kind and illuminating instruction bestowed upon them by their fathers and teachers alike
0	so here are the main times to remember
0	and bid them wait outside
0	when the maids saw what she was up to , they beat a hasty retreat
0	why , if it isn ’ t master bao ’ s maid , miss hua !
0	but to kill him outright that is deliberately to make me childless
0	indeed , it was a crime even if it had no effects at all ; the attempt to use magic was itself a criminal offence
0	bao-yu was for rushing off straight away
0	as long as you don ’ t get into a passion and start taking it out on things—that is the golden rule
0	li wan shook the cylinder and drew out a card
0	i can cap that line
0	this openly revealed the fact that time was the real commodity in which the usurer traded :
0	imperial use gauzes , in different shades lengths
0	that stupid caretaker is new here
0	beginning from tomorrow , i ’ ll write a hundred characters every morning
0	meanwhile the servants had begun pouring more wine so that the game could continue ; but grandmother jia intervened
0	if the viceroy speaks ill of a person , there ’ s not much hope of that person being able to defend himself , whatever the truth might he
0	don ’ t say anything about this to the others when you get home , he told xue pan
0	who delivers that formative judgment ?
0	widow jin ’ s self-iinterest gets the better of her
0	i never made the comparison , said bao-yu hotly , and i never laughed at you
0	the day is still young , he said , and i understand that bijou intends to perform a scene from the queen of the flowers ’ , their piece de resistance
0	but what though she is present in this place ?
0	bao-yu did not shed a single tear , nor did he try to offer them any solace
0	jia zheng turned to feng
0	yes , put in bao yong
0	the drink was beginning to make him sentimental - he called to them for some music , and flower sang for them in a clear , sweet voice , accompanied by lovey on the vertical bamboo flute
0	don ’ t you know how difficult things are lately ?
0	goethe ’ s gesamkunstwerk is certainly grotesque , arcane in imagery and baroque in scope , but its argument is eminently assimilated into western culture , deriving as it does from an unbroken popular tradition stretching back to the teufelbucher of the sixteenth century
0	now that the fact that today was her birthday had become public knowledge , xiu-yan was obliged to make a round of the apartments , bowing and kotowing to everybody , as bao-yu had had to do before her
0	we , grandmother ’ s own grandchildren , are despicable by comparison
0	it is something i have been uneasy about myself
0	i ’ m looking for him too , said ripple
0	it must be somewhere here
0	the cousins and maids all laughed when they heard this message
0	she ’ s grown up to be a real beauty too , has mrs lian
0	but in the end the treacherous night air betrayed me , and by morning i was lamentably indisposed
0	bao-yu was almost as startled as the bird
0	our story recommences in lady wang ’ s apartment next day
0	bao-yu dismissed the two serving-women on night-watch ; and when he was alone he sat up very quietly , said a silent prayer and then lay down again
0	skybright and the senior maids , though pretending concern and making half-hearted attempts to intervene , found it difficult not to laugh ; but aroma was genuinely distressed and dashed from one to another of them , dragging them away from aunt zhao
0	these lines do not give any details of the alleged pro-usury lobby
0	she ordered the maids to open all her boxes
0	the family servants next held a council of war among themselves :
0	well , if that ’ s all settled , xi-feng put in quickly , i ’ ve got two very reliable young men for you to take with you , qiang
0	the dowager princess of nan-an asked grandmother jia about bao-yu
0	ha , yes , that ’ ll do !
0	bao-yu felt suddenly embarrassed
0	just wait till we get home and i get my hands on you !
0	round and round it flies
0	large parts of marlowe ’ s play seem designed to appeal to the groundlings , the story remained firmly low-brow throughout the seventeenth century , and it was largely this volkisch aspect that appealed to goethe
0	patience , seeing that no one else was capable of offering an ?
0	it was followed by another splutter of laughter
0	it was very worrying
0	sir , he ventured , i have a draft apertura for your approval
0	two of our pawnshops have been sold and we have already spent the money from the sale , while the manager of the other pawnshop has run off with thousands of taels and we ’ re involved in another court case over that
0	when there ’ s good luck then enjoy it while you can
0	we heard the shouting , but couldn ’ t see anyone , and when we came to look , the things had already gone
0	the trouble is that behind our magnificent facade things are going from bad to worse
0	if she wants me , tell her i ’ ll be back directly
0	the inability to grasp the referential aspect of signification epitomizes the satanic perspective
0	henry jones puts it in the introduction to his edition of the english faust-book , what principally fuelled the public interest in faustus during this period was the climactic intensification of the german witch craze ( ) , and theodore ziolkowski concurs that the myth of faustus is at least partially a product of the trials for witchcraft
0	you can do hui-ming takes the letter from the western chamber
0	aroma would have done so too , but sky-bright drew her to one side and advised her against joining them
0	she turned to one of the maids : come on ’ now !
0	at this the mattress began to grow even more reckless in her incitements and jia lian to reveal the more disgusting of his sexual accomplishments
0	don ’ t feel bitter towards me !
0	xi-chun was now more miserable than ever
0	but to the usurer it becomes real
0	say that something has been lost and that no one can go out until it ’ s found
0	i ’ ve got red moon-flower
0	do you want me to kneel down again ?
0	when i get hack , i shall do my best to stop them
0	no , said the cousin ’ s wife , beginning to feel nervous
0	tears were welling in patience ’ s eyes
0	oh , that seems rather hard !
0	by this time patience was fast asleep and xi-feng herself was on the point of dropping off when she became dimly aware that qin-shi had just walked into the room from outside
0	our chief concern is that you may overtax yourself , embarking on such a strenuous journey at your age
0	in an alarum for usurers ( ) lodge distinguishes the usurer from other merchants on the grounds that he trades in nothing : but as among a trée of fruite there bée some withered fallings , and as among wholesome hearbes there growes some bitter colloquintida : so it can not be , but among such a number of marchaunts , there shoulde bee some , that degenerate from the true name and nature of marchaunts
0	xi-feng , on the other hand , dropped me shrewishness she had up to then been showing as soon as she saw them come and , breaking quickly away , ran weeping to grandmother jia
0	jia zheng took his leave
0	one way and another , we must have paid out at least thirty taels by now , and from what i can see , it was money down the drain
0	she ’ s only a bit of bought goods herself
0	this type of kidnapper specializes in kidnapping very young girls and rearing them until they are twelve or thirteen for sale in other parts of the country
0	the first person to venture out of the room was lady xing
0	and there we leave her
0	he sent someone to fetch various objects of his to give to jia huan as a reward and smilingly patted him on the head
0	as grandmother jia , clasping a little bundle of burning joss sticks with both her hands , knelt down for the incense-offering , the entire congregation of men and women , rank upon rank of them , close-packed as flowers in a flower-bed , knelt down in perfect time with her and proceeded to go through the motions of the great obeisance
0	white autumn ’ s sister stands beside the door ;
0	the date we ’ ve chosen is the fourteenth , said lai da ’ s wife hurriedly , before her mother-inaw had a chance to get under way again
0	uncle zheng has apparently been im¬peached by the viceroy !
0	that bird must have come here when the tree was in
0	because the implications of usury were so wide ranging , each tract or fictional treatment of the subject tends to discuss a variety of topics , march ,
0	that ’ s all very well , but i can ’ t do it just anyhow
0	i expect you ’ re making it up , but you may as well tell me
0	the deeds which appear to the magician to be effected by his signs and rituals are in actuality carried out by the devil , and to believe that such signs do things is to give oneself up to satan
0	the usurer admits that his arts and the broker ’ s are march ,
0	it ’ s shocking how people treat their friends nowadays , isn ’ t it !
0	after that the three of them settled down and went to sleep again
0	he threw the book down as jia yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming smile
0	this woman takes her money and then doesn ’ t treat her properly
0	this set them all off laughing
0	well i ’ m here on her old ladyship ’ s orders
0	resolved to end her own life at the first opportunity , she mounted a carriage and set off for home
0	we must get the young ladies ready as quickly as possible , and take them back to town
0	there ’ s no hope left then !
0	it sounded as if an outer casement had somehow come unfastened and fallen into the bamboos
0	now xue pan was very inconstant in his affections , always blowing east one day and west the next
0	just wait until i ’ ve won some of my money back !
0	zhang hua admitted that jia rong was the person in question , whereupon the censor , very much against his inclination , had to issue a summons for jia rong
0	if you get yourself thrown out of there , you needn ’ t think you can get in anywhere else , because you could easier fly to the moon than find another place like that
0	your good luck will shelter him from any such influ¬ences , now that he is here
0	presently she saw aunt xue and bao-chai arrive
0	fluttering like the wing-beats of a startled swan ,
0	where have you just come from ?
0	shall i have him called in now straight away , or shall i let him wait a bit ?
0	i have experienced it !
0	the charges in the indictment were dismissed and zhang hua was sentenced to be flogged and driven from the court
0	of course , everyone in the inner family will be expected to take part
0	don ’ t ask me about that , please !
0	the maxim nought out of nought assumes a natural economy , but in march ,
0	proceed on that basis , and declare whatever is in sir she ’ s compound
0	i am afraid this is just a trick to make us all drunk
0	she ’ s a caution all right , and no mistake !
0	it must be a maid from one of the apartments , thought bao-yu
0	we need have no fears , said jia she , resuming the pre¬vious topic of conversation
0	she was furious , of course : thought i was doing far too well out of it
0	she waited until they were about to get into their carriages on the morning of the fifteenth before revealing to her companions what their actual destination was to be
0	we must prepare the betrothal-card
0	what ’ s this lump here then ?
0	but she , on a tryst with eternity , brooking no coarctation has abandoned me , cruel , here in the dust to be ,
0	xi-feng dried her eyes
0	only xiang-yun was tactless enough to say anything :
0	i trust none of the facts and figures were wrong , aunt , said xi-feng
0	first of all , replied xi-feng , whether bao-yu knows anything yet or not , we let it be known that sir zheng proposes to betroth him to miss lin
0	seeing the way things were , the family now dared not pursue the matter any further even if they wanted to , and were obliged to digest in silence whatever they might feel of grief or anger
0	li wan then asked grandmother jia and lady wang to retire to the inner room , which they did , still weeping
0	i served miss lin for a long time , and as you know , ma ’ am , she treated me with a kindness that i shall never be able to repay
0	jia zheng turned a pair of wild and bloodshot eyes on him as he entered
0	let us turn instead to young xue , the man who purchased yingian and had feng yuan beaten to death
0	the contradiction sprang from the empirically observable fact that not all legal slaves were natural slaves , while many legally free people were
0	we two shan ’ t be drinking any wine , bao-yu said to the ladies
0	i hope you do pass !
0	after a long while she coughed up another mouthful of phlegm
0	very probably i shall die before you
0	to be as an object to all mens eies
0	the people at the yamen know how rich we are , ma ’ am , and master ke says we ’ ll have to use family con-nections here in the capital , and send another large bribe , if we ’ re to get a rehearing and a lighter sentence
0	he summarized the geopolitical impact of his work in a recent interview :
0	instead , it uses words to refer to and invoke a spirit
0	it wasn ’ t because of that i came ; it was just that i thought there might be something you needed me for
0	prove a peasant by asking for a ride on his haycart and , being rebuffed by the buzzardly ass , makes the wheels disappear ( )
0	and she dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief
0	aroma heard him calling his own name in his sleep and shook him awake
0	the paradigmatic heretical belief , for christianity , is that satan ’ s power is independent of god ’ s , and this is precisely the error that milton ’ s satan commits
0	are we to be at everyone ’ s beck and call ?
0	go back to my room and tell miss shi that we ’ ve got a beautiful foreigner here who can write poems in chinese
0	your wine will be getting cold
0	yours is also a fine aspiration
0	the fact that many activities considered usurious were legal , and indeed had been legal in some form in virtually all historical civiliza-tions , caused significant problems for the anti-usury campaigners
0	the drumming recommenced and the branch , starting from jia theng , began circulating again
0	fivey was deeply grateful
0	give the mother forty strokes , turn her out of the garden , and make sure that she is never employed inside the inner gate again
0	and it was not , in fact , until they had all rinsed out their mouths and washed their hands that another lot of tea was served , this time for drinking
0	put in xi-feng before aroma had finished speaking
0	by the looks of it she ’ s perfectly capable of scaring herself !
0	san-jie leaped to her feet and , pointing her finger at jia lian from where she stood on the kang , fixed him with a withering look of contempt
0	no , it is really not that serious , said xi-feng
0	and as if that wasn ’ t bad enough , you have to drag in this brat of yours , he san !
0	don ’ t take it to heart , grandmother !
0	he ’ d better not try laughing at me !
0	where have you been ?
0	luther believed that this reduced the sacrament to magic , making a fetish of the priestly ritual
0	what ’ s all this about ?
0	listen to me i if it ’ s anything else , never mind ; but if it ’ s about those little nuns —and she went on to tell him exactly what he should say in that event and to impress on him how important it was that he should say it
0	since putting his trousers on again was out of the question , aroma snatched up a lightweight coverlet and hur¬riedly threw it over him
0	i ’ m here to see to all that
0	he threw back the top cover himself
0	i wonder where destiny has taken cousin lin ?
0	nothing of interest was found in them
0	faithful and amber consoled her , helped her to her feet and escorted her back into the house
0	she turned to grannie liu
0	tomor¬row he must take a regulative draught , which i shall prescribe , and he should make a prompt and complete recovery
0	it naturally occurred to people to enquire after this enterprise ’ s purpose and source
0	but instead of waiting for her , parfumee picked the fritter up from its saucer , went over to ciggy with it , and held it under her nose for her to inspect
0	the name is taken from the inscription
0	we can all try our hands at composing
0	my son is a year younger
0	bolton denies that this is a matter of economic justice
0	who said that beautiful women are trouble-makers ?
0	adamantina leant low over the board and said to xi-chun :
0	there ’ s still just time
0	at their invitation it was drawn in through the centremost of the three gates
0	you shouldn ’ t take it for granted , retorted dai-yu
0	the clown scenes serve to parody the absurdity of such reasoning , as when robin barters his soul for a leg of beef : wagner : well , do you hear , sirrah ?
0	this suite , she told bao-yu , is not like the music-dramas of your earthly composers in which there are always the fixed parts of sheng , dan , jing , mo and so on , and set tunes in the various northern and southern modes
0	if these secular terms are rendered in the theological idiom , we might say that rushdie is a polytheist while ngugi is a monotheist
0	it ’ s nearly midnight , you two
0	she took her off into one of the maids ’ rooms , while qing-er continued playing in qiao-jie ’ s room
0	i shall wait for you at miss tan ’ s
0	i will take snowgoose with me
0	here was a situation , then , in which both parties concealed their real emotions and assumed counterfeit ones in an en¬deavour to find out what the real feelings of the other party were
0	are you sure this is your handkerchief ?
0	his pre¬sent shiftless attitude can only spell matrimonial disaster
0	and they still have plenty of plans and projects under way
0	i want you divided into two shifts like the others
0	… to go on an excursion—
0	cousin zhen and the other young male jias received a few words of exhorta¬tion , drank a farewell toast , and , together with a crowd of other friends and relatives , accompanied him as far as the hostelry of the tearful parting , some three or four miles beyond the city walls , where they bid their final farewell
0	if it had gone any further , not only would he have lost his job but the inherited family rank might have been forfeited as well !
0	li wan had sent warning of the doctor ’ s arrival both to the servants on the gate and the maids in the various apartments , so that his passage through the garden , both coming and going , was through an empty landscape in which not a single female was to be seen
0	when you ’ ve done that , you can make your rough draft
0	just look in for a moment , though , and then join the rest of us
0	they don ’ t seem to care what they say to one another ; and one is never quite sure what sort of mood one is going to find them in
0	yuan-chun was at last free to chat informally with her mother and the other female members of her family and learned for the first time about many personal and domestic events that had occurred in the household since she left it
0	i don ’ t think i ’ d be in such a hurry to , if i were you , said aroma
0	why not trim your sails to the wind in your handling of this case ?
0	christians , however , must be held to the more exacting conscientious standard
0	there is no cause at all to be so tragic about it
0	and the girls have been on duty all day , too
0	surely you ought to have a word with him about entertaining the people who went with him on the journey ?
0	usury was therefore a presumptuous , even blasphemous arrogation of ownership over the stuff of human life itself
0	so he said , since you are not prepared to give her up , i am afraid her illness will never get better as long as she lives
0	i must be too late !
0	you and our mistress have always been such good friends
0	she turned to bao-yu
0	s jade is no ordinary stone
0	in a farmstead east of ours there was an old dame of more than ninety who had fasted and prayed to the buddha every day of her life
0	to possess money is to possess this antinatural , magical power
0	it ’ s the law of the jungle now : you hit me , i hit you
0	and i have not kept a sufficiently careful watch on my nephew ’ s behaviour
0	in the words of the poet
0	about the remainder of that day our narrative is silent
0	startled by his father ’ s unaccountable anger , jia lian retreated in a hurry
0	discovered after a few days to be scraps of horn or the most filthy rub-bish
0	the novel ubiquity of usury was an implicit reproach to the morals of society as a whole
0	san-jie first examined the scabbard
0	you don ’ t like me any more
0	i should have thought it was obvious enough , said bao- yu
0	unknown to her , bao-yu was listening to this recitation from the slope of the near-by rockery
0	bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself
0	there ’ s the kind that you ’ ve got , which has the flowers growing one above the other on the stem : that ’ s called brothers and sisters ; and there ’ s another kind like mine here , which has two flowers growing side by side at the top : that ’ s called a husband and wife orchid
0	it ’ s probably not as roomy here as your farmyard , but i expect we ’ ll manage to tuck you in somewhere
0	on going out to investigate he ran into xi-feng and asked her what was happening
0	my child , you mustn ’ t forget you have a tendency to take ill if only i ’ d known earlier , i could have sent for a doctor and had some proper medicine prescribed for you in time
0	dew pearls the pavement ’ s moss ; the launderer ’ s beat is borne in unceasingly through my casement
0	bringing mr bao here of all places !
0	i haven ’ t seen him since then
0	look , they ’ re going to be double-decker ones , like the ones in our lily-pond at home , said kingfisher
0	dai-yu saw him to the door , then returned to her chair and sat brooding to herself
0	when you spend day after day fooling around outside , sooner or later something is bound to happen ; and you are such a thoughtless creature , that when it does , people naturally suspect that you are the one to blame , even if you aren ’ t
0	you gave me quite a shockno , we don ’ t get any flies or mosquitoes in here , but there ’ s a little tiny insect that finds its way through the holes in the netting
0	you ’ re hardly likely to have interesting snacks in the house after being an invalid for so many days
0	aunt xue , now that she was in the garden , concerned herself only with the welfare of the cousins and disciplining of their maids ; in other domestic matters , however important , she was unwilling to intervene
0	officials all behave like that when they first arrive
0	nightingale gave her a quizzical smile
0	go and show your mother ’
0	you don ’ t really need my services
0	he was obliged to seek the advice of his pages and to promise them rich rewards if they could procure her for his pleasure
0	jia lian signalled with his eyes to er-jie that she should pick the handkerchief up , but er-jie continued to ignore him
0	xi-feng spat straight in the old - woman ’ s face and said harshly :
0	said one plaster wang
0	jia lian followed soon after
0	the mistress by her rosy-misted casement must seem most cruelly afflicted ;
0	i shall send you some pills that you can dissolve in hot ginger-water and give her to drink at bed¬time
0	you can ’ t blame parfumee , said bao-yu
0	that way it will get put off
0	he stood still and endeavoured to catch what the weeping girl was saying
0	if my mother finds out , she ’ ll flog me to death !
0	the satisfaction of learning that the guilty bearer of these objects was a hated enemy almost compensated wang shan-bao ’ s wife for the indignity of being slapped by tan-chun and taunted by tan-chun ’ s maid
0	today i received the things sent us by the zhen family
0	at this jin-gui started whacking the side of the kang and shrieked at the top of her voice :
0	when zhou rui ’ s wife had finished seeing off grannie liu , she went to lady wang ’ s place to report
0	aunt xue had now moved to a quiet , secluded apartment m the north-east corner of the mansion , and pear-tree court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges
0	byron ’ s own works also involve a complicated interweaving of faustian with donjuanian themes
0	i can ’ t believe that it was my fate to be so unhappy
0	of course , anti-usury campaigners pointed out that the whole point of parables is that they are allegorical , and that to take the story as justifying usury is a crassly literalistic reading
0	well , she died without giving birth to an heir ; she only ever had a daughter
0	said xue pan , it ’ s not so much the lies you keep telling about me
0	it was goethe , however , who gave a name and a personality to the seduced and abandoned woman , and the gretchen theme enters the myth along with sturm und drang and the cult of sensibility
0	that done , he read the whole through to himself out loud , then , with a wonderful feeling of liberation , went to bed and fell fast asleep
0	a real little lady , miss bao—and generous-hearted , too
0	the person remains a legally autonomous subject , but he gives up a portion of his life—that is , of his self—in
0	an edict was issued in reply to this request , dismissing it as quite superfluous ; and jia zheng , his conscience a little placated , returned home and applied himself with devotion and zeal to his official duties
0	jia rui , who chanced to overhear him , called out from his bed :
0	have you quite recovered , cousin ?
0	truly this traffic in rents must be a sign and a symbol that the world , for its grievous sins , has been sold to the devil
0	time and again i have overlooked this sort of thing , but instead of feeling sorry , you glory in it
0	lai da was in at the door before he had finished speak¬ing
0	at this he became so exasperated that he picked the kite up , threw it down on the ground again , and pointed his finger at it in anger
0	at about ten o ’ clock it began to take effect
0	you ’ re getting to be quite a little man-eater , aren ’ t you ?
0	there are things i have heard
0	she turned to thou rui ’ s wife
0	well , this is what i thought , said li wan
0	the prince seemed fonder than ever of his young protégé ’ , and offered him some tea - a still greater honour
0	your mother says it number one of her vegeta¬rian days today , so she can eat alone
0	seeing nightingale reduced to floods of tears , she eyed her with a hostile smile and said :
0	come here at once my gal
0	the brush that praised them , eager for more tasks ,
0	there ’ s still one left ) ’ said bao-yu
0	i didn ’ t tell mother because i knew she was busy and not feeling very well , said tan-chun
0	tan-chun ’ s shoulders began to shake as she said this and she ended up by bursting into tears
0	ivory chopsticks with triple gold inlay , four bundles
0	dai-yu evidently had something on her mind that she wanted to say but was finding difficulty in expressing
0	i have to economize , she would say , to make up for what sir she wastes
0	rising early next morning , they were delighted to observe that it was going to be a beautiful clear , autumn day
0	tell mrs lian to go and lie down then , she said
0	from now on i ’ ll just pretend i ’ m dumb
0	not more than fifteen or so , said tealeaf
0	to caltrop , who in addition to writing poetry had lately been learning some calligraphy , the opportunity of exercising her new skill proved irresistible and she jumped up and insisted on doing the writing
0	wares rise and fall , and no continued march ,
0	i can only answer for my own integrity
0	bao-chai was about to elaborate , when a maid arrived to inform her that her presence was required at lady wang ’ s
0	i never heard of such a thing !
0	those of us who are in the master ’ s confidence daren ’ t say a word to upset the mistress ’ s boys ; but she can say or do whatever she likes to us
0	a speedy end was also predicted for xi-feng , since aunt zhao had named her as her own accuser in the nether world
0	i promised you i would give you a reward , and so i shall
0	she lives round at the back
0	this pear tree court had been the duke of rong-guo ’ s retreat during the last years of his life
0	here comes the next one , said faithful , laying down a double five
0	somewhat puzzled by this request , cook liu pointed out that on this particular occasion the catering was all being done in the outside kitchen
0	i ’ m going straight over to see ying-chun about this , she
0	bao-chai now knew the full truth , and in her own mind blamed her mother for making a foolish decision
0	where are you going now , coz ?
0	she ’ d never have dared to otherwise
0	our story must leave them for the time being
0	i say this not because we are future sisters-in-law but because we are friends
0	it isn ’ t , either , as if you had sisters who could help to take care of you
0	you ’ ll spoil the stitching
0	we can always sell my jewellery if we need to raise the money
0	green duckweed-trails on the water bright
0	it was left to bao-yu to make what conversation he could with the women as he continued to eat his lunch
0	faithful gave the money to an old serving-woman to take out to the accounts office
0	you must leave tomorrow
0	feeling suddenly rather foolish , he rose to his feet and brushed the earth from his clothes
0	it was nearly nine o clock by the time they finished
0	unalterable principles of equity , fairness , truthfulness , honesty that constituted usury
0	between them , two and five make seven
0	he begged leave to hand in his tally ’ and left the party
0	the monk ’ s directions were scrupulously followed
0	and she began to pummel the woman in her turn
0	it ’ s my belief that you ’ ve got it all worked out between you so that one of you gets a holiday every day
0	what shall i do with flowers when i have no hair to stick them in ?
0	any irregularities reported to his superiors were discounted by them in view of jia zheng ’ s record for scrupulous honesty
0	why did it have to be us ?
0	do you believe in an after life ?
0	the self is split up the middle—
0	the receipt of this reply seemed to throw the jia family into an even greater frenzy of preparation than before , so that even its new year celebrations that year were somewhat scamped
0	if you ’ re afraid too , and think that a proper funeral will get us into trouble , then no one will dare to give her old ladyship her due
0	we can give it to them , if you like , before they go
0	she can marry her to whomever she likes
0	lady jia ’ s pulse-rate is very poor
0	the almanac says the fourteenth is the best day for travel¬ling
0	they said as he entered
0	isn ’ t it bao-chai ’ s birthday the day after tomorrow ?
0	this put xi-feng on her mettle
0	bao-yu spoke to me about this when he got back from his visit the other day
0	he calls the spectacle a specious form of the sacred ( ) and a visible negation of life
0	xue pan , elated by his success , sat with a cup of wine in one hand and his arm round the shoulders of one of the pretty pot-boys
0	you must inform mother immediately that her pres¬ence is required at once at the palace
0	after a good deal more advice to jia rong on how he was to conduct himself , cousin zhen went inside to see you-shi and
0	i tried asking her what the matter was , but she wouldn ’ t speak , just sat there crying
0	the brighter colours definitely wouldn ’ t do
0	you can ’ t if j won ’ t let you , said bao-yu
0	she was about to shed tears once more ; but just then her parrot , which had been perched aloft under the verandah eaves , seeing that his mistress had returned , flew down with a sudden squawk that made her jump
0	crimson came up to her :
0	there ’ s always another way out
0	lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife , thinking that there might be other stolen articles in the kitchen , ordered a thorough search , in the course of which the packet of lycoperdon was discovered
0	jia lian was released , while jia she ’ s domestic staff , men and women alike , were all taken away into public service
0	incidentally , i assume you know perfectly well where the criminal is hiding ?
0	a very earnest young woman offers
0	if she followed the path in the wrong direction , it will have taken her to our back courtyard
0	he found san-jie so altered on this visit as to seem almost a different person er-jie , too , showed herself so careful and competent in her manage¬ment of the little household that he could see there would be no need to worry about either of them while he was away
0	oh , he didn ’ t say anything , lied aroma
0	please , for your soul ’ s sake , earn a bit of merit : don ’ t try to make me do that !
0	dai-yu and the others added their entreaties to musk ’ s , and xiu-yan left with all speed for green bower hermitage
0	jia qiang knew quite well that it would be futile even to try ; he let a day go by and then gave a false report that lady wang had refused his request
0	the following day they went in a body and tendered their resignations to a bewildered jia zheng , who commented somewhat naively :
0	after thinking for a bit , cousin zhen turned to jia rong :
0	a piece of fresh lotus root , ever so crisp and crunchy , as thick as that , look , and as long as that ;
0	nannie li did not know whether to feel upset or amused
0	and burning nard the chamber purifies
0	i brought these things back specially for you and sis , mamma , but i completely forgot to bring them home with me
0	naked and friendless through the world to roam
0	after all , you have already got dewy in the name
0	when father and son met there was a tearful scene , which we need not describe in detail
0	xi-feng was at hand to lend her support
0	send this fellow in to see me , and find somewhere for him to stay
0	her only reply was to give orders that they should all be locked up again and remain so until cousin zhen could deal with them when he got back
0	so for this last year or two they ’ ve been really comfortably off
0	our narrative returns now to dai-yu
0	and fell at the old lady ’ s feet , hugging her by the knees
0	what about paragons of virtue ?
0	at last bao-yu could withdraw
0	just about everyone in this establishment nowadays seem to spend their time discussing my shortcomings
0	bedtime , said aroma firmly
0	i daren ’ t risk angering her old ladyship and upsetting the whole household
0	slipping from his horse , he ordered the servants to help xue pan to his feet
0	why don ’ t i give you a rub , and then maybe you ’ ll be able to have a little nap ?
0	in time to come , if we enioy your blessing and can once more regain his majesty ’ s favour , then we shall do our utmost to atone for past errors , to restore the family fortune and to support you into your hundredth year
0	this is a consequence of your refusal to study properly
0	who knows , you may even be right
0	it ’ s only just recently that you ’ ve begun to look a bit better
0	i suppose i too must look to my own sur¬vival , he said in the end
0	pleased to find you here , sir , said lai da
0	of course i ’ ll come and say good-bye to you , said xiang-lian
0	it ’ s not really a very good match , she said , but i don ’ t suppose it will show very much when it ’ s been darned
0	i should just push on , if i were you
0	it ’ s a poor gift , but it ’ s given with a warm heart !
0	you go back to sleep anyway
0	he is unable to read the visible signs of the universe as referring to an ulterior referent , and is therefore deprived of the consolation which the archangel offers to adam and eve : doubt not but in valley and in plain / god is as here , and will be found alike / present , and of his presence many a sign / still following thee ( – )
0	if anything needs doing , aunt xue , just let me know and i ’ ll do what i can
0	very well then , grandmother jia concurred
0	i don ’ t want them all making fun of me again
0	xi-feng too could not re¬strain herself from remarking cryptically :
0	aroma , when she heard , was over¬joyed , and brought her hands piously together in a prayer of thanks to lord buddha
0	and when we have anything special here , like pheasant or roebuck , we can always arrange for a share of it to be sent over to them
0	for these legends agree upon , and eventually unite around , the proposition that performative signification and the consequent objectification of the subject are the work of the devil
0	when i came to the capital from my old home on mount xuan¬-mu , i had hoped to make a name for myself
0	the fourth table was occupied by the remaining maids , nightingale , oriole , skybright , periwinkle and chess , sitting around it in no particular order
0	'they are small items in themselves , said patience , 'but i should think if you added them all together the total annual saving would be well over four hundred taels
0	she said i only refused out of laziness and unwillingness to learn
0	she stared at dai-yu , laughed and continued :
0	what makes you say that ?
0	he begins by considering a common defense of limited usury :
0	surely , you will say , a household as long established and highly cultivated as the jias ’ must have had several well-known talents at its disposal which it could have called upon for such important purposes as these ?
0	that ’ s more like it !
0	ne ’ er leave me , ne ’ er abandon me :
0	then , closing the door of the inner room carefully behind her and letting down the flower-patterned portiere~ she went out to wake snow-goose , taking the full spittoon with her
0	a deficiency of humour in the lungs would give rise to sudden attacks of giddiness , sweating at five or six in the morning , and a sinking feeling rather like the feeling you get in a pitching boat
0	you worry too much , mrs lai , said xi-feng
0	the relationship between symbol and thing , which is presented in part one primarily as the difference between word and concept , is represented [ in the paper money scene ] as the tension between coined or paper money and commodity
0	shortly after this the party broke up
0	ning-guo house celebrates the birthday
0	his immediate reac¬tion on reading the memorial was to ask for particulars of jia jing ’ s official rank
0	of him no more
0	when at last morning came , jia rui saw the gate at the east end open and an old woman pass through to the gate opposite and call for someone to open up
0	but before she could say any more , bao-yu cut in and hurriedly changed the subject
0	well , the waiter turned out to be a daring sort of rogue himself he stuck his head out and challenged mr pan to hit him
0	jia qiang hurriedly handed him a list of the pieces they had rehearsed , together with a brochure containing the stage names of each of the twelve players and some notes on the parts which each of them played
0	aunt xue spat at her , and cried indignantly :
0	to lady wang , too , this seemed the most likely explanation
0	my daughter ying-lian was , as you know , kidnapped when she was a little girl
0	if her grace should really need them again , we can always buy some more
0	having waited until noon , he inquired whether xi-feng was back yet , and being informed that she was , he wrote out a form of receipt , took it round to the lians ’ apartment , and sent in word that he had called for his tally
0	i don ’ t suppose anyone else will want that title
0	often in the past you ’ ve said to me , now i know how busy you are , feng , but your health is important : you ought to find means somehow or other of taking a rest
0	she was showing her out , when adamantina gave a little laugh and said :
0	wang xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable , which she wore about the house for warmth , fastened on with a pearl ¬studded bandeau
0	it was as though she were under some sort of spell
0	with a touch of the whip he was away once more , still talk¬ing to tealeaf over his shoulder as he rode ahead
0	how do you get these ideas ?
0	jia lian thought for a moment :
0	you have only to look at the way the servants ’ wives are already decking themselves out in all sorts of fancy gold and silver ornaments to know what ’ s been going on
0	the books , too , are spoiled , by the false interpretations they put upon them
0	he lay there tossing and turning , a thousand wild fancies running through his head , and only nodded off some time after three in the morning
0	the two ladies stood up , meanwhile , politely demurring :
0	and as the days are so long now , i was afraid you might be going to sleep after lunch and making yourselves ill i ’ m glad you ’ ve found a way of keeping yourselves amused - where ’ s aroma ?
0	he laid down his chopsticks and rose to go , but xi-feng put a hand out and detained him :
0	those in charge have felt encouraged to abuse their authority , until finally an appalling thing like this can happen an innocent young life cut off by violence
0	so shall the credle do ,
0	no , no , you can ’ t , said lady wang
0	promiscuous liberty granted the goldsmiths to trade in bullion has grown to that licentiousnesss , that they have for divers years presumed , for their private gain , to sort and weigh all sorts of money current within our realm , to the end to cull out the old and new monies , which , either by not wearing , or by any other accident , are weightier than the rest , which weightiest monies have not only been molten down for the making of plate , & c , but even traded in and sold to merchant-strangers , & c , who have exported the same , whereby the consumption of coins has been greatly occasioned , as also the raising of the silver even of our own monies to a rate above what they are truly current for
0	use value in favor of exchange value , like the hoarding miser , and it also fostered an unproductive conspicuous consumption that seemed akin to the behavior of hogs
0	do you think there was some unexplained mystery behind it ?
0	have you been quarrelling over the rice-cakes ?
0	there was only one way of escape left
0	and out she went
0	he followed their example by pillowing his head on the
0	he looked round and saw that it was dai-yu
0	she evidently thought she could take advantage of that
0	for the inscription on the stone we ought to have the hopeful sign
0	jia qin picked it up and read it
0	if anyone from any other apartment notices you , you are to tell them on no account to mention it at the naiad ’ s house
0	then suppose grandmother finds out ?
0	i thought that the fuss made when they found out that things were missing would die down in a day or two
0	patience had no sooner climbed down from the kang than she heard footsteps outside
0	his deeds are honourably reported
0	xi-feng said to him
0	the three of them mounted the bank and strode off into the snow
0	will you take your own sash off , please , so that i can put it on instead ?
0	the wood had a grain like areca palm and a fragrance suggestive of musk and sandalwood
0	don ’ t mind him ; just stay where you are !
0	but with our rong-guo cousins it ’ s different
0	on hearing jia lian ’ s words she became articulate once more :
0	he has taken a fancy to lady jia ’ s maid faithful and wants her for his concubine ; and he has given me the job of asking lady jia for her
0	it must be some jewel or precious stone
0	if it is a fake , give it to me !
0	well , cheer up , it ’ s not number serious as all that !
0	eternity in return for two dozen years of power ; the writer agrees to the ruination of his life and gains ( but only if he ’ s lucky ) maybe not eternity , but posterity , at least
0	she says it makes her uncomfortable
0	lady wang now addressed landscape and xi-chun ’ s other maids :
0	in fact , we in the west need to question the categorical distinction we make between
0	i ’ ve come to warn you , said magpie , addressing herself in an urgent whisper to bao-yu
0	from this point on , faust will habitually impose the eidolon that he has fetishized and mistaken for the ideal form of beauty onto the living women he encounters , thus dehumanizing them and replacing their subjective essence with an objective image
0	jia yun recognized the voice as bao-yu ’ s and hurried up the steps inside
0	between seventy and eighty taels of silver we ’ ve had out of him during this past year
0	suddenly it occurred to him :
0	on which it has pleased heaven to bestow the
0	ours is such a large household , said xi-feng , and , as the saying goes , you can know a man ’ s face , but never his heart
0	dai-yu sat with him a little longer and then went back to her room
0	dialogue between mad mullinix and timothy ( ) , which mocks the audience ’ s lack of discrimination : shou ’ d faustus with the devil behind him , / enter the stage , they never mind him : / if punch , to spur their fancy , shews / in at the door his monstrous nose
0	i sent rong to draw it this morning , said you-shi
0	he terminated the interview by going into the inner room to change his clothes
0	after that she de¬parted with her mother , the latter indicating as they went , by many a sniff and sigh , the hatred that she dared net express more openly
0	jia zheng looked up
0	he does not shrink from confronting the logical problem posed by this state of affairs : a question may indeed be raised , whether there is any excellence at all in a slave beyond and higher than merely instrumental and ministerial qualities—whether he can have the virtues of temperance , courage , justice , and the like ; or whether slaves possess only bodily and ministerial qualities
0	the wretched girl , already half-dead with fright , now wept for terror and knocked her head repeatedly on the ground , entreating xi-feng for mercy
0	butler therefore opposes feminisms that seek to extend autonomous subjectivity to women , and advocates instead an assault on the notion of autonomous subjectivity per se : the identity of the feminist subject ought not to be the foundation of feminist politics
0	poor sapientia was so overcome with shame that she slipped away in the dark
0	since i ’ ve got such a bad reputation anyway , i might as well have something to show for it when i ’ m gone !
0	assuming that it must be aroma , he sat down on the edge of it and gave her a push
0	i didn ’ t like it at all
0	she will be coming over presently to say goodbye , ma ’ am
0	and tell them that we shall want lunch served in the garden tomorrow as well
0	the sudden appearance in their midst of xi-feng , bao-yu and qin zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one
0	the historical johann faust was a marginal , albeit intriguing , figure , but his boasting , clowning , and sexual misbehavior fitted him to fill a particular void in anti-magical discourse
0	well , here i am—and of course it ’ s exactly as i said it would be
0	if you deign to accede to my request , allow me to provide for you and accommodate you in my humble abode close by in the capital , that i may derive daily benefit from your wisdom
0	he says he is making a social call , and when i asked for his visiting card he told me there was no need for any such formality , as he was on the best of terms with you , sir
0	aroma pretended to scold
0	the words bao-yu had spoken to her that afternoon came flashing into her mind
0	tan-chun broke off as patience entered and indicated a low stool for her to sit on
0	and why couldn ’ t you have warned us in time ?
0	the metropolitan official referred to in censor li ’ s impeachment is in fact uncle she : which means that he is implicated in a miscarriage of justice - which is a serious offence
0	there are all sorts of objectionable things in the directions
0	but jia huan was in no position to act as his creditor , having himself never had a penny of his own , and having already squandered his mother ’ s savings
0	we told him he wasn ’ t ready for it , but he wouldn ’ t believe us
0	don ’ t take any notice of her !
0	and yet look at this calamity that ’ s befallen adamantina now - why couldn ’ t she have predicted that ?
0	word had already been sent to jin-gui ’ s family
0	that is strange , said bao-chai
0	i expect to live until i am at least a thousand
0	we shall be all right !
0	they had concluded their discussion in gathering dusk , and now moved back into the lamplit outer room and watched the ladies at their cards for a while
0	alas , this only reminded her that she had no real sister of her own and numberhe began to cry
0	at these words jia rui ’ s soul almost left its seat in his body
0	let me try looking into it as he says , and holding it up to his face he looked into the back as instructed and saw a grinning skull , which he covered up hastily with a curse :
0	don ’ t let ’ s stand here talking to the nasty creature , said a third
0	what a consolation that would be for your elder brother ’ s death , she went on , addressing bao-yu again
0	i ’ d forgotten she was at the party
0	it was a funeral after all , and no one would think such behaviour out of place
0	the least you owe her is a proper funeral
0	if there ’ s anything i need , musk and ripple can get it for me , so you go and have a rest
0	ser¬vants should know their place , and show a proper sense of respect
0	and she never noticed
0	surrounded by such a glory , he forgot his higher origin , and believed that he could find himself in himself ; and from this first ingratitude sprang all that does not seem to us in accordance with the will and purposes of the godhead
0	) : lack of acclaim borne with equanimity
0	back at the mansion xi-feng summoned two of the nannies from green delights
0	you ’ ll catch it now !
0	wait until the boys have spent another year or two at their studies , it will be soon enough then
0	he noticed how red her cheeks were and put out his hand to touch them
0	well why not ask her to come over as well ?
0	it was told in our last chapter how dai-yu ’ s visitors , who were on the point of leaving , heard a voice outside the window crying :
0	exclaimed xi-feng , aghast at this recital
0	when the servants saw their masters reduced to such measures , some decided to take advan¬tage of the situation and themselves invented excuses for borrowing against the rent due from the family ’ s eastern estates
0	bao-yu was normally ready enough with his tongue , but on this occasion grief for golden so occupied his mind ( at that moment he would very willingly have changed places with her ) that though he heard the words addressed to him by his father , he failed to take in their meaning and merely stared back at him stupidly
0	the spring-time blossoms , white and red ,
0	i ’ d better just stick to the book and follow family precedent
0	at the audience , when hm inquired , wu gave your father the highest recom¬mendation
0	those who had chosen to stay were assigned to different apartments - mostly in the garden - as servants
0	do not take my words amiss , sir !
0	she instructed one of the serving-women to bring the presents forward and exhibit them
0	only tell her not to make a fuss about it today , because it is her mistress ’ s birthday
0	you really are an old woman !
0	from now on in the imagination of men there are neither tartarus nor demons ; there is doubt there , nothingness still more frightful
0	it really is aubergine , the others laughingly assured her
0	don ’ t go getting yourself into scrapes like this again
0	so saying , jia zheng went out to give the staff their instructions
0	mrs bao is his cousin , so he needn ’ t worry about her being here too
0	no sooner had the new arrivals begun settling in than news came that grandmother jia ’ s nephew shi ding , the marquis of zhong-jing , was being transferred to an important position in one of the outer provinces and would shortly be leaving for his new post , taking his family with him
0	tomorrow your uncle bao will go over it with you , and she can listen in
0	and when , by yonder cloud-bank ,
0	the little acolyte picked himself up and , leaving his snuffers where they had fallen , darted off in the direction of the gate
0	and woe betide the cook if anything was not quite to her taste !
0	she sought out amber in order to give some cover to her exit
0	she shouted after him
0	you ought to pull them out and throw them in her lace , said the others
0	what were you doing at my aunt ’ s place , zhou ?
0	we must try and catch her then
0	do you expect me to make the mistress hate me lust for the sake of making you feel comfortable ?
0	we don ’ t hire them out , like some people
0	she had that very morning had a sudden fancy to give something to her darling grandson and to her devoted granddaughtern-law , and had told faithful to open one of her trunks and take out an antique han dynasty jade thumb-ring , a family heirloom of hers
0	i think we ought to have a fixed order , said bao-chai
0	as she walked , she wept and lamented to herself :
0	bao-yu had already caught sight of a slender , delicate girl whom he surmised to be his aunt lin ’ s daughter and quickly went over to greet her
0	bao-yu had finished and was just turning back to the waiting maids when two womenservants appeared , walking in his direction
0	to this end the buddhist mahāsattva impervioso and the taoist illuminate mysterioso first brought it into the world , and now that its destiny is fulfilled it is they who will take it back once more to its place of origin
0	his cronies noticed his depressed air and called out to him :
0	as i was on my way here just now , said li wan , i saw them carrying in two pots of white crab-blossom
0	i really can ’ t imagine what you have come back here for !
0	lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife continued on her way to the side gate where her carriage was waiting
0	in future when i ’ m with her old ladyship , you ’ re not to disturb me , no matter what the trouble is !
0	in hope that with the help of spirit-power i might solve many mysteries ,
0	i ’ ve been worried silly !
0	for tertullian , writing in the second century ad , pathological covetousness is the only conceivable motive for accumulating money
0	so if there is ever a fairly simple subject with easy rhymes and we feel like joining in , we should be allowed to do so
0	one can buy the required instruction and equipment to practice destructive magic on the streets of bamako and ouagadougou
0	the contribution for li wan appeared to be missing
0	won ’ t do it again
0	in both cases , the alienation of a human being ’ s soul , self , or substantive essence constitutes a fundamental ethical problem : herein lies the possibility of the alienation of personality and its substantive being , whether this alienation occurs unconsciously or intentionally
0	master lan has passed too !
0	miss shi says come quickly , master bao
0	is there some historical person by the name of wang xi-feng ?
0	such pretty little eggs they lay !
0	we carried mrs lian back and she looked as good as dead
0	i couldn ’ t do that if you -killed me
0	those two heavier articles i was not able to bring with me
0	and surely when s paul doth cal covetousness the bondage or service of idols , he there paynteth out no man so much , as he doth the usurer
0	there , isn ’ t that nice !
0	there are so many girls in my room , said bao-yu
0	there you go , sceptical as ever , quipped bao-yu
0	we owe everything to you , grannie , said patience with a grateful smile
0	suddenly he stood up , and muttered sarcasti-cally :
0	first came nanking and that disgraceful business over caltrop
0	she felt the heat surging within her , her eyes began to swim
0	he took jia rui by the arm , and having first blown the candle out , led him into the courtyard and groped his way round to the underside of the steps which led up to the terrace of the central building
0	the prosecutorial retort was that the witches had undeniably perpetrated at least one maleficium : they had put their faith in the satanic power of signs
0	i was standing in my room when suddenly someone seemed to come from be¬hind and ram something hard , like a wooden bar , up against the back of my head
0	while they were still wondering what to do with bao-yu , xi-feng appeared , brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path
0	at least i ’ ve got past the solstice without anything happening , so perhaps i shall get better
0	i was transferred to miss lin , but as it turned out i got on very well with her -ten times better , as a matter of fact , than the maid she brought with her from yangchow - and since then we ’ ve become inseparable
0	i wouldn ’ t mind lending it to her - even if she dirtied it , it wouldn ’ t matter all that much - but what has she ever done for us ?
0	said one of the old women , a body-servant of qin-shi ’ s who was standing by
0	she was so pleased about it , and now—i don ’ t know how it happened—i ’ ve gone and got a burn in it behind the lapel
0	tears rolled down his cheeks , but he did not feel them
0	the others were now served tea in covered cups of sweet-white ’ eggshell china—all , that is , except bao-chai and dai-yu , whom adamantina tugged by the sleeve as an indication that they should follow her inside
0	her eyes filled with tears , and clenching her teeth , she said fiercely :
0	he ’ s demanding more than a hundred million heads for the establishment of good common sense in europe
0	i ’ ve had an attack of my old sickness again and thought i had better rest quietly at home for a day or two
0	they were to stay behind and look after their mistresses ’ apartments while they were away
0	someone wants a word with you
0	then you say , the spirit control gives judgment as follows :
0	i ’ m afraid i quite forgot about you , grannie dear
0	aunt xue put in an extenuating word for her niece , while laughing with the rest at her discomfiture
0	just those few days in bed and i missed the apricot blossom
0	i don ’ t care how important it is whether it ’ s a career you ’ re after or making a pile—with me for a pal you ’ ll have no more to worry about !
0	what have things come to !
0	we manage to get by , your grace , she replied , and sat down
0	and yet , if helped into a sitting posi¬tion , he could still pass for someone in normal health
0	his right ankle is rather swollen , but he ’ s taken some medicine and the pain is not so bad now
0	unfortunately the best planks turned out to be too expensive and the more modestly priced ones did not meet with his approval
0	i wasn ’ t feeling very well recently
0	it is too late , basil , he faltered
0	value is a way of expressing human subjective agency—which is to say human life—in objective form
0	having decided on a strategy , she had only to await a suitable opportunity of putting it into practice
0	that shows you how noble they are
0	take responsible ones : not too young
0	i ’ m not in that much of a hurry , said xi-feng
0	i don ’ t know why you had to turn on me and start picking on my shortcomings
0	fast as a puff of smoke he sped to the naiad ’ s house
0	the joy of their reunion was , however , tempered with grief , because of the two deaths that had occurred since their parting , and for a while there was much loud weeping on either side
0	jin-gui raised the portiere and stepped out just in time to hear xue ke ’ s reply :
0	it was only a brief , faint gust , but the chill of it penetrated to the marrow of her bones and made her shudder
0	just tell me what happened
0	the maids wrapped it up and told me to bring it , replied tealeaf
0	it is a spiritual event , perhaps even a spirit , and so it can be countered , if at all , by spiritual means
0	but er-jie pretended not to have noticed
0	yesterday i had the managers of both agencies round asking me for the rest of the money
0	the sight of the roses has inspired her to write a poem , he thought
0	i thought just now that i was being called over about something serious , but it turned out to be just for this !
0	mizing , the time will surely come when our credit is ex¬hausted
0	yes , this is the best , they said
0	what an extraordinary question !
0	yes , my girl : all the excuses i used to hear from you in the past when i tried to get you to do something for me
0	he and she get on well together because they are both fond of mischief
0	as she turned a corner in the garden , she caught sight of lin ’ s wife walking ahead of her with snowgoose and called to her to wait
0	as a matter of fact even the language isn ’ t of primary importance
0	lifting up her skirts , xi-feng climbed slowly up the stairs
0	said cousin zhen irately
0	though she ’ s so well in with the mistress , she ’ ll often do you a kindness behind her back
0	rising early next morning , he went off as soon as he had washed to the shops in central street outside the south gate of the inner city and bought camphor and musk at a perfu¬mer ’ s
0	she asked her daughter
0	we thought there was only one of you
0	anyway , it ’ s done , she said
0	her mistress to the great void
0	but i must ask you not to discuss it with anyone else
0	a courier riding through the night to the emperor ’ s city came , and all who heard his heavy news with sadness did exclaim
0	quality canton glue oz
0	then to her amazement the man slipped the knife back into the scabbard slung over his shoulder , came towards her and put both his arms softly round her
0	this seemed to bring lady wang to her senses :
0	we must get rid of these crea¬tures immediately , once and for all
0	it seems that you must needs go perpetrating enor¬mities outside
0	said lady wang impatiently
0	during the last few days , since dai-yu ’ s return to her father had deprived him of her companionship , bao-yu , far from seeking diversion in the company of the others , had kept to himself , going to bed early every night and sleeping dis¬consolately on his own
0	i didn ’ t want to worry them
0	the expression on her face as she uttered these words was angrier than he had ever seen her look before
0	give her whatever you like in exchange
0	he also told me to see if you were getting on all right , ma ’ am ; and he said would i take some fur-¬lined gowns back with me for winter wear
0	he ’ s just this minute dropped off
0	& fearefull sightes , that i was almost brought to destruction vtterly , so far foorth that i coulde not tell what too doe
0	remember having seen these things on him
0	we were discussing that just now , said jia qiang
0	feng zi-ying first got one of the singing-boys to pour for them ; then he called on nuageuse to drink with each of the guests in turn
0	she spat at the ghost and fled
0	that ’ s what they always say , said kingfisher : the master is yang and the servant is yin
0	i told her you hadn ’ t eaten yet
0	what we are supposed to have and what we don ’ t have
0	in fact the two brothers were always at daggers drawn
0	xi-feng promised lady wang to carry out her instruc¬tions and left with her maid
0	the first time was when they came to extol the virtues of the jade ; the second was when bao-yu was seriously ill and the monk came and said a prayer over the jade , which seemed to cure bao-yu at once ; the third time was when he restored the jade to us after it had been lost
0	said xi-feng , who had already formed a shrewd idea of what was going on
0	the tray is for carrying it out¬side on , so that my taoist friends , some of whom have travelled long distances to be here , and my old students , and their students , all of whom are gathered here today , may have the privilege of examining it
0	her old ladyship wants you
0	ha , ha , ha he can ’ t reply
0	make my blood boil
0	now i shall be safe !
0	xue pan gave his own face a slap
0	more jewish , to extend and surpass the characteristics associated with literal or empirical judaism
0	having negotiated the archway , they presently came to the gateway of a palace
0	the young woman gave a start and let go of bao-yu
0	and before you start criticizing us , you might take a look at your own parents
0	what brush could ever capture a beauty ’ s breathing grace ?
0	for all your would-be spotlessness
0	how are you related to the commander ?
0	on this bao-yu , wearing everyday clothes and a pair of bedroom slippers , was reclining , book in hand
0	we won ’ t , miss , thank you all the same , they said
0	now , now , stop play-acting !
0	these fell as follows : yang at rest , yin at rest , yang at rest
0	grandmother jia , believing this farrago to be true , was naturally appalled
0	with many faire giftes he did him than aduaunce endowed him with vertue , grace , wysdome , and reason , to order him and his , and do his obseruaunce vnto god his maker , whan time requireth and season
0	if you have not yet fathomed the answer to her question , you must read the next chapter
0	if you won ’ t help us , we ’ re done for !
0	i didn ’ t really understand what mrs bao was saying about the sages of old
0	on arrival , jia she paid his respects to grandmother jia and left for his own apartment
0	he envisages creation as a hierarchy leading from debased matter to exalted spirit , holding out to eve the possibility of ascending toward spirit through gnosis : i , of brute , human ; ye , of human , gods ( )
0	while they were talking , dai-yu could be heard coughing again from inside the bed-curtains , and nightin¬gale hurried over to hold up the spittoon
0	jia-zheng entered it alone and sat down , stiffly upright , in a chair
0	grand¬mother jia had taken a particular fancy to the little player who had acted the heroine ’ s parts and the one who had played the clown , and when the last performance was over , she asked for them to be brought in to see her
0	in the trips i make to bazaars and temple fairs , whether it ’ s inside the city or round about , i can ’ t say that i ever see anything really nice or out of the ordinary
0	as they did so , they heard someone groaning among the rushes ; and there , when they went to look , was xue pan , his clothes torn , his face cut and swollen almost beyond recognition , and so besmirched with mud from head to foot that he had more the appearance of an old wallowing sow than of a human being
0	we ’ ve got nothing left to tidy up !
0	signalled the dis¬charge of a slop-pail ’ s stinking contents immediately above his head , drenching him from top to toe with liquid filth and causing him to cry out in dismay - but only momentarily , for the excrement covered his face and head and caused him to close his mouth again in a hurry and crouch silent and shivering in the icy cold
0	mastering a strong inclination to laugh , he began to extemporize with whatever came into his head
0	you just concentrate on getting better
0	it would only encourage her in her own ideas
0	qian huai ’ s own job was to accompany jia huan when he went to school
0	opposition to witchcraft and to the theatre reflect a wider fear of the generalized power of the performative sign : though [ daemonologie ] claims that magic is mere theatre , like the antitheatrical tracts , its real fear is that theater itself is constitutive ( )
0	so mind you don ’ t go getting above yourself , i said
0	but bao-yu allowed the line
0	what does she want in jinling ?
0	yuan-chun had sent two little eunuchs well in advance of the date with her presents ( various ornaments for tan-chun ’ s room )
0	the pavilion was built in the middle of the garden ’ s little river at one of the places where it broadened into a wide , deep pool
0	so you can imagine what they must be like about me
0	her ladyship wouldn ’ t lift a finger for us !
0	she ’ d only say something critical about adamantina being too fanciful
0	faithful pondered for a moment :
0	there you are !
0	trust you to pour cold water on the whole idea before grandmother has even had a chance to speak !

0	here are some robes that once belonged to my husband , and some of the gowns and jewellery that i used to wear when i was young - i don ’ t need them any more
0	she began to walk away
0	how could they understand the restless feelings that now consumed him ?

0	i got through by the skin of my teeth !
0	how mean you are , nightingale !
0	no , that ’ s a boring game , said bao-yu
0	just take them away
0	aren ’ t you going to say good-bye to your cousin bao-chai ?
0	and had jia lian not been acquitted , after all ?
0	the momentary silence which followed it was broken by cries of admiration from all present
0	and see that who¬ever it is has some tea before they go
0	you ’ ve used up all your inspiration , said bao-yu ; but instead of admitting that you can ’ t write any more , you make rude remarks about my poem !
0	my motive in arranging this is to help you grasp the fact that , since even in these immortal precincts love is an illusion , the love of your dust-stained , mortal world must be doubly an illusion

0	when moonbeam returned and described in detail what had hap¬pened , jin-gui realized that she had miscalculated and that by pursuing such a strategy she would cause herself much pointless trouble and forfeit moonbeam ’ s respect

0	no more of the old childish non-sense , eh ?
0	she was herself greatly distressed to learn of adamantina ’ s disappearance , but her concern for bao-yu tempered her grief , and she rallied him again briskly :
0	bao-yu : but it ’ s the truth , so help me buddha , the dharma and the holy brotherhood

0	then they got jobs themselves , looking after these player-girls in pear tree court
0	caltrop , she ordered without thinking , go over and see what ’ s going on , will you ?
0	as for the little actresses , on interviewing them individually , you-shi found that hardly any of them wanted to go

0	and faithful inadvertently interrupts
0	as he had no parents or brothers , i think it ’ s up to you as his best friend to find him
0	jia zheng could not help but admire :
0	you sure it wasn ’ t these two characters ?
0	she called nannie li and aroma to her as soon as the head boy had gone and instructed them to tell bao-yu this , so that no worries should retard the progress of his recovery
0	so just stop worrying and get better
0	all praised her great ability
0	even milton did not go so far as to praise the profession , though , as we shall see , he did attempt to redefine it
0	jia huan could see he was in for trouble and beat a hasty retreat
0	the captain ’ s son , too , turned out to be a young person of unexpectedly romantic notions , for on hearing that jin-ge had hanged her¬self , he promptly threw himself into a river and was drowned
0	oh , father doesn ’ t whip me for that sort of thing now¬adays , said bao-yu
0	nobody made much effort to discourage them , as it was understood that they were wholly unaccustomed to waiting on other people and were none of them able to sew
0	how can you tell without even looking at it ?
0	i ’ m much better at night than i was , said dai-yu

0	besides grand mother jia and lady wang were there and she did not dare to be disrespectful towards him in their presence
0	the carpenters were set to work on them immediately and ordered to go on working through the night so that the coffin should be ready in time
0	what do you think ?
0	she deserves a rest
0	they certainly make me laugh a lot
0	if there ’ s anything you want to eat or anything you want to play with , just come and tell me
0	everyone was forcibly struck by the strange blend of sense and nonsense in bao-yu ’ s words
0	everywhere a litter of the spat-out skins of melon-seeds bore silent testimony to their indulgence
0	the air of mystery surrounding this summons persisted after her arrival
0	suddenly he stood still
0	this met with general approval , and as soon as they had finished their meal they began gambling in earnest

0	in her last hour , when i might else have gone to her , i was called in haste from the garden by a father ’ s summons ; when , grieving , i sought to take leave of her abandoned body , i could not see it because it had been removed by a mother ’ s command ; and when i was told that her corpse had been consumed , i repented of my jesting vow that we should share the same grave-hole together , for that were now impossible , and that our ashes should commingle , for ash she is already become

0	gravely displeased , they would be beaten
0	now that she was convinced of their determination and saw that nothing could deflect them from it , she began to feel quite sorry for them and ordered the servants to get out various things to give them
0	there ’ s nothing very special about the tea we drink here
0	but personally i am inclined to believe that there may be very little reality behind some of those entries
0	wherein lies your preciousness and wherein lies your hardness ?
0	miss lin is not feeling very well today - so hurry up and go !
0	my memory is hopeless i ’ said tan-chun
0	why yes , very right and proper
0	to sweep away the fallen flowers
0	i ’ ve been looking at some lives of famous women , said dai-yu , all of them women who are famous in history for their beauty or intelligence
0	it does not matter so much about dai-yu
0	lady wang for her part was like a woman who has lost a limb
0	now that you know about my leaving , i should like to ask formally for permission to move out my things
0	xi-chun told her that adamantina had visited her , and that she had stayed on to play go and keep her company during the night
0	and i ’ d say that the heavenly dragon had laid an egg , said aunt xue , if you really had the will-power to do it
0	please carry on with your game , he said
0	his ignorance of representation ’ s practical power does not bode well for generous ’ s future , especially march ,

0	he departs from the miners ’ own beliefs only in his claim that the demons do not perform labor :

0	no poetry club , no linked couplets , nothing !
0	it would be such a kindness if you would do this for us
0	why do you laugh ?
0	we should not take it seriously
0	and nobody could distract him
0	let ’ s give her time to think it all over
0	come drink with me and sing ,
0	however , don ’ t you worry : as long as i ’ m here , i promise to do my best to make it easier for you
0	but there are these two sons of mine , d ’ ye see ?
0	the other servants had returned to their master ’ s boat to find the cabin empty and were told by the boatman that jia zheng had gone on shore in pursuit of two monks and a taoist
0	it would be too dangerous
0	yu-cun hurriedly took a sedan-chair to the palace
0	just then one of the maids came in to announce another arrival
0	what you have said exactly describes how it is with her ; there is no need for us to tell you anything more
0	the line of verse was by zhu shu-zhen :
0	the incense and paper-offerings for the ceremony , the wedding-feast and marriage-bed had all been made ready long before she arrived
0	but i don ’ t under-stand why she should want to hide things from me
0	notable among them was hermes trismegistus , a syncretic , mythical figure who would come to dominate the alternative , occult theories of divinity which christianity will label as magic
0	we ’ re going first thing tomorrow , said xiang-yun
0	when she heard her coughing again , she hurried over to hold up the spittoon
0	skybright was being quite abandoned
0	green isn ’ t a suitable colour for the windows here in any case
0	granddaughter , was both relieved and happy to observe this new development
0	when i first came here to mr zhu , i had several maids , too , but—i don ’ t know why it was , for i ’ m sure you wouldn ’ t call me a hard mistress—they were always dissatisfied
0	fenton has broken with the fetishistic animism that believes financial value inhabits precious metals like a god or spirit
0	jia lian : where are the women who were supposed to be on night-duty in the inner apartments ?
0	is that all the thanks i get for helping to bring the two of you together ?
0	a little later two young lads came in , younger sons of stewards lai and lin
0	if you really don ’ t tell anyone about this stupid mistake of mine , i promise to honour you as if you were my mother
0	faithful knows the truth now , and she doesn ’ t hold mrs lian to blame any longer
0	yes , indeed , said yu-cun
0	so that ’ s what it is !
0	just at that moment , a diminutive page¬boy went flashing past
0	which is this : our exchequer has for a long time been completely empty - in fact , more than empty
0	gentlemen of the jia family !
0	after being carried for what seemed a very great length of time , she saw , on the north front of the east-west street through which they were passing , two great stone lions crouched one on each side of a triple gateway whose doors were embellished with animal-heads
0	she said that there was so much she wanted to talk to you about , but that she would not be able to come to the capital at present
0	one or two were even quite subtle , and had a certain delicate charm
0	it seems that the prosecutors were engaged in a coordinated effort to prove that the use of performative signs was a pact with the devil
0	he performs abhorred rites to hecate ( ) is
0	i happen to know of someone who would suit him perfectly
0	but that was not the end of it
0	i leave all that to you , sister , said er-jie
0	i prom¬ised her i had and offered to read them out for her
0	useful , instead of mooning around all day doing nothing
0	i couldn ’ t see her very clearly
0	there are quite a few
0	she too , he concluded , was having her nap and not to be disturbed
0	barely three-tenths of it had been completed
0	charity , or caritas , in a mutually determining binary opposition
0	do you deny that ?
0	he was dealt with according to the law relating to accidental homicide , and permitted to pay a fine in commutation
0	and xue bao-chai has a predestined encounter
0	you ’ re to sit down as well
0	it ’ s very , very strange
0	if i had known , i should have rubbed some ink on your face !
0	the journey to the capital is a long one , and the sort of money i can earn from my copying is not enough— '
0	and there was no master jin ’ when he saw him , either : it was jin !
0	why grieve to watch
0	it ’ s no good to me , said aunt xue , but i ’ ve an idea your grandmother may be going out now
0	if it hadn ’ t been for this little escapade of yours , our guests would have left long ago
0	xi-feng , seeing him , was herself deeply affected ; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make qin-shi even more distressed , whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up , she rallied him lightly on his tears
0	he got up to go
0	grandmother jia saw him come in and asked him :
0	jia zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently
0	who did you get this from ?
0	just as he was dropping off , skybright walked into the room looking exactly as she used to do before she was ill she came right up to the bed and spoke to him
0	bao-yu had been about to leave the room , but at xi-feng ’ s mention of fivey had stood there bemused
0	is this what you ordered ?
0	to give up either one would be unkind
0	is mrs lian in ?
0	i see , said bao-yu
0	most people keep a cat to keep down the mice for them
0	we only write for the fun of it ourselves , said tan-chun
0	indeed , he can not fail to do so , by his very existence he has already done so , since the beguilement consists precisely in the displacement of natural by occult significance
0	she sat staring into the mirror
0	meanwhile , when not actually engaged in discharging ceremonial duties , he spent all the time on his own in a quiet , out-of-the-way corner of the mansion , in a state of incommunicado with the other members of the family
0	you really are the limit !
0	cousin xue , this time i think you do have to pay the forfeit
0	i read once more this sad lament ,
0	her husband lives nearby
0	now , if the grain is not going to be taken in and delivered on time , what ’ s the point of your being here at all ?
0	let me try to put it for you in a nutshell
0	i ’ d like to ask her where she got that child from
0	it sounds as if the blood-gate has burst
0	'the almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travel¬ling , he went on , addressing yu-cun again
0	lady wang meanwhile had finally concluded that she must inform jia zheng of xi-chun ’ s determination to shave her head and take holy vows
0	as they approached jin-gui ’ s apartment , they could hear the storm continuing unabated inside
0	that ’ s all there is , i ’ m afraid
0	did sticke an hauthorne pricke , against the left sides of the breastes of the images , directly there where thei thought the hartes of the persones to bee sette , whom the same pictures did represente , and thereupn within shorte space , the saied fower persones , beeyng sodainely taken , died
0	bao-chai told aroma to take him some tea , and then decided to go out herself and join him , surmising that he was nervous of an impending confrontation with his father , when his failure to make any progress in his studies would be discovered ( and no doubt punished )
0	why don ’ t you run round to the kitchen and ask them to heat it up for her ? — nannie , she said , addressing the old woman , you
0	it doesn ’ t bear thinking of
0	but there were simply no funds ; it was an impossible task
0	but to discover who was laughing , you must turn to the next chapter
0	labor-power in the vernacular of political economy—and it magically condenses this power within itself
0	the graeco-roman new comedy , on which the city comedies of early modern london were based , often explores this contradiction through the stock figure of the servus callidus or clever slave , whose function is to disrupt the carefully ordered plans of the free
0	god hath made the syluer as well as other thynges for the seruice of man , vnto whome he hath made all thing subiect
0	how could she possibly have betrayed us !
0	why couldn ’ t i have been born in the family of some poor scholar or low-grade clerk ?
0	so he simply slipped in later on when they weren ’ t there and helped himself
0	i ’ m so bored lately
0	but since they are going to worry , i really think you ought to be getting back soon
0	eight gem motherwort pills ?
0	it was on account of beating you that i got into this truble
0	if you want to talk , she said , why not talk inside the room ?
0	you might scald yourself
0	this went on for most of the day but there was still no sign of the jade
0	but in future , if you want to go walking there , you must at least take more people with you
0	he peered closely at an embroidered purse that she was wearing and expressed a strong interest in one of her rings
0	mongolian suslik , twenty-four squares
0	since humour can not circulate , it has congealed into phlegm
0	once you start taking bird ’ s nest , you ’ ve got to keep it up , and it seemed to me that as cousin bao is really here as our guest , it would be rather boorish to keep asking her for more ; on the other hand it would be rather awkward to have to ask lady wang for it ; so i dropped a hint to grandma , and i rather think that she had a word on the subject with feng
0	her fur-clad master ’ s somewhat worse for wine ;
0	lovey took this message to you-shi , who proceeded to go through the list deciding how much should go to whom and making arrangements for the delivery
0	you really shouldn ’ t go to such lengths on young chai ’ s account
0	your timetable will be as follows :
0	they both agreed on this strategy , called on ladies xing and wang , and then went through the motions of trying to dissuade xi-¬chun , who was every bit as adamant as they had predicted
0	they probably won ’ t be free to come over , though
0	thank goodness she ’ s better !
0	now , it seems , you have got your muddy paws onto your wife 's own maid that she brought with her from her home
0	jia zheng had been sitting on a mat on the floor , and had asked master zhen on arrival to sit at a chair , an invitation that master zhen had ( very properly ) declined , since his senior was seated at a lower level
0	tell me , the old lady continued , how was qiao-jie when you went to see her yesterday ?
0	it was but yesterday that i painted those delicate smoke black eyebrows ; and who is there today to warm the cold jade rings for her fingers ?
0	we just need to choose an auspicious day to exchange presents in pro¬per style , and then set a date for the wedding itself , possible afterwards
0	jia lian had no choice but to escort the monk to the reception hall and then hurry over to inform jia zheng ; who was enormously relieved by the news , and sent for the monk straight away , bowing to him and expressing his profound thanks
0	he therefore opened up the gate in the outer wall of pear-tree court giving on to the passage-way between the two mansions which led into two dukes street
0	having sent his representative along well in advance with offerings for the departed spirit , he presently arrived himself , seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the streets before him , to present his offerings in person
0	so mrs zhu has given orders for all the paths to be cleared of leaves - that ’ s what all the shout¬ing was about
0	i ’ m not feeling well
0	you-shi predictably had a barbed comment to make :
0	you shouldn ’ t all take the old girl so seriously , said bao-yu
0	how could nightingale know that the mere mention of these homely names , intended to reassure and comfort , was enough to conjure up again the horror of the night¬mare ?
0	the story you ’ ve just been listening to is called falsehood exposed , or the tale of a grandmother
0	he asked for a tray and zhang guang handed him a tea¬tray of black lacquer , asking :
0	that ’ s why i came over
0	she said , i know it ’ s hard for you to refuse them , but even salt and soy sauce cost something , and we don ’ t want you to end up out of pocket
0	probably she dislikes skybright just for being beautiful
0	leave him to me , grannie dear !
0	with these words she walked off into the inner room of grandmother jia ’ s apartment and lay down on the kang in a rage
0	were to stop her and start asking questions , she ’ d have a lot of trouble explaining what she was doing
0	tall bamboos tempt the phoenix to alight
0	you choose a title for us , amaryllis islander can set the rhymes , and lotus dweller can supervise us while we compose our poems
0	more likely they lust went off for a walk
0	putting her eye to the crack peered through into the half-lit interior
0	if he ’ s not going , it must be because he is still angry about yesterday ; or if it-isn ’ t that , it must be because he ’ s heard that i ’ m not going and doesn ’ t want to go without me
0	and i have a few jars of choice new wine of my own brewing
0	well , well an ingenious idea , i must say !
0	i must be on my way to see tan
0	none of the rest of us knows how it ’ s done
0	bao-yu hauled qin zhong from the room
0	it will be humiliating for her to discover that my prediction was right , and that will make her angry ; and then she ’ ll take it out on me—which won ’ t be very amusing
0	grandmother jia turned to the two women :
0	discussion of commodified religion is from areopagitica : a wealthy man , addicted to his pleasure and to his profits , finds religion to be a traffic so entangled , and of so many piddling accounts , that of all mysteries he can not skill to keep a stock going upon that trade
0	autonomous subjectivity is thus not only oppressive in itself , it is also a male preserve and , rather than extend to women the rights of subjectivity , it is preferable to deconstruct the subject/object binary altogether
0	keep an eye on him , said nannie li to the maids
0	one day when spring has gone and youth has fled ,
0	he ’ s sure to ask you to that
0	i forbid you to utter another word of such gloomy nonsense
0	grandmother jia and the others were now sobbing audibly and were much too overcome to reply
0	dai-yu sat motionless for a con¬siderable while , then finally began her morning toilet , negligently , her eyes still brimming with tears
0	it ’ s a good job there are so many of us working in the garden and no one can ever remember who is related to who , otherwise they might get the impression that the people in my family do nothing but quarrel all the time
0	why did you say that ?
0	the quantitative relation between them overrides their qualitative essences
0	a faint smile crossed the old man ’ s face
0	oh go on , nannie i ’ bao-yu pleaded good-humouredly
0	he ’ s a good-looking boy , though , and his grandmother ’ s favourite , so there ’ s not much his father and mother can do about it
0	how are you going to show your face anywhere when other people get to hear about it ?
0	- raise the blind a bit and see
0	they knelt manchu-style and did homage as her grace ’ s most hum¬ble servants ’ , before ushering the imperial delegation through the gateway and across the courtyard to the main reception-hall , where they begged them both to be seated
0	why make yourself miserable when you have got them ?
0	take your p earl for instance
0	what other mrs lian ?
0	you have , for a start , said aunt zhao
0	she wiped her eyes , curled the third and fourth fingers of her left hand back against the side of her mouth and with a supreme effort half bit half tore off the two two-inch lengths of scallion-like nail that projected from them
0	she turned away and began marching out , but xi-feng ran after and detained her
0	tomorrow i have to go to xing-yi , by the way
0	why aren ’ t you over there ?
0	some gaily-dressed maids were sitting on the steps of the main building opposite
0	she says there ’ s nothing wrong with her and that i ’ m trying to make her ill by talking about it
0	the presents distributed were as follows :
0	no sooner had he arrived at his new post than a case in¬volving manslaughter was referred to his tribunal
0	patience , whose gentle nature was easily overawed , at once left off , tearfully protesting that it was cruel of them to speak about her in such a way behind her back
0	oh , you ’ re so useless , you make me sick !
0	it would be just the same if you were to hear someone at my place complaining about me
0	now that you ’ ve all moved inside , of course , it ’ s rather out of their hands ; but they won ’ t give up
0	yes , replied lady wang
0	half angrily , half tearfully she begged jia lan :
0	how are you going to explain how you got to know about it ?
0	well , i ’ d better be going now
0	grannie will be very cross with you
0	it was only the ear-rings that gave her away
0	only in this instance i hope that now you ’ ve hit me you won ’ t from now on go around hitting other people
0	what are you doing ?
0	it was she , in fact , who had brought the embroidered bag to lady wang , and she had trailed along to xi-feng ’ s place out of curiosity , to see what she would do about the discovery
0	when he heard this , bao-yu threw aside his books and reverted to the drifting , aimless way of life that was customary with him
0	one was for corrupting the sons of noble families , encouraging them to gamble and that sort of thing
0	his attendants have already beaten the drum twice
0	i thought perhaps you might be able to tell me what they were
0	i don ’ t wonder the young ladies call you busybody , said aroma
0	the thieves came during the fourth and fifth watches , just after we finished duty
0	jia zheng went chasing after them along the slippery track , but although he could spy them ahead of him , somehow they always remained just out of reach
0	if i still mean anything to you , then the one thing i beg of you is to look after little qiao-jie when i ’ m gone
0	he led them round the gauze hangings of a summer-bed , then through a door into a garden full of rambler roses
0	what we really need is a sponsor to settle these matters for us
0	jia lian : why didn ’ t you tell uncle zheng about this , that one of the burglars was zhou rui ’ s adopted son , and that he had been killed by bao yong ?
0	i ’ ve got nothing at all of my own , absolutely nothing
0	xiu-yan hung her head and the reply she made was scarcely audible
0	it doesn ’ t look as if i shall ever get better
0	it was created in ancient times to help man purify himself and lead a gentle and sober life , to quell all wayward pas¬sions and to curb every riotous impulse
0	as he pursued this train of thought to its logical conclusion , a line from zhuang-zi came into his mind : this life , this insubstantial tissue of vanity , floats like a cloud on the wind !
0	with that he gave bao-yu a hefty shove
0	the little girl is suffering from a convulsive attack com¬plicated by an internal fever
0	if yoli look too close , the cupboard ’ s bare !
0	we must tell the ser¬vants not to go talking about this to everyone they meet
0	the girls looked at each other blankly , trying to remember
0	things mustn ’ t be allowed to go on like this !
0	who , world-disdainer , shares your hiding-place ?
0	bao-yu ’ s delight knew no bounds
0	we don ’ t need reminding how powerful your rong-guo relations are !
0	i was originally one of her old ladyship ’ s
0	bao-yu hurried over to li wan ’ s side and studied the dice : the red and green pips were symmetrically paired
0	stopping before this blind , the lady-in-waiting turned to bao-yu and said :
0	he was a regular waiter , replied li
0	this was certainly not the sort of answer aroma was used to getting
0	i haven ’ t felt like seeing anyone since that beating , he thought , and some excuse for getting away from every-body for a year or so is just what i ’ ve been looking for
0	all my life i ’ ve lived with her old ladyship , and now that she ’ s dead i ’ ve nowhere to turn
0	he read the lines through and thought of sticking them up on his wall
0	well i ’ ve got you now , and you won ’ t escape me !
0	bao-yu took this as confirmation of his hypothesis
0	their meeting can not have been coincidental
0	lin zhi¬xiao ’ s wife shoved her off impatiently
0	this mr cao smiled and said :
0	he reads the words of pliny , god is one supremest good , / one pure essence , one existence , / self-sustained ,
0	no power exists in a figured object by virtue of the figure
0	before the fragrant peach and almond red ;
0	you think she ’ s not good enough to wear red
0	lady wang thought that bao-yu must at last have been found and rising from her bed she exclaimed with delight :
0	do all in your power to show that you are worthy of the trust
0	hurriedly he made his birthday kotow to xi-feng
0	at the end of the second month i intend to set you your maiden theme
0	the rich man ’ s fortune now all vanished ,
0	i would like to start a heart business , a market for human hearts , a shop for human hearts , a supermarket for human heart , permanent sale
0	see to it that you work hard and diligently !
0	in a world of wonders , translated into english and march ,
0	she crossed bridges , she walked round each tiny mountain ’ , and every once in a while she stopped to look about her and admire the view
0	you should a taken a look at yourself in the mirror before you went inside , missus !
0	i ’ ve just had a look - she didn ’ t seem to be there , said amber
0	soon after this bao-chai dropped in
0	the young woman laughed
0	our ancestors could not escape their crude perceptions without falling into superstitions still more crude
0	well , let me consult you myself
0	jia lian duly came in and paid his respects to lady wang
0	i want everyone to enjoy themselves , he said
0	there is absolutely no need to go rushing off in person , shouting and hollering at them
0	the others all accepted this as a satisfactory conclusion of the performance
0	you know you ’ re the one the master trusts
0	i ’ ve still got lots of these things
0	but then your dice in the next line bring us back again to the banal
0	he needed no iron flute to teach him those arts
0	after thinking for a while , she produced the following
0	presently lunch was served for the ladies
0	we ought to start our lunch now
0	but given its omnipresence , one has to participate in it one way or another
0	it was nothing to do with you
0	they kept it up like this for some time
0	having made the decision , he thanked ni er with a smile :
0	they expect to be home by the end of the spring
0	the two of them had already written their poems out while bao-yu was still thinking
0	by now li wan and the three girls had also arrived for their evening duty , and when all had wished lady wang good night they departed to their different rooms
0	he records spies ’ s close connections with the ecclesiastical and secular governors of frankfurt , and claims that [ t ] he narrator took his role as a representative of the religious and secular authorities seriously , and he had no difficulty imagining what the authorities expected faustus to have experienced and felt
0	your honour used to be decisive enough in the old days , said the usher with a smile
0	the best present you could have brought aroma would have been a couple of those cheap agate rings like the ones you sent us the other day
0	with a shake of his sleeve shi-yin was gone
0	all right , we won ’ t tell
0	his greatest anxiety is always how not to offend them
0	trust you to know that !
0	these two sacks are the ones you brought the vegetables in when you came
0	i should only keep you awake
0	but to hear her talk now , she seems quite the same as ever
0	but can you really pull it off ?
0	i shall do my best to give satisfaction , sir , said bao er
0	adamantina picked up the brush and began , muttering and writing by turns , until , having knocked off some dozen or so couplets , all in the same apparently effortless manner , she laid the brush down again and handed the paper over for the other two to read
0	a couple of days and it will probably be all right again
0	she had the duck cradled in her right attn
0	but she never bore a grudge against me , countered xi-feng with a smile
0	come on , that ’ s ’ enough
0	he imagines that faust ’ s soul can be captured by physically pulling off its wings , a term he evidently understands in a myopically literal sense
0	they ’ ll get round to it in time
0	from a protestant perspective , such thinking misconceives of redemption in quantitative , financial terms , and this ultimately leads faustus into fatalistic despair
0	he is presented as a man for whom intention , or any other form of interior subjectivity , is non-existent
0	dai-yu picked up a writing-brush , i ’ ll write it down for you while you recite it , she said
0	how can she ever get better if she herself won ’ t face up to the fact that she is ill ?
0	yes , tomorrow ’ s her birthday , he said
0	i ran into them in the back courtyard , kissing each other and feeling arses as plain as anything
0	some said they would give one tael , others two
0	there are far too many of them
0	but it ’ s our only hope !
0	this is all your fault , mr rui , sir
0	ban-chai supplied two more without too much difficulty
0	you still have to make a couplet on this place
0	but if he does seem at all pleased at the news , it will make things rather more com¬plicated
0	ten , who was lounging complacently in a chair with one foot propped on his other knee and his chest puffed out , asked him what his business was with mr zhou
0	incidentally , you may not think it matters very much if the arrangements for other people ’ s winter clothing get put off , but what about the clothing for the girls ?
0	this is the new year holi¬days , when their ladyships and the young ladies are all en¬joying themselves
0	give him some money to buy sweeties with and tell the others that they are not to grumble at him
0	this half cup will be quite enough for me
0	his royal highness has now arrived ; take your men and post yourselves at the front and rear gates of the mansion
0	he hasn ’ t been here yet today , said tealeaf
0	she was up early next morning
0	i came here to find faithful
0	it was now xue pan ’ s turn
0	he remarks on ravenous creditors that will not suffer / the bodies of their poor departed debtors / to go to th ’ grave , but e ’ en in death to vex / and stay the corps ( )
0	lotus flounced off angrily after the messenger
0	what a terrible thing !
0	ah yes , said grandmother jia
0	we obviously can ’ t put ourselves on a level with lady jia
0	you go on writing poems like this , young fellow !
0	and when i came to live here , and saw so many other treasures around me , it
0	if you hadn ’ t been in charge now , i ’ d never have asked you
0	the others agreed that this was a good proposal and should be adopted
0	see its round source in yon clear midnight sky
0	just as i was beginning to get warm !
0	musk and fivey can look after you
0	cash received by : jia rong , captain , imperial body-
0	after sitting with them for a few min¬utes , he also noticed that aunt xue was not being as affectionate towards him as usual , and mused to himself :
0	patience hurriedly wiped it off and fetched water for her to wash with
0	you have to decide which to bring into the foreground and which to push into the background , which to leave out altogether and which to show only in glimpses
0	he said tell her ladyship to try and get hold of some a bit fresher than this
0	still , it should be interesting
0	why don ’ t we part company here and each go about his own business ?
0	turning then , he had formally reproved parfumee for her belligerency and then sent her on an errand to the kitchen
0	find one or two boy ’ s things , but they were the sort of things a quite small boy would use
0	bao-yu asked if he could go with xi-feng to see qin-shi
0	sander points out how absurd it is to think of material coins reproducing , in order to show that the whole concept of interest is a
0	i think we should send out invitations and make a proper party of it
0	come , you have nothing to fear , the others reassured him
0	no , the girl in that picture isn ’ t wearing a cape like that—and she isn ’ t half as pretty as qin , either
0	bao-yu and miss lin have been together ever since they were little , and this has never troubled me , as i have always thought of them as children
0	according to you i am to wait until mother ’ s anger has subsided and after that wait until a favourable opportunity arises for talking to grandmother ; but what makes you think that skybright ’ s illness will wait that long ?
0	the devil ’ s admonition is of no avail , and nor is helen ’ s own protestation that she is merely an idol
0	now that bao-yu and the other two had joined the company , it would hardly be right for them to sit on the floor with jia zheng ; nor on the other hand could they remain standing while master zhen , their contemporary , was seated below
0	i ’ ll come over to you
0	i ’ m afraid my knowledge of poetry is strictly limited , however , i happened to see a couplet on someone ’ s wall yesterday which has stuck in my mind ; and as one line in it is about something i can see here , i shall use it to finish my turn with
0	in the interests of economy
0	she could not tell whether he ever did rinse his mouth or not , as the next she knew he was giggling and asking her :
0	lady wang drew aroma towards her
0	between this hedge of trees and the lower slope of the hill was a rustic well , furnished with both well-sweep and windlass
0	things seemed more hopeful now , and relative calm was restored
0	and if you destroy your arcs and lines , throw away your compasses and set-squares and break the fingers of chui the cunning , people will begin to make proper use of their own skill…
0	san-jie shouted , half angrily and half in jest
0	it evidently seemed credible to baines that marlowe would aver [ t ] hat if there be any god or any good religion , then it is in the papistes because the service of god is performed with more cerimonies , as elevation of the mass , organs , singing men , shaven crowns & cta
0	jin-gui had intended to feign anger with her darling , but there was something so appealingly boyish about the flush on his cheeks and the slightly befuddled innocence in his eyes , that her heart melted and her feigned hostility fled to the distant land of java
0	the murdered man was my master , your honour
0	he plans to retire for a few years and leave everything in your hands , uncle
0	said jia lian—though not ill ¬humouredly
0	bao-yu glanced back at her :
0	then i watched you go into xi-chun ’ s courtyard
0	now it appears that you were in here , work¬ing yourself into a rage
0	the indulgence controversy that initially sparked his protest against rome concerned the question of whether human penitential activity could be represented in the form of performative signs
0	i noticed that you ’ re still wearing that old black fan-over we made for you when you went into mourning for mrs rong
0	there were a few quite well-off families in the village , who when they heard that there was a miss jia staying at grannie liu ’ s insisted on coming to have a look for themselves
0	all right , go then ; but if you breathe a word of this outside , i ’ ll have you flayed !
0	strictly speaking , one of the other ladies had to be chosen to orchestrate the reception
0	( they supposed that he was still suffering from shock )
0	didn ’ t seem so very special
0	said the old lady
0	the most convincing arguments for the proposition that the rational human subject is a repressive construct tend to be advanced by feminist theorists
0	i expect that one is by bao-yu , said grandmother jia
0	they found her lying on the ground , with her arms outstretched , frothing at the mouth
0	why not see if you ’ ve got any in that ?
0	we should have more definite news in a day or two and will let her ladyship know straight away
0	he was just getting into his stride when jia rong came out to see xi-feng off in her carriage
0	but be sure to keep the cash flowing !
0	bao-chai chided him with a smile
0	if you end up by under-miring your health ; i- ’
0	later another batch was despatched on the same mission , with the same result
0	i think all this worrying is ruin¬ing your health
0	but in fairness to our girls i think it must be said that they are already making do with the absolute minimum of service
0	i don ’ t know what the rest of you thought about it
0	the ash-filled gauge shows winter ’ s solstice near—
0	you ’ ve always been so good to me , fussed over me so - how can you treat me like this in my hour of need ?
0	huh i ’ she said
0	but your case is totally different
0	besides , she sensed something inauspicious
0	we must echo the numbers he uses , if we are to preserve the correct sequence of his moral and intellectual development
0	tan-chun treated them all to a lively account of what had happened , after which you-shi , seeing that there was no longer any point in concealment , proceeded to tell them about her recent encounter with xi-chun
0	since i have been here , i have kept this a secret
0	prosper called ahead diplomatically :
0	aroma had gone outside to take the air and was leaning on the verandah railings at the foot of the front door steps
0	in order to live by reproducing himself , the youth is urged to make a loan of his love to women
0	nothing very special , i ’ m afraid ; but they ’ d like our young friend to keep them , either to amuse himself with or to give away to his friends
0	and please , no more of that miss ’ moonbeam - it makes me feel most uncomfortable
0	couldn ’ t she be expecting ?
0	said the literary gentlemen
0	these are all things that her ladyship gave you
0	it is unnatural because it makes money breed : aristotle describes usury as an artificial tokos , or birth :
0	however , this did not unduly concern her
0	at five o ’ clock , when the ladies were ready and the gentle¬men had put the finishing touches to their ceremonial outfits , steward lin and lai da came to the inner gate to report that the chairs and carriages were all ready as ordered and had been drawn up outside
0	the master sent someone to the garden to ask if you were home from school yet , aroma said you were , so you ’ d better be quick !
0	he was a frequent visitor at the ning and rong mansions and was known to everyone there - as to everyone else outside - as one plaster wang ’ from his habit of always concluding the patter with which he recommended his medicaments with the same
0	grandmother jia asked someone to fetch a spray of cassia and made one of the women sit behind the screen and drum for them , so that they could play passing the branch
0	said grandmother jia in tears
0	the old lady fasted for two days , but she still had a painfully bloated stomach , and began to cough and have dizzy spells
0	on the contrary , said bao-chai
0	jia zheng nodded , and they continued chatting for a while longer
0	of course , replied yu-cun
0	sister faithful , your death was of your own choosing ; what does it have to do with mrs zhao ?
0	the lady-in-waiting outside the blind whispered in a shocked tone :
0	the motive for secrecy seems to have been to conceal the inferior quality and trivial nature of the consumer fripperies that the distressed gentlemen were compelled to peddle
0	luckily , the next triennial is only a few months ahead
0	by demonstrating the unreality of love , then , dorian destroyed her essence and killed her
0	and it ’ s not warm enough for the time of year , either
0	he ’ s gone and called up a person full of life and health to come here right in our midst !
0	that was the main reason for the beating ; but then there were a number of smaller things a few days later—i don ’ t even remember now what they were

0	shortly after that he received some more sheets of calligraphy that xiang-yun and bao-qin had been copying for him
0	were to come into the open

0	with a borrowed knife
0	he ’ s giving a return party tonight , said skybright
0	very well , let him do it then , said grandmother jia
0	i don ’ t say but what he mightn ’ t sometimes , just once in a while , let one of your names drop out by accident , and no harm done
0	the monk was a strange enough creature , said lady wang
0	we can always put on a bit more clothing , said grandmother jia
0	looking out , all she could see were long clouds that stretched across the sky , and the moon shining through a watery haze
0	i didn ’ t know , really i didn ’ t
0	lai ’ s da information at once dispelled the anxiety that grandmother jia and the others had all this time been feeling , and the worried looks on their faces quickly gave way to smiles of pleasure
0	grandmother jia availed herself of their presence to sing xi-feng ’ s praises
0	the woman , shamed into silence by musk ’ s tirade , made no reply
0	two piculs of best rice were missing , she said ; a month ’ s supply of general purpose rice had been overdrawn ; and the amount of charcoal was not what it was supposed to be
0	the season of appointments brought news that wang zi-teng had been promoted to the post of inspector-general of armies in the nine provinces and that jia yu-cun was to become under secretary to the president of the board of war with occasional duties at court
0	the male servants , who are not included in that number , were meanwhile preparing the mule-litters that their mistresses would ride in and getting the harness and other gear into good order

0	that whiche afore tyme brought men to shame , that in these daies bringeth men to estimation
0	they decided to take cousin zhen , jia lian and bao-yu along with them
0	bao-chai could think of no suitable retort
0	i was going to tell you myself , but you went rushing off before i had a chance to
0	well that ’ s nothing whatever to do with me
0	it ’ s only grandmother who will worry so
0	patience sent me over to let you know
0	but as a religious establishment it had always been self-supporting , and had never been dependent on jia family charity
0	—her words made him suddenly aware that the whole of his body was icy cold , and when he looked down , he saw that he was soaked
0	where you are indebted with any great sum : your creditor observes you with no less regard than if he were bound to you for some great benefit , and will quake to give you the least cause of offence , lest he lose his money
0	it was terribly funny
0	two years before heywood ’ s play , drayton had also stressed the commodifying effect of edward ’ s wooing in england ’ s heroicall epistles ( ) , in which the king exclaims mee thinks thy husband takes his marke awry / to set his plate to sale when thou art by , and compares jane to gold that is
0	calvin ’ s doctrine was certainly exploited by churchmen looking for an excuse to wink at march ,
0	don ’ t talk such nonsense
0	another possibility is that she ’ s fallen out with bao-qin and this is a plot to disgrace me and drag the family name in the mud
0	ruskin correctly cites john jewell , elizabethan bishop of salisbury , as representative of orthodox opinion on this kind of usury :

0	next day she showed it to bao-chai as well
0	xi-feng was in li wan ’ s room , as tan-chun had predicted , and crimson found the two of them in conversation
0	bao-chai ignored the opinions and criticisms of those around her and continued to keep a close watch on bao¬yu ’ s progress , probing him judiciously , like an acupun¬turist with a needle
0	though our verses may be of little value , they will gain distinction by being associated with yours
0	i will argue that , since the sixteenth century , the myth of doctor faustus has provided an arena in which the performative sign has been defined as a magical , and thus satanic , phenomenon
0	i should like to go and see her myself
0	while she was speaking , li wan and old mrs li came in and paid their respects
0	in snowbound woods a bough ’ s creak terrifies
0	what kept you so long , sir ?
0	the monk is back !
0	the then acting magistrate held an inquest and the coroner completed the usual certificate
0	mr lian ’ s servant bao er has been arrested , and some of the items on the inventory of stolen property have been found on his person
0	what a stroke of luck !
0	his own name meant precious jade ’
0	so that ’ s what you were saving for me !
0	the captains and the counsellors and men of high degree
0	you would have some pet theory of your own
0	later on , when i have more time to spare , i intend to write a description of prospect garden and a set of verses to be entitled the visitation in commemoration of this wonderful night
0	when our cousin was holding forth about that medicine just now and i said i didn ’ t know about it , i believe actually he was rather wounded
0	emerging from the outer door , he grinned and stuck his tongue out at golden , then shot off like a puff of smoke , the two old nannies hurrying after him
0	now would not be a good moment to bring it up ; there are too many people in the room
0	i ’ ve got my contacts too
0	do you know how to weave things with these ?
0	who are you ordering about like that ?
0	he peered at it closely and exclaimed :
0	bao-yu kept telling everyone how hungry he felt and grumbling because the servants were so long in serving
0	fresh wine was called for and the flautist told to stop playing
0	she spoke to grandmother jia from behind you-shi ’ s shoulder
0	why this refusal to study , this per-verse streak of hedonism ?
0	that ’ s why mrs lian sent me here
0	you ’ re just being a bully !
0	there was a gentleman sitting at mr xue ’ s table , your honour
0	after four or five days the pain of his injuries had subsided , but not the bumps and bruises ; and as , while these still dis¬figured him , he was unwilling to meet any of his acquaintance , he kept to his room on the pretext that he was still too ill to go out
0	then they may never be able to study properly , and all your efforts will have been in vain
0	so i shall , presently , bao-yu whispered back at her
0	her heart was wound into a tight knot
0	after all they ’ ve done for him , to kick them in the teeth like that !
0	he drank and sang a song
0	then she turned to xi-feng :
0	grandmother jia and the other ladies tried to comfort him but he was impervious to their efforts
0	he ascertained , from his enquiries in official quarters , that his father and cousin zhen were indeed facing a serious charge ; and seeing that there was nothing he could do to help , returned despondently home
0	a much-used black satin back-rest was pushed up against the east wall
0	one day she sat down to finish a betel-nut refresher ’ bag she had been embroider¬ing , and fell to thinking of the great change wrought in all their lives by bao-yu ’ s new routine
0	nothing is brought into the world more then when the money was first disbursed
0	we ’ d better go in here for a bit before going home , he explained to aroma ’ s brother
0	she proceeded to pat her hair into place , smilingly com¬placently :
0	plato indicates that souls that follow their logos will be rewarded after death , while those that are ruled by their epithumiai are to be punished
0	a musky perfume of orchids hangs in the sunset courtyard
0	oh , what are you doing here ?
0	the simple votaries to frame ,
0	at that faithful laughed and went away content
0	if you must go filling yourself with liquor , why can ’ t you lie down quietly and sleep it off like a good , sensible creature ?
0	many polemicists on divorce drew the same analogy
0	even aunt wang and aunt xue don ’ t know about it
0	but the bystanders who had witnessed the flogging in the street lost no time in telling the story to their friends , and the news soon spread that ni er the swank , ni er the drunken bully , had fallen foul of mayor jia and landed himself in deep water
0	why do we have to be in a boat to enjoy this ?
0	said dai-yu , with a bitter smile
0	you can invite our employees from the shop in to help you finish it
0	jia zheng sent a page to fetch jia lian , who was instructed to take the pearl and the precious net through to grandmother jia ’ s apartment
0	and , heedless of his own great faults ,
0	evidently you are cleverer than i am
0	you just lowered your eyes again , stavrogin interjected with an irritable sneer , because you ’ re ashamed of me for believing in the devil ; now you think i ’ m pretending i don ’ t believe in him , and that i ’ m cunningly posing the question to you : does he really exist or not ?
0	shortly afterwards another maid came in with the timely news that bao-yu was demanding to see his grandmother
0	she escorted him into his room and then went her separate way to bed
0	the following words were inscribed horizontally above the lintel :
0	you know what they say : important people have short memories
0	how does it go on ?
0	it ’ s called the abject apology
0	there was a lot of writing on top that i didn ’ t pay much attention to , but i did notice the signature
0	we ’ ve got too big a staff , he said
0	i spend all my time on call at the inner gate , madam
0	i could never bear to be parted from it for long , so however much i may wander , if you take that as my pledge , you can be sure of my eventually coming back to get it
0	he explained to disenchantment that he had drunk too much and would like to lie down
0	but when she went over to ask him what he wanted , she saw that he was crying
0	all right , young ladies , that ’ s enough !
0	fortunately jia zheng suddenly recollected that bao-yu was still with him :
0	although chai has no father , she has got me and pan so you see i know that you have the greater need
0	a rapid investigation revealed that autumn was the only person in the household born under that sign
0	well , sir , as you know , there was a lot of snow this year : it must have been lying three or four foot thick in places
0	stop that at once !
0	even your mother-in-law daren ’ t argue with me , my dear !
0	nature ] hutch ’ t th ’ all-worshipt ore , and precious gems to store her children with
0	there ’ s no need to change things
0	interrupted grandmother jia testily
0	can this be some silly maid come here to bury flowers like frowner ?
0	she struggled out of bed , opened one of her boxes , and hunted out a nugget of raw gold
0	as soon as tealeaf thought of it , he set off to the book-stalls and bought a pile of books—books of a kind bao-yu had never heard about - to give as a present to his young master
0	li wan had been visited in the meantime by her doctor ; and as she was feeling much livelier than she had done for some days , she had remained sitting up after her visit
0	it ’ s not worth a quarrel , said sunset , defending him
0	the things you say are really laughable !
0	zhou rui told the servants to carry the goods into xi-feng ’ s courtyard , and gave instructions for them to be checked against the inventory
0	such passages confirm usury ’ s position as the antithesis of labor power :
0	moonbeam is the only one who would dare go in my room
0	what do you think , my dear : his nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who does the tree-planting—yin or yun or whatever his name is—so nannie has to go and ask him in
0	but today there ’ s ho doubt about it , they ’ ve come out in the most beautiful blossom !
0	your wife will be with me a long time yet playing cards
0	in the end he got on his horse and insisted on going to see for himself
0	sending the younger maids to stand in for her !
0	this was followed by several blows
0	human figures are no problem , said dai-yu
0	and where ’ s that precious mother superior of yours gone off to , bald-headed old mischief ?
0	that was when i woke up
0	like differance , usury appears to generate surplus value out of nothing , and even to produce value in the very act of expending it
0	and it would explain why you were calling your own name out in your sleep
0	thinking she wanted it for the extra warmth , nightin¬gale protested :
0	i can ’ t help being upset !
0	come on , we are listening
0	using a pair of bamboo scissors , bao-yu now cut the twin blossoms from the stem of an autumn-flowering orchid that was growing in a pot and stuck them in patience ’ s hair
0	drink a forfeit , there ’ s a boy !
0	she ought to give preference to girls
0	by an unlucky chance mamma xia had a granddaughter who worked in tan-chun ’ s apartment and did various little errands for the maids , with all of whom she was popular
0	cook liu knew something of the young wife ’ s reputation and assumed that it must be one of her lovers
0	her words provoked jia yun to such a pitch of excite¬ment that he was ready to burst
0	he called from outside the doorway
0	bao-yu took skybright by one hand and parfumee by the other and walked with them into the room
0	but of this our narrative omits further details
0	she made him sit on the edge of the kang and ordered oriole to pour him some tea
0	while it was undeniably an iconic and commodified march ,
0	are you better now ?
0	as soon as all of the twelve tides have been covered , we shall call a halt , and anyone who goes on writing after that will be made to pay a penalty
0	it follows , then , that thou hast a soul as well
0	we have here a succession of empty images with no objective referent
0	her natural decency suddenly getting the better of her compelled her now to speak
0	even though they couldn ’ t very well tell yon off , like enough they ’ d blame us for not teaching you manners
0	his sedan moved on , and bao yong swaggered home feeling very pleased with himself and far too drunk to be discreet
0	last night i only coughed twice
0	we all know how well you ’ ve done for yourself
0	there is , replied the man with a superior smile , and yet there is not , such a place
0	during the past few months , she said , i ’ ve managed to save up another ten strings or so of cash
0	all right , said grandmother jia , laughing herself
0	it ’ s all empty show , really
0	keep it up all of you !
0	i trust i find you fully recovered ?
0	what was it you wanted to see me about ?
0	drayton asserts , implausibly , that the goldsmith ’ s art is focused entirely on the metal ’ s selfeworth : its natural , inherent use value
0	having concluded , she puffed out both her cheeks and stared in front of her with an expression of great determina¬tion
0	jia zheng , who was painfully aware of his own incompetence in such matters , mumbled a contrite yes , mother ’ to all of these eminently practical instructions , thinking to himself :
0	now that mrs lian is gone , patience thinks she can take over
0	and we must let the xia family know , and report the death to the authorities
0	pearl , answered the maid
0	grandmother jia was greatly distressed
0	xi-feng could see that lady wang was too incensed to reason with ; and however much she might have said to the point , she would not in any case have dared to do so in front of wang shan-bao ’ s wife , who was one of her mother¬-in-law ’ s principal informants and a most notorious stirrer-up of trouble
0	she thought that sympathy would have little chance of success as a remedy , and decided instead to administer a cheerful rebuke
0	he made one of the little maids hold the glass lamp dai-yu had given him and leaned on her shoulder until they were back home
0	didn ’ t you even know there were thieves in the house ?
0	i must meditate at four , said adamantina
0	give me a little time !
0	once we ’ ve got our hands on the money , you and i would be wasting our time in these parts
0	everything i have done up to now will turn out to have been simply working towards my own downfall
0	what karma brings thee to maya ’ s dusty realm ?
0	i hear that cousin lin has been ill i hope she is getting better now
0	it ’ s quite pos¬sible that she misremembered when she gave me those direc¬tions
0	and he delegated all responsibility for the marriage plans to grandmother j ia , who in turn left the arrangements to lady wang and xi-feng
0	uncle zheng has today had word from yu-cun that uncle wang zi-teng has been promoted to a position in the grand secretariat
0	was not she , wang shan-bao ’ s wife , one of lady xing ’ s oldest and most trusted servants ?
0	the prince of bei-jing ’ s consort , whose turn it was next , did exactly the same
0	on the morning of his birthday bao-yu rose at dawn , and after completing his toilet , put on his most formal clothes and went out to the main front courtyard of the mansion , where li gui and three other of his grooms were waiting for him by a table they had ’ made ready with an incense burner and candlesticks and offerings as an altar to heaven and earth
0	why couldn ’ t you have kept your mouth shut ?
0	in spite of often heroic efforts to fight against it , an objective observer would have to conclude that capitalism gives every sign of being a power that is irresistible by any political , military , or legal means
0	he expounds the former concept : the latin name is compounded of two words , meum and tuum , myne and thine , as if we might say in english mynethine : whereby is ment , that the thing which before was myne , is by lending made thine , to the end that thou maist use it , being thine owne , and the value thereof must again of thine be made mine when it is restored back unto me
0	when you see a poore wretch , that to keep life in a loathed body hath not a house left to cover his head from the tempests , nor a bed ( but the common bedde which our mother the earth allowes him ) for his cares to sleep uppon , when you have ( by keeping or locking him up ) robd him of all means to get , what seeke you to have him loose but his life ?
0	let me get you another cup , said aroma
0	she did not feel she could raise such a sensitive matter at a large family gathering , and decided to wait until the evening when she could discuss it privately with her sister
0	he held his hand out to receive it , and as soon as it was in his possession , hid it under the quilt , chuckling with satisfaction as he did so :
0	imprisoned along with justina , cyprian commits the ultimate sin of despair , fearing that his sins are too great to be forgiven
0	well , has the preceptor given you a scheme of work ?
0	how lovely it is to see you again !
0	she was quite unlike any earthly lady , as the following poem will make clear :
0	thank you , said you-shi , but waited all the same until the old lady had rinsed her mouth and washed her hands and was walking up and down on lady wang ’ s arm for her digestion before she begged to be seated ’
0	but before i have had a chance to do anything , you have to come along and start making things diffi¬cult for me
0	not daring to express this presentiment of hers openly , bao-chai held back her tears and remained silent
0	because lady wang was away , rather less fuss was made of it than in previous years
0	before doing so she called on grandmother jia and lady wang to say good-bye
0	it seems advisable to retire rather earlier than usual tonight if we are to make a prompt start in the morning
0	i wonder why they are ?
0	it was merely fedka the convict , a robber who ’ s escaped from prison
0	now i must go and see your mother-in-law , and after that i have to hurry back and give my report on you to grandma
0	dai-yu pretended not to hear
0	you know why i have brought him over here , don ’ t you ?
0	and the reason he particularly wants aunt er is because he feels it would be better to keep things in the family and have someone he knows , than risk taking some unknown person from outside
0	claims of that sort are fantastic and don ’ t deserve to be taken seriously
0	but no intruder could be found
0	i shall wait to hear from you then
0	the three who were leaving were taken away by their foster-mothers to stay with them for the time being until their real parents could come to fetch them
0	jia lan was the first to finish a poem and jia huan , fearful of being outstripped by his young nephew , made haste to follow
0	if only i hadn ’ t forgotten what was written in them
0	davenport ’ s gallants are failed entrepreneurs , who have been tempted by moneylenders into trying their luck in the emerging commodities market
0	after lunch , jia zheng returned from giving thanks at court , and having per¬formed his ceremonial prostrations in the family shrine , came in to kotow before grandmother jia
0	perhaps it ’ s for a seasonal offering
0	another thing is this
0	prince heng thought so highly of her that he gave her a colonelcy and put her in command of the whole female troop
0	my son-in-law ’ s name is zhen , but he left home to become a taoist more than a year ago
0	she turned to look and saw that it was—
0	silly old fool , to scare me like that !
0	give her to me !
0	if you ’ ve something on your mind , then just go ahead and say it !
0	he turned to tealeaf : treacherous little beast i what are you still kneeling for ?
0	as a child she was always ailing and her parents paid for any number of proxy novices in the hope that she would get better ; but all was of no avail
0	my name was golden oriole originally , said oriole , but miss bao found it too much of a mouthful , so she called me just oriole for short , and now everyone else does
0	you won ’ t find me letting you do every-thing just as it suits you
0	xue pan had been having the sulks earlier on because he was losing , but then his luck had changed : he had not only recouped his losses but made a lot of extra money
0	i braved the flames and went into the temple to see if i could find the taoist
0	this is truly the end !
0	how about a nice cup of tea ?
0	i hope your two curios are well wrapped ?
0	after ying-chun ’ s departure , lady xing continued as though nothing had happened
0	that was cer¬tainly what our ancestors would have done ; and i do not believe that we have become quite so degenerate or so un¬generous that we can not , in this matter at least , follow the ancestors ’ example
0	and when you ’ re grown up , you must win her honour and glory !
0	i wouldn ’ t be at all surprised if that ’ s how it got about
0	take this as a rule , there is neuer usurie without losse
0	she isn ’ t an habitual gambler
0	she was covered all over from head to foot with crimson petals from the peony bushes which grew round about ; the fan which had slipped from her hand and lay on the ground beside her was half buried in petals ; and heaped-up peony petals wrapped in a white silk handkerchief made an improvised pillow for her head
0	you know you ’ re always saying how good rose¬orris is for skin troubles - how much better than the silver powder you get from outside - well , have a look at this !
0	bao yong offers his humble respects , sir
0	why don ’ t you calm down a bit ?
0	what on earth are you upset about this time ?
0	dai-yu looked at him with astonishment
0	as in the historia , faustus ’ s encounter with helen marks the point at which he finally succumbs to the deceptive power of signification
0	he was shown to his temporary quarters by some of the servants , and there we must leave him
0	i wouldn ’ t expect you to remember the likes of us !
0	the buildings belonging to the garden of spices ’ she named all-spice court ’
0	you had an inside counter¬attack up your sleeve
0	who ’ s been upsetting you then ?
0	but who could bear a grudge against bao-yu ?
0	the primary principle of sympathy is similarity or imitation : like produces like , an effect resembles its cause
0	he made his way back to his apartment in a mood of profound depression , said not a word , did not even smile , but stared vacantly into space
0	then she thought to herself , of course !
0	credit here designates the economic credibility , or creditworthiness , that witgood has gained only by presenting an appropriate
0	that ’ s even more inappropriate !
0	the statue reminds juan that the wages of sin is death , and these figurative wages are duly paid : juan ’ s long credit has ended
0	pity it ’ s so gloomy , they said
0	as she was speaking , crimson came in to report the
0	commodified sexuality seems an appropriate metaphor for usury , because it brazenly substi-tutes money for the natural telos and product of sexual intercourse
0	i ’ m very fond of my plantains
0	do you want to release it now ?
0	the things here are all so pretty
0	in any case , i think your aunt xue is getting tea ready for you
0	now this wang zhong had an only son whose name was wang xi-feng - ’
0	that doesn ’ t leave me anyone to turn to , does it ?
0	himself handed it to bao-yu , who re¬ceived it humbly in both hands , gave thanks and then took his leave
0	while we are on the subject , where is cousin shi ?
0	xi-feng appeared to be thinking , and to be growing angrier and angrier the more she thought
0	my gratitude to his majesty , for so graciously absolving me of blame , and for restoring my portion of the family property , knows no bounds , said jia zheng
0	according to james , powerful sorcerers are just as susceptible to the wiles of satan as unlettered witches
0	can anyone have offended her ?
0	we tried to talk some sense into her , but then this ruffian butted in , and started using the most dreadful language in front of the young ladies
0	greatly improved , lady jia
0	snowgoose was lost in thought , and the question gave her quite a turn
0	thereupon he , forced him to the ground , and , with the utmost savagery , dealt him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo , after which he forbade him to eat and made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared the equivalent of ten days ’ homework
0	i don ’ t think we need be too strict about that , said jia zheng
0	as he did so , he found himself almost face to face with xiang-lian
0	but what you seem to have forgotten is that if their ladyships get to hear , the likes of us will be torn to shreds and ground to powder !
0	to praise her loveliness by night and day
0	her old ladyship sent round several times asking about you , but because the master was so pleased with you , we told her not to worry
0	bao-yu , poor child , who used to be such a bundle of mischief and fun , has been so badly affected by our troubles that he can hardly put two words together
0	miss lin has only just recovered from her illness , she whispered to nightingale
0	i don ’ t see how there could have been any mistake
0	what the maid told her brought her flying over at once to green delights , brimming over with sympathy and concern
0	the rest will be told in the following chapter
0	xi-feng insisted that what had happened had chiefly come about through her own fault
0	on their return from the banquet which she gave them , their chairs were set down out¬side the pavilion-gate of the ning-guo mansion , where those of the younger jia males who had not escorted them to the palace were lined up on either side of the gateway waiting to receive them
0	moreover the gallery was bare and draughty and this was the midwinter season when the nights are long and the bitter north wind seems to pierce into the very marrow of the bones
0	such a mode of interpretation will look beyond the surface play of signification , ignoring the satanic claim that signs can be substituted for their referents , uncovering essence beneath appearance , and progressing
0	to him he adheres , resigns the whole warehouse of his religion , with all the locks and keys , into his custody ; and indeed makes the very person of that man his religion ; esteems his associating with him a sufficient evidence and commendatory of his own piety
0	nor is our meeting again like this today a coincidence , but rather a meaningful and marvellous event
0	that ’ s a little unnecessary , isn ’ t it ?
0	he had no intention of leaving straight away and announced to them all :
0	forever seeking strange meanings
0	before xi-chun had time to reply , their unobserved observer , unable to contain himself any longer , burst out laughing
0	staging was put up in readiness for the taoists and buddhists , but their requiems were to be deferred until cousin zhen should have returned
0	still , it ’ s not too late
0	wu xin-deng ’ s wife and mrs shan are already waiting for him at the painted gate on the south-west corner of the garden , said the woman who had brought the message
0	the maids all seemed terrified and rushed forward to pick it up , while grandmother jia clung to bao-yu in alarm
0	at that very moment a maid arrived summoning her back to li wan ’ s place and she had to leave him in a hurry
0	how would anyone dare do such a thing ?
0	across the sky to the world ’ s farthest end ,
0	they paid their respects , made their kotow and stood humbly to one side
0	that ’ s why your old grannie is so fond of her
0	because of you i , too , have made myself ill—only i haven ’ t dared tell anyone about it and have had to bear it all in silence
0	every day that fellow stays alive means one more day of nagging and lies for me to put up with
0	my dear , sheltered young innocent !
0	a versified faust-book was published in , the first wagner-book detailing the adventures of faust ’ s dull-witted servant appeared in , and we can date the inception of scholarly treatments of faust to , when georg rudolf widman brought out an extended edition of the historia complete with extensive commentary , learned research into previous magicians , and bilious theological invective
0	he made one last attempt to talk her round :
0	why , that was the story the lady storyteller told at the lantern festival a couple of years ago
0	then bao-yu made a condition :
0	it does hurt a bit , said bao-yu when she asked him , but nothing very terrible
0	you would have done much better to let me look at it in the first place , instead of hiding it so guiltily
0	her weariness after the day ’ s exertions seemed to fall from her , and she began reading again
0	dragon-robe satin , eighteen bolts
0	oh ’ nothing at all !
0	in the eighteenth century , the faustian attitude to autonomous representation and the objectification of the subject moves decisively into the realm of the erotic
0	inevitably xiu-yan became a little more withdrawn after it , spending rather less of her time in bao-chai 's and bao-qin 's company and speaking , when she was in it , rather more sparingly
0	but i know perfectly well what ’ s in your mind
0	in the tradition of french antihumanism , the unitary , rational subject is the product of the repressive , mysterious force that foucault terms power
0	she asked , observing xi-feng ’ s ugly expression
0	now , they said , we ’ ll see you back in style !
0	we should be delighted
0	and with that he slipped the stone into his sleeve and set off at a great pace with the taoist
0	i hate aspens great , stupid trees i it ’ s not as if they had more leaves than others , yet at the slightest breath of wind they start making a racket
0	after a silence lasting several minutes jia zheng suddenly seemed to think of something
0	she had a whole cupboard full of spare paper figures , and there were account slips all over the floor , listing families dealt with and amounts out¬standing , together with records of goodness knows how much money received for oil and incense
0	there was a loud burst of laughter from the assembled company
0	a family that was related to our family by marriage once
0	the spot where he expounded the sutras , the precinct of the scattered flowers , as it is called , can be seen on the hillside to this very day
0	walking on , he reached all spice court , which was locked and shuttered
0	if you say things like this behind her back , what must you say behind mine ?
0	then feng zi-ying told me about a scholar friend of his called zhang you-shi
0	i ’ m also glad of the opportunity my errand gives me of offering you my respects , ma ’ am , and of seeing the young ladies again , jia lian continued after er-jie had gone
0	when , after exchanging courtesies with them , he glanced back behind him , er-jie was stand¬ing unconcernedly in the same place , with the same inscrut¬able smile on her face ; but the handkerchief had vanished
0	lady wang bade her be seated , and together they discussed the whole adventure
0	the second thing is this , said aroma
0	lady xing criticized him for this , and he felt obliged to restrain himself
0	'that master of yours is such a barbarian , she said
0	whenever he had a chance to , he flirted or made eyes at them -unsuccessfully in san-jie 's case , for she met all his advances with indifference , but with a more promising reaction from her sister
0	oriole was by now so disgusted with the whole affair that she threw everything - basket , twigs and flowers - into the water and went off home , leaving the old aunt blessing her¬self in pious horror at the waste
0	if by the end of that time you are still in your present unre¬generate state , you may as well give up altogether , and i for my part shall have to think again about owning a creat¬ure like you as my son
0	concerning the rest of that day and the night which fol¬lowed our narrative is silent
0	item , total realized from sales of livestock and cereals taels silver
0	once , when no one was about , he took nightingale ’ s hand in his own and drew her to him
0	what i was going to tell you is that i ’ ve just had a visit from feng zi-ying
0	grandmother jia ’ s dinner was now served , and xi-feng and lady wang returned to their apartments
0	said xiang-yun , now genuinely indignant
0	it ’ s not just calling a doctor or taking medicine that she objects to
0	mrs lian is here , one of the servants announced
0	but if you wish to escape from the fiery pit , you have only to remember us when the time comes ) and all will be well
0	if that ’ s your attitude , said musk , we might as well carry out the whole boxful and let her tear away to her heart ’ s con¬tent
0	philosopher theophrastus wrote a study , on moral characters , which described various stock figures , whose characteristics frequently derive from the roles they occupy within usurious transactions

0	lady wang was still reluctant to broach any serious topic ; when jia zheng referred to her brother wang zieng ’ s death , she did her best not to appear too distressed ; and when he mentioned xue pan ’ s fresh calamities , her only comment was that he had brought them upon himself
0	but when will i next have a chance to get out and have some fun ?
0	in that same instant bao-yu knew who it was that she resembled : you san-jie
0	this one has got fruit and nuts and other things from the garden in it
0	i am afraid i was overwrought and allowed anger to get the better of me
0	you won ’ t ever tell your cousin pan about this , will you ?
0	all that day bao-yu stayed in his own room , seeing no one
0	social reality with material repercussions for future relations—the meeting of hands and it ’ s a deal , or the negotiation and witnessed signing of a contract
0	there ’ s always a reason for everything , he said
0	what a dreadful pity it is that our miss lin never had the fortune to be his bride !
0	while two cracked and worn uprights at the sides of the gate were inscribed with the following couplet :
0	as they did so , grandmother jia noticed , for the first time that evening , that bao-chai and bao-qin were not there
0	jia she was stunned :
0	if at a time like this you can ’ t share my anxiety—if you can think of nothing better to do than provoke me with that sort of silly talk , it shows that the concern i feel for you every waking minute of the day is wasted : that you just don ’ t care about me at all
0	this is truly a faustian pact , however , for in procuring the ability to eat souls the buyer is described as being himself enslaved and , in a moral sense , destroyed ( )
0	kingfisher said something of the sort just now and had master bao so worried that he sent me straight round to find out how she is
0	i ’ m in charge of the garden and i must ask you to return to your quarters
0	bao-yu ’ s sudden appearance at that moment was so unexpected that skybright found it comical
0	she spun round and saw the figure of a lady standing there before her
0	what a wonderful stroke of luck !
0	and to make matters worse , now i ’ ve got this idiot round my neck !
0	when i asked her , she told me it was caltrop ’ s new name
0	when he asked me who made them , i naturally didn ’ t date to tell him that you had , so i said that aunt wang had given them to me as a birthday present a few days before
0	he also planned to take a saddle-horse of his own as an alternative mount
0	crimson , carry these things to the hall for mr yun , said xi-feng curtly , and see him out
0	inquiries made among xiang-lian ’ s neighbours confirmed that he had not returned
0	this son of mine is the bane of our lives !
0	of course it is , said jia lian
0	at the sound of nightingale ’ s master bao , miss ’ , she raised herself wearily , though with a smiling face , and invited him to sit by her
0	there ’ s a nice little draught out here
0	he was accompanied by his mother and bao-chai , and there was quite a family gathering at rong-guo house
0	he says he only wants master bao-yu to call on him when¬ever he can
0	give me the cash and i ’ ll guarantee to deliver the goods
0	with the money you ’ ve already got you ’ d have no difficulty in finding yourself a very nice little wife , and if you decide to go away , i can promise you some more money towards your travel expenses
0	when the three young women had finished , grannie liu , who had been watching them , remarked on how little they had eaten
0	i thought you had come to see bao-yu
0	the extra strain this placed on her always delicate constitution brought on a severe attack of a recurrent sickness , and for a long time she was unable to pursue her lessons
0	you are more like one of bao-yu ’ s boys than one of the master ’ s
0	and don ’ t ever come back !
0	i suppose the doctors in attendance on this family aren ’ t too bad as doctors go , said bao-chai , but the medicines they prescribe for you don ’ t seem to make you any better
0	sounds of the wrangling going on inside were distinctly audible as they entered her courtyard
0	to identify belief in the efficacy of the sign with slavery to satan was a powerful weapon against uneducated practitioners of ritual magic
0	old kong mei-xi from the homeland of confucius called the book a mirror for the romantic
0	why did you think i would have a nasty experience ?
0	i am only trying to be helpful , sir
0	it will look as though you were inventing an excuse to get off school
0	she cast out again , and this time stood there angling for ages
0	jia rong himself returned to the party to report back to his father
0	at this period jia lan was still only a very little boy and did not really know what was going on
0	faust : so all of mankind is only empty words !
0	now don ’ t get carried away , grandma !
0	here can ’ t read or write
0	lady wang had forbidden the maids to kotow to younger members of the family for fear it might shorten their lives
0	dai-yu had no wish to see xi-feng , and rose to her feet hurriedly
0	when i was making my inspection yesterday , i decided to take a look at wan ’ s servants as well
0	the striking similarities between witchcraft discourses in , for example , seventeenth-century
0	so what are you going to do ?
0	amidst further laughter they looked at the instructions :
0	the pair of you should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves !
0	leah s marcus argues that in the b text there is a strong potential for contamination between the black arts of the magician , the elaborate
0	it ’ s faithful in there with her
0	it concerns the love between a man and a woman
0	it had the eight symbols of her nativity written on it and five needles sticking into it , one in the heart and one in each of the limbs
0	and haven ’ t i heard somewhere that your aunt er is already engaged to someone ?
0	whom frequent sconcings soon inebriate
0	and his old woman is as deaf as a post
0	market behavior provides a model that can be extended to other areas of life , and the last two decades have witnessed the emergence of economic imperialism : the colonizing of other fields by neoclassical economic theory
0	once faust ’ s prideful certainty of his dominance over the devil has been established , spies sets about systematically demolishing it
0	you ’ re having me on , said grannie liu , when she had eaten the proffered mouthful
0	they were given to my brother by mr zhen , madam
0	but all he said was :
0	but you know perfectly well that no one dares to rub me up the wrong way !
0	he tossed and turned for most of that night , and it was not until after five o ’ clock that he finally fell asleep
0	xi-feng would not look up at the statues , but otherwise conducted herself like a devout believer , kowtowing and taking the tube of fortune-sticks from the altar
0	she has little enough to do but get up to mischief as it is
0	but fancy your bringing this one here specially !
0	it is too late today
0	he did not like to mention that he had been to see her brother in case she was angry
0	so they forbade him to go
0	surely you owe a visit to the person who saved you from the mosquitoes ?
0	now , please don ’ t you worry , mother
0	the two of them then went in again and resumed their places
0	these old nannies are all the same
0	you ’ re supposed to use only quotations in this game
0	at all events , i can ’ t give you this sword , said xiang-lian
0	the simple answer to that is that i have to follow the rules
0	viewed from this perspective , lust is evil in itself ; a seductive distraction from love ’ s properly spiritual end
0	and rong-guo house makes itself ready for
0	but perhaps you would like to send for the bailiff , as you have a copy yourself , to make sure the list is genuine
0	it is quite out of the question that i should deliberately deceive their ladyships in order to cover up for them
0	next morning , as soon as he had washed and combed his hair , he sat down at the window and began painstakingly copying kai-shu , characters out of a sample-book
0	europe had always been full of cunning men and women , who practiced what was known as natural magic
0	but it ’ s as well to know how
0	everyone was of course delighted to hear that he was coming back so soon
0	she began to cry
0	shall i go with you ?
0	losing it is what has made him lose his wits
0	but the western world too is ruled by icons , charms , and fetishes
0	then he returned and removed his copy of zhuang-zi from the table , collecting up at the same time some of his other favourite esoteric books ( a collection that included the hermetic clavicule , the secret of the primordial flower and the compendium of the five lamps )
0	whether they get round to it or not , said xi-feng , they still need materials for the job , and they can ’ t get the materials if i don ’ t choose to give them the tallies—i can tell you that for sure !
0	jia lian went straight off to discuss the matter with lin zhi-xiao himself
0	he got on the kang and began tickling skybright
0	and then i wished that i had wings to fly
0	one of them could have slipped out on some pretext or other when no one was looking to flirt with the pages on the inner gate and got it from one of them
0	grandmother jia immediately put a hand on pearl ’ s shoulder and set off , accompanied by xi-feng
0	if you ever hear that i ’ ve been drinking with those others again , sis , you can spit at me and you can call me a beast and a—and a—worthless louse !
0	( ) for the followers of aristotle , then , the reason money can not reproduce is that it is not an essence in itself , but an expression of the value of other essences
0	they smiled at her as she emerged , and one of them chaffed her about the length of her visit
0	i came here to have a word with uncle lian
0	the wedding chamber was a off , and the guests heard nothing of the weeping , but from the naiad ’ s house , in a brief interval of silence between their lamentations , they heard a faint snatch of musicin the distance
0	i ’ ve got no one to tell my troubles to
0	bao-yu laughingly intercepted her
0	something about knowing in advance that things would be like this , and then something about behaving rather differently
0	when it came to old style prose , the case was rather different
0	xue ke would naturally stay with his aunt and occupy the study that xue pan had vacated
0	tan-chun handed li wan the relevant account to look at , while at the same time informing wu xin-deng ’ s wife of her decision :
0	to his great surprise he discovered that she was in earnest and not at all willing to comply with his wishes
0	the famous paragon of all the virtues ?
0	objections to such hubris also informed protests against the nascent insurance industry , as the use of money to insulate oneself against providence was portrayed as a prideful circumvention of the hand of god
0	she felt sure that he would get up to some kind of mischief now that he was removed from jia zheng ’ s restraint
0	if you don ’ t do it properly , they will laugh at you
0	i ’ m long past caring about appearances !
0	surely you know better than that ?
0	similarly , if i say i promise to marry you while secretly determined to remain a bachelor , the statement is neither false not infelicitous
0	why was she glum ?
0	bao-yu changed his mind about going to see xi-chun and accompanied periwinkle to the naiad ’ s house
0	i hope you won ’ t take offence
0	bao-chai said , turning to tan-chun ’ s maid ebony
0	the geographical gazetteer , you ’ ll find that it isn ’ t only guan yu who has graves in several different places : practic¬ally all the famous men who ever lived appear to have been buried in more than one place
0	for example , the sky is yang and the earth is yin ; water is yin and fire is yang ; the sun is yang and the moon is yin
0	a general warrant for their arrest would soon be issued , after which it would be impossible for them to pass through the inspection posts
0	there ’ s no time like the present
0	xue pan stared at her in astonishment
0	reflect with care upon this first line , and do not let your pen be hasty !
0	the peach-flowers and the peach-leaves nod in a rich array :
0	the first will be a three-hundred-line poem in pentasyllabics exhausting the rhyme first
0	he sat back , gazed at the ceiling and was soon lost in a daydream
0	well now , simple , said lady xing , you seem very pleased with yourself
0	we ’ ve got all the other places to go to yet , and if we delay too long , word will get round that we are coming and they will be prepared for us
0	isn ’ t it just like her to reduce the entire party to anarchy before we have even begun i ’ said tan-chun
0	if that gets us nowhere , then let ’ s by all means look for another doctor
0	those mothers of yours ought not to drink so much or be so free with their tongues - that ’ s the cause of all this trouble
0	i want to have a word with you , , said jia zheng , when he arrived , concerning your studies
0	when did you get back ?
0	bao-yu took back the book from her with a good-natured laugh :
0	i don ’ t see what answer i can give when you say things like that , said bao-yu
0	sister is such a funny girl
0	with the transition from a barter to a money economy , value must be expressed in the form of a common denominator
0	you ’ ve been carrying it around with you everywhere , said aroma
0	will it come up ?
0	tears were streaming down dai-yu ’ s face as she spoke
0	unable to defend themselves , the girls were obliged to endure a long and abusive dressing-down , after which grandmother jia concluded the affair by carrying bao-yu off to her own apart¬ment
0	for firste , he hath a certain allowance of the archdivell who owns the money , for helping him to such vent for his coyne : secondly , he hath a great deale more usurie to himselfe , of him who borroweth the money , than he alloweth the owner of the mony : and , thirdly , he hath not the least part for making the writings between them
0	when asked his name , shore superfluously adds that he is a goldsmith by my trade ( ) , and before marching off to fight the rebels he resolves that enuie shall neuer say that mathew shore / the goldsmith staid , when other men went out ( )
0	we energetic younger ones may tie up a dozen servants , but we are still not so effective as her
0	this news , so precious to the ears of lady jia and lady wang , who at once had rice gruel brought in to feed them with , was relayed to the girls in the outer room
0	it ’ s because if they bought you stuff of better quality , they ’ d be in trouble with the regular buyers , said patience
0	i must say , she never struck me as a wily seductress
0	mrs lian says thank you very much , and she hopes you didn ’ t think her greedy for asking
0	by buddha ’ s altar lamp should sleep alone !
0	moreover the school itself ought to be situated on it
0	soon the news had spread to the other parts of the rong household and to the household next door and jia she , lady xing , cousin zhen , jia zheng , jia lian , jia rong , jia yun , jia ping , aunt xue and xue pan—not to mention zhou rui ’ s wife and a great bevy of domestics both high and low—came hurrying into the garden , adding numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators
0	having already , in this first encounter , caused her husband to lower his colours and at the same time discovered that her mother-in-law was harmless , jin-gui began pressing forwards in quest of yet further victories
0	the burglars must have put us to sleep by burning some sort of incense
0	how grandmother jia replied will be shown in the follow¬ing chapter
0	the maids now went outside to fetch tea , leaving the two of them alone together
0	of course it ’ s your fault , said xi-feng
0	number am glad that you have come , because now you will be able to
0	we can report to the throne for the necessary authorization afterwards
0	today was—or would have been if -she had lived—golden ’ s birthday , and for this reason be had been feeling miserable since early morning
0	she was more particularly worried for bao-yu , who had not been out at all since his encounter with the monk
0	see if he can shed any light on the matter
0	perhaps i shouldn ’ t say this , but in view of all that she ’ s done for you , it doesn ’ t seem very fair to make such a big fuss about this one favour , especially when you think how many other people are involved
0	he peeped up at the prince as they advanced and saw that he was , as report had painted him , an extremely good-looking young man
0	come here , said grandmother jia with a twinkle in her eye
0	n , from now on i shall concentrate on doing my duty and not allow myself to get involved
0	yet yours was a generous , open-hearted nature ,
0	skybright had been coughing a good deal during the final stages of her task and it had been all she could do to conclude
0	old mrs zhu has been again
0	he was always getting beaten
0	perhaps she ’ s fallen into the privy , one of the young people suggested cheerfully
0	it was on that occasion that musk had gone out during the night and skybright had tried to play a trick on her and give her a fright
0	xiu-yan ran her eye over it and laughed
0	then he went home , calling at ni er ’ s house on the way to give the message to his wife
0	and if one person is beaten or given the sack , it will have to be everyone
0	go and get some of the other girls together and decide how much you are going to give
0	grannie liu dealt him a hefty slap
0	law ’ s ultimately disastrous but perspicacious experiment was used by goethe as the inspiration for the paper money scene in faust part two , which explores the connections between alchemical and financial value at length
0	remembering patience ’ s many kindnesses to er-jie while she was still alive , you-shi nodded her head sympathetically
0	you are to see that all the gates are locked and keep a look-out for fires
0	the tea-water today has nothing to do with me
0	five hundred taels of silver from the imperial
0	the bride and groom made their prostrations to heaven and earth , the paper offerings were set fire to , and mrs you conducted her heavily-veiled daughter into the marriage-chamber , gratified to observe the transformation wrought by a completely new and expensive-looking outfit of clothes and jewellery
0	in isles by tortoises supported
0	after jia zheng ’ s departure , cousin zhen and jia lian re¬turned to their separate apartments , while bao-yu went back to grandmother jia ’ s
0	the nurse smiled , grimaced , and shook her head
0	i beseech you to pray for me , said xi-feng
0	if you want someone fetched , you ’ d better go and find someone whose job it is to fetch them
0	dai-yu reflected for a moment or two , then smiled
0	it ’ s true then , said xi-feng , smiling delightedly
0	i ’ m sure it will , said lady wang
0	at the present moment he is so hard up that sooner than die of hunger and cold , he is prepared to do almost anything
0	tell him not to be in so much of a hurry
0	and tell tealeaf to go and get dr wang , said bao-yu
0	see that he goes to bed early and doesn ’ t get up too late
0	you will have to be up early again tomorrow
0	she had agreed in this instance only because grandmother jia had asked her to and she could not very well refuse
0	better the dogs eat it than these swindlers have it all i ’
0	the prince led forth the emperor ’ s men the rebel hordes to quell
0	leave all these little things to me
0	dai-yu was aware that bao-vu ’ s maids often played tricks on one another , and it occurred to her that the girl in the courtyard , not recognizing her voice , might have mistaken her for another maid and be keeping her locked out for a joke
0	after he had gone , lady xing and lady wang turned on xi-feng and began scolding her ; but grandmother jia did what she could to comfort her by dismissing the incident as unimportant
0	i ’ m sure she ’ d be better than this one
0	it ’ s obviously colder today than it was yesterday
0	as he was on his way in again after seeing the chamberlain off the premises , jia huan with two or three pages at his heels came stampeding across the courtyard
0	after a long silence , dai-yu began to speak again , searching for breath between words :
0	when prettikins came in looking for her fan , she had been on the point of adding some facetiousness of her own at bao-chai ’ s expense ; but bao-chai ’ s brief explosion caused her to drop the prepared witticism and ask instead what play the two acts were from that bao-chai said she had just been watching
0	if i ’ d known you were going to start giving me a lecture
0	she even knows about outside mat¬ters
0	and , saying this , he poured yu-cun a large cup of wine
0	dime ’ s daughter thought this over to herself :
0	just at that moment the servants outside announced miss lin ’ arid almost simultaneously dai-yu came flouncing into the room
0	it really had nothing to do with you
0	even if bao-yu were to marry another lady and i witnessed the wedding with my own eyes , i swear i wouldn ’ t breathe a word of it to anyone
0	i know her sort , said xi-feng
0	even in our households the children aren ’ t allowed to listen to such stories
0	by now the zhangs were really upset and sent to the capital for some moral support - for they are now quite determined to break off their daughter ’ s en¬gagement , seeing that the captain has been so unreasonable
0	the woman saw her daughter go up to bao-yu inside the house and bao-yu take her by the hand
0	she picked up the wine-kettle and pouted out a cupful of wine ; then , having drunk half of it herself , she threw an arm round jia lian ’ s neck and pressed the winecup to his lips
0	he spat in his face
0	they were now ready to leave
0	i think it ’ s a splendid name for her !
0	he looked round and smiled happily as his eyes rested on the hibiscus bushes
0	you ’ d better not waste time jawing , then , said bao-yu , and left the young toxophilite to his pursuits
0	john : – uses the term logos for the word of god , and paul conveys the same relation when he refers to christ as the image ( eikon ) of god ( corinthians )
0	by the end of the novel , he is quite conscious that , as he tells lord henry : the soul is a terrible reality
0	speckled bamboo : one hundred
0	bao-yu took his leave , and had reached the door , when ripple appeared , followed by a junior maid bearing a small pot of orchid-plants
0	but it ’ s no use ; he won ’ t listen
0	parfumee was the only one to abstain
0	from then on it was a steady stream :
0	don ’ t start making a scene about it now !
0	summon him and he would visit her then gladly enough , for he still had some small hope of winning her ; but he was careful to behave himself when he did , and to defer in everything to her wishes
0	due to this system , an unnatural situation pertains in the postmodern world
0	tear off a little leg for me , will you ?
0	presently , when the visiting ladies had dispersed , lady wang asked xi-feng what her plans were for the rest of the day
0	bao-yu was so taken aback that for a while he said nothing
0	she had often heard her mother say that her grandmother jia ’ s home was not like other people ’ s houses
0	it would be no joke if you were to have an accident
0	the servant sent back a reassuring report to jia zheng , himself remaining behind to await further developments
0	i come whence i come , and i go whither i go
0	she picked up the gift of koumiss and began to drink it
0	instead she decided to bide her time , and continued to accumu¬late a deep and bitter store of resentment towards her rival
0	said jia zheng when they were all seated
0	let them say that it was i who could not tolerate my own husband ’ s sister and drove her to a nunnery !
0	why , you might wait ten years before getting all those things at the proper times !
0	it would simply be a question of brazening it out
0	what a blessing this is , to return to the scene of my childhood dream !
0	i didn ’ t call you over
0	he did up his gown again and sat down abstractedly by the lamp
0	on the other side of the picture were directions for the person drawing the card and for the other drinkers :
0	yu ’ re none of you to mention my illness to master bao
0	and i have to take my medicine when i get back
0	and i really do think that while she is away you might try to compose yourself a bit and not go working yourself up into such a state
0	the girls rushed around tidying up , and told jia qin to hide
0	you wouldn ’ t catch her sending us things like this !
0	xi-feng opened her eyes , and as she looked at the old dame , she felt strangely moved
0	got a few taels of silver here
0	he said that when your step-mother died , you moved your sister in regardless and married her to lian as his number two
0	the two maids split up to make their inquiries , but everywhere they went it was the same story
0	no one is safe from you
0	she was very much taken with oriole ’ s handiwork
0	well , even if we haven ’ t got any , said lady wang , you can send to your mother-in-law ’ s for some ; and probably they will have some at your cousin zhen ’ s
0	lady wang was eagerly awaiting the return of bao-yu and jia lan , and when midday came and there was still no sign of either of them , she , li wan and bao-chai all began to worry and sent one servant after another to find out what had become of them
0	anything but well , replied the woman
0	is that the divine luminescent page ?
0	this fiendish paradox , through which rationality is revealed as the ultimate superstition , is what adorno elsewhere calls the dialectic of enlightenment
0	in the evening she sat by the lamp thinking about it , and it was after midnight when she went to bed
0	we paid money to get our jobs , and here we are after more than a month with nothing to show for it
0	leastways it would show my gratitude
0	just at that moment they were interrupted by an announcement from outside
0	unless be meant , whom i conjecture , our grand foe , satan ; who , in the serpent , hath contrived against us this deceit : to crush his head would be revenge indeed !
0	when i was young , i too abhorred anything that smacked of the platitude and the cliche
0	she also gave him three hundred taels with which to streng¬then his persuasion
0	this rebellion issues in the birth of sin , who is an image of satan
0	the parable does indeed justify usury
0	well , all i can say is that it ’ s very nice of you to have taken time off when you could have been winning money , to go out in the rain and bring me these things
0	xi-feng tutted and looked amused
0	you said , i expect chess is looking after it
0	now i ’ ve done it !
0	there ’ s no cause to be angry with me , miss , she said
0	interrupted bao-chai impatiently , before he had finished speaking
0	we could play go together and chat
0	she ’ ll take you seriously
0	the nuns at the temple or the priory ?
0	the two men took turns on night-duty in the outer study , and during the daytime enjoyed themselves with the servants , throwing parties and inviting a variety of friends , who took it in turns with them to act as host
0	oh , and if lady jia should ask any of you about this , tell her that we used the ginseng she gave us
0	nevertheless , when she had gone a little way towards her carriage , she changed her mind and , turning back , called him to her so that she could whisper a parting request in his ear
0	i have chosen a bad time to come !
0	now i feel thy power / within
0	if you don ’ t want your things to be searched , you have only to say so and i shall tell her ladyship
0	perhaps sir zheng is planning to send for us all !
0	as soon as the old woman had gone out , oriole moved closer to where bao-chai was sitting and spoke softly into her ear
0	pray allow me to be your guide !
0	swansdown ’ velvet , four rolls
0	this the minister did and drafted a detailed memorial on the subject
0	he usually requires intolerable assurance , mortgage & c his money weares not
0	no one else is to accompany me but you
0	not your job to run errands ?
0	yu-cun ’ s delight goes without saying
0	do you think if i really had a magic formula i ’ d be sitting here talking to you now ?
0	, but he was too distraught to reply
0	how can she possibly remember all those names ?
0	it a faint strain of music from outside
0	you and i have only two pairs of eyes between us
0	no , no , no , you ’ ve made a mistake !
0	this was a great relief
0	i was dying to ask the mistress if she would let me move in with you after mr xue had gone , said caltrop , but i was afraid she might think i only wanted to get into the garden to play
0	she fell back and collided with amber , who looked up in turn , screamed and stood rooted to the spot
0	and the play reprises all the now-familiar motifs of the legend
0	her affianced , now a young man of nineteen , was a gambler and a wastrel
0	i just want them to have it ready for me
0	in a sermon preached in , william jackson inveighed against
0	look at the state my eyes are in i ’ she said
0	on the day in question , after waking from his midday nap , he noticed that bao-chai was out and was
0	aroma made a valiant attempt to avert any further blunders
0	a little smile played over bao-yu ’ s face and he nodded
0	see if you can tell me the answers
0	the others rose and invited her to be seated
0	how dare you talk such nonsense !
0	while she was speaking , the drumming began again
0	but as he was passing by the gateway of xi¬-feng ’ s courtyard , it happened that xi-feng herself was stand¬ing in her doorway with one foot on the threshold , grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her direction
0	you ’ re lucky then , said li wan
0	her silence only increased bao-yu ’ s own misgivings , and finally in some embarrassment he stood up and said :
0	i thought we hadn ’ t heard the last of that
0	at next day ’ s session a group of well-known associates of the wanted man were brought in and subjected by yu-cun to careful questioning
0	don ’ t be so stuffy , chai !
0	the doctor left and the ladies all returned to their apart¬ments in much improved spirits
0	why , we have fewer servants for lady jia ’ s funeral than we had for qin ke-qing ’ s !
0	is your mistress any better , patience ?
0	dai-yu picked up a hazel-nut
0	it was just my luck , he thought to himself ; to have been lumbered with this first prince !
0	still— ’ she turned to crimson , perhaps we ought to ask the party most concerned if she is willing
0	lady xing brought her a cup of ginseng tea , and she put her lips to it
0	midst odorous herbs the singer ’ s green fan hides ;
0	they , too , left in order of precedence and had not finally dispersed until around two o ’ clock
0	who it was and what she wanted will be revealed in the fol¬lowing chapter
0	there ’ s nothing like it for building you up if you have low vitality
0	cousin oaf and uncle dumbo , each with a partner , were playing six-dice grabs on the kang in the outer room
0	actually my idea is not to mention this to lady jia at first
0	nothing serious , i hope ?
0	and due gratitude show for the gift of a meal
0	first creditor : [ taking witgood aside ] do you hear , sir ?
0	what ’ s the matter with patience ?
0	the pool ’ s pink-petalled lotus crowns have gone ,
0	the palanquin passed through the gateway and into the first courtyard
0	and then there was miss lin , you must have heard about that
0	what if grand¬father did make a little bit of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment ?
0	now that he knew the kylin on the tray was like one that shi xiang-yun wore , bao-yu hurriedly picked it up and thrust it inside his jacket
0	when they returned , and when their master ques¬tioned them about the young lady ’ s provenance , they did not dare conceal the truth
0	she doesn ’ t play for the money , she just enjoys winning
0	is her life in danger ?
0	i ought to tell you that
0	the etymological root of avaritia in aveo , to crave , exerts its influence here
0	he ordered them to find one , but they were stumped too
0	cousin , i ’ ve come to pay you my respects !
0	friends and rel¬atives were all eager to celebrate , but he was not in festive mood
0	music is an apt medium through which to explore such shifts in the status of representation , for it is a non-referential or autonomous form of expression
0	these were drawn from greek philosophy and the bible , and it will help to examine the hellenic and the hebraic traditions separately , in order to see what they share in common as well as how they differ
0	finding that he could not go on , a sort of panic gripped him
0	bao-yu agreed , delighted that she had accepted , and hurried back to find aroma , head low and eyes to the ground , think¬ing about caltrop all the way
0	it was in this way that she first came to the attention of grandmother jia
0	there was an answering call from the women below , and presently a number of them came for¬ward bearing trays and boxes of various shapes and sizes which they handed up onto the kang
0	as soon as she caught sight of xiang-yun , she hurried down into the courtyard to welcome her , and taking her by the hand , led her into the house , animatedly exchanging news with her as they went
0	she wept as she spoke
0	after dinner , tea was brought in and feng ’ s page came in and murmured something in his master ’ s ear
0	satan openly admits his purely psychological status , arguing that , in the age of the hyper-real , physical nonexistence is no bar to earthly dominion
0	bao-chai ’ s absence caused a momentary depression in bao-yu ’ s spirits , which was however soon dispelled by the presence of dai-yu
0	some can be sold , some kept on , as seems most appropriate
0	caltrop murmured a reply and went off to make her calls , beginning with grandmother jia
0	and the members of the family bad themselves gradually died off until only yu-cun was left there were no prospect for him in his home town , so he had set off for the capital , in search of fame and fortune
0	after seeing yu-cun off , shi-yin went to bed and slept without a break until the sun was high in the sky next morn¬ing
0	after studying it , li wan , tan-chun and bao-chai sent one of the women to obtain the drugs from outside and to supervise the making-up and administering of the medicine
0	in anthropology , the performative is often described as a reflexive domain , in which the performer overtly engages in acts of self-fashioning
0	however good a person may be to start with , once they get into that profession , they ’ re ruined
0	after he had gone back to his seat , the game continued
0	to think they should have produced a bright little thing like this between them ! —how old are you ?
0	your soul must fly home to its own country
0	i never have any savings because as soon as i ’ ve got any money i spend it all
0	i noticed just now that the red plum in green bower hermitage is very fine
0	while the three of them were leaving , bao-yu stopped to have a word with adamantina
0	if you get up late , people will laugh at you
0	i recognize that kite , said bao-yu
0	saladin is spectacularly rewarded for his attitude by being physically transformed into the image of satan , complete with horns , tail , and cloven hooves
0	flog him to death !
0	i heard you chanting
0	yuan-chun ’ s gifts , which were delivered to the mansion by eunuchs , were :
0	to the latter ’ s considerable surprise and mystification he found , on going outside to look , his sister ’ s young master waiting at the gate with a servant
0	i was just turning it for fun , to see how it works
0	amber did not dare utter a word
0	you can ’ t expect her to stand up to your teasing in the way that we can
0	ying-chun saw her out as far as the courtyard gate
0	i ’ d never have asked her if i ’ d realized
0	lady xing is your own grandmother , and with your father away she has every right to make these decis¬ions
0	they had gone no more than a few steps out of the courtyard gate when little tangerine came running after them and handed chess a silk purse , while with the other hand she wiped her streaming eyes
0	however , the leipzig script is not devoid of theological sophistication
0	certainly , the accusa-tory voice of the devil has the power to enter ivan ’ s thoughts at will , without his own volition
0	nightingale went in to see how dai-yu was and found the quilt in the same crumpled heap as before
0	the reading of these words was greeted with general laughter
0	he had a look at the collected sheets himself
0	if it has to be like this now , he said , as if to himself ; it ’ s a pity it was ever like it was in the beginning
0	then the elements , fire and water , bona communia , and therefore gratis to be communicated to one another ( saith cicero ) might be let out or sold for money , because mediately they are very useful
0	try and get them to quieten down
0	xi-feng managed to struggle through the rest of that day and the next , and early in the morning of the first of the month she had her carriage made ready , and set out for the convent of the scattered flowers , accompanied by patience and a bevy of serving-women
0	i would want the best for any member of the family , and especially for qiao-jie , for her parents ’ sake
0	she turned to you-shi
0	you really mustn ’ t let servants get away with it like this
0	i can ’ t suddenly go altering them
0	like taylor , milton is convinced that a hireling will automatically be drawn toward idolatry , because the conception of labor as a thing for sale involves a process of objectification analogous to that by which divinity is identified with an icon
0	i have made you drunk with fairy wine
0	i shall report to her old ladyship and mrs lian
0	i say nothing of other families , but the jias of the ning and rong households used to be famous for the way in which they brought up their sons
0	when cousin zhen first made his request , her mind had at once consented ; and now , observing that lady wang appeared to be already half persuaded , she hastened to complete the process
0	aunt xue happened to be in bao-chai ’ s room and heard the terrible racket they were making
0	patience , go back and tell your mistress : i insist that these payments should be discontinued
0	if only nightingale would hurry up and come back !
0	my dear wan , can ’ t you see what a futile waste of time this all is ?
0	so who was it ?
0	bao-yu and the other guests arranged themselves on the kang , while the seven maids and parfumee , as hosts , sat on the row of chairs below , within reach of one or other of the tables
0	she smiled back , however , and did her best to oblige
0	she sent lady wang away and told bao-yu to bid his uncle she and cousin zhen farewell and to return immediately afterwards
0	monks and nuns always have the best-kept gardens , said grandmother jia , in smiling approval of what she saw
0	i find , he said , that it is not to be
0	because images were not naturally efficacious , any more than money is naturally fertile , any attempt to use images for objective effects was a violation of nature , and thus satanic
0	yet the sovereign deity
0	what an uncannily apt response on the part of the oracle !
0	then she read the gatha
0	that is what everyone has been told
0	grannie liu , surprised and delighted ( as she showed by her many pious ejaculations ) to be receiving these further presents in addition to what patience had shown her the night before , seemed eager to accede to this request
0	bao-yu would never let me come back , however half¬witted he may be
0	but i could not bear to leave without seeing you lust once more before i go
0	brave ma yuan to conquest and empire was born :
0	i call that most insulting !
0	beside them stood a silver spittoon
0	in the two middle couplets , the developing and turning ones , you have to have tone-contrast and parallel¬ism
0	that ’ s for her to decide
0	a monster with a yellow face and a red beard , all dressed in green !
0	anyway , my sister seems very happy with the idea , but she says she will have to wait until pan comes home before saying any¬thing final
0	we shall never get anywhere unless we do something like that
0	you didn ’ t ; you missed me , she said
0	there ’ s nothing seriously wrong with lady jia , said dr wang when they were seated
0	she and little lan still spend their days quietly together
0	their conversation was interrupted by a burst of angry shouting from the direction of bao-yu ’ s room
0	faust ’ s students seem not to be sexually tempted by simulacra , whereas one only has to look around to see that twenty-first century men and women are perfectly capable of finding erotic stimulation in mere images
0	her rose-fresh beauty reminded him strongly of bao-chai , but there was also something about her of dai-yu ’ s delicate charm
0	she turned back , blushing to the tips of her ears , but not in tune to escape the notice of the other two
0	she had a gentle , sweet , reserved manner
0	both luther and melanchthon report devil-pacts that involve satan paying money for souls , and the huge market for devil-books as well as the instant popularity of the historia itself suggest that the threat of satanic magic seemed very serious
0	surely you know me better than that ?
0	that whole match was a blunder on my elder brother ’ s part
0	lady wang now proceeded to inspect bao-yu ’ s things
0	the card-game continued until dinner-time , and it was not until after dinner that the company finally broke up
0	they are a bit hard up , but mama is a great deal more relaxed than she used to be
0	they were in a terrible state , very worried and frightened
0	from youth ’ s extravagance you sought release
0	but when i reported just now , they said i was to bring her , said the woman
0	it was a surprise to him , needless to say , to call with the other pages on his sick workmate and find fivey ’ s mother at the bedside
0	i admit it was very wrong of me to make free with your parent , but after all , you ’ ve only got to mention my father next time you want to fool me and we ’ ll be quits i ’
0	many of his contemporaries pointed to the link between the theatrical and the economic variants of magical thinking
0	he observed that she was wearing a little pale blue fur-lined dress embroidered with flowers , and an ermine-lined sleeveless jacket , while her hair was coiled up in her every¬day style and had no flowers in it but only a flat hairpin of purest gold
0	it ’ s all this yun ’ s fault , or whatever his wretched name is
0	to clear themselves , and patience was the first to volunteer
0	when they saw that the old lady was tired , they all went their separate ways home
0	look , i ’ m not just saying this to flatter you , said jia lian , but though i know plenty of other people who have a thousand taels ’ worth of stuff in their keeping , they none of them have your courage or intelligence
0	a lot of these rare plants are mentioned in li sao and wen xuan , particularly in the poetical descriptions of the three capitals by zuo si
0	how can i eat this horrible greasy stuff ?
0	grandmother jia , lady wang , jia lian , patience and aroma had cried themselves into a state bordering on prostration
0	no wonder it ’ s getting so cold , said grandmother jia
0	so she will be staying at home anyway
0	measure of life ; it rather pertains to the quality , the essential nature , of life
0	you ’ ve known nothing but soft living since you were born , i said
0	it ’ s all ripple ’ s fault !
0	our familiarity with this practice may have blinded us to its implications , but these were quite visible years ago , when it was still in its infancy
0	bao-yu surveyed the scene approvingly
0	first creditor : let none of them see it , i beseech you
0	this was an occasion for further tears
0	why don ’ t i just die and get it over with ?
0	he closed his eyes and was lost once more in his meditations
0	these two couches with a pair of tables each were for grandmother jia and aunt xue
0	and if you are short of anything , don ’ t behave like a little frightened mouse ; ask me straight out for it , without delay
0	many other plays feature jews or lombards march ,
0	losing a thing like this is much more serious
0	jin-gui , on the other hand , pursued him with an eagerness that made him feel most uncomfortable
0	most countries in the modern world were born in debt , and the former colonial powers have successfully cooperated to ensure that they remain in that condition
0	isn ’ t that bao-chai ’ s place ?
0	just the thing , your old ladyship , said elegante drily
0	when they arrived outside the ning-guo mansion , tealeaf told the cabbie to stop
0	yesterday a little devil on the bridge offered to murder lebyadkin and marya timofeevna to resolve the matter of my legal marriage once and for all and cover all traces
0	and a flood of passion allows evil spirits
0	of course , i realize that i shall never be able to do justice to the score
0	simultaneously another dicing game , driving the sheep , was being played by several players sitting round a large table on the floor below
0	she must behave prop¬erly , if she is to earn my love
0	it is hard to say how long the four of them might have remained there in this impasse had not a servant arrived at that moment and summoned them to dinner in grandmother jia ’ s room
0	they went inside together
0	that meant that quite apart from the fact that they didn ’ t have to find my keep any more , they were getting an additional four or five hundred cash each month that i managed to save out of my wages
0	there was little pretence or illusion that the rise of finance was somehow conducive to the general good ; on the contrary it is almost always portrayed as a zero-sum game , as in george whetstone ’ s the rock of regard ( ) :
0	lady jia gave instructions to slip her grace ’ s eight stems and branches in with some of the maids ’ , and to ask this man to tell their fortunes
0	i should worry less
0	bother your two heads are better than one !
0	as soon as he was up next morning , someone came in with a message to say that the melons and mooncakes he had ordered were now ready and it only remained for him to say who they were to be sent to
0	he was his grand¬father ’ s favourite
0	i remember it now
0	but the usurer generally takes for the bare use ; for hazard he will run none
0	but now we are older it is rather different
0	some minutes later xi-feng and you- shi sent a servant in to inquire whether the boys would like anything else to eat , adding that they had only to ask if they wanted anything
0	finally only skybright ’ s trunk remained
0	this was one of the reasons why she tended to keep aloof from bao-yu
0	i ’ ll be sending someone over later
0	xi-feng immediately sent someone in great secrecy to explain euergesia ’ s business to brightie
0	arriving at the naiad ’ s house , he could see the remains of incense smoke as he entered the courtyard gate
0	you ’ d better keep your voices down
0	xi-feng went back to see him
0	like ravening beasts , or swarming bees after the queen has flown –
0	too much of this might ruin her chances of being born again
0	a faint light burned in the duty-room and a sliver of moon half-way up the sky shed a feeble radiance from above
0	'when , during this past week or two , has moonbeam had the time to go inside your room ?
0	at that moment lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife came in :
0	went into its production
0	see the three of them back to their room now , said grandmother jia to her women
0	fetch it out at once and get on with it , my girl !
0	one wondered what the unfortunate girls had done to deserve being considered for such a fate
0	but none the less , it would look very bad for a girl from a family such as ours to enter a nunnery
0	in fact , i shan ’ t be content unless we do
0	your cousins are too young for these matters and i am too busy
0	would you be mrs xia , ma ’ am ?
0	i ’ ll tell a joke instead
0	i know not why my heart ’ s so strangely sad ,
0	dai-yu affected scorn , but was blushing hotly
0	you should have heard her last night
0	you don ’ t want oriole to get a telling-off
0	you would poke your nose in , wouldn ’ t you , and now you ’ ve got smut on it !
0	never mind that , said bao-yu airily
0	i ’ m sure if i had , it would all have been settled long ago
0	yet do these flowers , of hue so rich and rare ,
0	said dai-yu , endeavouring to tug one of his hands away from the door-jamb
0	don ’ t be such an idiot !
0	oh , it was nothing important , said bao-yu
0	you go to bed too , my dear
0	it wasn ’ t about poetry or painting that you came to see me : it was revenge for patience you were after
0	so from then on oriole was put in charge
0	she said , rising to her feet
0	she ’ s a regular camel-dealer , that one
0	those lions outside the main gate are solid jade , and they ’ ve a golden kylin in the garden - used to be two , till one was stolen !
0	child , have you heard the news ?
0	i did tell them to stop , said jia rui , but they wouldn ’ t listen
0	why , at the inquest the defendant himself admitted to assaulting zhang and deal¬ing the fatal blow with the cup , and you verified the admission yourself
0	i ’ ve got something nice for you here and i ’ ve been waiting for you to come so that i could give it to you
0	some went out¬side to admire the peonies or to lean on the balustrade at the edge of the lake and look at the fish swimming in the water below
0	the maids there told her that they were in tan-chun ’ s apartment with the others , so she retraced her footsteps and called in at autumn studio
0	we ’ ve certainly never had such a mountain in our garden , and one is not going to spring suddenly from nowhere
0	in all the years he ’ s spent here pan hasn ’ t made a single decent friend !
0	there was a further message for patience :
0	the women were enthusiastic
0	we know of a certain mongol prince , replied the girls
0	the only trouble is , master bao still thinks of no one but miss li it ’ s a good thing he didn ’ t hear just now
0	the caul of a first-born child ;
0	they ’ ve gone to sleep
0	there is no need to consult me any fur¬ther
0	so this is my respected cousin ?
0	i ’ ll kill the lot of you and swing for it
0	and with no defenders , qing-zhou ’ s fate seemed already to be sealed
0	now perhaps you ’ ll have some idea what i feel like most numberf the time !
0	the reference to earlier forms of globalisation ( slave trade ) is now used in order to express and contest , in a witchcraft idiom , newer forms of globalisation , such as the differential access to consumer goods and post-colonial state power
0	bao-chai ’ s eye came to rest on the jade
0	though an imperial purveyor , he was wholly innocent of business skill and savoir-faire ; and though , for his father ’ s and grand¬father ’ s sake , he was allowed to register at the ministry and receive regular payments of grain and money , everything else was looked after for him by the clerks and factors of the family business
0	as they laughed and chattered together , the actors even¬tually finished performing the second of the two pieces xi¬-feng had selected , whereupon the wine was removed from the tables and rice served
0	she was to see how aroma was and urge her not to endanger her health by excessive weeping
0	i ’ ve been a bit better this last day or two , so mother brought me into the garden with her for a change of air
0	this was probably preordained because of something they did in their past lives
0	the words iron threshold ’ brought xi-feng back to her senses
0	much better make a clean sweep of these things , she said
0	xue pan , by the time he had three little cupfuls of wine inside him , was already beginning to be obstreperous
0	mrs xia had been in full spate when jia lian made his entrance
0	we ’ ve just been in to see her , miss , said ebony
0	that ’ s why caltrop was also there at the time of mrs pan ’ s death
0	but it ’ s a long story
0	how dare you answer me back !
0	he wrote out a prescription , and jia zheng , seeing that it contained nothing out of the ordinary , told one of the maids to brew the ingredients up and administer the decoction to grandmother jia
0	something no one would ever guess
0	xi-feng ’ s simple recipe ’ caused grannie liu to stick her tongue out and shake her head in wonderment
0	if he were here , her future really would look grim
0	if anything untoward occurred , i should be still more deeply at fault
0	the use of my powers differs from my powers and therefore from myself , only in so far as it is quantitatively restricted
0	by buddha ’ s altar lamp should sleep alone !
0	witches are modernity ’ s prototypical malcontents
0	( – ) both satan and raphael characterize the relation of creature to creator in terms of neoplatonic emanation , as opposed to aristotelian immanent entelechy , and they thereby introduce illegitimate aspirations into the minds of adam and eve
0	of course bao-yu isn ’ t going to upset himself over a little thing like that
0	now , now , that ’ s a foolish way to talk !
0	cousin zhen promised to see this done and added a sugges¬tion of his own :
0	so that a man may say his religion is now no more within himself , but is become a dividuall movable , and goes and comes near him , according as that good man frequents the house
0	delighted that everything bao-yu said was so clear and to the point , the prince observed to jia zheng that the young phoenix was worthy of his sire
0	turning once again , this time north-wards , he made his way swiftly towards pear tree court
0	and then she heard scribe repeat xi-feng ’ s words , that grandmother jia intended to marry bao-yu to one of his cousins , to one that lived in the garden ; and who could that be but herself ?
0	it ’ s such a well-known poem i can ’ t quite recall it at present , confessed bao-yu , smiling rather sheepishly
0	when the cousins arrived , they first of all read the notice on the wall and then read xiang-yun ’ s poem
0	how can you be so hopelessly naive ?
0	don ’ t talk to me about those dumplings !
0	we both agreed that if you didn ’ t make yourselves a bit more accommodating , there were sure to be one or two explosions
0	a new type of witches who no longer eat their victims , but who transform them into a kind of zombie and put them to work on
0	but thinking that some sort of reply was expected of her , she finally came out with :
0	lord have mercy on us !
0	you stupid old creature !
0	soon they were playing guess-fingers and singing solos
0	and whatever did the monk say to that ?
0	all right , let it pass , said dai-yu
0	what makes you so optimistic ?
0	the usher smiled coldly
0	a fine mess you and your rather have made of things between yul i said at the time that no good would come of this
0	that means that the creditor could inflict all kinds of ignominy and torture on the body of the debtor , for instance , slice off the body as much as seemed appropriate for the size of the debt : —and this point of view early on and everywhere gave rise to precise , sometimes horrific estimates going into the smallest detail , legally established estimates about individual limbs and body parts
0	adamantina looked at her curiously for a minute
0	it was forced on me by grandmother and the rest
0	a pot of honeyed lychees is what i ’ ve been instructed by miss bao-chai to bring to you , miss lin , replied the old woman , her features relaxing into a smile
0	he first performed his duty and glanced through the state papers ( which spelled out his majesty ’ s displeasure with the state of the coastal defences ) , and then left the cabinet office at once to find jia zheng and to commiserate with him on his impeachment , expressing his relief that it was not too serious a charge , and asking if his journey to the capital had been a comfortable one
0	as it happened lady xing didn ’ t even think it a good match
0	the menfolk of both rong-guo and ning-guo house had taken courage from the presence of the priests , and were gathered in the garden to watch the demon-hunt
0	no , said jia zheng
0	yes , send them away , said grandmother jia , while at the same time she did her best to soothe him : there , there , there
0	suppose i were to break a plate
0	li gui shouted at him furiously
0	let me put it off until to¬morrow
0	and he gets even worse when he ’ s had something to drink
0	she has with new-swept snow the kettle filled
0	said another of them
0	and it so happens the jias are all away at this funeral , and there ’ s only a few women left at home
0	then one of the nine had an idea :
0	as a result i suppose she herself decided to keep her distance
0	if this matter is delayed , it isn ’ t your negligence that will be blamed but our incompetence
0	but i got over it
0	surely you know better by now than to joke with him ?
0	say that miss lin and i send our regards to her and her mother , and ask her if her illness is any better and what she ’ s taking for it
0	we wouldn ’ t dream of going against mrs lian
0	don ’ t be so modest !
0	you ’ d better come up here and sit next to me
0	the coast was now at last clear for grannie liu to come forward and take her leave
0	they ’ d better have mine , said grandmother jia
0	aunt xue exploded a mouthful of tea over tan-chun ’ s skirt
0	try and guess , said bao-yu
0	all right then , i ’ ll come , said grandmother jia , who had been listening
0	my headache went away and i felt quite myself again
0	her old ladyship says please miss bao don ’ t be too strict with miss qin ; she ’ s still only little and should he allowed to have her own way
0	leverkuhn ’ s method is unable to avoid the recurring tritone—
0	what are my instructions from his highness ?
0	tomorrow you must tell your menfolk to make sure our carriages and horses are prepared well in advance
0	i think lady allspice dealt with her subject most effect¬ively , said tan-chun
0	most literate people in early modern england were hermeneutically sophisticated enough to conceive of two forms of judaism : the literal and the figurative
0	the practical consequences of this information need no elaboration , and are in themselves sufficient proof of the felix culpa
0	but it soon became ap¬parent that feverishness was the least serious of his symp¬toms
0	i am sure she would be quite incapable of deliber¬ately giving offence
0	when they learned that he was from the zhen family , the men stood up and made room for the newcomer to sit down
0	as vitiated in nature : more to know
0	the notion that in doing this she was in some way conferring on herself the status of a moon-goddess was perhaps not entirely absent from her mind
0	( – ) the lady scorns the sorcerer ’ s usurious value as base forgery ( ) , recognizing that comus ’ s argument perverts the natural telos of both money and sexuality
0	if bao-yu or the girls need any more , we can supply them from the regular staff ; they don ’ t need young actresses to wait on them
0	thurmond ’ s work consists largely of dancing and special stage effects ; he followed it up in with the miser , or wagner and abericock
0	his mother didn ’ t carry him for twenty-four months before he was born
0	i ’ m not much good at song-lyrics , said bao-yu , but i suppose i had better do what i can
0	than consolidate her ascendancy over xue pan ; then , using her feminine charms to make him her instrument , she would extend her dominion over aunt xue ; and finally bao-chai too should be brought under her control
0	she pulled out the drawer in li wan ’ s dressing-box , took out two little vanity-brushes , primmed her hair at the mirror , then , hurriedly replacing everything , went back into the outer room , where the others were still laughing
0	it leads us to neglect our studies
0	i think you must have been hiding it from me
0	jia zheng ’ s doings after his departure are not recorded in this history ; we merely observe that the departure left bao-yu free to play and idle in the garden to his heart ’ s content witout the least fear of restraint or reprisal
0	but the son has already praised the father for his genuinely productive usury , which uses even satan ’ s own activities for creative ends : [ h ] is evil / thou usest , and from thence creat ’ st more good ( : – )
0	and another thing , sir ; i have heard that a permanent secre¬tary ’ s position has become vacant in the ministry of works

0	right , she said
0	bao-yu is to accompany the young ladies into the garden and to continue his studies there
0	yes , of course , said bao-yu
0	that ’ s why i have waited for this opportunity before asking
0	a dose or two of medicine and he ’ ll be perfectly all right again
0	the efficacy of representation and the objectification of the subject are two aspects of one process , and the sixteenth-century campaign against magic , of which the faust myth forms a central element , was concerned to establish the fact that to put one ’ s faith in the performative sign is to bring about the death of one ’ s soul
0	she swept out angrily , indicating to her maids as she went that they should bring picture with them
0	her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she heard that she was , after all , to be given twenty taels of sliver can be imagined
0	subsiding at last , they read the whole poem through again from the beginning
0	in a short while they were ready , and walked out from the main hall to the sedan-chairs that were wait¬ing to carry them to the palace
0	it could , however , be exacted from those outside the community : the alien and hostile tribes surrounding the israelites in canaan , whom the god of abraham had commanded his people to attack and dispossess
0	included , who were ready
0	who do you want to visit in her apartment ?
0	we ’ re all in the family
0	i never imagined you were going to make such an uproar , or i wouldn ’ t have said them
0	i know your mistress never eats that sort of thing
0	it ’ s not my de¬cision
0	skybright was in the first instance purchased , when she was barely ten years old , by the chief steward lai da as a little slave-girl for his wife , who often took skybright with her when she went to work in rong-guo house
0	she rolled her eyes and gestured with one hand in the direction of the window
0	eight or nine , the old woman replied
0	mephistopheles : of course its nonsense !
0	his father simply inherited the post when the old man died
0	what do you mean ?
0	it ’ s just that you know what people say about actors
0	i ’ m not used to hearing such things
0	you keep it - i ’ m not cold
0	zhu-er ’ s wife followed at her elbow , begging to be let off
0	worldly success versus moral achievement
0	the wholsomeness , the ingenuity ,
0	it is a good line , i agree , said bao-yu
0	jia lian was made angrier still by this revelation , and wanted to beat the man on night-duty , but steward lin pleaded with him to abate his wrath
0	fortunately the present civil and military authorities have such a sound grip on the situation , and are so dedicated to the service of the throne , that these criminal elements will be effectively controlled
0	i needn ’ t have been so puzzled then
0	the play does not endorse a union of spirit with matter , but concludes with a firm rejection of physical lust as a fond conceit , in favor of the love of heaven
0	lin zhi-xiao said he would do so , but showed no inclination to leave
0	his powers of comprehension have improved , i grant you
0	and she said if they appear to want anything , she would leave it to you to decide what we should do for them
0	where then there is such a difference as that between soul and body , or between men and animals ( as in the case of those whose business is to use their body , and who can do nothing better ) , the lower sort are by nature slaves , and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they
0	no , we ’ ve all got our own , they said
0	said tan-chun , when she and li wan had finished discussing the theme for the verse-making
0	while they were talking , grannie liu came back from the other room having already finished eating , smacking her lips and sucking her teeth appreciatively , and voicing her thanks for the repast
0	caltrop disturbs an elaborate seduction
0	although financial mediation was replacing direct barter , and feudal dues were being translated into money payments , physical coinage remained generally in short supply , and banknotes were not yet widely current
0	you aren ’ t the stone you were , are you ?
0	faustus himself who has been deceived by the devil
0	i don ’ t know what ’ s so special about my family ’ s things
0	a daughter-in-law ’ s life must be pretty impossible
0	xi-feng listened attentively and thought for some moments before speaking
0	to think that one so young and pretty should be so gifted and all !
0	twice every day the doctor called to take his pulses and
0	then have someone go and fetch them at once
0	er-jie was no less startled than her servant when she heard the message , but even in such an extremity she could do no less than receive her visitor with the expected courtesies
0	xing xiu-yan had moved in with her aunt lady xing after ying-chun ’ s marriage , while the two li sisters only ever visited the garden with their mother , and then would stay for a couple of days with li wan before returning home
0	the trouble is , i don ’ t know how to do buildings in the elaborate style , and i ’ m no good at human figures ; but as i was too scared to refuse , i ’ ve got myself into a mess
0	have you got a pain anywhere ?
0	no , i was thinking about something rather more serious than that -something which , for all our sakes , i hope will never come to light
0	bao-yu was afraid of being subjected to one of her inquisitions , and merely replied :
0	i can ’ t abide it
0	she slipped in and stood spying at the inner doorway
0	in the morning , when bao¬yu came to her apartment to pay his respects , he found her a ! one , sighing pensively to herself
0	and a true heart is able to sympathize
0	then we should have seen him sweat !
0	she ’ s even worse than a cer¬tain person here aroma held up two fingers , indicat¬ing the second young lady of the household - xi-feng
0	next moment , without quite knowing how it happened , bao-yu found that he had left the place of registers behind him and was following disenchantment through the rear parts of the palace
0	tan-chun smiled courteously at the women
0	xue pan finds to his sorrow that he is
0	cousin zhen ’ s two pages were all this time drinking with bao er in the kitchen , while the mattress stood at the stove with her back to them
0	he turned with a smile to grandmother jia
0	i know of an infusion that might
0	and sis , she always thinks of everything
0	the only way left would be through the back gate
0	for the sequel , please turn to the next chapter
0	well in that case , said grandmother jia , everyone can go home for lunch , except feng and cousin zhen ’ s wife
0	on the contrary , he has been secretly sending here for considerable sums
0	it was useless to deny that she had said them
0	how can what happens to trees and plants have anything to do with human beings ?
0	we had better send someone over with them , said grandmother jia
0	xi-feng walked slowly through the all-scents garden until she came to the shrine in the ascension pavilion
0	all of you concentrate on your jobs and do them as best you can
0	the clear rays glint on roofs and courts below -
0	all we ’ ve heard is that my brother has killed someone and that he has been arrested by the local magistrate
0	aquinas argues that ceremonial magicians are not , as they claim to be , pious or at worst disinterested students of nature , but evil servants of the devil :
0	jia zheng and lady wang sat facing each other on the kang talking
0	the pear tree court women all hated them , but had not hitherto dared to quarrel with them openly
0	there you are i all three months of autumn condensed into a single sequence of a dozen poems !
0	you may find it surprising that smartweed bank and flowery harbour ’ , the phoenix dance ’ and those other names , which in the last chapter we showed bao-yu inventing in an aptitude test imposed at random by his father , should actually have been used on the occasion of the imperial concubine ’ s first visit to her family
0	unfortunately grandmother jia and lady wang were also there when they arrived
0	she also prepared several dishes for a little repast to which she invited her new colleagues
0	it may be some sort of hidden clue , suggested li wan
0	bao-yu sat on the edge of the couch and kicked his shoes off
0	you had been insulted
0	miss bao is sure to give a return party , isn ’ t she ?
0	a rumour comes true and the imperial consort
0	tell her , if she has , the sooner she abandons hope in that direction the better , because if i can ’ t have her , she may be very sure that no one else in this family will dare to
0	and the convalescent stone-in-waiting weeps
0	how shall i be able to face them after this ?
0	but marlowe follows the orthodox line that the independence of magical power is illusory
0	tell me , miss , what exactly is this illness of yours ?
0	we ’ ll send someone out on the quiet with it immediately to find a good invisible mender and get it mended for you
0	and then he thought what a crime against nature it would be if any of those parents were to become ill as a result of not seeing their daughters
0	suddenly all was pitch black before his eyes
0	she coughed several times while she was saying this
0	in that case all you have to do now is give them the eight characters for qiao-jie ’ s horoscope
0	he bowed afresh and said :
0	then when we got to her ladyship ’ s , her ladyship was with mrs lian and mrs zhao going through her chests and looking out some of the things she used to wear when she was a girl to give to someone—i don ’ t know who it was
0	tan-chun was relieved that he seemed able to view her future in a less tragic and more enlightened manner ; and after saying goodbye to the rest of the family , she climbed into her sedan and set off on the long journey that would take her by land and water to the south
0	if i ’ d realized earlier what the situation was , i should have gone straight to you in the first place
0	you know , her ladyship ’ s eldest brothers daughter , that we used to call feng-ge when she was a child ’
0	this constant depiction of usury as satanic is not merely pro forma rhetoric
0	but i can ’ t do a thing with them
0	they ’ re interested only in making a profit for themselves
0	wait until we are both in bed and i ’ ll settle accounts with you then
0	we owe bao-yu ’ s life to you , she began
0	she quietly removed it when no one was looking , and i assumed that after a few days had gone by , when she was in funds again , she would redeem it and quietly slip it back again
0	it ’ s a bit early for that yet , he said
0	that was no young lady ’ s room
0	don ’ t be so selfish !
0	then if the girl persists in her folly , will simply have to act as if she is no longer one of our family
0	all the years we ’ ve been knockin ’ around togevver we ’ ve never before insisted that a fellow should have to stay if he don ’ t want to
0	oh , she ’ s so petty !
0	hearing this , dai-yu ordered one of the maids to fetch the chair by the window that she normally sat on herself and bring it up for her aunt to sit on
0	i will get a dealer here right away and have her sold ; that 's the only way to settle this
0	fas¬cinated by it , he continued to stare at her with a somewhat dazed expression ) so that when she handed him the chaplet , which she had now succeeded in getting off her wrist , he failed to take it from her
0	the audience ’ s sympathies are directed toward the scientists
0	it has taken us these last ten years or more to stop their tongues , and now we have to go putting up a poster like this , announcing our troubles to the world !
0	you can clear them away
0	even in the early modern period , usurers were not portrayed as misers for the sake of naturalistic veracity , but to provide a figure for the proverbial absurdity of viewing money as an end rather than as a means
0	here , saie you , hée that lendeth is a gainer , and he that borroweth is a gainer
0	court chaplets , nine strings of one hundred and eight bands
0	he asked the old women as soon as he had dressed
0	lady wang and xi-feng at once sent back to inquire whether the child was in any danger
0	three and four centuries ago , however , labor was conceived as more than material production
0	all those prospects and pavilions—even the rocks and trees and flowers will seem somehow incomplete without that touch of poetry which only the written word can lend a scene
0	back in his own home , when school was over , he brooded with mounting anger on his humiliation
0	once more he stretched out the threatening fingers and dai-yu again began to shriek
0	because of her weakness , the effort of doing this made her pant so much that she could not speak ; but bao-yu understood what she wanted
0	a lie of some sort was indispensable
0	the mention of her mother set qiao-jie weeping with renewed abandon
0	this plausible suggestion brought a momentary smile to lady wang ’ s cheeks , and the family seized on this opportunity to persuade her to eat and drink a little
0	this is a fine son you bore us , i must say !
0	between the inner form of allegory and marx ’ s analysis of the commodity there is a clear structural parallelism
0	that is why i am not only determined to move permanently out of the garden myself , aunt , but would seriously urge you to make whatever other reduction in numbers may be necessary
0	it was now imperative that she should move in with her parents and look to them for support
0	while doing so , he discussed with aroma the drinking-party that they were planning to have that evening
0	what i want to know is , has anyone come over from grand¬mother ’ s with a message ?
0	so lai took a few days ’ leave , and meanwhile sent a mes¬senger to his son ’ s yamen , advising him also to plead sick and re¬linquish his official post
0	you ’ re imagining things , said aroma
0	i take it you don ’ t need me to read the rules out
0	that ’ s an offence deserving hard labour at the very least , yet nothing ’ s happened so far , bar a bit of muttering
0	and yet if once he applied himself , nothing was beyond his reach
0	from green bower convent sounds the matin bell ;
0	what on earth do you mean ?
0	adaman¬tina turned her head :
0	none of the family are at home , said bao yong
0	she said this straight-faced and in a very matter-of-fact tone of voice
0	spare your sorrow , said bao-yu
0	you need not strive ;
0	as you say , i just forgot
0	finally he managed to emit a piercing wail
0	i think he has more or less made up his mind already , and has only written to you for your formal approval , mother
0	john ferror , of norfolk , aggravated his usury and extortion
0	and to think that he ’ s engaged to be married now - and still as silly as ever !
0	as a matter of fact i did have an ulterior motive in bringing this tray , said abbot zhang , laughing , but it wasn ’ t in order to make a collection , i assure you
0	how often i ’ ve wished i could dream that dream of mine again !
0	i don ’ t think much of that , said bao-yu
0	what a waste to throw away a beautiful girl on that great booby !
0	gracious arseholes said xi-feng
0	she thought morbidly to herself
0	she would probably forget to say oh if you stuck a pin in her
0	mother , today we should be filled with joy
0	seeing that she was resolved to stay , the old women brought up a little table and put a small pillow on it for her to rest her arm on
0	barbara rosen has argued that the idea of witches flying may have been introduced into english witch discourse via spies ’ s influence , and the first english tract to attribute flight to witches , a most wicked worke of a wretched witch , was published in , within four years of pf ’ s translation
0	she asked him , and , obtaining no immediate reply , asked again
0	you send me off on a wild-goose chase to look for something you ’ ve read about in some book or other or heard about in some old-wives ’ tale , and then when i can ’ t find it ( because there ’ s probably no such thing any way ) you start abusing me
0	here is a chance of doing all those things you ever set your heart on doing
0	shi-yin gave an inscrutable smile :
0	then i forgot to put it on again
0	coming up closer to bao-yu , he bent down and spoke softly into his ear
0	and if we go , i shall send someone a day or two in advance to turn the taoists out of that part of the temple and make it nice and clean for us and get them td put up blinds
0	and weary goose-files in the cold sky are seen
0	why don ’ t you and the young ladies go on ahead and meet them ?
0	some malign star must surely have ruled the day of my birth !
0	why don ’ t i get a bit of capital together and spend a year or so travelling around with zhang de-hui ?
0	they reached the foot of the terrace and she began again in a whisper :
0	but after a moment ’ s reflection she thought it advisable to contain herself and still struggled to keep a smile on her face :
0	and there 's another thing
0	he sat and chatted for a while without much enthusiasm , and soon made motions of leaving
0	the incompatibility of aristocratic with financial modes of evaluation is often employed as a plot device in renaissance drama
0	we ministers of the nether world , from the highest down to the lowest , all have unbending iron natures and—unlike the officials of the mortal world , who are always doing kindnesses and showing favours and inventing little tricks and dodges for frustrating the course of justice - we are incapable of showing partiality
0	in the mean-time the little household was managing very comfortably
0	jia zheng hurried out
0	no need of a peacemaker that i could see
0	let ’ s start making a list
0	now his majesty the emperor had shown him a special favour as the de¬scendant of a loyal and deserving subject , had restored him to his hereditary position and had summoned him to the capital for an audience
0	he was not at all his usual smiling talkative self , in fact he hardly said a word to aroma and the others , but lay down dressed as he was on the kang
0	she ’ ll even fan the flames up and make it hotter for that other person once she ’ s safely out of it herself
0	what are you doing here at this late hour ? , they asked her
0	this is made of peacock gold , said skybright
0	it ’ s too early in the year
0	james issued a series of edicts forbidding currency speculation and the melting down of coin , including in [ a ] proclamation prohibiting the exchange of monies for profit , the making of plate of any of his maiesties coynes , and the excessiue vse of gold and siluer foliate
0	and he ’ s demanding his ten thousand taels !
0	i hardly think sir zheng would want her to remain single and make a show of faithfulness to bao-yu , said aunt xue
0	when bao-yu heard these words they struck a responsive chord in his breast , and he reflected bitterly that even nightin¬gale seemed to understand him better than dai-yu but then he looked again at dai-yu , who was sobbing and panting by turns , and whose red and swollen face was wet with perspira¬tion and tears , and seeing how pitiably frail and ill she looked , his heart misgave him
0	she ’ s just eaten and now she ’ s having an afternoon nap , she said in a low voice
0	do you really see him ?
0	i came in through the court-yard door at the back
0	this he effecteth by falsifying the valuation of mony , which is the rule and measure of things , which money he caused to be made vncertaine , and as it were a merchandize , giuing thereby a wonderfull ability to some of the members of a commonwealth to oppresse the other : whereby the concord is broken , and men can not liue in their vocation , by that whereunto they were borne or bred
0	i miss her such a lot
0	then back to the mansion again and out through the inner gate to call on nannie li and three other of his former nannies , with each of whom he was expected to spend some time in conversation
0	derrida ’ s dantonesque rhetoric soars into the firmament of revolutionary ardor , as the insurrection of the performative frees the other from the bastille of dialectics
0	that does not prevent their becoming rivals , however
0	their whereabouts were eventually traced , however , and zhang hua ’ s father summoned to ning-guo house and induced to sign a deed of revocation releasing er-jie from her betrothal
0	the table at which grandmother jia presided , seated alone on a couch , had two empty chairs numbern either side
0	or grains of frost that on the railings lie ?
0	and even bao-yu came in for a share , he said
0	but aunt zhao was not to be placated :
0	the effect of the fall is to reduce the world to the same alienated
0	ying-chun sat in the first place on the right opposite dai-yu , tan-chun sat second on the left , and xi-chun sat second on the right
0	however , dai-yu went on , that i could forgive
0	the other evening ; ’ replied bao-chai , she wept herself into a terrible state and had a sudden giddy spell
0	who told you to bring this ?
0	but what are they all ?
0	we are afraid that if we came to see you looking the way we are , you would disown us ; and even the people at the gate might think we were tramps !
0	the one thing she could not help noticing , however , the one detail that marred the illusion , was the way in which the object of her passion entrusted every smailest thing of his to caltrop
0	from of old our rising , falling
0	stop teaching your grand¬mother to suck eggs
0	where are you going ?
0	thomas culpeper ’ s a tract against usury ( ) offers
0	there are things worse than burglary , the mere suspicion of which could have the direst consequences for all of you
0	and bao-yu ’ s childish manner is deceptive : he can be extremely stupid and tactless
0	i thought i should report to you first , sir , before going to offer my congratulations , replied bao-yu with a polite smile
0	she pointed at jia huan scornfully
0	just imagine what it will be like for me if you continue living here outside
0	the first i heard of it was this afternoon , when mr lian gave us her old ladyship ’ s orders to put the posters up
0	but musk had already closed the cabinet
0	she ’ s torturing my little girl !
0	bao-yu had slipped silently away as soon as his mother sat up
0	one of your difficulties is going to be the ruler-work
0	no one will believe that you ’ re poor
0	i only have to ask for it
0	a path winds upwards to mysterious places
0	qiao-jie studies the lives of noble women
0	you have an altar set up in the court and a planchette board installed on it and you issue an open invita¬tion to any members of the public who want to to attend a séance
0	the self-alienation of the soul , the activity whereby it violates its own nature , is effectively equated with the lust for money
0	you look very puzzled !
0	they are like the serpent that tempted adam in paradise , who wheras god stinted him , what trees and fruites he should eate on , and goe no further , he entic ’ d him to breake the bondes of that stint , and put into his head what a number of excellent pleasures he should reape thereby ; so wheras carefull fathers send their children to this citty , in all gentleman-like qualities to bee trained vp , and stint them to a moderate allowance , sufficient ( indifferently husbanded ) to maintaine their credite euery way , and profit them in that they are sent hither for : what doo our couetous cittie blood-suckers , but hire pandars , and professed parasiticall epicures , to close in with them , and ( like the serpent ) to alienate them from that ciuill course wherein they were setled
0	so possessyons began by extorcyon
0	i feel so depressed
0	she was all smiles and loving sympathy , my dear ’ this and my dear ’ that
0	your affectionate cousin , bao-chai
0	two years previous to this date droopy ’ s father had provided him with a wife
0	pay them back for some of the things they ’ ve done to us in the past
0	i shouldn ’ t dream of trampling on you
0	i am not much of a manager really , said xi-feng
0	patience was afraid of frightening the old lady
0	what ’ s the idea ?
0	i will give you twelve months ’ grace
0	then you wo not be troubled by her any more
0	i suppose it must be as you say : her good looks have been her undoing
0	early next day a messenger arrived from yu-cun bearing two packets of silver and four bolts of silk brocade for mrs zhen as a token of the sender ’ s gratitude
0	people are always saying how clever your miss bao is
0	snatch¬ing whose wife , in the name of heaven ?
0	should we even say that these are two fundamentally different types of self ?
0	the fifth patriarch at once handed him his robe and bow ] as a sign that he was to succeed him
0	what did he say ?
0	none the less , he took the man aside into an out-of-the-way alley , and the two of them stood there talking a while longer before going their separate ways
0	perhaps if we both thought about it we could finish it together , said xiang-yun
0	nobody told me , and she just hit me !
0	all : oh , oh , oh—
0	parfumee asked her how she felt
0	into real essential powers and faculties
0	think of something new and entertaining for us
0	indoors , however , it was stark and bare
0	er-jie once or twice tried speaking to her about it , but mercy only glared at her and lifted her voice up in noisy self-justification
0	we were shamefully insulted , and because we didn ’ t want to start a quarrel , we went along in a perfectly polite and reasonable manner and reported the matter to cousin rui
0	i never heard such nonsense !
0	faust is associated with unbridled and perverse sexuality from his earliest appearances in the historical record
0	instead he will place himself at the head of the entire family and lead them in prostrating themselves in your direction
0	and its impact on them , hearing it for the first time , was like that of a zen perception ’ something to be meditated on with bowed head and savoured with a gush of tears
0	what grounds have you for this accusation ?
0	presently the lady-in-waiting returned and announced :
0	is that all it was ?
0	tries to clear up a possible discrepancy on this subject
0	her ladyship has been speaking very highly of you in the front room
0	faithful undid the draw-strings and extracted from each purse a golden heart ’ s desire ’ medallion with a device showing an ingot , a writing-brush and a sceptre
0	bao-yu ’ s day-dreaming took another turn
0	in both the reception hall and the courtyard out¬side it there were plays to watch and tables at which the un¬ending stream of visitors could sit for a while and eat and drink while they watched them
0	i heard something to that effect , said bao-chai , but i didn ’ t know whether to believe it or not
0	at this point dai-yu , who was still full of dissatisfaction because her talent had been under¬employed , noticed that bao-yu was struggling and came over to the table at which he was working
0	wo not you come into my little den , and we can help each other to while away this tedious hot day ?
0	after all , there ’ s no harm in it
0	while they were there , a message arrived for lady wang to say that aroma ’ s brother , hua zi-fang , had come and was waiting outside in the front
0	this is rather a strait-laced household we are going into , xi-feng confided to er-jie when they were alone in the carriage together
0	outside the gateway to the inner quartets bao-yu found tea-leaf waiting
0	as thomas lupton puts it in a dream of the divell ( ) :
0	take this for the time being to make some winter clothes for the children with
0	so the rich man goes to heaven because of the righteousness of the poor , and the poor man goes to hell because of the wickedness of the rich or because he is now without a soul !
0	now what about the next bit ?
0	bao-yu hung his head and pondered a while before finally coming out with this line :
0	to his great delight , he found that he could still remember every detail of his dream , and he chuckled aloud with satisfaction :
0	he left reluctantly , not knowing quite where to go
0	well , today he ’ s here
0	why not continue the conversation on our way back ?
0	won ’ t you sit outside with the girls and let them give you some tea ?
0	all he ’ s fit for is a couple of sad old dumplings like me and patience !
0	grey squirrel-skins , two hundred and sixty-three
0	but of course his prize is immediately transformed into gaunt skeleton , a statue , / a pale image , a sepulchral / show of death , thus instructing him in the objectifying properties of both magic and sexual obsession
0	i shall buy up supplies of stationery and sandalwood fans on my way , aiming to get back here in time for the double fifth
0	which , because it disrupts harmonic progression , was traditionally called the devil ’ s interval—and as a result his music is disturbing and unpleasant to listen to
0	bao-yu raised his head and laughed
0	while she was there , a maid arrived to ask if she would mind calling in to see xi-chun , so she went along to xi-chun ’ s
0	i know just the person for this
0	mind you , said xi-feng , i ’ m not one of your money-grubbing run-ofhe-miii go-betweens
0	on the other hand , if i don ’ t go , then with no one there to stop her , she may simply go on getting more and more upset
0	yes , i ’ m sure that ’ s what it was , said bao-yu
0	next day , the last of the old year , grandmother jia and any of the jia ladies who possessed patents of nobility attired themselves in the court dress appropriate to their rank and were borne in procession to the palace , grandmother jia at the head in a palanquin carried by eight bearers , to make their kotows to the imperial concubine and felicitate her on the successful conclusion of the year
0	there is not enough time
0	give the workmen a couple of taels for carrying it here and it ’ s yours
0	i said it to make you come , because i fought that if i asked you outright to come and drink wiv me , you ’ d make excuses
0	do you know what i tell people about you ?
0	there is an old saying , desire maketh the wise man a fool ’
0	early on the fourth day bao-yu suddenly opened his eyes wide and spoke to grandmother jia :
0	i found it behind the rocks , said simple , when i was looking for crickets
0	she hurried out to welcome her
0	i think perhaps you ’ d better go and sit in someone else ’ s room , he said
0	hehl hehl and he often cries or laughs when no one else is by
0	let us in future forget all this uncle nephew business and address each other exactly like friends or brothers !
0	she did not wait for nightingale but raised the portiere herself , and walked into the room
0	we ’ ve had no news of the zhens , ever since they too were raided and had their property confiscated
0	the only dissatisfied member of the party - to begin with , at any rate—was xue pan
0	yes , yes , of course it is , said grandmother jia
0	by childish piques and envious passions—
0	she asked who had brought the money , and on being informed that it was lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife , sent the maid back to fetch her in from the servants ’ quarters , where she was waiting
0	since when did meng guang accept liang hong ’ s tray ?
0	cousin zhen was aware that , though abbot zhang had started life a poor boy and entered the taoist church as proxy novice of grandmother jia ’ s late husband , a former emperor had with his own imperial lips conferred on him the title doctor mysticus ’ , and he now held the seals of the board of commissioners of the taoist church , had been awarded the title doctor serenissimus ’ by the reigning sovereign , and was addressed as holiness ’ by princes , dukes and governors of provinces
0	this is what she had written :
0	neither of them could understand the strange state slie was in
0	there ’ s no need to carry on like this about it
0	temporarily forgetting about the orris-powder , she reached up and broke off some of the tender willow-twigs
0	we ’ re not children any more
0	i remember your uncle zheng speaking very strongly against the marriage to your father , but your father was so set on it , he wouldn ’ t listen
0	he went round with bao-chai , pouring a cup of wine for each of the guests on her behalf
0	what are you mooning about for this time ?
0	it was lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife , accompanied by a number of the stewardesses
0	he made him first change into court dress before , leading him forward to meet the prince
0	he could not state the real purpose of his visit in front of so many people and merely told them that he had come to see
0	from love i came ; from love i now depart
0	why not give it a try ?
0	said bao-chai , joining in her mother ’ s efforts to restrain him
0	even if we can ’ t hope to become buddhas or saints , at least by keeping up our devotions we may one day in another lifetime he reborn as men
0	obviously i ’ m not in the same class as your cousin lin
0	that ’ s all very well , but i don ’ t want to part with your aunt er , said xi-feng hurriedly
0	in the sense that usury was a prominent cultural element in renaissance england , then , it seems reasonable to refer to a culture of usury in that period
0	he mistakes quantity for quality , believing that the amount of money he hoards will satisfy him without being spent
0	i need to make an example of one of them , and this one will do very well
0	but not a bit of it : two days have gone by already and they ’ re worse than ever
0	that ’ s just a whim of yours , master bao
0	it thus frees signification from the authority of telos and logos ; a performative sign does not mean anything , it does something
0	whatever you think of the poem , it hardly justifies talking in this way about the boy ’ s future
0	what did it say ?
0	we don ’ t know where sister adamantina went last night , they said
0	all of these disciplines , in their postmodern forms , privilege what linguistics calls the performative , rather than the denotative , aspect of signs
0	but before i do that , i promise to have the liver and lights out of you two , or my name ’ s not san-jie !
0	after jia she and jia zheng had left , taking the two younger men with them , grandmother jia had the screen removed and proposed that those sitting at both tables should combine to make a single party
0	xiang-yun hurried back into the fray :
0	this was hardly the way one would have expected a man of great spiritual attainments to talk , reflected bao-yu
0	he handed jia lian the heirloom when he had got it out of his bundle , and after a few more drinks the three men remounted , took leave of each other , and went their separate ways
0	let them take her away now and get it over with
0	as soon as miss lin set eyes on them , she burst into tears
0	he can ’ t have got very far
0	i didn ’ t think i should ever see you again
0	we can ’ t have you paying out that sort of money , grand¬mother jia said to li wan , —a young widow with no mean of her own
0	supposing bao-yu really died - what then ?
0	we don ’ t exist any more !
0	i ’ m afraid i don ’ t pay much attention to what bao-yu is doing
0	in wilson ’ s three ladies we find conscience reduced to peddling brooms : usury :
0	the bowls of soup , rice and so forth fitted into it easily
0	when did you ever hear miss shi say anything serious ?
0	to lend her your dress , but you take very good care that it ’ s me and miss lin that get blamed for refusing it , and not you
0	although that does not strictly entail any such pro¬hibition , bao-yu should at least abide by the set term of mourning for a deceased elder sister , which would mean a period numberf nine months during which marriage would be highly irregular
0	jia rong mischievously proposed that they should take him back to the lais ’ house to rejoin the party : but xue pan entreated so piteously and begged him so earnestly not to tell anyone of his plight , that jia rong relented and allowed him to go back home alone
0	they are grandsons of the former duke of rong-guo
0	then she be¬gan to cry
0	what austin claims of performative utterances—that they produce effects rather than describe situations , that they can be felicitous or infelicitous rather than true or false , that they do not derive their meanings from the intentions of a prelinguistic subject—all of these are , according to derrida , true of language in general , and therefore of human experience as a whole
0	it appeared that feng zi-ying ’ s mother , hearing that the jia ladies were having a pro viventibus performed at the taoist temple , had immediately prepared an offering of pork , mutton , incense , tea and cakes and sent it post-haste to the temple with her compliments
0	you should think how lucky you ’ ve been
0	or , dressed for bed , by open casements sit
0	and there ’ s one other thing
0	ripple spat in her face :
0	when he got to dai-yu
0	she felt as though plunged into a great ocean
0	that ’ s what we ’ re trying to do , cheer her up
0	now what i ’ d really fancy are some dried chestnuts , if you ’ d like to be peeling them for me while i make up your bed on the king
0	oh no , said grandmother jia
0	in future , if those people are nasty to you , you must learn to put up with it
0	it ’ s too late to start being afraid now
0	the children couldn ’ t hold out any longer
0	when his wife saw this , she was furious
0	lanterns of crystal and glass were fixed to the balustrades which lined the banks , their silvery radiance giving the white marble , in the semi-darkness , the appearance of gleaming drifts of snow
0	when you take him in to see the master , there ’ s no need to say that i ’ ve already seen him
0	the second choice was a heap of honours , which shows the sixtieth birthday party of the great tang general guo zi-yi , attended by his seven sons and eight sons-in-law , all of whom held high office , the heap of honours ’ of the title being a reference to the table in his reception-hall piled high with their insignia
0	reassured , tealeaf fetched the horse , and the two of them slipped out by the back entrance
0	besides , mistress and maid are such an unpoetical combination
0	and the poetry enthusiast applies herself to making verses
0	having stretched the material out over the mushroom , she scraped away the charred parts and the surrounding nap with a razor until the threads were clearly exposed , then , with her needle and thread , she worked first across in one direction and then at right-angles in the other until she had filled the hole with a criss-cross darn
0	please don ’ t make a thing of it
0	said lady xing gaily
0	it may be that witchcraft—
0	the writing ceased , and the wand came to rest
0	suitable presents had now been made ready by an attendant : five gold rings , five jade rings and five wristlets of aromatic beads
0	why don ’ t you pour uncle a drink and tell him you ’ re sorry ?
0	there , there , my darling !
0	surely the one who has my promise can safely ignore the claims of the other ; and , if i keep my word , what has she to worry about ?
0	lady wang lacked the nerve to go and challenge lady xing directly
0	he sent me to ask you if you happen to have one or two hundred taels on you you could let him have just for the time being
0	bring it here , quickly !
0	it seems that there were two things the master was upset about : one was to do with bijou and the ether was to do with golden
0	it isn ’ t enough to take decent girls from their homes and shut them up in this prison to learn beastly opera all day
0	there they were to be placed beneath a pagoda , whose geomantic location would ensure that they and their contents were safely contained ’
0	said ciggy , taking the money for the sweetcake
0	get her to put it on for you in the evening
0	to an extent unknown in previous ages , the causal factors behind the soul ’ s alienation quickly coalesced into the personified figure of satan
0	i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever seen any quite like it before
0	why hasn ’ t miss bao ’ s lunch been brought here so that she can eat with us ?
0	i think you had better not use that word studies again in my hearing , unless you want to make me blush for you
0	such an orientation is alien to the soul ’ s nature , since the body is what the soul is not
0	to mark what of their state he more might learn by word or action mark ’ d
0	just tell me what you have to say
0	this palpable sense of an evil power , working in and through particular individuals , but also transcending and controlling them , is the secularized descendent of the seventeenth-century ’ s fear of witches
0	how do you know it ’ s all up with him ?
0	take it now and speak to her when you ’ ve spent it
0	told her about the plan
0	light some incense , and sit in silent meditation
0	what subject wilt you get on to next ?
0	end of first round
0	no , no , no , said xue pan hurriedly
0	nightingale hurriedly put down her sewing and stood up
0	i ’ ve been ages looking for you
0	by this time someone had arrived from grandmother jia ’ s room to inquire what all the noise was about
0	mrs pan , have you seen master ke ?
0	petal-stuffed damask cushion , turning over on his side , and promptly dropping off to sleep
0	it ’ ll be all right
0	in the afternoon he woke from his sleep feeling very bored , and picked up a book to read
0	but caltrop , though she had truly believed that this second poem was a minor masterpiece and was extremely dashed by its rejection , was most unwilling to give up
0	she had waited so long for xiang-lian , and now that at last he had come , he was re¬jecting her
0	swabey suspects the hand of economic interests behind abbot ’ s appointment as primate rather than the far more able andrewes , and even speculates that the latter might have been able to stem the tide of usury had he won the election
0	when grandmother jia had taken in what they were saying she laughed out loud :
0	since you-shi was still confined to her room , it was left entirely to xi-feng to do the honours
0	about one dollar out of every three loaned to latin america by banks between and made that round trip
0	but faust himself is taken in by the illusion , and in spies he even imagines that he has impregnated her
0	let the weather be clear and calm , a gentle breeze , a moon¬lit night
0	it hasn ’ t been touched yet , so it ’ s quite clean
0	marriage is going to be a most important step in his life
0	swallow ’ s mother appealed to the other maids :
0	we are all to drink something , he said
0	having delivered this message he got straight back on to his horse without staying for so much as a cup of tea and rode away
0	i ’ m no sister of yours !
0	you ’ d better come back straight away and get changed ! ,
0	i ’ ve never done anyone any harm
0	it was as the answer to such questions that the figure of satan achieved unprecedented cultural prominence during the english renaissance
0	but thanks to the emperor ’ s generosity and the gra¬cious favour of the two princes , we have been treated with great compassion
0	you can leave your granddaughter here
0	whereas in the early stages of capitalism , economics assumed a rational subject able to suppress his or her desires and impulses and to defer gratification , the consumer economy demands a self which spontaneously and unreflectively acts on irrational desires
0	cousin zhen is no less capable of choosing the right person for the job than we are
0	the couplets he has already written for them are very good , but these are four such special places , that i feel they deserve to have something more written about them
0	just before new year i heard her old ladyship say that she was betrothing you to miss qin
0	xi-feng and patience were banished totally from his thoughts
0	that ’ s a good game
0	that can be my nunnery
0	in , the canon of the church of st mary ’ s in gotha called faust a mere braggart and fool ( ) , but in he was paid ten guilders by the bishop of bamberg for a horoscope or prognostication ( )
0	there was therefore no need for her to say anything , and after standing silently for a few moments inside the doorway , she slipped out again , signalling with her eyes to parfumee as she did so to follow her into the outer room
0	you should be more careful what you say
0	tell her that when zhang cai ’ s wife comes for it , she is to weigh it out in front of her before handing it over
0	as the matter was urgent , jia lian had invited another , who was already on his way
0	standing around here with nothing to do : why don ’ t you get her to go ?
0	this isn ’ t the sort of thing one eats every day , and now that cousin bao has men¬tioned it , it seems silly to make it just for him and not let you and grandma and auntie xue taste it as well
0	she was such a superior sort of girl , so handsome , so intelligent , so different from the average run of common , insensitive creatures
0	can i really have been all this time mistaken in my feelings towards you ?
0	that i know no place to abide , i liue so much in feare
0	i ’ ll have them fly to india for gold ,
0	just a minute , aunt
0	ashamed to have been discovered in such a predicament , she struggled hastily to her feet and accompanied the others back to the summerhouse , where she rinsed her mouth out with water and drank two very strong cups of tea
0	satan can not accept the mediating function of signs ; he takes them as autonomous powers in their own right
0	what have i done wrong since i came to this place that you should want to treat me like this ?
0	i was looking the other day it that prescription of yours , said bao-chai
0	the sexual union of faust and helen , which faust knows to be illusory but which he enjoys as if it were real , is the mythical expression of the birth of the simulacrum
0	he is being interrogated , and they hope to trace the burglars through him
0	it landed with a tremendous crash , scattering books , papers , writing-brushes and inkstones in all directions and smashing bao-yu ’ s teabowl to smithereens so that tea flowed over everything round about
0	zhang hua and his father have run away
0	one bides a broken arm inside one ’ s sleeve : surely you , of all people , know that , auntie ?
0	i ’ ve already decided that , said li wan
0	would you do that then ?
0	what do you say to the idea ?
0	they can be redeemed after your period of mourning , and after father ’ s return - all the more so if he is reinstated
0	why are you so feeble ?
0	the speaker of shakespeare ’ s sonnets employs the same conceptual framework when he encourages the young man to lend his beauty to women , in order to reap interest in the form of children :
0	let us leave them alone together , then
0	but there is also a not so high-minded , rather more selfish way of looking at it
0	when aunt xue tried to reason with the intruders , mrs xia completely ignored her
0	bao-chai also greeted him
0	you ’ re all in league against me
0	his knowledge of the masters of painting and calligraphy both past and present was not in-considerable , but he had never in all his experience come across a geng huang ’
0	i don ’ t want it !
0	he grasps labour as the essence of man—as man ’ s essence in the act of proving itself
0	a brief family reunion is permitted by the
0	feeling a strange sensation in which sadness and happiness commingled , he mused for some minutes in silence before going over to sweet-rice village to join the others
0	but how do we go about collecting the subscriptions ?
0	she ’ ll have to flog a few of them when this is over ; that ’ s the only way to cure this sort of thing
0	would be terrible if we lost the jade , worse even than losing master bao himself !
0	yes , you ’ re right , said bao-yu
0	the room was certainly a young lady ’ s boudoir , and the consultation was made with the patient behind a curtain
0	so what are you yammering at me now for ?
0	he did not think money sterile at all , he just hated its fruits
0	a day arrived when the smallpox poison had spent itself and baby ’ s pustules showed signs of drying up
0	jia lan , by contrast , sat by his mother ’ s side conscientiously studying , and when he had finished a composition would take it to the family school for the preceptor ’ s comments
0	an oppressive feeling of dread came over them ; the night air seemed suddenly to have grown colder ; the moon appeared less bright than it had been a few minutes before ; and they could feel their skins crawling with terror
0	after reading these poems , the cousins all praised the re¬markable ingenuity with which they had been constructed
0	what do you mean , give and take a bit ?
0	righteous aroma discovers how to rebuke her
0	lady wang took over the story
0	and the ranks of tall bullrushes , her guardsmen ’ s spears
0	think of something else
0	besides myself there are only two other people in the world who know about this : parfumee in your room and etamine in miss bao ’ s
0	but don ’ t you go thinking i can ’ t lay my hands on you any more
0	she turned to ploughboy and said briskly :
0	when he had almost reached his destination and there was only the spur of a miniature mountain ’ be¬tween him and the burial-place of the flowers , he heard the sound of a voice , coming from the other side of the rock , whose continuous , gentle chiding was occasionally broken by the most pitiable and heart-rending sobs
0	xue ke ’ s words intensified aunt xue ’ s anxiety
0	a long , high table of carved red sandalwood , ornamented with dragons , stood against the wall underneath
0	she probably didn ’ t feel in the mood for all the noise and excitement
0	at once preparations for the procession into the city were put in motion
0	she ’ ll say you ’ ve been up to your old childish tricks again
0	we don ’ t have to do that now , surely ?
0	mayn ’ t i do favours too , if i want to ?
0	tealeaf , after some moments of reflection , smiled uncertainly :
0	how old is he ?
0	a range of servants ’ quarters on the east side of the rong-guo grounds had already been demolished
0	instead he poured her a cup of tea from a pot on the table and gave it to her to rinse her mouth with
0	through-out all of this not a single sound was uttered by his partner
0	but stony didn ’ t want a price not if they offered him a thousand taels a fan , he said
0	gaffer li hurried to the scene but was too late to be of any help
0	wait until i have a little time to spare : i ’ ll have your hide off first and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing son of mine !
0	the thought of her crying made him knit his brows and sigh
0	but surely jin-gui would never think of such a thing ?
0	bao-yu stepped softly into the room and made his presence known to the two cousins
0	what about the stove ?
0	stop it , mrs zhu !
0	what happened after their departure will be related in the following chapter
0	deep skill ’ d in all his mothers witcheries ( ) , and in fact excells his mother at her mighty art ( )
0	we obviously can ’ t refuse , grannie , after what papa zhang has just said , said bao-yu ; but i really have no use for this stuff
0	she was only over on a short visit and went home after lunch
0	i do not belong to demons ( – )
0	she must be some goddess come to earth
0	how can we possibly call it that ?
0	at first he thought of going back to xue pan and talking it over with him ; then he changed his mind , partly because xue pan was ill but mainly because in any case he had little confidence in his judgement
0	i shall be quite all right with patience here
0	this revived aroma ’ s anxiety , and she would have seized hold of him again had she not felt constrained by the presence of lady wang and bao-chai and by the need to preserve some semblance of respect towards bao-yu
0	the local magistrates have been made to feel uncomfortable by all his stern pronouncements
0	jia lian went in
0	we don ’ t have to worry about that sort of thing yet !
0	no wonder he ’ s every minute of the day wishing he could lay his hands on you and give you a thrashing
0	england and twenty-first century cameroon have led to some fascinating forays into comparative analysis , involving the interdisciplinary efforts of anthropologists and historians
0	she arrived just as faithful was coming off duty and the two of them were able to sit down for a chat
0	dai-yu , though somewhat overcome on the day previous to this by the sultry weather , had by no means been seriously ill arguing that if she was not ill , it was impossible that he should be , she felt sure , when she heard of bao-yu ’ s excuse , that it must be a false one
0	'his face looks extraordinarily familiar
0	i ’ ve already seen to that , replied faithful
0	why aren ’ t you wearing a proper robe ?
0	shocking i ’ exclaimed the others
0	the silly apparatus , the demented gestures—
0	you have both your sons with you this year , mother
0	and i heard one got knocked down
0	the blind women were practised performers in this game and deliberately varied the speed of the beat
0	from what you say , grandma , it sounds as if the good talkers are the only ones you can be fond of
0	for the outcome , please read the next chapter
0	look at this , all of you !
0	she told her how worried she had been when she heard about the lawsuit , and what she had found out as a result of her inquiries
0	but my inside information will at least save me a lot of unnecessary worrying
0	asked the other mice
0	it really isn ’ t because of what you think that i am leaving the garden
0	thus satan himself , who transfigures himself into an angel of light , when he has captured the mind of a miserable little woman and has subjected her to himself by infidelity and incredulity , immediately transforms himself into the species and similitudes of different person-ages
0	really , grandma , what a thing to say !
0	as for your virtue , who has ever attained the true pristine state of virtue ?
0	—a different scene altogether from the one he had just left
0	get away with you !
0	of course they ’ d lend us their car¬riages
0	the remark passed unnoticed , with two exceptions
0	her father-inaw and mother¬inaw both send you their regards
0	tomorrow is a good day , according to the calendar
0	i was asking cousin wan about you the day before yesterday
0	lady wang bowed her head and thought for some moments in silence
0	i shall do all i can for them
0	i ’ ve no one at home , and i should like her to choose a lucky day for the wedding
0	in that case , do please stay here with us !
0	you can always find yourself a better wife when you feel like it
0	yes , you should speak to her , said lady xing
0	after a bit she did , however , stop crying and rolled up her hair , which had come undone
0	she summoned a maid to assist her and leaning heavily on her arm struggled back to her own room and lay down
0	but tell him that if things show any sign of getting too hot , i am perfectly well able to cool them down again
0	she only caught the words a complete waste of time ’ and went running home in a great huff to aunt xue , who was anxiously awaiting her return :
0	he did not even greet them but burst into tears
0	when bao-chai returned with the clothes , she found bao-yu sitting beside his mother in tears
0	say you found him at home
0	jia zheng was not a man to look for unnecessary trouble , and was content to consider the matter closed
0	i ’ d like to have asked you here in the first place , but i saw that mrs zhu and the young ladies were taking care of you , so i didn ’ t like to interfere
0	very well then , i shall go myself , declared aunt xue
0	as bao-yu arrived , his thoughts went back to the days before dai-yu had fallen ill , before things had taken this turn
0	besides , it must be all often o ’ clock and if you go now it will give the children a chance to enjoy them¬selves unconstrainedly for a while before they go to bed
0	jia lian thought it best not to spend the night at home , and did not even find time to reproach xi-feng for her part in the affair
0	isn ’ t it rather a poor return for patience ’ s considerateness immediately to start making an outcry about it ?
0	sir zheng is in his little study in the su dong-po rooms , having his afternoon nap
0	how did so beautiful a person come to have so appalling a character ?
0	i was afraid you would be upset , mother , and that his father would be angry , so i still have not told him
0	i promise to obey you
0	she herself went off to fetch her a change of clothes
0	man ] soule made to his owne semblance
0	what delicacy of feeling !
0	tomorrow is nibbansday , he said , and everywhere in the world of men they will be cooking frumenty
0	you can have a hundred or two hundred taels now if you need them
0	i shall allow you an initial period of one month in which to revise your old texts thoroughly , and a further month in which to study models of octopartite composi¬tion
0	i know not how he has become so bewildered
0	in his mother ’ s presence he still tried to behave as normally as possible , but there was already a marked cooling-off in his relations with bao-chai and aroma
0	you ’ ll see me when i come back next year , after making a fortune !
0	this mention of tan-chun only brought more tears to the eyes of grandmother jia and the ladies
0	today we ’ ve got a buffoon of our own—a female one
0	even in biblical times , according to weyer , the pythian woman of endor raised not samuel , but a devil-spector in the image of samuel ( )
0	he disappeared when the fighting started , sir
0	entering together in a tight little knot , master and servants surged through like swarming bees to the inner apartment at the back where qin zhong lay , causing great consternation among the two aunts and half-dozen girl cousins who were tending him and who were unable to con¬ceal themselves before the advent of this masculine invasion
0	clutching the volume of poems , caltrop returned in great glee and at once began thinking about her composition
0	it is surely at least worth asking whether and how the criticisms of usury made by the texts studied here might be applied to the postmodern condition
0	in goethe ’ s faust as in paradise lost , the satanic is that element in the human mind that denies that we are created , the tendency of products to forget that they are produced
0	she didn ’ t know any better and went inside miss xing ’ s apartment to have a look around
0	above the flowering apricot
0	i hope you will not refuse to join me
0	i have packed your big fur gown for the pages to take
0	ah yes , said xi-feng
0	aren ’ t you satisfied yet ?
0	what have you been getting up to this time ?
0	shelving was concealed in the double thick¬ness of the partition at the base of these apertures , making it possible to use them for storing books and writing materials and for the display of antique bronzes , vases of flowers , miniature tray-gardens and the like
0	the bar did not however prevent her from slipping out into the garden when everyone else had gone , making her way round it between the rocks and the perimeter wall to the foot of the wall that separated it from pear-tree court , and eavesdropping on what was going on inside
0	and if we hand them over to the official broker who usually finds husbands for orphan girls , even though we don ’ t want the body price , someone is sure to try and make money out of them , and no one will think of their wel¬fare
0	on greensickness peak
0	from amber cups thirst-quenching nectar flows
0	i think that would be sensible
0	it seems a terrible waste to use it on windows
0	the mighty sturgeon has his pool ;
0	when my period of mourning is over , i shall instigate a search for those items and am confident we shall find them
0	i ’ m just as much an outsider as you are , said bao-chai
0	i dare say we could find somewhere , said tealeaf without much conviction
0	i shall never catch anything at this rate
0	if it is a life of pure contemplation that you seek , surely one of the sacred mountains would be a more conducive dwelling place ?
0	xi-feng had long since changed back into her ordinary clothes
0	aroma continued to weep inconsolably
0	they returned wearing only tunics and trousers , with their unadorned hair loosely knotted or coiled
0	i hand you over to the younger generation , who will learn much from you
0	the extent of this influence should not surprise us , given the poet ’ s lifelong involvement in the trade , but modern readers have often elided milton ’ s references to usury , partly because the terms of the debate are now so deeply embedded in our consciousness as to be indiscernible , and partly because our language has changed its emphases to reflect this familiarity
0	you ’ ve never liked her , so why go asking for trouble ?
0	then , cleansed of all wayward thoughts , her mind began to soar towards the realm of higher truth
0	shamed and angered by her words , yet still not daring to act upon them ) jia huan made a dismissive gesture with his hand
0	if she heard it and it gets about—oh dear !
0	when it was nicely flooded , they rounded up a number of mallards , sheldrakes , mandarin ducks and other waterfowl , tied their wings together , and having first closed die courtyard gate , set them down in the water to swim about
0	tan-chun was the only one to abstain from making any comment
0	why aren ’ t you pouring the tea ?
0	yet , if you asked him where his dwelling was ,
0	in typological interpretation , the literal and partisan significances of the old testament are assimilated and subjected to the figurative , generalized meanings of the new dispensation
0	she turned to the servants
0	mrs lian sent someone round to fetch crimson , said aroma
0	when he returned to his own yamen , he despatched a family servant to the capital to ascertain exactly what had happened , and at the same time to carry a message to grandmother jia , informing her of the marriage proposal
0	you must sit next to your mother , she told bao-yu
0	that ’ s all right , my darling , don ’ t you worry !
0	talking as they went , they presently passed through the gate of the garden and accompanied grandmother jia back to her apartment
0	i ’ ll tell you something , my girl you just don ’ t realize how lucky you are
0	damp airs the silver toad of the moon inflate
0	presently she finished washing and laughed
0	off you go now , all of you , and have a good night ’ s sleep
0	lady xing had sent someone over to say that she wanted ying-chun to spend a few days with her so that she could be exhibited to the representatives of a family seeking her in marriage , and lady wang herself was facing a visit from an official match-maker who was coming to discuss the matrimonial prospects of tan-chun
0	but eventually he allowed himself to be persuaded , and producing it from within his gown , he exhibited the jade to them fleetingly on the palm of his hand , saying :
0	twelfth song : the good things have an end
0	the impressive-looking official titles inscribed on the carriage lanterns enabled them to pass through the district barricades , and by the time they reached the city gate it was opening time and the gatekeeper did not even bother to ask any questions , thinking they were on official business
0	as soon as dai-yu had finished writing this down , xiang-¬yan and the rest began a critical discussion of the whole poem
0	we ’ ll just say that it ’ s grannie ’ s orders , and he won ’ t be able to do a thing
0	then she drew him up to sit beside her on the kang and asked him about the others , at the same time giving orders for tea to be served
0	so can we lok forward to your kind help in this matter tomorrow ?
0	it is a pity that none of you seem to understand this child ’ s heredity
0	( ) he successfully insinuates himself into his victim ’ s mind , so that this immediately becomes
0	or have you only served them for a number of years ?
0	there ’ s also quite a good enamelled screen from admiral wu ’ s lady
0	next time he gives trouble , we ’ ll let you know and you can deal with him then
0	it ’ s the sincerity with which we make the offering , not the offering itself that counts
0	but tis air my void arm presses—
0	she ’ s so weak too , and never could stand up for herself properly
0	she found them very sweet ’ - even more so on a closer inspection - and asked them their ages
0	she called faithful over :
0	then you must take twelve drams of rain water that fell on the rain days in the second month
0	the elevation of the sign as an end in itself involves giving priority to the material and the literal levels of meaning , at the expense of the spiritual and figurative , and these are among the most conspicuous ideological effects of calvin ’ s usurious and liturgical hermeneutics
0	we may find a hint in the lines from swift that hedderwick uses as the epigraph to his translation of the bonneschky manuscript : the gods of old were logs of wood ,
0	he is quickly rebuked for this leniency
0	there they set it down again and then retired in respectful silence
0	we only came to know yu-cun , continued jia zheng , when my brother-in-law , lin ru-hai , who at that time was the yangchow salt commissioner , engaged him as private tutor for his daughter - this was after his dismissal
0	better than your cousin , anyway , forever boozing his way into trouble
0	why should i create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself - especially when i am the wife ’ s son and he is the concubine ’ s ?
0	the winecups were replenished with warm wine
0	there seemed little point in protesting
0	she turned to melilot
0	it ’ s what happens in the long run that counts
0	oh very well then , said faithful , resigning herself to her fate
0	xi-feng was almost convinced
0	musk , said aroma , i ’ m no good at arguing with people and skybright is too excitable
0	the presents which bao-yu received from the girls were of a less formal nature and chosen more to mark the occasion than for their intrinsic value : a fan from one , a specimen of calli¬graphy from another , a painting or a poem
0	don ’ t worry , said er-jie
0	it is jade , isn ’ t it , in your cover-up ?
0	just at that moment a third figure , previously invisible , stepped out from behind bao-qin ’ s back
0	i ’ ll just have to put a bold face on it and do the best i can
0	so there wasn ’ t anything frightening in the garden then ?
0	we realize , said cousin zhen , that lady jia is a generation older than father
0	he and his parents were all three delighted when they learned what she had brought them
0	i said i ’ d mention it to you , ma ’ am
0	as she spoke , her tears fell like drops of rain
0	no one is really up to it yet
0	and even in the end , no such calamity as this ever befell them
0	do tell me what she wants to go and change her name for ?
0	what did you think i would be up to ?
0	oriole , on the other hand , reproved her mistress in private for having been , as she put it , too hasty
0	in this sense , the old testament term most commonly translated as soul
0	who ’ s been making a doormat of you this time ?
0	i can ’ t bring myself to swallow gold or take poison
0	there ’ s a strong little will there , though—plenty of deter¬mination underneath it all
0	by now it was clear to aroma that dai-yu ’ s mind was as disturbed as bao-¬yu ’ s
0	its willows orioles from the vale invite ;
0	or the earth ’ s embalming
0	jia zheng was informed directly upon his return , and for most of the winter he was kept very busy and spent nearly all of his time at the ministry
0	look , here ’ s a two heads are better than one
0	he drew a handkerchief of his own from inside his sleeve and held it up in front of her with a smile :
0	to begin with that ’ s what some of the doctors told us , said you-shi , resuming the conversation ; but yesterday feng zi-ying introduced a doctor friend of his to us who is terribly good , someone he went to school with , and he said that she wasn ’ t expecting at all
0	a day or so later , he was in his study puzzling his head over some figures , when a servant came hurrying in to inform him that his presence was immediately required at court
0	( ) , and declares that none should aduenture on the thing , /
0	the subjective element of desire is repressed , and it is assumed that beautiful objects , especially the female body , simply produce desire by virtue of their own qualities
0	jia lian : wang ren
0	a pledge is a pledge
0	you mustn ’ t go reading that sort of stuff !
0	that only means you ’ ve got some inflammation on your lungs , and have brought a little up
0	the second son , though , jia zheng , has been mad keen on study ever since he was a lad
0	was there anything missing ?
0	can ’ t we leave together in the evening ?
0	from his reading of the inscription vanitas realized that this was a stone of some consequence
0	fortunately she did not have long to wait
0	what will you take back ?
0	some time after this bao-yu got back
0	not that i could engage in such a thing anyway while still in mourning
0	give me a proper cup of tea !
0	as she did so , her eye chanced to light on the gold kylin fastened in the intricate loopings of her mistress ’ s girdle
0	have you put it away some¬where ?
0	yellow vetch root drams
0	lady xing and lady wang fol¬lowed in their less imposing conveyances , accompanied by you-shi , who was also going over to the other mansion
0	cousin zhen went first to mrs li , bowed , took her wine-cup and , turning back , handed it to jia lian to fill
0	at that point there was a great thump and the sensation of being hit on the back of the neck by an object like a large iron hammer
0	you ’ re a nice one !
0	any old thief could push down this false wall ( jia qiang )
0	i know all that by heart
0	it ’ s not the money you ’ re after
0	he was so insistent that in the end i had to break up two of my ornaments for him
0	said aroma with a smile
0	it isn ’ t as if i hadn ’ t begged him to take a second wife
0	because tan-chun had recently been crying , three or four maids had already been to fetch water and towels and a hand-mirror so that she could wash her face
0	as nash ’ s christ ’ s tears remarks : courtiers hate merchants more then any men , for that being once in their bookes , they can neuer get out ( ibid )
0	this is not actually my affair
0	bao-yu gratifies his grandmother
0	unquestionably , said the doctor
0	that ponce and his poxy strumpet seem to enjoy themselves , she would say self-pityingly
0	he never stops us
0	angered and revolted by his odious intimacy , xiang-lian quickly thought of a plan for disposing of him
0	the usurer , however , violates this natural prerequisite and , by representing use value as exchange value , unnaturally earns a profit without laboring
0	crying won ’ t make it any better
0	the younger generation must pay homage to her
0	i ’ d get you something nice to replace it with
0	nothing can alter fate
0	such confusion about the ontological status of representation is for milton the very definition of apostasy
0	it was only a question of time
0	partly it was because she had a fear of infecting him : for she still continued , though very infrequently , to cough blood
0	having promised to carry out these instructions , xi-feng turned to aunt xue and nudged her playfully
0	it won ’ t be much fun for grandma if it ’ s too cold
0	early this morning master huan was over at her ladyship ’ s
0	when you see through the spring scene ’ s transient state ,
0	well , don ’ t you think i share in that concern myself ?
0	jia zheng passed on to the second theme ( it may be helpful at this point to provide some idea of the pedagogic principles that guided dai-ru in his selection of themes for his young pupil
0	come on , ten old mate !
0	although her whole body had broken out in a sweat and she was still shivering with fright , she now felt alert and clear-headed and could distinguish the forms of crimson and felicity walking in her direction
0	my own business here is all finished now , but if you want to amuse yourselves a bit longer , i suppose i must resign myself to staying
0	the impecunious gentleman witgood has been living in fear of meeting his creditors , but when his credit appears to be restored by the prospect of marriage to a rich widow , they rush to press predatory loans upon him : second creditor : faith , we heard you brought up a rich widow , sir , and were suddenly to marry her
0	the boxes and cupboards were all flung open , and how could they possibly remember what had been in them ?
0	bao-yu made no comment
0	now that i ’ ve got this job , i rely entirely on your support to run things here , she told them
0	she is your own cousin after all
0	from the light , availed himself of the shadow ’ s concealment to give xi-feng ’ s dress a surreptitious tug
0	there was never any question of asking you to approach lady jia for me : i shall naturally undertake that task myself
0	the name of the lord buddha
0	he asked the old woman , or is there someone with him ?
0	holding the tray out respectfully in both her hands , she offered the cup to grand¬mother jia
0	describes how hans wurst wants to have a lot of money and , to please him mephistophiles permits him to cause a shower of gold
0	please come in and sit down
0	another attendant began to roll up the pearl blind , and as she did so bao-yu caught sight of a regal figure seated within , dressed in richly embroidered robes and wearing a crown of flowers on her head
0	so she turned a deaf ear to aroma ’ s entreaties
0	when he came in , aunt xue told him to give them a full account of every¬thing he had heard
0	why don ’ t you get your nose back into your winecup ?
0	she just stood there a while collecting herself and then walked quietly out of the room
0	i doubt very much whether any of your own young ladies would know a pawn ticket if she saw one
0	you didn ’ t waste much time , having got him to yourself , did you ?
0	he ’ ll be coming this way
0	and don ’ t encourage him to get mixed up with bad women
0	our record omits any description of that ceremony and moves back to bao-yu , who was sitting in the central gallery beside his grandmother , and who now called for a maid to bring the tray up so that he could put on his magic jade again
0	after all , things may be a bit difficult at present , but we can ’ t be all that poor
0	it will be exactly the same if one day huan has a chamber-wife from outside
0	it was some of the women¬folk we saw there
0	the monk returned the salutation and sat down
0	bao-qin , concluding that this was now a free-for-all , -cut in with ? he next half couplet :
0	it was bao-yu , who had just caught sight of nightingale and who now , to everyone ’ s relief , burst into tears
0	he was puzzled , therefore , by bao-chai ’ s rejoinder , and even more puzzled when he studied the ex¬pression on dai-yu ’ s face and found that , far from showing any trace of the resentment he would have expected , it exactly tallied with what bao-chai had said
0	some of them , in their gladness to be free of it , were willing to let bygones be bygones
0	do you actually see some figure ?
0	in any case , they ’ re not your real sisters , so what ’ s the point of seeing them ?
0	caltrop , warming to the argument , momentarily forgot jin-gui ’ s taboo
0	things look bad , he reported later that day
0	said the old woman
0	just look at that !
0	on one of these evenings she had just finished waiting on grandmother jia while she took her evening meal , when the old lady exempted her from further services
0	mrs li was also invited , and later that day she arrived together with li wen and li qi
0	that being so , you can be quite sure that i shall be the person she ’ ll pick on first to make an example of
0	the impostor had been waiting in the study , and as time went by and no one returned , had already begun to lose his nerve

0	i race along , i am a splendid specimen
0	don juan : pray heaven to give you a new coat
0	all this can gold , all this can siluer do ,
0	now you pick out one or two good ones for us !
0	at this time all the great families which kept troupes of actors or actresses in their households were beginning to disband them
0	she ’ ll feel that all the trouble she has had in bringing me up has not been wasted
0	all that talk about spending mid-autumn night enjoying the moon together and using the occasion to revive the poetry club with another linked couplets session - and then , when the time comes , they leave us in the lurch and go off to enjoy the moon by themselves !
0	it is merely a sign ; when the devil sees the sign and hears the word , he knows what they indicate ; then he performs the act , and it is the devil who does this and not [ the witches ]
0	her few padded or fur-lined clothes looked rather worn and ineffective as protection against the cold
0	george puttenham ’ s the arte of english poesie ( ) gives to personification the greek term prosopopeia , and immediately connects it to avarice ,
0	the two wives sat down once more
0	she works in the garden
0	i heard her asking you about a handkerchief
0	use the little side-gate in the garden , that used to be kept open
0	the debts you mentioned must be honoured at once
0	your old southern mansion has tumbled in ruins ,
0	i ’ m no : wandering about , if you really want to know , said crimson
0	the women tried anxiously to forestall any more of his grandiose threats :
0	and in chalices cunningly fashioned from calabash pour rarest metheglin flavoured with penny-royal
0	won ’ t you stay a little longer ?
0	while he was speaking he had been fishing for a copy of the mandarin ’ s lift-preserver in his pocket
0	bao-yu was most upset
0	that ’ s why she wrote to me rather than anyone else
0	i am glad you reminded me
0	now , you are not your own mistress , and the few strings of cash they give you a month at home are not even enough £or your own needs
0	were recent arrivals on the london scene
0	several of the servants shouted at her and attempted to pull her off
0	yes , great-grannie , qiao-jie smilingly replied
0	commodities can be exchanged because they are qualitatively different , and quantitatively equal : in the semantic field , however , there is no way of reproducing the distinction between quantity and quality
0	replied one of the servants
0	it was a dazzling sight there that met her eyes : not perhaps the
0	xi-feng went off to speak to the girls ’ mothers
0	all right , said bao-yu to the girl
0	and give patience some money , so that she can look after her properly
0	in fact , be concluded , everything about her excited one ’ s admiration and respect
0	the others all laughed
0	he told the bad spirit : take my soul
0	eventually mr xia came out and saw us waiting there
0	it ’ s true she is a bit better-looking than the rest of you , but she has never taken advantage of that fact : no one has ever been made to feel threatened by it
0	you ’ ll have to come with me to the jobs room and explain yourself to them there
0	i shall have to go and have it out with her
0	so be it , then
0	jia lian was so intoxicated by his desire for er-jie that jia rong ’ s idiotic plan struck him as unassailable
0	the more abstract and self-referential money grows , the less reference it bears to the physical world or to any objective reality , and the more energetic , voracious , and destructive it becomes
0	bao-yu , who up to that point had been listening to her enthralled , laughed at her sudden silence
0	how does the old song go ?
0	i shall really hare to see her ladyship about this and get it over with
0	whence then springeth vsurie ?
0	yesterday she seemed to be a little better , he said , but this pulse today takes us right back to where we started from—empty , superficial , faint , constricted
0	no one else gets a chance
0	but i remember two years ago i asked you to bring me some big crickets
0	now i know that she was related to the jias of the rong household , i am not surprised
0	the cup struck zhang on the top of the head , there was a substantial loss of blood , and he died shortly afterwards
0	the emphasis augustine lays upon this point indicates that he saw the mistaking of signs for things as a common and dangerous error
0	where did you get it from ?
0	items in brass and pewter , over five hundred
0	under the circumstances , grandmother jia could not very well press her to stay , and after some polite skirmishing when the princess protested that she could perfectly well find her way off the premises alone , the entire company saw her to the gate of the garden , where she climbed into her palanquin and was carried away
0	quickly warming his hands over the stove , he slipped one of them inside the bedclothes and felt her body
0	i said to wan , i don ’ t care how you do it , my dear , but you must get rid of that woman at once
0	it has , replied jia zheng
0	we ’ d better wait until that ’ s over before putting on anything of our own
0	no more i ’ ll sink and soar between gloom and elation ,
0	i could go on listening for ever !
0	wait here for your instructions from her majesty
0	patience has almost certainly taken her off to hide in the home of a relative
0	a few young novices to wait on her and help about the priory were just what she was looking for
0	i don ’ t know why , but i ’ m absolutely ravenous
0	she resembled skybright in every detail
0	it is just this satanic ability to conjure images that convinces cyprian to sign the faustian pact , when the devil fabricates a chimera representing justina
0	aroma was ready with words of comfort , but bao-chai silenced her with a wave of her hand :
0	jia zheng smiled deprecatingly
0	and she stepped briskly forward and made her a kotow
0	i ’ m glad the boy ’ s from a nanking family , said grandmother jia
0	why drag me into it ?
0	'that may be ; but what if cupidity proves stronger than friendship ?
0	we will search for all we are worth
0	dai-yu for her part was sufficiently aware of her own weakness not to insist on looking
0	a smile spread across the old lady ’ s face when she heard , and she went at once to tell qiao-jie and congratulate her on the good news
0	it was only a casual suggestion , and i never mentioned it at home
0	you ’ d better go and rescue her
0	your ladyship has no need to worry
0	the old woman came forward to kotow first to xi-feng then to xiu-yan , and left
0	i don ’ t want it !
0	lady xing could not simply walk out , so she filled a cup with some tea and set it down in front of grandmother jia
0	in an effort to restore his spirits , the servants turned the conversa¬tion to jia lan ’ s success in the exams and the revival of the family fortunes
0	xi-feng took up some more from the dish in her chopsticks and popped it into grannie liu ’ s mouth
0	can learn what , deep within it ,
0	having installed him on the kang , they bustled to and fro fetching things to eat and pour¬ing tea
0	your own mother hates you so much she ’ s itching to get her teeth in you
0	merchants were often portrayed as brokers of their wives ’ sexuality ( )
0	aroma knew that when grandmother jia gave her to bao-yu she had intended her to belong to him in the fullest possible sense , and so , having no good reason for refusing him , she allowed him , after a certain amount of coy resistance , to have his way with her
0	there was a raised stone walk running all the way up to the main gate , along which the old nurses now conducted her
0	if the girl ’ s done wrong , why can ’ t you just punish her for it ?
0	no matter where he ’ s been , sir zheng and lady wang are quite capable of looking after him themselves
0	sold emerges almost simultaneously with the concept of the soul itself
0	the allowance for aunt zhao ’ s and aunt zhou ’ s maids used to be one string each a month , but last year accounts reduced it by a half to five hundred cash
0	in fact , i refuse to hear of it
0	not daring to interrupt it , she passed on into the inner room , where xue bao-chai , dressed in workaday clothes , her hair unadorned and twisted in a knot on top of her head , sat with her maid oriole over a little table towards the back of the kang , tracing a pattern for her embroidery
0	i ’ ve been looking for you everywhere
0	following his directions , patience found that her com¬plexion had acquired a radiant freshness that she had never seen in it before
0	since you can not come to me , i have come to you instead
0	ha , i see you have magical properties !
0	needless to say , it is only the ignorant sort of persons who hold this ridiculous belief
0	she and caltrop have a lot of sewing to catch up on at home
0	the ancients used a poetic theme as a vehicle for whatever feelings they happened to want to express at that particular moment
0	one of the women told the tale , how they had heard sounds in the night , had been put to sleep by the incense , had found adamantina missing in the morning and discovered the rope-ladder and scabbard by the garden wall
0	as she wiped her eyes with one hand , dai-yu pushed him away from her with the other
0	but though the pages made no trouble , this young zhou dropped the box he was carrying and scattered wheat-cakes all over the courtyard
0	that ’ s the point at which to stop then , said grandmother jia
0	but why don ’ t you finish it ?
0	everyone was impressed and cousin zhen eagerly inquired the price
0	i was afraid that if i sent one of the others , they might not understand what you wanted
0	it was already lighting-up time and lady wang , li wan , xi-feng , ying-chun , tan-chun and xi-chun had also forgathered for the meal
0	i couldn ’ t let her go to the
0	both lines allude , in turn , to the incarnation , and thus ironically reveal the blasphemous inversion that defines the villains ’ financial mode of evaluation
0	xiang-lian behaved very bad because he was drunk
0	the reason i ’ ve dragged you here is because i want you to do some knotting for me
0	mr xue had been feeling very jealous , and it looks as though he may have put someone else up to telling the master about it out of spite
0	i got so hungry that just now i asked liu to do a bowl of soup and some rice for me to eat here now ; so i shan ’ t want anything again tonight
0	but what could she do ?
0	she is the daughter of sir jia she by one of his secondary wives
0	jia zheng sat down to regain his breath and told them what had happened
0	perhaps i don ’ t come in quite the same category as the others , said the old taoist
0	you see , i am a very hard mistress
0	rowlands includes admonitory examples of the brokers ’ tricks : sayes good-man broker , in his new print ruffe : he will not stand too strictly on a day ,
0	as soon as tan-chun had received this confirmation , she and li wan sent for the list of women employed in the garden
0	they were all of them delighted and accepted these conditions unani¬mously
0	now he ’ s found one at last - someone he met the other day on the journey
0	presently night¬ingale and kingfisher came in to help the girls with their toilet
0	that was to put over the mortar to pound the pearls through
0	we need not worry on her account
0	this time their arrival was anticipated
0	don ’ t take offence , miss
0	what has made you of all people so parsimonious about things all of a sudden ?
0	they ’ re sure to give in sooner or later , even if they ’ re made of iron
0	i don ’ t want it !
0	and venison reeks strangely on rosebud lips
0	it might have been a maid of one of the young ladles that broke it
0	the court knows all the facts now but has decided not to prosecute
0	give fivey forty strokes too and pack her off to the grange
0	i paid it for you myself
0	this lengthy homily had so chastened dai-yu that she sat with head bowed low over her teacup and , though her heart consented , could only manage a weak little yes ’ by way of reply
0	i don ’ t even know who or what bijou is , let alone what you mean by enticement
0	you see , i was not mistaken , said yu-cun
0	i should only have got smut on my nose if i ’ d gone inside
0	the terrified pages chorused in unison at each of his commands , and some of them went off to look for bao-yu
0	wine was now brought in and everyone sat down in the places assigned to them
0	i was bringing in the beans , and i was that shocked i couldn ’ t go on , i just had to sit down on the ground and cry my heart out
0	jia zheng nodded , and jia lian went in to lady xing ’ s apart¬ment
0	lady wang was also present , anxious that grandmother jia might be souffrante and in need of consolation , and she too was delighted to hear jia zheng ’ s news
0	he forsook all other interests for her
0	children of the upper classes , especially if they are reared delicately and provided they are not pock-marked or ill-favoured , are all much of a muchness as far as good looks are concerned
0	said xiang-yun , rolling up her sleeves
0	all that remained was for jia lian to name the day
0	it follows , of course , that the human subject can be expressed in financial terms
0	having finished with skybright , she ordered all the other maids to be called in , from aroma down to the most junior maid-of-all-work , to be subjected to her scrutiny
0	cousin zhen asked them
0	i thought of you as the person most likely to be able to help me get to the bottom of this business
0	have they been selected to suit the individual rooms ?
0	musk did not agree , however
0	since none else autumn ’ s mystery can explain ,
0	i wouldn ’ t lay claim to any great riches , but i think i may perhaps be a little bit better off than the rest of you
0	she wrapped up three of the rings again , and after sitting a little longer , went off , attended by her nannies and maids , to call on wang xi-¬feng
0	these turned out to be the cards for not ’ and spot ,
0	and see all autumn in a single spray
0	it ’ s just that—if you ’ ll allow me to say so—master bao and the young ladies are beginning to grow up now , and though they are all cousins , there is the difference of sex between them , which makes it very awkward sometimes when they are all living together , especially in the case of miss lin and miss bao , who aren ’ t even of the same clan
0	the anxieties and injustices which now beset him , coming on top of the shocks he had suffered a year or two previously , left a man of his years with little resistance to the joint onslaught of poverty and ill-health , and gradually he began to betray the unmistakable symptoms of a decline
0	soon the draft was finished , and he took a piece of white material of the kind they call mer¬maid silk ’ , which he knew skybright had been fond of , and after first writing the title on it in large characters :
0	as she was speaking , a group including xi-feng , lady xing , lady wang and bao-chai advanced into the room and announced cheerfully :
0	at that time you graciously favoured my suggestion that the connection between our two families he further strengthened by a matrimonial alliance
0	they would be able to give your ladyship an answer
0	dai-yu laughingly shook her head
0	i don ’ t think i ’ ll ever pull through
0	he certainly does seem a bit simple
0	just us four , surely ?
0	and sure enough she sent one of her little maids round less than ten days later asking for this and asking for that
0	they ’ ve done nothing to provoke you
0	the prophecy contained in her nightmare was to be fulfilled after all
0	surely you must know ?
0	explicit quarta pars lapidis historiae
0	we really are in a sorry state !

0	it is i who should kotow to you -which is what i have come to do now
0	aroma noticed this neglect and was afraid that oriole might be offended
0	that statement would have seemed eccentric to many intellectuals of the last century , who often took the naively literalist view that satan
0	by the time she had completed it , paid her daily tribute to nature , washed her hands , drunk a few mouthfuls of milk , and rinsed out her mouth , it was already half past six and brightie ’ s wife , at the head of the other female domestics , had been waiting for some considerable time in the courtyard outside

0	she was being allowed in on this occasion by virtue of her recent adoption into the family and was anxious to take in every detail in order that she might retain as accurate an im¬pression of it as possible
0	observing that the hopeful sign ’ still remained to be done , she told him to get on with the copying out in fair of the three poems he had already completed while she thought of something for the hopeful sign ’

0	before entrusting it to you ,
0	hadn ’ t you better come with me to explain all about this to grandmother and lady wang ?
0	i ought perhaps to mention that their family circumstances are somewhat reduced
0	when two days had gone by and still nothing had happened , she began to feel a little easier
0	with a vehicle for romantic feelings
0	if you were to ask me nicely , said xi-feng jovially , i think i could undertake to hurry them up for you

0	one of the waiters employed by gaffer li the proprietor was a certain zhang san , with whom xue was not previously acquainted

0	we started chatting , and one of us happened to mention master bao and his naughty ways
0	said bao-yu to jia huan , ignoring bao-chai ’ s excuses
0	a knock at the gate coming in the midst of these resentful mutterings was enough to make her really angry
0	and she says that when she ’ s made a bit more progress she ’ s going to come over to see you and make you a kotow in person
0	zhang hua has only dragged me into it because he has a personal grudge against me
0	grandmother jia had stopped when- she heard this voice -and now stood panting for some moments while she regained her breath
0	but as he entered the gate the source of his annoyance dis¬appeared ; for a miniature mountain of rock , whose many holes and fissures , worn through it by weathering or the wash of waters , bestowed on it a misleading appearance of fragile delicacy , towered up in front of him and combined with the many smaller rocks of various shapes and sizes which sur¬rounded it to efface from their view every vestige of the build¬ing they had just been looking at

0	lady wang was a good woman at heart and had only opposed the young actresses ’ determination to become nuns because she thought it proceeded from mere childish waywardness and feared that when put to the test they would find the vows of celibacy and abstinence too much for them and fall into mortal sin
0	luckily we had a little bezoar left and it ’ s all mixed now , so you might as well go
0	she was back again presently to invite the two boys to tea and cakes ; but neither of them felt much enthusiasm for such feminine repasts , and after sitting a short while for the sake of politeness , were soon off to amuse themselves else¬where
0	i ’ ll invite you all round to my place another day and you shall have the details then
0	surely , said lady xing , when it became evident that faithful was determined not to accompany her , surely you can ’ t mean to refuse this offer ?

0	after seeing grandmother jia , mother ma drifted round the mansion calling at various other apartments
0	what a cruel end for such a gentle creature , her flowerlike beauty crushed within a year of marriage !
0	just leave her to do as she likes and take no notice !
0	it makes me feel really angry on their ladyships ’ behalf

0	a number of stewardesses who were waiting their turn to report , pricked up their ears at this mention of tan-chun ’ s natural mother and waited with interest to see what the two young deputies would decide
0	the charge against him is that he failed to control his subordinates and was responsible for the requisitioning of extortionate quantities of tax-grain
0	lady wang was evidently in the midst of rebuking him about something , but as soon as she caught sight of bao-chai , she closed her mouth and fell silent
0	very good , said cousin zhen
0	a while ago i had one or two of bao¬yu ’ s more flirtatious maids dismissed - i ’ m sure you knew about the affair ; it led to your going home to live with your mother
0	ask whether lady jia is quite better yet and whether or not she is still taking medicine
0	well , of course , first and foremost we came to see you , replied grannie liu mendaciously , but we were also hoping to pay our respects to her ladyship
0	in the west , marxists and their descendents might call this power money , but money itself is only an idea and has no material or physical existence
0	to meet one of them in the garden where the roses grow ;
0	i can understand that the two of them should have grown rather fond of one another , after growing up together and playing together as children
0	but if it ’ s master bao you want to quarrel with , then at least you might do it a bit more quietly and not let everyone else know about it
0	you ’ d better hand her over to the night watch and tell them to look after her until the morning
0	just listen to the way she suddenly uses a sharpened fourth there !
0	with angels may participate , and find
0	since he operates entirely in the dimension of representation , rather than reality , the devil attempts to induce in the magician the belief that signs are efficacious , and this belief involves a covenant with satan :
0	yes , said tan-chun
0	our jia girls are no match for them !
0	early next morning she went to pay her respects to grandmother jia
0	the hebrew bible uses the word nephesh to refer to the essence of a living individual
0	in seeking to redeem her they would have had to rely on the customary generosity of the jias , who , as soon as they were approached on the subject , would in all probability restore not only the person of aroma but also the body-price offered for her , but who were certainly not under any obliga¬tion to do so
0	dampit does openly and literally what usurers were conceived as doing secretly and implicitly : he becomes monstrously alien to society , constantly intoxicated , incomprehensibly hostile , and despite or because of all this , outrageously egocentric
0	i have a nice , kind cousin to stick up for me
0	it was no surprise to tan-chun , therefore , that patience should have walked in just as she was saying this ; but to the others her appearance at that moment was little short of miraculous
0	jia zheng was moved to tears to see how clearly she had worked everything out
0	one day when she ’ s feeling high-spirited she ’ ll let him drink as much as he likes ; other days she won ’ t let him touch a drop
0	later in the play he pretends to be converted , then mocks sganarelle ’ s credulity : did you really take what i said just now for genuine currency ?
0	have a very careful look and try to find out exactly how she is
0	he stepped forwards impetuously and barred their way
0	uncle zheng has been impeached

0	in¬timidated by the master ’ s presence in the next room , none of the maids dared speak to him and he soon fell into a deep sleep
0	in this bleak north it makes such brave display ,
0	i don ’ t think any of my girls has bad taste
0	presently xue pan began to notice that he was getting into the open country and brought his horse round about
0	yes , of course , said bao-yu inattentively , and gave ripple instructions to take his presents round to dai-yu :
0	immediately he jumped up and peered out to see who it was
0	no , i ’ ll be honest with you , they ’ re not for me
0	it ’ s a long story , ma ’ am
0	in a word , i am eclectic , that is to say that i believe in everything because i believe in nothing
0	xi-feng threw herself upon you-shi 's bosom , weeping and wailing in a fine display of histrionic grief
0	in any case , you ’ ve put up with much worse than this in the past ; why be so touchy today ?
0	her brother had entertained hopes of trading on these assets in order to ally himself matrimonially with some powerful or aristocratic family—an ambition which -had hitherto led him to look frowningly on lesser offers , with the—result that , at -the relatively great age of twenty-two , qiu-fang remained unbetrothed
0	for both thinkers , money is the power that can overturn nature and impose representation on reality
0	where ’ s my little lan ?
0	if it ’ s a present , you ’ d better bring it now ; i ’ m a busy woman !
0	bao-yu nodded attentively and commended the tea
0	he appeared to be disconcerted by what he found
0	the great lord was always inviting the village god over for a chat
0	aroma had always been an intelligent girl
0	even if one or two of them have been up to some mischief , i don ’ t think it would be fair to punish them in-discriminately , by making them all return to lay-life
0	ladies should have to put up with the inconvenience of moving into a strange house
0	i thought as much , said dai-yu sneeringly
0	whenever he saw moonbeam , she lowered her head and walked away without so much as a glance in his direction
0	light reflected from the bamboos outside passed through the gauze of the window to make a green gloom within , lending a cold , aquarian look to the floor and the -surfaces of the furniture
0	of the day or two which followed these events our story preserves no record
0	when patience heard that , she made no further objectionafter the women had gone , tan-chun looked at bao-chai inquiringly :
0	go over to the garden and tell our bao-yu to come here so that our visitors can have a look at him and tell us how he compares with their bao-yu
0	ba-chai guessed at once that she had been forced to pawn them
0	as soon as our money comes in i shall redeem them and give them back to you
0	do you think after all the years i ’ ve been here i don ’ t know how unmanageable and how ruthless you can be ?
0	with so many of us , there ’ s surely nothing to be afraid of
0	eventually they achieved their goal : they were all evacuated , the garden gate was securely locked , and no one dared go in at all
0	i ’ ve been worrying about you myself , replied aunt xue
0	the child is of age now
0	she asked jia lian for his opinion :
0	it ’ s all very well for you to say forget about it !
0	you ’ re like a cat : always eating except when you ought to be
0	they had a strange assortment of names
0	four , said citronella
0	in england ’ s view ( ) malynes had recommended : [ c ] oncerning vsury : let vs
0	you ’ re holding everyone up
0	but i ’ m sure what i ’ ve got to say is only going to make you angry
0	how did you come to get it back again ?
0	no , said bao-yu
0	do as you please , it ’ s all the same to me
0	his mother is seriously ill and has been asking to see aroma , said the messenger
0	now don ’ t drink too much
0	the ones that owe us a favour are penniless , and the ones that don ’ t are unlikely to come forward and help us now
0	a whole lot more of them have settled just in the time we have been talk¬ing
0	but skybright motioned impatiently to him to be quiet and crept out of the door
0	and you know what a difficult lot those old stewardesses are
0	i never said it was !
0	they didn ’ t mention anyone else , said the girl
0	i haven ’ t got that little something which would have made me worthy of you
0	the poet john milton grew up quite literally under the sign of the scriveners : the spread eagle that hung over his father ’ s shop was the profession ’ s corporate symbol
0	observing that he was dressed in the uniform of a mandarin of the sixth rank , grand¬mother jia deduced that he must be a court physician , and in returning his salutation was careful to address him with the worshipful ’ to which his appointment entitled him
0	true learning implies a clear insight into human activities
0	lady wang was not naturally unkind
0	grannie liu was a good long while puzzling over this
0	according to a prominent line of interpretation , these ostensibly divergent phenomena share the highly unusual characteristic of being permitted to the jews in the old testament law , but explicitly forbidden by christ in the new testament
0	where did i get it from ?
0	i ’ ve naught to do with you
0	oh dear , this is all so extravagant i ’
0	he could have made his offering anywhere
0	and now that one remark of ours has nearly been the death of her
0	that might be a bit cold and lonely though
0	oh , i quite agree , said wang shan-bao ’ s wife
0	that was my very reason for suggesting an inspection of the accounts
0	he then prompts the astrologer to propose a solution in pseudo-alchemical language , prophesizing faust ’ s discovery of , not the philosopher ’ s stone , but its antithesis
0	he nodded approvingly before hurrying on
0	the conscious intention of the speaker is irrelevant to the felicity of a performative , and to the degree that the performative is characteristic of all language , the autonomous subject evaporates
0	in middleton , however , the disruption of stable subjectivity is revealed as a by-product of usury , with its monetarization of character and its evaluation of credit in financial terms
0	dai-yu fluttered her eyelids and slowly bowed her head
0	the owner of the voice hurriedly relieved him of the cup
0	cyprian pledges his word directly to the devil , while later don juans make their promises to women , but the performative effect of the promise is the same in both cases
1	girt even in death with iron armour and long spears
1	it ’ s obviously not a supervisor you want but a mint-master to supply you with cash
1	nothing to do with me
1	in our timber-yard is some qiang wood from the iron-net mountain across the sea , said the young man
1	he got up again and demanded to be dressed so that he could go to his grandmother and then to the other mansion
1	chou chin , cup in hand , thanked the villagers and drained his cup
1	she ordered a feast to be served to them outside
1	he said it was to be kept for mr wei
1	bring that small cedar table over here , directed the lady dowager
1	she ordered the attendants , in future don ’ t let lin zhixiao ’ s wife into the garden
1	they had no sooner washed their faces and sat down to drink tea when the gateman came in
1	can i buy some incense here ?
1	when baoyu spoke highly of the goose feet and duck tongues served a couple of days before by madam you , she produced some of her own , pickled with distiller ’ s grain , for him to try
1	let me know and i ’ ll tell the old lady first thing in the morning
1	at that time , all the men of both jia mansions were in the hall except for baoyu , who had slipped off to join the old lady on the pretext of indisposition , and jia huan who was seldom presented to guests
1	the prior excused himself and went out
1	as their minds were made up , they kowtowed to the two abbesses and then to lady wang by way of farewell
1	as both of them liked dicing because it was fast , they had got two fellows to dice with them on the kang in the outer room where a few other men were playing cards at a big table , while in the inner room a less uncouth party were in the middle of a game of dominoes
1	confucius and yang hu looked alike but had different names ; lin xiangru and sima xiangru had the same name but looked different
1	sorry , we didn ’ t know , said the women with a smile
1	i suppose we have no other choice
1	we used to have window gauze in four or five colours , i remember
1	yuanyang chuckled before giving them the old lady ’ s message
1	your highness is far−sighted , said wang mien
1	then they read her verse to the melody linjiangxian :
1	this is our private affair , gentlemen , replied lung san
1	so heedless of his people 's suffering
1	because the vulgar herd are afraid of death they tell cautionary tales about the wrath that heaven visits on fools who are not content with their lot or senselessly cut short their lives by indulging in lust or running amok , making away with themselves for no good reason
1	here ’ s your pledge , i ’ m returning it
1	then at last baoyu could withdraw
1	i hope you will write a letter of introduction for me , sir , when the time comes
1	some of my friends here admire your poetry , sir ; and one day we shall make bold to call on you
1	we won ’ t stay long ,
1	but sit down while i prepare a meal for you
1	our old lady ’ s in a bad temper
1	since the old lady liked her rough-and-ready ways and her ability to make people laugh , she gave her the nickname numskull and when she felt bored would make fun of her , letting her behave in any way she liked
1	i kill just one pig a day , and only make ten cents per pig
1	why do not you call more often ?
1	she turned to aunt xue
1	jia lian came in , clasped the corpse and wept without stop
1	as pledge i gave my belt of splendid sheen ,
1	when your mistress comes i ’ ll tell her the whole story
1	lu ascertained the date of your nephew 's birthday when you entertained him to a feast here ; and on his return home i cast both their horoscopes to see whether they could marry or not
1	you should have let one of the younger girls do this , miss , she said
1	stop talking such nonsense just after the new year
1	there ’ s a sameness about all these tales , complained the old lady
1	in desperation , pinger ran out of the room to find a knife with which to kill herself , but the serving-women and maids outside hastily stopped her and tried to dissuade her
1	is this the way an elder brother should behave ?
1	i shall never forget your great kindness , said fan chin
1	having entered the room , she told him with a smile :
1	the maid went on with a sigh , it ’ s all right to be fond of cousins , but still there ’ s a limit
1	the two of them proceeded together to the lou house
1	we ’ re sure he will do all right
1	he walked up to the officer
1	but when later she heard that xifeng was sending her to work for baoyu , she was more eager for this than baoyu himself
1	xueyan , forgetting herself , blurted out , why , then , our young lady ’ s dying for no reason !
1	baoyu at once informed the lady dowager , and a doctor was sent to examine her
1	being in her cups , she pointed at the wall separating the two brothers ’ houses and loosed off a flood of abuse
1	as they were crying out in consternation , miaoyu 's attendants arrived in search of her
1	if that 's the case , there 's something i would like to tell you ; but if she has not decided yet i dare not speak out of turn
1	after dabbling for a while he asked for a towel
1	pinger and the two others proceeded then to the lady dowager 's apartments where all the girls from the graden were assembled
1	back in his room he had barely sat down when a maid announced :
1	he spat in disgust and swore at pinger again
1	this pleased jia zhen so much that he directed that henceforward baozhu should be addressed as miss , as if she were a daughter of the house
1	what can one make out of the lawsuits here ?
1	isn ’ t this a firecracker ?
1	greatly shocked , ma hurried upstairs to see the sick man ; but he found him at his last gasp , unable to raise his head
1	a man unjust in deed who would engage ?
1	rage and disappointment had made her mad !
1	she says that just before she was born her mother dreamed that she had a length of brocade with coloured designs of the lucky swastika
1	that is why great personages have always favoured me
1	second sister ordered two dishes and made him drink a goblet of wine as he squatted by the kang while she questioned him about the jia family
1	some of his attendants and boatmen were cut down ; while the rest , to escape being put to the sword , jumped overboard and were drowned
1	such thoughtfulness in little things is good
1	i ’ ll tell you what to do
1	lai da went out to pass on this warning , and thereafter the servants were more circumspect
1	she asked if her carriage was ready
1	if he were some purse-proud , fivolous official i ’ d be dishonouring your high principles , brother , and i myself would disdain to do such a thing
1	the following day chu hsien−fu went to the hall to thank his father and mother−in−law and feasted with them
1	returning with the silver , the servant announced : master tang is here , sir
1	the central administration was made up of two main sections : the chief government offices such as the inner chancery , the six ministries , the censorate , the office of transmission , the han lin academy , the imperial college ; and offices to serve the imperial house , such as the imperial physicians ' office
1	now that you are on good terms with that mr chang , you need not be afraid of going short
1	the next day when he got up , some servants reported that the watermelons and mooncakes for the festival were ready for distribution
1	we must eat first
1	how did they get that name ?
1	what brings you to an outlying region like this ?
1	ting−hsi hastily ordered the maids to revive her with ginger water ; but when she came to she sobbed and screamed , rolled on the ground and tore her hair
1	number so once we hit on the right pawnshop , we ’ ll find whoever pawned it and then we can redeem it
1	he did in fact go out to eavesdrop and heard sheyue ask softly , how did you recover it ?
1	after paying their respects to the lady dowager , then to ha zheng and lady wang , they all gave way to weeping
1	finding each other 's company congenial , they soon became good friends
1	should heart and mind be tested too ,
1	so they loosed their kites , then dispersed , daiyu going back to her own apartments to rest
1	then i found a tumbledown temple in the fields to the northeast
1	so it seems to me a very difficult job
1	but when tu bade his boy make a search , it appeared they had only five coppers left
1	it is useless to keep it a secret , sir
1	the priest chuckled , i myself don ’ t know where we are or who i am
1	if , however , you are brilliant enough to pass the examinations , you immediately reflect credit upon your whole family
1	so , thanks to your honour 's goodness , even i came in for some praise !
1	i am going to the palace today , said chen
1	the whole : o'er the five peaks the young god wends his way
1	wang ren for his part was convinced that his sister must have sizable savings , so that even after the raid they could hardly be short of silver
1	it was her i was thinking of
1	she doesn ’ t need a foster-mother like you to muck her up !
1	with your condescension and respect for genius , you must be the best patrons nobles of the kingdoms of wei and chi in the third century bc , they both had over three thousand protégés this mr yang has ever encountered in his life ; yet he has twice avoided you , as if he were afraid of meeting you
1	before she could fathom his meaning he went on , yesterday i took an oath because of this , and today you provoke me again
1	but stranger still was the birth later of a son who came into the world with a piece of clear , brilliantly coloured jade in his mouth
1	and a worse one for deceiving me
1	don ’ t look so pleased , replied jia lian mockingly
1	xifeng was strolling along enjoying this sight when a man appeared without warning from behind an artificial rockery and accosted her with , greetings , sister-in-law !
1	do not let anyone bully him
1	when presently it was announced that all was ready she started up the hill , leaning on some maids ’ shoulders
1	how come i didn ’ t know it was given to your mistress ?
1	it ’ s all the doing of the old man of the moon
1	xiren put a hand to her mouth to hide her laughter , so amused that she could not speak
1	never , day or night , did i neglect my duties
1	when the other women saw how determined she was , they all volunteered to join her
1	as for that wretch pinger , i thought she was a good girl how could she turn out so sly ?
1	li wan proposed , as i ’ m a poor hand at versifying , let me just do the first three lines
1	true to his word , pan proposed the match to mr cheng , compared the young couple 's horoscopes and only asked kuang for twelve taels to buy trinkets and four costumes for the bride
1	that 's what you must do
1	i have met him
1	they found two chambers , smaller than the main hall but most tastefully furnished
1	i ’ ll get jia lian to write an announcement to hang up by the road baoyu took that day , offering a reward of ten thousand taels to anyone who picked up the jade and returns it , and five thousand to anyone who tells us who has it so that we can get it back
1	how can he ward off evil and exorcise devils ?
1	to the petals and there it swings
1	outside the ornamental gate pages were waiting beside a blue lacquered carriage with kingfisher-blue curtains , into which lady xing and her niece entered
1	surely there are chief stewards ’ wives to take him in ?
1	that reminds me , said lady wang
1	when jingui saw that she was not to be bullied , she tried to pick fault with her in various ways ; but being unable to find any chinks in her armour , she finally had to come to terms with her
1	what use is that ?
1	he may believe in the saying that the flowers at home aren ’ t as sweet as flowers growing wild ; but if he thinks that , he ’ s making a big mistake
1	i have long wished to make your acquaintance , sir , but lacked the opportunity , he said
1	i was nearly scared to death too last night by the other !
1	your aunt ’ s eyesight isn ’ t good ; she can help us both with our cards
1	is your worthy father a servant of the state ?
1	i was just talking about natural reactions
1	ifs cold out there
1	as soon as they ’ d gone i took a peep at it , but couldn ’ t guess what it was
1	well , if this is the wish of the gods , what must be must be
1	her name , before she married , was jia min
1	he ordered this man to put on a long white gown and a tall black paper hat , and to smear his face with lime , for this was how the local devil was supposed to look
1	show this she forced herself to get up
1	let 's raise some money between us and lend it to mr chou , so that he can go in for the examination
1	but i have to leave home for a time on business
1	then he called to the boatman : bring in his luggage
1	well , it ’ s my fault for coming
1	i want you to bring me the pouch which is by the pillow on the bed in the inner room
1	yucun turned to see flames leaping skyward and the sun blotted out by smoke and dust
1	after a moment ’ s reflection the lady dowager agreed to this
1	you know that lake at the foot of this hill and concave crystal lodge by the inlet there ?
1	so in the garden she was also called adou or fried pea
1	a roll of silk my form ; my thunderous crash
1	first thing tomorrow i shall proceed to my post , respectfully accept the seal of office , and then straightway give you fifty silver taels to spread over for several months for your club ’ s refreshments
1	the others exclaimed in delight after each line
1	the only objection is that too many poems have been written about it in the past
1	if it had been any other maid , i would have felt a few taels of silver would be enough ; but jinchuan was with me for some time and was just like a daughter to me
1	guests staying here ca not manage with one servant only to cook and shop , remarked the abbot woodenly
1	how could you write such rubbish ?
1	baoyu , taking jia lian 's hand , sobbed bitterly ; and jia lian too wailed again
1	and sure enough , when zhixiao came back and looked where he suggested , we found the thing at once
1	i never thought i ’ d be able to be there when she breathed her last
1	as he looked rather embarrassed , after sitting there for a while aunt xue got up
1	however , he did not move but burst into tears
1	this startled all five of them
1	qingwen went off with the money , slamming the portière behind her
1	i roam the primeval void
1	i ’ d be too scared to get a wink of sleep
1	very well , replied the magistrate
1	he locked his door and went with the priest to a tea−house in the old city
1	jia qin seems to be shaping well
1	this said , he took a stone from his sleeve and aimed it at baoyu 's heart
1	an old scholar at leisure
1	the two scholars were also so overwhelmed with awe that their hair was standing on end
1	presently wenxiang arrived and some pages ushered him through the inner gate
1	when the women had left to see to this , xiren went back inside to look for a plate on which to put the gifts for xiangyun ; but the plate she wanted was missing from the carved cabinet
1	it 's news to me that anyone in trouble should feel in the mood for feasts and operas
1	the magistrate put his seal on the documents , then told the runners on duty to fetch wan to the hall
1	that fellow had all his facts right , though !
1	he turned to bow to her saying , do not worry , sister-in-law
1	what an ado there would be if you had another bad relapse like that time when you lost your jade !
1	who would have thought this house would put up with them ?
1	after stealing and selling it all on the journey , you bring this trumped up charge to clear yourselves !
1	i ’ ll make it up later if your funds run out
1	with me in happy red court , we shall be close together and beautifully quiet
1	as she asked after the old lady and her aunts and cousins , she took in baoyu ’ s costume
1	lie down , she said , leaving her seat
1	flushing crimson the two boys demanded indignantly , what have you caught us at ?
1	but the sight of second sister robbed hu junrong of his senses
1	future candidates , knowing that there is an easy way to high position , will look down on real scholarship and correct behaviour
1	how is it that in all these stories , when such things happen , no one has any inkling of it except the girl herself and one trusted maid ?
1	wan and feng went ashore to stretch their legs , and watched the evening mist scatter as the moon cast its bright reflection in the water
1	i will peep through a crack , offered xiren , to see if it 's somebody we should let in
1	apparently mr niu here and your husband are both called niu pu−yi , said hsiang to mrs niu
1	i ’ d no idea what her illness was till i overheard my mother telling her mother-in-law , and the name meant nothing to me
1	some servants told her , crab-meat
1	when yen had read it he said , i understand
1	better find the other man ’ s family , was aunt xue ’ s counter-proposal
1	more likely , as the seventh month is the season for melons and fruit and every family is making an autumn sacrifice at its graves , she ’ s felt moved to sacrifice privately in her own quarters , according to the precept in the book of rites that in autumn and spring one should offer the food in season
1	my old bones are aching , she told aunt xue and aunt li
1	and she hasn ’ t eaten anything all day
1	he ’ s set his mind on inviting you to a feast
1	you can assign anyone you think fit to stay here so as to keep an eye on it
1	by changing the metre and adding a slightly awkward second line , however , i feel you have made it somewhat flat
1	he ’ s bound later on to run after women like the very devil
1	so jia lian had to move to his study in the outer compound , while xifeng and pinger joined lady wang in daily sacrifice to the goddess of smallpox
1	he found daiyu looking more pathetically frail than ever , although she insisted that her health was much better
1	the abbot was fainting with fear !
1	that ’ s not true , he remonstrated
1	yucun , though he understood barely half of this , nodded and mar-
1	jia zhen knew he was on bad terms with lady xing , who thoroughly disapproved of him and often complained about him
1	but some gentlemen of your family found out , and said i would stolen the trees
1	she asked the two women what new stories they had
1	tang san agreed to this
1	xiren ’ s only comment was , you were rather too hasty
1	lady wang ordered a feast of welcome at which jia zheng 's sons and grandsons poured him wine ; and though xifeng was the wife of a nephew , since she was running the household she joined baochai and the others in passing the wine
1	feeling reassured , baoyu went to the door and asked :
1	she would often sit moodily frowning or sighing over nothing or , for no apparent reason , would give way to tong spells of weeping
1	if a wall starts tottering , everyone gives it a shove
1	the other day she came herself to report to you
1	it would be fun to play a drinking game
1	that 's why both she and baochan are under guard there
1	yen , however , pretended not to see what he was doing
1	in wuho , however , this was the talk of the town
1	nodding she said , all right then
1	he found beiming having a game of chess with chuyao and squabbling over a move
1	with a cry of terror , his legs gave way and he fell down
1	there ’ s no time to be lost
1	chiung−chih said nothing , but alighted and walked straight into the hall , where she sat herself down
1	the colour of flowers ?
1	the next day it was after noon before jia lian arrived
1	this year is not propitious , said fan chin
1	and the next day when the lady dowager asked why her eyes were so red and swollen
1	when at last the feast ended and they prepared to leave , they suddenly discovered that xiangyun was missing
1	each time they come they reel all this off , as if offering the old lady some rare treasure
1	but he still insisted on having the money
1	what is there to say ?
1	that 's where you were wrong !
1	your best bet is to go to the big mansion
1	in swaying dance , now swift , now slow
1	i am sure you will pass high on the list this year , said mr chi , when he came to see him off
1	just then a serving-woman hurried in
1	they ’ re quite different when you compare them
1	why should a smart young man like master liu suddenly do such a foolish thing , going off with a taoist priest ?
1	this touched baoyu 's heart , yet also struck him as proof that daiyu had less consideration for him than zijuan
1	the three girls went to green lattice nunnery
1	when i was still in chiangnan your fame reached my ears , and now i have come to consult you
1	the people of wuho are blinded by profit and power when yu yu−ta had buried his parents , he told his younger brother he meant to go back to nanking to thank tu shaoching and look for a teaching post since his money was finished
1	although you ’ ve repented and mended your ways , you ’ ve already made father , son and cousins guilty of incest ; so how can providence allow you to live at peace ?
1	proceeding to xichun 's quarters the nuns asked caiping , where is your young lady ?
1	go easy , warned both the lady dowager and aunt xue
1	but i ’ ve been so engrossed in talking , a long time ’ s slipped by and i must be getting back now
1	xifeng stepped forward to whisper , miss baochai is sitting in the inner room ; so don ’ t talk foolishly
1	she turned back and went in again at once
1	i hope you will forgive me , sir , for being so remiss
1	how dare you stall , you little bastard !
1	if he goes to the examination hall , we will be the spirits of those he has wronged !
1	looking downwards , they saw a crystal stream cascading as white as snow and stone steps going down through the mist to a pool
1	as they were feasting , a servant came in with a note writen on fine sungchiang paper folded in the manner of an invitation card
1	her ladyship 's waiting for you
1	let 's go back and have a look
1	ouguan had the fantastic notion that as she used to play young men and diguan young ladies , and as they were often cast as husband and wife , although it was make-believe they should act the part every day as if they were really in love
1	he carried her to the kang , where he showered kisses on her and fumbled with her clothes , pouring out incoherent endearments
1	i asked for you in the seal shop , and learned that you had moved here
1	i am he , replied wang mien , and this is my humble house
1	that 's no way to talk
1	it ’ s not as if you were taking a bribe to let a thief escape !
1	demanded tanchun and daiyu
1	only a little fruit , what does it matter ?
1	or go and rave if you must to those petty-minded creatures who are so quick to take offence , and who know how to manage you
1	there she was indeed informed of her promotion and told to go and kowtow to lady wang , but not to trouble the lady dowager
1	then getting up slowly he ordered , none of those who came with me are to move
1	the next day ting−hsi bought more offerings and paper coins with his travelling money , and went back to his brother 's grave
1	if a mao month happened to fall in a yin year , there would be a double clash and that would undermine her strength , just as in the case of good wood if it ’ s carved too intricately
1	still playing the innocent ?
1	how many inmates has it ?
1	as the garden happened then to be ready for inspection , he had called on his son for inscriptions in order to test him
1	dusk had fallen by the time he came back , slightly tipsy , and as he lurched into his courtyard he noticed someone lying on a couch there
1	he brought a bowl of tea from the tea−house for ma , then sat down with him
1	he could have ladled out a bowl of water anywhere and wept over it to work off his feelings
1	so much the better
1	then bowls of strong tea were brought him one after another
1	i have no son
1	they ’ d invited a troupe of amateur actors , among them a certain liu xianglian who liked to play the young hero ’ s part in operas
1	he didn ’ t think you would be back so soon
1	and therefore instead of entering she turned away , wiping her tears
1	as this development looked serious and caiping feared she would be held to blame , she quietly went and reported it to madam you
1	seeing the tear-stains on her face he asked , who ’ s been offending you again , cousin ?
1	my father knew nothing about it
1	he looked round but could see no writing-brush or ink , and for fear of being disturbed he read rapidly on
1	they went inside and looked at three rooms , then came out and sat down again with the abbot to ask the price
1	he ’ s making great progress , not only in his form
1	i just feel these clothes i am wearing are not very good , not up to that peacock-feather cape the old lady gave me that year
1	it overlooked a tiny courtyard planted with several plum trees , a few twigs of which were already in blossom , since the last three or four days had been warm
1	if i tell an amusing one he ’ ll say i ’ m no good at studying , only able to gab , and blame me all the more
1	she sent a maid to see what he was doing and ask him over
1	presently their boats moored at kaoyao wharf
1	during the morning , the passenger removed a plank from the back of the cabin and caught sight of niu pu
1	i should think he might possibly be there
1	on her return to the room she found that lady wang had called and qiaojie was weeping in her arms
1	after dinner , because it was dark , madam you suggested that they send two men-servants to see qin zhong home , and maids went out with these orders
1	it ’ s only the possibility of some unforeseen expenses that makes me anxious , for then we ’ d really be in serious trouble
1	you are a married woman now , said mrs lu and the nurse
1	is he any relation of yours ?
1	these two , being in the inner court , did not have to be locked
1	for suddenly it comes and suddenly goes ,
1	wait till the lamps are lit , then ask the clerk in charge of this case to come here
1	the pleasure grounds were named the grand view garden
1	miss xichun is at home , longing to see you
1	upstairs he found pin−niang studying chess moves
1	in this hamper are the pastries you asked for
1	bending over the depth to listen ,
1	this reminded the lady dowager of something , and she ordered an old woman to take her instructions to the servants in the garden
1	why did not you receive dr yu yesterday ?
1	zhang hua on reflection thought this a good idea
1	i went up to peking last year , and this year came back to nanking
1	the board of punishments sanctioned this and after receiving the money issued an order for xue pan 's release
1	take good care of yourselves
1	he promised to look after him
1	then it will be all right
1	he is quite different from the common run , declared tu
1	haven ’ t they been kept ?
1	you should have sent them all to bed
1	do not forget , that 's all
1	nursing her grief , the old lady rose to leave the palace and go home by sedan-chair
1	after two more cups of wine the bawd was tipsy
1	to think you have been all these years in this business , but you are still so green that in a case like this you want to inform !
1	the man after his long wait was already somewhat apprehensive , and now he saw jia lian come out in a towering rage
1	not daring to refuse , the abbot took the gourd , found the old woman on the slope , and handed the gourd to her
1	that 's why i have come to talk it over with you
1	his mother hurried out to stop his mouth
1	making a casual gesture of greeting to the company , he plumped himself down in the seat of honour
1	going on to read the exegesis he saw that the original , which had been crossed out , started , now it is common for people not to be bent on study
1	why let this upset you ?
1	he was just about to go in again when a monk and a taoist priest drew near , laughing and gibbering like two maniacs
1	some looked familiar , others were combinations of various radicals and numerals
1	why are you taking my hen ?
1	one thing i ca not make out , though , is his coolness towards xiren nowadays as well
1	i ’ m ashamed to speak of it , madam
1	aware that she had given herself away , wuer blushed furiously
1	then , seated in his sedan-chair , he heard the men in front shouting angrily and asked them what had happened
1	good riddance to bad rubbish !
1	vast number pang palace ,
1	at once baoyu went to tell the lady dowager , who instructed some trustworthy men to accompany him
1	i ’ ve never asked you to amuse me either
1	wait till we have set up the club before laying down rules , said li wan
1	then she reflected that , good as baoyu was to her , there was still a certain distance between them
1	to know whether it boded well or not , read the next chapter
1	the sight stirred her , but whether with joy or with grief she did not know as she stared at them blankly
1	i couldn ’ t help laughing and told her , even if the two young ladies had bellies as big as a buddha , they couldn ’ t eat five hundred cash worth
1	he was an official in kiangsi who surrendered to prince ning , whispered wu
1	if everyone was like you and would not give us a cent , we would have to live on air
1	i have not much else , she continued
1	i had the impression that it was about the vanity of all things
1	are you leaving tomorrow ?
1	wouldn ’ t that be pleasanter for everyone ?
1	i am used to it
1	if there 's anything you want , she said , 'lust let me know
1	how lively we were in the old days in the garden !
1	though i edited a collection of essays in chiahsing this year and received several dozen taels as remuneration , i spent the whole sum on behalf of a friend
1	prince heng loved martial arts , the fair sex too…
1	shen chiung−chih is taken under arrest to yangchow after the middle of the fourth month in nanking , the chinhuai river becomes quite lovely
1	i ’ ll pay you well for it tomorrow
1	so you like wine too ?
1	however , with jia qiang mediating between them , he was forced to write another i o u for fifty taels of silver
1	when he passed our gate and saw our jiaoxing buying thread , he supposed that shiyin had moved his household here
1	mrs lin told pinger , i brought her here first thing this morning
1	why should she put herself to all that trouble ?
1	countered baoyu as soon as he saw who it was
1	if i were so fond of silver , i should not have declined it as i did
1	'' i do not suppose they are much good , they are just made to order
1	never mind that , put in chi wei−hsiao
1	we must have some sort of order
1	at this the old woman held her peace
1	very nicely reasoned , indeed !
1	i ’ m not destined for such good fortune
1	daiyu , engrossed in reading when she arrived , got up to offer her a seat
1	the drinking lasts till the moon rises over the plum trees ,
1	if you do yourself such serious harm you ’ ll fall ill do remember that
1	~the most troublesome are the old lady 's maids , said xifeng
1	a fine lot you are , cried pinger
1	that ’ s not their worst trouble , though
1	madam you made lady xing , lady wang and her mother take the places of honour , while she sat at a side table with xifeng and baoyu
1	he turned with a smile to ask her :
1	as xichun knew her ways , instead of pressing her to stay she saw her to the door
1	she took yuanyang ’ s hand to lead her out , but the girl coloured and shrank back
1	one ’ s lin daiyu her mother was the old lady ’ s daughter
1	again the others exclaimed , that fine word rampaged ’ shows skill , and the turn in the narrative is natural too
1	the ninth mr hsu told a servant to bring in a gift box containing two hundred taels and give it to mr chen
1	the child has her grandmother here , demurred lady wang
1	when she grows up to marriageable age , she ’ s bound to be sent back to the lin family
1	and she had wrapped up some peony petals in her handkerchief to serve as a pillow
1	then you can go off and amuse yourself somewhere else till you think she ’ ll have gone
1	chin tzu−fu and pao ting−hsi also conducted the musicians from the hall and the thirty−six young dancers to the two libraries at the back
1	he paced the room frantic as an ant on a hot griddle , but there was no sight or sound of anyone
1	having filled this for daiyu , she offered baoyu the green jade beaker that she normally drank from herself
1	they filled the streets , and some of them sat on the ground to beg
1	i can ’ t toast myself here all the time , replied qingwen smiling
1	at that the whole company laughed
1	i ’ m such a fool , i was so carried away by their arrival , i never thought of that
1	when he 's in a saving mood he treasures the least scrap of thread , but at other times he does not mind squandering millions
1	not too difficult , said xifeng after some thought
1	baoyu ’ s unexpected visit and the apparent intimacy between maid and master opened their eyes to the true situation , leaving them much reassured
1	by this time , moreover , brigade general miao had died in gaol , and the announcement of wan 's appointment to the patent office had arrived
1	in that case we certainly won ’ t give him a wife
1	well , if they won ’ t join in , why don ’ t the two of us write a poem together ?
1	because jia zhen was out —though he could have done nothing even if at home — jiao da was fairly letting himself go
1	i paid no attention , of course
1	your mother was lord she ’ s concubine , tanchun ’ s mother lord zheng ’ s concubine , and by rights you two should have the same status
1	i do not feel like it because my present rooms are not as light as those in the garden
1	this silenced xifeng and she giggled
1	as even she shows you special consideration , i shall have to explain this to you
1	when i tell him the real facts , he refuses to believe me
1	i ’ m certainly out of luck today , madam you laughed , finding so many of you girls in a bad temper
1	you play too well , sir , said chen
1	is this enough for a feast or theatricals ?
1	whether miaoyu lived on in shame after being kidnapped , or whether she resisted and was killed we can not venture to say , not knowing the sequel
1	soon after the chamberlain had left the imperial edict arrived and was put into force by the officers in charge , who confiscated certain things , returning the rest
1	wax candles set the sumptuous feast aglow
1	in the fields just north of our village there stands a small shrine , she said
1	the lady dowager had been waiting anxiously in the corridor outside the great hail with lady xing , lady wang , madam you , li wan , xifeng and the jia girls , as well as aunt xue
1	of it on the pole , he waved frantically
1	so he is your uncle !
1	then up came an irate matron to drag her away
1	smiling all over his face , he drew closer to whisper :
1	she just dropped in for a chat
1	asking a steward named yen from the yang family to accompany him , he went once more to the capital
1	you have lost several days over this case , said dr yu
1	this gentleman often comes to our house , he said , so there ’ s no need for all the maids to hide
1	how dare you confer the title of mistress on her
1	after they had paid their respects to the duke and greeted the other guests , everyone sat down to talk
1	baochai who had heard all this did not say a word , although inwardly she was lamenting
1	so when they met they could only express their concern in the most superficial way
1	soon she was out of sight
1	thus i despaired , my face with sad tears marred ,
1	that would simply set tongues wagging
1	yingchun ’ s subject , the abacus , is in constant commotion ; tanchun ’ s kite is something which drifts away with the wind ; xichun ’ s temple lamp is even more lonely and neglected
1	at this point zijuan came out too and stood in the doorway , and doctor wang , addressing her , continued :
1	baoyu was so absorbed by his thoughts that when daiyu flicked his eyes with her handkerchief , he gave a sudden start
1	a big fellow like him calling a boy like you father — isn ’ t that shameless ?
1	she ’ s one of those who keep watch at night at the south gate of the garden , mrs lin answered
1	what a dreadful thing -- all those monsters in the garden !
1	so madam you ordered the meal to be served at once
1	but if baoyu is really so infatuated , it ’ s going to be difficult !
1	her skirt of kingfisher-blue crepe was patterned with flowers
1	soon the feast was ready
1	and do not wait until the mourning is over to find a wife for ting−hsi—this is important
1	yet when they look around i ’ ve turned to ash
1	after all , you ’ re not an old woman or a child
1	you all make so much of him !
1	judging by this , mr wei will probably soon become a great official
1	it shows there are plenty of good ready-made scenes and images from olden days down to the present , but stupid fools can ’ t trot
1	but by autumn he was worse again and had to keep to his bed
1	they had been drinking a fair amount as they talked , and now pu mo−ching said : gentlemen , i have a problem for you
1	practically the whole north side of the street is taken up by their houses , the ning mansion on the east and the rong mansion adjoining it on the west
1	i can ’ t lay my hands on it at a moment ’ s notice
1	madam you , now in the garden , had come across xiren , baoqin and xiangyun exchanging stories and jokes with two nuns from the ksitigarbha nunnery
1	about ten miles outside the city lives a man called shih men−ching , who decided to sell his younger brother 's widow to a man called huang chiang−fu
1	just leave it to me
1	zijuan waited for him to answer , but not a word could he utter
1	wo not you have a game with mr tsou ?
1	what more is there to say ?
1	having cursed them roundly he told the chief steward lai da , bring me the roster of servants and check their names ; then write an announcement for them all to read
1	this is probably about one tael , she remarked
1	we all have mothers , do not we ?
1	we are not heavy drinkers , replied lou feng
1	in fact , because his greatgrandfather had served as a minister , his grandfather as a hanlin , and his father as a prefect , his family had acquired true distinction
1	the jade he ’ s talking about can ’ t be the right one
1	if i see such a sight i sha not have lived in vain !
1	we mustn ’ t talk to him
1	now there was word from the capital that a request for the reinstatement of former officials had been sanctioned , and he was busily pulling strings to find some opening
1	i have not been able to afford it yet
1	remember she ’ s your nephew ’ s wife
1	on all matters , indeed , they were in complete accord
1	to know what happened later , read the next chapter
1	the prince helped him up and urged him not to worry , then informed him of the terms of the new decree
1	she swept aside the portière and went out
1	i ’ ve already lost three of you , i don ’ t want to lose one more
1	well then , how can i charge you interest ?
1	no , i stayed with chang chin−chai
1	jia rong went back to tell his parents this , after which he sent for lai sheng to instruct him to prepare the two days ’ feast
1	the girl 's worry : will the bawd always beat and scold her ?
1	he passed the palace examination in the third year of cheng te , and is now magistrate of ningpo
1	so things went on for some time
1	dr yu could not help being sad
1	just leave her alone
1	what more could i do ?
1	this is why i think you deserve to be called 'precious jade
1	don ’ t scold the locust while pointing at the mulberry ’
1	after a while she came back to tell them gaily , i said there was no need to go
1	but you must not imagine i am someone who enjoys riches and rank and ca not endure poverty
1	only a good−for−nothing would let his grandfather support him
1	i myself don ’ t want a cent
1	as it is , i make six or seven silver cents a day ; and when i have eaten my fill , if i want to strum my lyre or do some writing , there 's nobody to stop me
1	kneeling to pinger she told her all that she and fangguan had done
1	as i ’ m lower in status you can lay it on even thicker !
1	but when will you be wanting us ?
1	yes , madam , he does
1	then she inquired why baoyu had not come to greet her
1	that he was flustered made him blunder along more awkwardly than ever , without looking where he was going
1	of course she must know
1	they found another man sitting with tu , and after exchanging greetings they urged the stranger to take the seat of honour
1	she called angrily , jumping with fright , then hastily mopped her face with a handkerchief
1	this has not been done before and ca not be too stereotyped
1	although the sachet had not been finished , the embroidery on it was very fine and she had put a lot of work into it , so he was annoyed to see it spoilt for no reason
1	she might have remained there in a quandary had not someone come up behind her all of a sudden and given her a shove in the back
1	the next day at dawn , the maids in the different houses lit the lamps , their mistresses washed and dressed , and the masters made ready too
1	do you know this man ?
1	one of them answered , in the shop we did hear a great hubbub outside about some taoist priest , who with just a few words persuaded a young man to go away with him
1	the lady dowager ’ s gate is closed , and the second master is in the hall looking over the things which have arrived from jinling , so you can ’ t get out that way
1	a servant had gone on ahead to announce their arrival
1	you must look after your health , madam , urged mrs wang
1	aren ’ t you ashamed talking like that ?
1	well , it has a name , but i ca not think what melody goes with it
1	that was like burying the living with the dead and showed your cousin ’ s filial piety
1	call me early tomorrow morning , he ordered his maids
1	just bring it here ; that ’ s simplest
1	you ’ d better rest now
1	what family doesn ’ t have a few tiffs and squabbles ?
1	presently jia zhen came to report that lots had been drawn before the shrine for the operas , and the first was to be the white serpent
1	if anyone had told them that a magistrate might respect a man for his character or make friends with him because he was a good scholar , the people of that county would have laughed their mouths crooked
1	this reminds me of mr liu in the reign of hung wu
1	that reminds me , when you went to see aunt xue did you broach that business ?
1	so they laughed and chatted till the plays came to an end , when the wine was taken away and rice brought in
1	my mother ’ s beating me again
1	truth will always prevail , they assured him
1	why are things so different now from in the past ?
1	kao was obviously running shao−ching down just now , said chih heng−shall
1	it ’ s still stored with us because no one has ventured to buy it
1	mr cao chuckled , they call you void , and you really are devoid of sense !
1	when baochai returned with the clothes a little later she found baoyu sitting in tears beside his mother
1	one reflection led to another until , after repeated ruminations , he wished he were some insensible , stupid object , able to escape all earthy entanglements and be free from such wretchedness despite the --
1	beat him to death !
1	i have never heard of guardian-angel pills
1	the old lady came partly to see how you are and partly because there ’ s some important business which she ’ d like to discuss with you in our place
1	he fell in love at first sight and sent to ask for her hand ; but she was already engaged to the son of the former inspector of changan
1	i wanted to save your face , retorted xifeng
1	then she slipped over to see xiren and find out whether it was true that fangguan had given wuer the rose flavoured juice
1	suspecting at first that this was another dream , he propped himself up to look at her more closely
1	what are you two plolling behind my back ?
1	as his wife was comforting him they heard shouts and blows outside , and a fierce−looking fellow burst in accusing old kuang 's elder son of taking over his pitch in the market
1	why act like this ?
1	at first he could not sleep ; but once he had calmed himself he dozed off and slept soundly all night , not waking until dawn
1	he ordered them to be invited in
1	then , realizing the impossibility of banning any reference to osmanthus , she decided to give the flower a new name ; and recalling the story of the osmanthus and the moon goddess , number she changed the name of the flower to moon-goddess flower ’ to add to her own dignity in this way
1	do not say any more about thanks
1	what is this , after all , but a bowl of milk ?
1	if you were still living , she sobbed , i should not care if a hundred others died
1	the players assented and left
1	an old taoist priest was sitting in the courtyard mending his clothes ; but he could only gesticulate in answer to her questions , because he was deaf and dumb
1	you ’ d better go outside if you want us to get up
1	little did i think we would meet today like this
1	why play such dirty tricks here ?
1	i should like some tea
1	not wanting to alarm her pinger said , she 's a little better ; since you are here , madam , please step in and see for yourself
1	no wonder you feel upset , sir
1	an image in the mirror , snow melting away
1	it was through the school , too , that you met mr xue who ’ s helped us this last year or so to the tune of seventy or eighty taels of silver at least
1	how dare you make such a row here ?
1	i didn ’ t have anything special in mind , just wanted to show how i appreciate your kindness to me , aunt , he said with a smirk
1	there were three examinations at anching
1	all the others received pouches , silver , handkerchiefs and fans
1	they should either both be set free or both bound up , as the three of them were together
1	their ladyships are in high spirits today , daiyu remarked
1	the concubine was so angry that she darted forward and slapped fangguan on both cheeks
1	so you are master zhen , immortal one !
1	just say i ’ ve smashed it
1	if you overeat you will have a stomach-ache
1	i will go inside to see her
1	magistrate tung immediately asked to be excused and went to the office to draw lots
1	baoyu had never been a good student , and now as he entertained such perverse ideas how could he produce any good poems or essays ?
1	i put it away , she said
1	xing dequan although lady xing ’ s brother had totally different interests , being a credulous fool who spent money like water and found all his pleasure in drinking , gambling and debauchery
1	they don ’ t understand that some things aren ’ t allowed
1	a stem bearing one flower is the lan orchid , and a stem bearing several flowers is the hui orchid , xiangling told them
1	then for about a tael of silver he pawned the new silk gown he had made for his visit to the yamen , and decided to look up chi wei−hsiao before doing anything else
1	she wept and stormed while pinger and xiren restrained her and tried to calm her
1	when she struck him then sighed and wept without a word , he too was reduced to tears
1	you can fetch it first thing tomorrow
1	as regards ability and craftiness , she took after xifeng
1	bring him that peacock-feather cape taken out yesterday , the old lady ordered yuanyang
1	master bao wants to give his jade back to the monk
1	jia yun went into the study and took a seat
1	but , rich as he was , he was timid
1	the other eight approved of this idea
1	let me have a look
1	lady wang and the other womenfolk had assembled in the hall of glorious felicity to meet him , but first he went to the old lady 's apartments to pay her his respects and report to her all that had happened since his departure
1	lin zhixiao is outside with something to report , sir
1	come on now , lung san !
1	fan chin kowtowed again in thanks , then stood to one side of the road as the examiner 's chair was carried swiftly off
1	now what had kept xifeng away ?
1	that won ’ t do , mother
1	and now that i ’ m serving you , miss baochai has even less to do with me
1	said lung san , rising
1	thereupon they started addressing her as the young mistress , and none of the household objected
1	but i fear from the ghost in the parents ' sign that your father 's health may be affected too
1	yon must rest properly , not let your thoughts wander
1	xue pan picked up his cup and tossed it off
1	it 's all very well for these big things to have yin and yang , but what about mosquitoes , fleas and midges ?
1	asked by invitation , you do not
1	are you out of your mind again ?
1	is your business good in nanking ?
1	it is only a temporary blockage , however , less serious than the other types
1	the obituary tablet and notice were inscribed : obsequies of lady qin , spouse of the house of ha , granted a rank by imperial decree off the celestial court
1	since your relative became the village head , said mr hsun to shen hsiang−fu , he 's been in luck
1	then she turned to calm baoyu
1	instead of answering he asked , where is the wrapper ?
1	i ’ ve had such a fright , she cried laughing
1	over fresh tea let us talk on and on
1	we can study together , but we may not be travelling the same road , ' he thought
1	did you see sister xiren ?
1	as soon as the servant had left , a native of soochow who was a brewer here sent a messenger to invite them both to his brewery for a bath
1	the old lady 's grief set the three of them crying too
1	then ma carefully selected a few volumes of essays from his bookcase and wrapped them up with the clothes
1	there remained only two maids eager to please baoyu
1	while she was still speaking her cousin ’ s wife lifted the portiere and burst in , smirking
1	but apparently it was no use my hoping for that
1	the idea expressed in this poem is the commonplace one that in human life riches , rank , success and fame are external things
1	baoyu used to be so devoted to our young lady , why doesn ’ t he come out ?
1	is not such a person a toady ?
1	you ' ve been with your godfather for several days and must have got pots of money from the rong mansion
1	but disregarding appearances , she set her whole heart on enticing xue ke , to carry out baochan 's plan
1	but to know what happened next , you must read the following chapter
1	they ’ re all girls , aren ’ t they ?
1	he was longing , too , for news of zhineng
1	did you hear master bao talk with someone in his sleep ?
1	there was no end to their noisy talk and laughter
1	they have some sense , these country folk , eh ?
1	the plaintiff has requested that yang be compelled to pay up ; but since he is a salaried licentiate we can not proceed , and he must be deprived of his rank before he can be condemned
1	seeing that she was toying with the handkerchief to which her pouch was fastened , he felt his waist as if groping for his own pouch
1	buried in snow the broken golden hairpin
1	when you have chosen a good day you can come and tell the old lady and elder mistress , then take her over and be done with it
1	they went back together to wenshang county , where chou chin paid his respects to the magistrate and the local examiner , and officials sent in their cards and called to congratulate him
1	a few days after this , kuang chao−jen went to the city to thank magistrate li , who now treated him as an equal , entertained him to a meal and offered to be his patron
1	the greybeard grabbing for a cake is mocked
1	on her return to her own quarters , she called in xiren to interrogate her
1	you got that from the line write on plantain leaves and green is the writing
1	a short one too
1	leaving jia qiong , jia cen , jia lin and jia qiang to keep the guests company , jia zhen sent to invite someone from the department of astrology to choose auspicious days
1	the way was long , and wrapped in gloom did seem ,
1	as hsun mei was leaving the examination school , he saw mei chiu standing by the door and could not resist asking : when did you study with vice−president chou , mr mei ?
1	that ’ s easily checked on , said pinger
1	the pleasure−goers buy water−rat fireworks too , which project from the water and look like pear trees in blossom when let off
1	since fourth brother feng has come , let 's stop riding and go to my rooms for a drink , suggested chin
1	they were offered seats and pinger handed round tea
1	as the coffin had been prepared many years ago , and kept ever since in the temple , the funeral was easily managed
1	after this she went on to write down the following lines composed by herself and others :
1	even if one of them asked for her , the old lady would never let her go
1	but i did not have enough money , so i asked a go−between to borrow twenty taels of silver for me from senior licentiate yen at three per cent monthly interest
1	never mind who they are , stormed baoyu tearfully
1	these four will take charge of the dinner-sets and wine vessels , and likewise make good any loss
1	you ’ re talking nonsense too , child
1	you must help me , brother !
1	how old are you ?
1	you ’ re right , nanny , agreed baoyu again
1	why should she be so cocky ?
1	jia huan stood in even greater awe of xifeng than of lady wang
1	they also played a game of chess and read some passages from a book together before xiangling took her leave
1	baochai pointed a finger at her
1	it ’ s snowing outside , sir , and the first watch has sounded
1	where have they gone ?
1	go out through the back gate and invite dr chang over , he ordered
1	while saying this baochai had been examining the work in xiren 's hand
1	what an impressive order !
1	for birthdays in the past we ’ ve always sent our presents separately , which is stereotyped and rather formal
1	baochai had answered gravely , you shouldn ’ t ask me that , mother
1	put it away , said daiyu , then talked a little longer with xiren until the latter left
1	there ’ s something shifty about young master yun , observed xiren
1	with a cry of dismay , he ran to the door and saw that the village was on fire
1	controlling his impatience he slowly withdrew
1	tu shao−ching went to the inner chambers to ask his wife if she knew anything about this wine , but she did not
1	i didn ’ t get it too clear , madam
1	i thought it was the runner from the yamen
1	this was reported to the emperor , and imperial physicians were summoned
1	they have neither learned a trade nor studied ; they just live on the old man
1	remember what yen tze wrote , wei−hsiao , said tu
1	did not i tell you the other day that there were signs of good fortune on your face , and a high official would soon come into your life ?
1	she threw down the scissors to brush away her tears
1	now all these kites were airborne except baoyu ’ s beauty , making him so frantic that sweat poured down his face
1	our mistress doesn ’ t use cosmetics , so please make do with these of mine if you don ’ t think them dirty , madam , she said with a smile
1	our poor clan is such a large one that after all these years we have relatives everywhere
1	when the book is published , sir , he said , i shall let you have fifty copies
1	and finding her in a good mood she reported :
1	the scholars wu tsu−hsiang the long and glorious tradition of classical realist literature in china was carried forward in the middle of the eighteenth century by two outstanding novelists — tsao hsueh− chin , author of the dream of the red chamber , and wu ching−tzu , author of the scholars
1	he bowed to tu and sat down
1	so i tricked him into giving me his casket which is downstairs now in the shop
1	this is not half so much fun
1	that ’ s splendid , said baoyu
1	how dare you , mingyan !
1	before the porch hung a placard gilded with the nine-dragon design , and the inscription stars shine on the assistant , which had been written by the late emperor himself
1	xiangyun , who noticed him slip away , supposed that he was sulking because he had tossed less successfully than the rest
1	they had never seen such goings-on before and were too frightened to speak
1	leaving the market , they walked down the main road for over a mile until they met a woodcutter carrying faggots
1	that is why confucius said : amake few false statements and do little you may regret , then all will be well
1	who ever heard of gentlemen waiting to go with the ladies ?
1	you ’ re badly off , i know that perfectly well ; so why should you spend money on me for nothing ?
1	'what are you doing here ?
1	by now jia dairu had arrived with jia daixiu , jia chi , jia xiao , jia dun , jia she , jia zheng , jia cong , jia bin , jia heng , jia guang , jia chen , jia qiong , jia lin , jia qiang , jia chang , jia ling , jia yun , jia qin , jia zhen , jia ping , jia zao , jia heng , jia fen , jia fang , jia lan , jia jun and jia zhi
1	and where ’ s that bald-headed , crotchety abbess of yours ?
1	he too was a native of jinling of noble ancestry and related to the ha family , with whom he had been on close terms
1	i came to this house as the bride of a great-grandson , and now i have great-granddaughters-in-law myself
1	these three things are all presents from the prince of beijing
1	when will you let me hear you ?
1	i was dead to all around me
1	today i went to the yamen to find out what cousin pan 's sentence is , and i heard that two censors have accused cousin zhen of corrupting young nobles by getting them to gamble that is not so serious
1	presently a white−bearded old man strolled over with his hands behind his back to watch the game
1	he heard the guards outside shouting
1	some of the big families here have sent to discuss it , prefect chu told them
1	having glanced through these , tu shen−ching set them aside
1	i know , replied miaoyu smiling
1	at sight of him she glared
1	why should the silly child keep changing ?
1	here i am back safe and sound !
1	on either pillar was this couplet :
1	pu−yi is my unworthy name
1	i find climbing mountains or visiting lakes too strenuous
1	he was wearing a ragged head−cloth , a tattered gown , and shoes with the soles flapping loose
1	knows how many generations or aeons , sure enough he found mourning-the-red studio , where mr cao xueqin was reading an ancient history
1	since the actresses have moved into the garden , they ’ ve been living separately , but they ’ re still just as greedy
1	now i ’ ve got this bad name for nothing and i ’ m dying
1	sounds like miss baochai , said sheyue
1	your highnesses will have to ask my nephew jia lian
1	she kept passing his room , coughing deliberately ; and though well aware that he was inside , she would make a point of asking who was there
1	when the stewards had received the old nurses ’ instructions , acting as grooms they helped baoyu to mount slowly into the saddle
1	since the emperor knows him , he is sure to come first on the list
1	that'numberl help you to manage your own affairs in future and make some friends
1	that must be baochan or jingui , he thought
1	did you hear that ?
1	why do it here , attracting attention ?
1	we do not need gold or silver , just an ordinary dinner service
1	since aunt xue had enlisted jia zheng 's help and he had appealed to the magistrate , if the court was asked to punish these officials he might find himself involved
1	the mossy stones may be slippery , warned lady wang
1	the lady dowager saw from his robes of the sixth official rank that this was one of the imperial physicians
1	do not show her yet , said li wan
1	the last couple of days i ’ ve been thinking of sending for her , answered lady wang
1	that day , however , while the girls were waiting upon the old lady and lady wang at breakfast , a letter arrived from jia zheng
1	your excellency must have had a tiring journey
1	xifeng ’ s eyes smarted again at this
1	the seats at this were unoccupied , however , as they were waiting on the tables of the lady dowager and lady wang
1	the girl , frightened out of her wits , burst into tears and knocked her head on the ground as she begged for mercy
1	the first page had a painting of two withered trees on which hung a jade belt , while at the foot of a snowdrift lay a broken golden hairpin
1	you saw how wretched yingchun looked yesterday , and heard all that she said
1	in silence then she turned to trim the lamp
1	i have never been through such a scene before
1	so i may as well call in all those loans
1	that was kind of her
1	this doctor must have second sight : there ’ s no need for us to tell him anything
1	if this were false it could only fool one or two people
1	you forgot to ask me ; it 's i who should fine you people , said xiangyun laughingly
1	small bridges spanned the brooks
1	of course a few other relatives attended , but since you did not go you did not know that
1	the magistrate was thoroughly frightened
1	sobbing bitterly , she seemed through her tears to see the lady dowager standing before her
1	did you think i ’ d send you on this errand ?
1	sheyue , who had been thinking of suicide , was equally relieved by his recovery
1	if he finds rose petals cloying , take him these
1	you mustn ’ t mind me butting in , son-in-law , she said
1	she ’ s a sponger who sucks up to people and goes down on her knees to madam lian for things to pawn
1	lai da ’ s mother rose to her feet in mock indignation
1	we carried her back just now in a dead faint , but presently she came to and cried a little
1	then we can devise an efficacious prescription and submit it to the discretion of his lordship
1	pin−niang gave a peal of laughter
1	if you do , i ’ ll really respect you
1	baoyu was now wearing only a green satin jacket above a pair of blood-red trousers , and qiuwen noticing that these were trousers which qingwen had made for him heaved a sigh
1	in the afternoon dr yu arrived , to be ushered in by chuang , chih , ma and tu
1	have you paid your duty calls ?
1	but who is it that loves them ?
1	you were quite right
1	are you the mr chi who judged the operatic contest ?
1	we can ’ t milk you like this
1	most of the garden ’ s inmates were innocent , ingenuous girls who laughed and romped all day long without any inhibitions , quite unaware of his feelings
1	this is clearly a case of enervation caused by too little water and too much wood
1	next time you get an invitation , miss , i hope you will take me along
1	bashfully , at the word of command , i take up my pen ;
1	but it ’ s so seldom i get a free day , why shouldn ’ t i have some fun ?
1	do have a look
1	she must be having a hard time of it with her mistress such a martinet , a worse terror even than her
1	tired out after their recent exertions , they went to bed unusually early and after an uneventful night returned to the court at dawn
1	at any rate i would take it kindly of you
1	among the townsfolk , however , some outstanding figures emerged
1	qin zhong objected that she would be too busy to welcome visitors and might think them a nuisance
1	the next day , accordingly , wang hui sent men to move hsun mei 's luggage to his house in sticky rice lane , and they stayed together
1	i was offered the post of instructor when i was growing old ; but since it involved making reports to the superintendent and humbling myself to him i felt it would be too much for my self−respect , and excused myself on grounds of ill health
1	daiyu realized then that she was indeed rather tired , and after some hesitation she walked slowly back to bamboo lodge on her maid 's arm
1	the next day when jia lan went to offer his thanks at court , he learned that zhen baoyu had also passed and so they ranked as classmatesyoung zhen , told of baoyu 's mysterious disappearance , expressed his sympathy
1	i beg your honour to decide between us !
1	a lovely young lady like you , from such a fine family too , is bound to make a good match and enjoy a life of luxury and splendour
1	do not mention it any more
1	i never said i ’ d stay out here all day
1	back in the hall , intendant hsiang asked : when is your father to be buried ?
1	just before virgin 's pool a storm sprang up , and tang shih ordered the boat to moor at once
1	admiration at the fine landscapes , trees and figures carved on them , as well as the seals and inscriptions
1	this means that the author 's own views must accord with objective reality
1	xifeng was tempted to tell him about the job of supervising tree-planting which they had in mind for him , but was afraid he might take it the wrong way and imagine she was offering it in return for a few aromatics
1	low vermilion railings beyond the bamboo grove surrounded a bed of peonies still in bud
1	without stopping for an explanation , he ordered his two men to strip niu pu of all his clothes , even his cap , shoes and socks
1	so she handed them a length of silk and two small gold medallions inscribed with the wish that the owner would win first place in the palace examination
1	i ca not help worrying , because the elder mistress lets things slide and the master 's afraid of being ostentatious
1	the old lady and lady wang were delighted with this explanation
1	he then left to tell the servants to make preparations
1	though it can not speak
1	and now qinger told zhang hua , as you were engaged to the girl first , if you demand her the court will have to give her to you
1	baochai ignored him , secretly telling xiren to give him a sedative and talk him round little by little
1	the zhens are different from other families , observed the lady dowager
1	don ’ t mix them up !
1	the lady dowager chuckled
1	madam you asked lady xing and lady wang , would you prefer to eat here or in the garden ?
1	so she was so lovely and chaste , he reflected , torn by remorse
1	i have thought of another
1	she received this message with a smile and the comment :
1	this path will take you there
1	she searched the whole room , but there was no trace of it
1	her tutor was paid as highly as if he were teaching a boy , and he supervised her studies just as strictly
1	sixth master sat down on a bench , pulling both girls with him — one on each side
1	it to requite debts of breeze and moonlight
1	so i knew that though qingwen ’ s gone her name would still be on your lips
1	as their host could not prevail on him to stay , baoyu had no choice but to go back with him
1	she told a maid to burn incense and sat quietly for a while , then looked up the treatises on draughts by kong rong , number wang jixin and others
1	you are his favourite ; see if you ca not talk him round
1	did you ask where he lives ?
1	asked tanchun with a smile
1	weeping and choking , her face streaked with tears and sweat , she looked most fearfully frail
1	when baoyu entered the lady dowager ’ s room , he was relieved to find her playing cards there with his mother as if nothing were amiss
1	in the next year or two i expect to pass the palace examination , and after that , of course , i will need a lot of money ; so for the time being i must hold on to what i have
1	but why should that be ?
1	passing through the gate , baoyu observed that all the maids and matrons in the court were beaming
1	so unseasonable blossom must be an evil omen
1	li wan and tanchun rose early to attend her until she left , then went back to the hail
1	well , take that couplet in the poem on the northern borderland :
1	in gauze cap and official gown , he was wearing flowers and had red silk over his shoulders
1	what 's all this crying during the festival ?
1	as it will soon be growing dark , he told us to come home first
1	jia qin picked it up and read it
1	i was fortunate , said mei chiu
1	then having given the monk five cents for incense , he made his servant carry all the left−overs back to the city
1	overjoyed , he immediately heated six or seven pots more , obtaining from them six or seven more ingots
1	she was rather vexed herself too because the game was so dull
1	xifeng , before she even started to speak , gesticulated with both hands and doubled up with laughter
1	the next day i called at the yamen , and although his honour had just returned from the county school and had a great deal of business to attend to , he immediately set it all aside and invited me in
1	let 's wait a little , answered yu with a smile
1	after zhang cai ’ s wife had finished her business and returned the tally , the other was sent with it to get wall-paper
1	she was wondering whether or not to go back when the sound of talk and laughter inside -- she distinguished the voices of baoyu and baochai -- upset her even more
1	lady wang told xifeng to take all the gifts to the old lady for her inspection , and to get xiren to let baoyu know as well
1	just look at this household !
1	we ’ ve more important things to see to
1	distraught by this news siqi thought , even if there ’ s a scandal we ought to die together
1	put in baochai quickly
1	jia zhen now disposed of this rent in kind as follows : part was kept for the ancestral sacrifice ; part delivered by jia rong to the other mansion ; part kept for family use ; and the rest divided into different shares and placed on the terrace of the main hail , where the younger men of the clan were summoned to collect them
1	he begged on his knees
1	what really matters , the messenger can tell you
1	four smart attendants in silk and brocade , each wearing new shoes , served tea punctiliously ; and when their master bade them prepare a meal , they assented together before they left the room
1	at this there was general laughter
1	she was meaning to visit the girls when xichun sent a maid to invite her over
1	at this point xifeng came in and paid her respects to both her seniors in turn
1	is there anyone in the county who does not know him ?
1	are you dressed like a gentleman of means with a responsible post ?
1	just work it out for yourself !
1	she then turned to jia rong and said , take uncle bao to rejoin the others while i stay here a little longer
1	this sounded to baoyu like a reflection on him
1	no , that won ’ t do
1	this is not a regular sacrifice , she said
1	what a thing to say !
1	we can always come and ask for more when it 's finished
1	pity this child of a wealthy noble house
1	you do not take medicine at random like that
1	xifeng tossed it off
1	you should be pleased by his appointment instead of worrying like this
1	four or five days later kuang ta came home early , bringing a pot of wine and a chicken which he ordered his wife to boil to welcome his brother home
1	cousin xifeng really is growing rather thoughtless
1	whatever he 's like , he 's your brother-in-law , she said
1	if she doesn ’ t know any better , you should have told her
1	an old man like you need not stand upon ceremony , they said
1	and now baoyu walked over to make her a deep bow
1	after more curses he swaggered to his sedan−chair , followed by the servants and luggage
1	all we ’ ve heard is that my brother has been arrested by the county yamen for killing a man outside
1	when they had reached chao 's house and sat down in the hall , feng asked chao to unfasten the chains on wan 's neck
1	xiaoyan and sier , who had been awaiting this order , immediately called for the gate to be unlocked and went off to the different apartments
1	just then someone in the yard started bellowing , i have always said those nuns , bawds , go-betweens and the like are no good !
1	does not he want the money then ?
1	let me send to aunt xue for some , proposed lady wang
1	we have so many people here , if we don ’ t make an example of one of them the bigger offenders will get quite out of hand
1	she went dejectedly back to her room and lay down to think it oven
1	people said he had no manners and should know better ; but later didn ’ t he tell us in confidence , you know , sisters , it ’ s not that i had no sense of respect , but those monks are so dirty i was afraid you ’ d find their stench overpowering
1	it was thoughtful of you to send over to ask how she was the other day
1	the two of them went together then to the lady dowager ’ s quarters
1	why stir up more trouble ?
1	still , it 's natural , you know , for her to see things rather differently
1	from it alighted an old man in a square cap , white gauze gown and red silk slippers , who had the red nose of a heavy drinker , and a long , silky , silvery beard
1	i forgot just now to suggest that you should make up some riddles in his presence
1	i heard some talk of that , put in chih , but never knew the details
1	xiren and the others told him to go out to meet them and pay his respects , for though deranged he could still get about as usual
1	ducks in red rue studio foretells the future
1	ni is looking for his sixth brother
1	as she tossed and turned someone called softly through the window :
1	this done , he took a seat in the temple annex and called jia zhen and jia lian in to ask about family affairs
1	in all the different young masters ’ and mistresses ’ households , which nurse or nanny doesn ’ t get certain perks
1	after the death of the duke of rongguo , his elder son jia daishan succeeded to the title and married a daughter of marquis shi of jinling , by whom he had two sons , jia she and jia zheng
1	her chance came at noon one day when aunt xue , baochai and daiyu were eating water-melons in lady wang 's apartments
1	instead she told fenger who was standing near by to take word of this at once to their lady ships
1	if there would been a scandal , not only would he be dismissed -- our ancestors might even be deprived of their titles !
1	you have thought it all out !
1	she seems to fit this description of qingwen ,
1	two rugs were spread at the foot of the slope under the fragrant osmanthus trees for the serving-women and the younger maids , who were urged to eat and drink as much as they liked and not to come unless called
1	how can men commit a murder and go scot-free ?
1	i was just going to tell you something , said the old lady
1	though she did not say so outright , her attitude was so clear that her parents could not accept the offer for her
1	would you like to meet him ?
1	baoyu pressed them to stay , but mrs lin had already led her party off to finish making their rounds
1	my mother has been dead now for more than three years
1	so many inlaws and nurses chipping in for your birthday , yet you ’ re still not satisfied
1	he asked pointing inside
1	the old lady nodded
1	and if this experiment fails , we can think of something else
1	yinger hastily reported this to her mother
1	he examined it and it was certainly solid
1	i was serving at the bar
1	presently jia zheng returned , as he still had misgivings about the old lady
1	so saying , she too stepped forward without thinking and reached out her hand to wipe his perspiring face
1	braving the cold it blossoms for the east wind
1	if it ’ s an immortal ’ s gate , that won ’ t be easy to enter !
1	well , whispered pinger
1	squat down there until we come back and don ’ t make a sound
1	thinking it wisest to make herself scarce , she told hupo :
1	so that ’ s who he is !
1	we came to congratulate the old gentleman on his birthday , remarked lady xing and lady wang
1	he diagnosed baoyu ’ s upset as a slight one , a mild case of indigestion and a chill which sweating would put right
1	then a lucky day was chosen for the new tutor to take up his duties
1	if you think it good , you must drink another cup , madam
1	a few days ago a son was born to mr hu , explained the abbess
1	well , she lives in bamboo lodge and she 's always crying
1	i have long heard of your fame
1	baoyu had skipped through these , noting here and there a well-written paragraph or argument or certain digressions , amusing anecdotes or poignant sentiments
1	it goes without saying they ’ ll appear rather delicate
1	i shall report this to the mistresses , so look out for a thrashing !
1	true understanding need not be sought far away
1	when did he pass away ?
1	as these messengers left baochai exclaimed joyfully , can it be our xue ke and his sister ?
1	the medicine was brought and decocted , and xiren drank it
1	yet silver and gold they prize
1	mrs zhou demurred , the other day she scolded wang shanbao ’ s wife and boxed her ears for being too officious
1	when they looked at my arm , it was not even bruised
1	so you ’ d better not go in
1	very well then , he said to baoyu , smiling
1	all you understand is eating , drinking and whoring
1	when jia zhen and all the young men had dined , the party broke up ; and there is no need to describe the entertainment they offered all their kinsmen the next day
1	no , when the first emperor ascended the throne , he merely relied on the geomancers to choose an auspicious burial ground for his line
1	huan answered , the tutor has some business today , so he ’ s given us one day ’ s holiday
1	i gave my age as thirty
1	however , two doses of medicine failed to cure her - she raved more wildly than ever
1	one of them replied , i have long known of your brother lord she 's unseemly conduct , and master zhen of that mansion was even more profligate
1	whispered zijuan , her tears falling like rain
1	i need money right away
1	when she was five or six he had engaged a tutor to teach her the four books and the five classics , so that by the time she was twelve she could expound the classics and read essays , having thoroughly mastered the works of wang shou−hsi
1	i ’ m just feeling slightly better ; i don ’ t want to lose my temper
1	because even if someone promised to take a message , he might not deliver it
1	why are you sighing ?
1	this reference to cakes is a classical allusion
1	of course he was delighted to be sent for
1	he steeped a bowl of rice in hot tea , added some diced pheasant and hastily swallowed this down
1	after he had collected the other passengers ' fares they set out , and soon the boat reached swallow cliff
1	some pages were going to fetch them when huan stepped forward and caught hold of his father 's gown , then fell on his knees
1	would she make up something against you ?
1	thanks to the generosity of your masters above as well as your parents below , you were able to study like a young gentleman , cossetted by maids and nurses as if you were a phoenix
1	think i was freezing to death here ?
1	let those carts in at once !
1	yellow in the face with a red beard , dressed in green
1	pointing at two dishes in a hamper yuanyang remarked :
1	whenever this geomancer found a site , the others who checked on it would prove it was no good
1	in the absence of news of miaoyu he kept brooding
1	swaying a little , baoyu called over his shoulder , she has a better time of it than our old lady
1	what are the symponis of this illness of yours , miss ?
1	i am an ignorant villager , said wang mien , and did not recognize your highness
1	he 's often used them
1	limp and out of breath , his heart misgave him
1	after sprinting a dozen miles without taking breath , he put the old man down
1	in regulated verse ’ it ’ s just a matter of opening , developing , changing and concluding ; and the developing and changing couplets in the middle should be antithetical
1	oh well , each one 's romance is fated by heaven
1	the tender youth had never seen bastinadoes before ; so , frightened out of his wits , he said whatever the magistrate wanted to hear , not daring to contradict him
1	i am keeping watch over this fairy plant , and no mortals are allowed to loiter here
1	did you hear of the death of concubine zhao whom you met here ?
1	i have never fed anyone
1	his learning is profound
1	the others commented with a smile , this is really in a tragic vein
1	you won ’ t like what i ’ m going to say , but your father isn ’ t strict enough with you , and the old lady always shields you
1	the illusory land of great void is the blessed land of truth
1	once you get into that habit you ’ ll never cure yourself of it
1	that 's why i came
1	it isn ’ t all that important
1	and melilotus leaves i took to stem
1	when people called her 'concubine ' she swore at them and insisted on being called amadam
1	but because he was too honest , sir , nobody liked him and he offended some people
1	xue pan , hearing this , gradually got over his rage
1	try to remember , or just go and ask them
1	you have to wait for the snow to melt in spring and run down the mountain before men and beasts can find water
1	and we don ’ t know yet how to raise two hundred to redeem it
1	what i told you that day was what i heard from hongyu
1	after an exchange of amenities lady wang sent to invite zhen baoyu in too , having heard that he was the image of he~ baoyu
1	your cousin daiyu , on the other hand , was narrow-minded and hyper-sensitive ; that 's why she did not live long
1	xiaohong , in fact , had been quite taken in
1	now , fourth brother , said chin when they rose from the table , you must show us what you can do
1	then you haven ’ t heard of the beating lord she gave master lian ?
1	is it serious , nanny ?
1	then he added , what a pity you ’ ve dirtied your new clothes too
1	you won ’ t catch cold , and sitting quietly by yourself you won ’ t be distracted either
1	having greeted xifeng in her usual teasing fashion , madam you led baoyu to a seat in the drawing room
1	the two sisters put down their sewing at this to chase him playfully and pummel him
1	the next day he packed up and crossed the yangtse
1	what do you think ?
1	and as she took a seat , tanchun and baoqin got up and asked to be excused
1	yuanyang saw that this was done , then asked the matrons whether the boxes of titbits to go with the wine were ready yet or not
1	hurry up and plead with her !
1	we would know it , but that 's no proof in a court of law
1	you can kill him or slice him to pieces just as you please !
1	back in his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed
1	his host saw him out
1	he felt even more touched
1	wouldn ’ t that be the smart thing to do ?
1	and there are two more jars of lichees which miss baochai wants sent to master bao
1	just let it be
1	she could be seen in the distance wearing a big cape with a grey squirrel-fur hood , seated in a small bamboo sedan-chair sheltered by a black silk umbrella , and surrounded by her maids , each holding an umbrella
1	then the auspicious hour arrived and they went in two sedan−chairs , preceded by lanterns , to the bride 's home
1	you may think eggs are easily come by , knowing nothing about conditions outside in the market
1	they exclaimed in surprise
1	his father and mother sat facing each other on the kang talking , while on a row of chairs below sat yingchun , tanchun , xichun and jia huan , all of whom except yingchun rose to their feet at his entrance
1	to tell the truth , i ’ m clumsy
1	its back door overlooked the river
1	unless a man could write paku essays , he was not considered a scholar
1	then xifeng called for clean bowls and chose dishes for baoyu
1	jia rong agreed at once to pass on this message
1	what does it matter ?
1	if you fell into his clutches then , that would be worse
1	it ’ s not me they ’ re thinking of , laughed his father
1	a thousand woodland birds begin to stir ,
1	if there would been just one worth keeping , i would have someone to help me now
1	before long the doctor arrived and felt her pulses
1	i heard you were ill , said mrs lin
1	seeing fangguan blowing on the soup , she hurried in
1	why are you so angry ?
1	we had better go back to yicheng and prepare for a long journey
1	jia rong , being young and not involved , is to be released
1	xifeng took the jade from the old lady and went in with xiren to show it to baoyu , who had just woken from a nap
1	he was the one wearing the jade , so he ’ s the one you should ask instead of me
1	scholars should base their careers on success in the examinations
1	when did you get here , mother ?
1	i am only afraid after he 's joined the government and become chief examiner , he will miss genuine talent when he marks the candidates ' papers
1	on it was inscribed in large characters happy land of
1	i am afraid my relatives may object , said mr
1	that would never do
1	but it 's true , put in lady wang
1	their family may be transferred to the capital
1	but this small room is even better furnished than that big one , with all these fine things -- whatever they are called -- in it
1	i can use my own discretion in other matters , she replied , but i can ’ t obey you in this
1	when he had prostrated himself and burnt a magic formula to invoke the oracle , he asked wang hui and hsun mei to support the brush
1	those two are all right , rejoined sheyue
1	xue ke gave a start
1	yes , said yen ta−yu
1	yet now she will wear furs and be a fine lady
1	as the maids had gone to fetch tea and there was no one else present , jia lian kept darting smiling glances at second sister , who lowered her head to hide a smile but did not respond , and he dared not make any further advances
1	xifeng smiled at this blunt way of talking
1	then she urged second sister to put on her jewels and they went out hand in hand to mount the carriage , in which they sat side by side
1	zhen to share out her belongings
1	asked the lady dowager anxiously
1	the old woman was hard of hearing
1	then along came brother liu in the nick of time to drive the brigands away , rescue our goods and save our lives into the bargain
1	so if i were you i ’ d appeal to madam lian
1	then in her concern she burned out and made lai wang 's wife summon all the serving-women to assign them different tasks
1	baoyu , by nature restless , hankered after a stroll in the garden
1	pieh and feng were so terrified that their feet seemed nailed to the ground
1	buy a few cakes first , and i will tell you when i have eaten
1	but there is a masculine beauty too , which is seldom recognized
1	on the evening of the third day an oil lamp was lit on his table , and the room was crowded with relatives
1	so you can see all that happens to us is predestined , and it 's no use worrying
1	going in sheepishly , he fell on his knees before the lady dowager
1	so your mistress is allowed to cheat , but i ’ m not allowed to bribe you , teased madam you
1	to revert now to baoyu
1	yes , after all , it ’ s the old who are the most experienced , observed xifeng
1	everyone praises your aunt xifeng , he said , but to my mind she can ’ t stand comparison with your second aunt
1	it ’ s easy for you to jabber away on the kang , gouer retorted
1	i am only a slave , though , so what can i say ?
1	don ’ t be afraid ; i ’ ll protect you , he promised her
1	let ’ s all fish to try our luck , proposed baoyu
1	you mustn ’ t spend any more on me , protested granny liu
1	bailiff wu of the manor in black mountain village has arrived , sir , he reported
1	aren ’ t you afraid of catching cold ?
1	baochai drew her fan from her sleeve and ran after them over the grass
1	he ’ s come here several times to ask for it back , and when he fails to get it he points at me and scolds , don ’ t put on those ladified airs with me !
1	since all your maids ’ things are here , there ’ s no need to search , replied xifeng with a smile
1	as soon as he saw the memorial he asked what official post ha jing had held , and the board of ceremony reported that he had been a palace graduate , whose ancestor ’ s noble title had passed on to his son jia zhen
1	once they knew they had been tricked , they darted wildly out
1	i want to go to take the prefectural examination
1	so for a fortnight daiyu ate daily less , till her appetite had so diminished that she could not even swallow a mouthful of congee
1	fangguan ’ s too fussy , said qingwen
1	li wan was on the point of explaining , but madam you stopped her
1	she , however , now went to madam you ’ s sitting-room , the floor of which was covered with a red carpet where stood a large gilded cloisonne brazier , its three legs in the form of elephant trunks
1	i hear you are from the yangtse valley , sir , said hsiao
1	lai wang ’ s wife relies on her mistress ’ power
1	just then xifeng came in to pay her respects , and lady wang wanted a detailed account of the party -- -the other guests , the operas and the feast
1	what are you afraid of ?
1	i longed to travel far , yet with no bourn ,
1	i have long hoped to meet you , said yang
1	then tanchun and the others went back
1	then i will send her horoscope over , you get someone to choose an auspicious day , and the thing will be done
1	then came a large sedan-chair in which was seated an official in a black gauze cap and red robe
1	as she was speaking jia rong ’ s wife , having finished her toilet , came in to pay her respects
1	and since chen was another man who prized one copper as highly as his life , the two of them hit it off well together
1	i do not think the subject and rhymes should be decided by one per-son , yingchun demurred
1	why deny it when we have proof ?
1	i consider our families well matched and think this should be a good marriage for tanchun
1	whenever magistrates and prefects pass by , they go in to pay their respects
1	i have come to say goodbye to her
1	baoyu knelt down and first asked after their ladyships ’ health , then inquired after jia lian ’ s health
1	the young man , who was tired , entered a roadside inn to rest
1	there were such famous beauties as wang qiang , xi shi , fan su , xiaoman and jiang xian
1	tomorrow you can ask him
1	so why have these people come ?
1	liu xiangiian ’ s eyes flashed with anger
1	how can you abuse her like this ?
1	the days were so long that after lunch masters and servants alike were exhausted
1	keqing led the party to an inner room , where baoyu noticed a fine painting of the scholar working by torchlightnumber without even seeing who the artist was , he took a dislike to the picture
1	butcher hu was coming to offer his congratulations
1	countered yingchun with a smile
1	afterwards they sipped tea and chatted or amused themselves as they pleased
1	what has that letter got to do with you ?
1	yet he was annoyed with me because of this and since then has cold-shouldered me
1	do you have a fever ?
1	in fact , i think this hall is too big and would prefer to have a single feast in your library ; so that the four of us can talk comfortably at the same table
1	whatever is the fellow driving at in this essay ?
1	seeing that they were determined and not to be dissuaded , she could not help feeling a pang of pity and sent for gifts for them as well as for the abbesses
1	she has no parents , poor thing , no one to care for her
1	this will prevent any scandals here and save us money too
1	he called for zixiao
1	this academic discussion has a bearing on our business , replied baochai
1	and nothing is left behind
1	this was the rong mansion
1	even li bai copied from yellow crane pavilion ~ when he wrote his phoenix tower
1	meanwhile refreshments had been served
1	you know that monster always talks nonsense , she said
1	the double ninth festiyal is near
1	then baoyu tried again
1	since they robbed us yesterday they must have taken the opposite direction
1	the rest were loud in their praise and jia zheng nodded
1	go in , uncle wang , and announce that the third mr tsang is here , he said
1	we come from the same district as your master , said the brothers
1	mrs zhou walked into the adjoining room and found xichun laughing and chatting with zhineng , a young nun from the water moon convent
1	he simply lay down quietly on his bed , leaving the three girls to chat in the outer room
1	she sent off your bad luck for you
1	because of you i got kicked and beaten
1	then , borrowing a small boat from a neighbour , the old man had all his purchases put aboard and rowed to where yang chih−chung lived
1	they were chatting together when a young maid came in and whispered to hupo
1	so whom is your honour going to arrest ?
1	at first , they dared not venture out at night , so that birds and beasts ran wild ; then , even in the daytime , they would only go there in groups and armed with weapons
1	who can we get to help us out ?
1	after they had agreed to do this , he went to enlist the help of other colleagues
1	i can ’ t go on shamming illness indefinitely
1	quite a coincidence that , they commented , these two cases one after the other
1	having no interest in other provinces , he was eager to find his native place and soon discovered one cabinet labelled first register of twelve beauties of jinling
1	they looked at each other ’ s poem
1	she asked , more puzzled than ever
1	do not worry , sir , li rejoined
1	if she does it again we ’ ll punish her for both
1	commissioner zhao rose to his feet
1	we ’ ve consulted oracles too , and they all say we shall find it in a pawnshop
1	its bright splendour lights up the painted balustrade
1	speechless , they could only sob
1	she ’ s the only one here fit to be compared to a hibiscus
1	the lady dowager prays to heaven
1	colleagues must stand by each other
1	this is something auspicious and good ; there ’ s no monster here
1	when i came in and looked for zhou rui 's wife she was nowhere to be found , and a little girl told me she would been driven out for doing something wrong
1	lord zheng , you must wait prudently for a further decree
1	after paying their respects they returned home , instructed their cook to prepare a feast for the next day , and sent an invitation to the compiler saying that they wished to celebrate his home−coming
1	we ’ re too hard up to gad about
1	thus jia lian , going home that evening , found the place uncannily quiet
1	whatever sum ’ s given , who would dare to complain ?
1	baoyu first drank half the cup , as no one was watching , then passed the rest to fangguan , who drained the cup
1	three years ago when i thought about this question too , she was my first choice
1	very good , was li gui ’ s answer
1	if i do , you must not let her know
1	she took it for granted that her husband had completed his studies and would soon pass the metropolitan and palace examinations ; yet , even after they had been married for nearly two weeks , he still paid not the slightest attention to the essays which filled her room
1	it ’ s no use play-acting
1	lady wang who had taken to the boy answered readily , i would like to act as go-between myself
1	but i haven ’ t dirtied the bed
1	as soon as you get up your headache will stop !
1	it 's kind of you to put up with it and let her have her own way
1	the old man swore
1	this took the wind out of her sails
1	caiyun explained , this seems to be all we have
1	please take your seats at table , gentlemen , he said
1	but if we wait till these are no longer problems , baoyu ’ s father will be gone , and what shall we do if his illness gets steadily worse ?
1	later your father came to dine with us
1	but we ’ ve plenty of troublesome business here , and now that her ladyship ’ s growing old she sometimes forgets things
1	either but if you are afraid you will be lowering yourself , i wo not presume to lend it
1	i will say goodbye to you , uncle , and go back to my boat
1	baoyu caught hold of her hand then and asked softly :
1	he 's sure to come back this way
1	one day she had just gone in when she heard an old woman at purple caltrop isle raising a rumpus
1	now fangguan came in with a small glass bottle about five inches high
1	aunt xue murmured agreement , then added , i wonder if you ’ re not , perhaps , rather partial to the wife for your younger son , madam ?
1	with his catapult at his belt and his sword in his hand , hsiao charged fearlessly at the head of his men , cutting down all the tribesmen in his path
1	he then followed the matrons out again
1	yuanyang felt no fear but wondered , who is she ?
1	when yang heard how they spoke , he felt even greater admiration for them and exchanged some courtesies with chu hsien−fu
1	there was nothing ostentatious about her costume , which was none too new
1	~granny , she said with an effort
1	yes , mother , said wang mien
1	this has been so from time immemorial
1	how can you carry on in this crazy way ?
1	what i do is none of your business
1	gentle and demure , she looked very approachable
1	will you do some copying too ?
1	still , since we belong to the same village , i wo not say any more
1	she knew lady wang must be referring to him
1	baoqin cut in gleefully :
1	in future she 's to have the same treatment as concubine zhao , only her share is to come from my allowance , not from the general fund
1	gradually all the other guests left too , only kuo tieh−pi and lai the taoist priest staying behind to spend the night in chu−ko 's room
1	if i am hurt i wo not blame you but mr chin
1	now is the time too use them
1	of course they can
1	who do you think you are , ting yen−chih ?
1	as xiangyun said this she unwrapped her handkerchief from which she took a ring and passed it to xiren , who was loud in her thanks
1	these last few months i have saved a dozen strings of cash
1	your patron , mr tang , was a pupil of my grandfather ; so i feel very close to you
1	how can you compare with her ?
1	my brother-in-law lin ruhai , who was salt commissioner of yangzhou then , engaged him as a tutor for his daughter
1	i shall resign in a couple of days and leave here
1	on my return from court i happened to be passing this way , so i decided to call on your father , little thinking that he was already no more
1	but fan chin brushed past them into the house to look at the official announcement , already hung up , which read : this is to announce that the master of your honourable mansion , fan chin , has passed the provincial examination in kwangtung , coming seventh in the list
1	today she sent me back ahead to have a look , and i ’ m to go out of the city at the fifth watch tomorrow to meet her
1	his wife , holding back her tears , went to tell the lady dowager that yuanchun was ill and they were to call to pay their respects to her
1	he also set a table there with incense−burners , candlesticks and pennons to call back the spirit
1	as she said this a maid came from lady wang to summon xifeng , who took her leave of li wan
1	i lost my mother when i was a child , and was lucky to have a few peaceful years here with you , auntie
1	she asked her age as well as the hour , day and month of her birth , and wanted to know all about her family
1	do not tell me he 's in charge !
1	seeing miaoyu turning away , she guessed that bao yong must have offended her
1	there 's no time like the present
1	who is there now to speak so sweet and low ?
1	at the start , his subordinates were apprehensive and tried in all manner of ways to ingratiate themselves with him
1	he desisted then , demanding with a smile , will you talk that way any more ?
1	and jingui , besotted by her infatuation , indulged in the wildest fantasies which blinded her to his real attitude to her
1	though my heart aches , i haven ’ t many tears to shed
1	i do not want to spoil my reputation by giving the impression that i am out for profit ; yet if i put your name down after mine , people will think that you finance the publication and that i am working for money
1	too excited to sleep soundly , baoyu got up the next day as soon as it was light to draw the curtains
1	yucun turned and saw that it was zhang rugui , a native of this place and his former colleague who had also been dismissed from his post for the same reason as himself , and had returned home to yangzhou
1	however , i am all too conscious that my essays are unsatisfactory
1	xiangyun chuckled , it would be thirteen !
1	when the boatman had paid him for the water chestnuts , he rowed away
1	besides , however good she may be , she ’ s lower in status than i am
1	after admiring this they read baochai 's poem :
1	go back to bed now
1	asked dr yu , going out to receive them
1	when baoyu stepped into the garden , it struck him as a scene of desolation
1	if you ’ re too honest and don ’ t know any tricks , your father and mother-in-law will think you a simpleton and the household won ’ t respect you
1	but now you are growing up
1	he ordered , then turned to zhou rui
1	the big bamboos were now in constant use
1	i propose we call her queen of the bamboos
1	no , she hasn ’ t been over there recently — she ’ s only just left her bed
1	pinger holding it on her palm found it light , pinky white and fragrant , delightful in every respect
1	fearful that granny lin might tire xifeng out with her loquacity , pinger tugged at her sleeve and said , you mentioned her ladyship whom you have not seen yet
1	i doubt if your family could produce anything half as good , and that ’ s not boasting either
1	i put it by the tiller
1	and not only that , she didn ’ t treat me as warmly as she used to
1	roaring with laughter the rest said , how side-splitting !
1	what was your reply , sir ?
1	____________________ in ad he was sent by the han emperor to the western regions , and spent thirty years in what is now sinkiang
1	we are not interested in becoming rich or noble
1	as she was speaking they heard a clattering as if some things had fallen to the ground , and the next minute qingwen appeared
1	he ordered his servant−boy
1	just think how busy he must be !
1	that would be set in kweichow
1	if you were to be upset again and fall ill , how could your sons bear it ?
1	so your cousin ke has come back , making it possible for me to come over
1	jia lian , beaming , rushed to embrace her , pouring out an incoherent flood of endearments
1	he thought , the relationship between these two has changed , they now seem ten times better friends than the others
1	you ca not open your mouth without raving !
1	then the girl knew she was trapped
1	i ca not make enough to feed or clothe myself properly , sir , he replied
1	yes , it must be her !
1	i have prepared a scroll here , and anyone who would like to contribute can sign it
1	how could he possibly guess that the lou brothers had championed his cause ?
1	mr lou was in complete charge of all financial transactions , and my father never questioned him
1	of course , it is foolish to judge men by their success or failure , said prefect chu
1	sheyue remarked , no wonder the old lady keeps warning us , there mustn ’ t be too many mirrors in children ’ s rooms
1	then he took a boat back to the south , and returned to his teaching
1	fan chin 's mother ran out and called after him , just frighten him a little !
1	i will call when i am in the mood , miaoyu promised her
1	jia zheng shook his head
1	in that flurry who ’ d know what happened afterwards ?
1	these apt generalizations give us the main theme of the scholars in a nutshell
1	you have over two hundred taels , brother , left from that sum for buying silk
1	if you ’ ll really do that i ’ ll let bygones be bygones
1	the other was empty , ready for their favourite dishes
1	daiyu ’ s just out of bed and yingchun ’ s ill again
1	first go and get me some water
1	raised him to be a councilor of state
1	just send anyone who ’ s free and say i approve of the match
1	i have something to say to you
1	the women went off then reluctantly , while xifeng hurried to the main apartment to ask their ladyships ' permission to fetch what would be needed
1	if any scholar says anything , tell the fellow i sent him
1	xiren remarked with a smile , when people grow old they talk so foolishly , one doesn ’ t know whether to be angry or laugh
1	i must ask you to go back
1	is mr ma in ?
1	so he has two sons and a grandson
1	then sheyue gave her water to rinse her mouth and poured her half a bowl of tea
1	i shall have to teach you a lesson
1	he sent me on ahead to see how you are , madam , and to beg you to stay till the whole business is finished
1	she wanted to keep it in readiness for whenever i might need money in a hurry
1	a day was quickly chosen on which jia lian and daiyu took their leave of everyone and , accompanied by attendants , set sail for yangzhou
1	who thinks her a thorn in the flesh ?
1	the rat gave a sneering laugh
1	baoyu insisted that he was right and could hardly wait till dawn to send to find out
1	but if you ’ ve got a really fine line , the rules can be disregarded
1	tanchun , li wan and xichun stood in the shade of the willows watching the waterfowl , while yingchun , standing apart in the shade of the blossom , threaded jasmine flowers with a needle
1	when magistrate hsiang called on her , she told him how she had travelled from chekiang to wuhu and from wuhu to antung
1	it all depends on how well one handles things
1	if there ’ s anything i fancy , next year when my brother makes another trip i can ask him to bring more ; it ’ s no trouble at all
1	his majesty in his great goodness then ordered the bureau in charge to re-investigate jia she 's case and submit their findings to him
1	all these were important confucian classics
1	we will call you when we need you
1	he slipped out of bed , took the lamp , and went over to have a look
1	at once all looked round
1	the two ladies rose protesting laughingly , please take seats , gentlemen
1	chiung−chih had the seat of honour , mrs tu the place of hostess , and mrs yao a seat at one side , while tu sat by the window
1	don ’ t make me say things you ’ ll be sorry for !
1	go and get qiuling to fetch my handkerchief from my room , she ordered
1	constant to ten thousand boughs ,
1	what if i do this ?
1	in general i am against a hard-and-fast rhyme pattern , replied baochai
1	laughing up her sleeve , zijuan went out to do this and heard a clamour of voices in the garden
1	all the men in wuho are accustomed to sleeping with these big−footed maids
1	that was true twenty years ago , retorted chien
1	this is an irrelevant diagram
1	how can i look anyone in the face again ?
1	dialogue is used with great skill to reveal the speaker 's thought and personality
1	mrs liu , having put the pachyma flour away , was busy allotting the dishes for different quarters when yingchun ’ s little maid lianhua came in
1	just walk under a tree , and they glare like broody hens
1	this is simply to let you know that after you have proved for yourself the illusory nature of pleasures in fairyland you should realize the vanity of love in your dusty world
1	not a voice could be heard
1	you shouldn ’ t have kept at such a distance from her
1	but what delighted him most was the rouge by the window and the spilt powder left from a lady ’ s toilet
1	huiniang had been fated to die at the early age of eighteen , so that no more of her work could be obtained
1	having asked sheyue to help by twisting the thread , she now took one and compared it with the cape
1	now that i have found you , i am sure we shall be able to pull this off
1	even in the yamen they do not know , he reported
1	what ’ s really the matter ?
1	you know very well that none of our household would dare do such a thing
1	the trouble with them is that they don ’ t study hard
1	please thank my sister-in-law
1	he will be only too pleased to come
1	taking turns will prevent disputes and malpractices like mortgages or sales
1	and then he heard daiyu address baoqin as younger sister ’ without mentioning her name , as if they were real sisters
1	when he received his fee , he would buy what he needed to eat and give what was left to any poor man he happened to meet , not keeping a cent himself
1	i do not want any money or welcome from you , growled pan
1	now that i have had the honour of this interview , i shall go on by boat tonight to soochow
1	let ’ s send someone on ahead to have one cleaned up
1	i ’ m still young , yet already i ’ m like a plant in late autumn
1	this line is no good
1	then let me ask you something , and see how you answer
1	with that he called for a rope
1	she started to giggle
1	because his parents thought he was a monster , they abandoned him behind the icy mountain
1	have all the other men in the world died out ?
1	soon the results were published , and fan chin 's name was first on the list
1	when jia lian lifted the coverlet and saw second sister lying there as if alive , yet even lovelier than in life , he threw his arms around her
1	she likes nothing better than letting off big fire-crackers herself , explained baochai
1	after all , the master acted too hastily and was guilty of two offences by marrying during state mourning and family mourning
1	how can we control her ?
1	as our house was searched , to list any valuables would be reprehensible
1	however , those rebels were crafty
1	you leave that alone !
1	but although commissioner chou had had this man driven out , he still read his paper
1	while they were drinking , kuang told him all that had happened ; but after expressing his admiration ching steered the conversation round to pan number three
1	he 's two years younger than i am , and has passed the district examination too
1	the whole business is over !
1	since we are related , we invite him to several feasts each year , but he never offers us so much as a cup of wine
1	he bade the servant take this to the library , then went in with tu shao−ching
1	where can he be from ?
1	a prompt avowal will save us trouble and win you our gratitude
1	after noon one of mr kao 's servants came twice to fetch him
1	first slow as the dripping of water from a clepsydra , the drumming soon gathered speed like the patter of peas being poured into a bowl
1	he made his chair-bearers stop there to wait for his retinue
1	were not you the one who prepared it ?
1	although pao wen−ching did not approve of the ways of these players he said no more
1	you lose your temper too easily , miss , they scolded
1	he was disconcerted to see they looked like court runners
1	its functionaries included the left and right chief censors , the left and right vice−censors , and a number of subordinate censors who might either remain in the capital or be sent out to different provinces
1	especially when they behave so disgracefully
1	he made him change out of mourning , then took him to meet the prince
1	here with a person like you , gold , pearls , jade and jewels must all count as vulgar
1	as those young whores are low-class girls it won ’ t matter offending them
1	i did not know you had come , sir
1	we told the old lady , and she says there may be some left-over materials in the downstairs store-room at the back , which we can have if we can find them
1	and taking out his purse he gave yang twenty cents of silver
1	when kuang ta would not admit that he was in the wrong , but answered back furiously , the other man seized his pedlar 's kit , spilled out the contents and kicked the baskets to pieces
1	to know what happened after , read the next chapter
1	upon xiren ’ s return after her mother ’ s funeral , sheyue told her in detail of pinger ’ s visit , the part played by nanny song , the reason for zhuier ’ s dismissal by qingwen and the fact that this had been reported to baoyu
1	when tang had agreed and left , yoo told his servant to go to the chandler 's and ask the clerk in confidence to write on a red invitation card : will you honour me at lunch on the eighteenth ?
1	and when they had washed their faces , he gave feng a hundred taels in two packets to show his appreciation
1	aunt huang ’ s furious determination while with her sister-in-law to have it out with keqing had , during this recital , been scared away into the sea of java
1	if she ’ s a grand-daughter of the rong family that explains it
1	that 's what you say !
1	he made himself useful in tu 's household for anothertwo months , until the end of the seventh month when the weather began to grow cooler
1	she was the only one in a shabby cape , all hunched up with cold , poor thing !
1	i shall never forgive him as long as i live !
1	and in case of doubt , i can consult you
1	when he reached shilitun a doctor was sent for , but unfortunately that place has no good doctors
1	this was a tall order , but xichun had to agree
1	you must look elsewhere for your father
1	one of the sons of their house called lan has passed the examination ; so that prediction of yours has come true
1	just look at the dowries lady wang and i brought and compare them with yours
1	a true gentleman of the old school !
1	and even today a fragrance clings to her gown
1	then after crying bitterly once more before the coffin he left
1	in two weeks i shall come to fetch them , bringing the payment from magistrate shih
1	you with your avid eyes and itching palms , you ’ re the bane of our lives and a disgrace to us all i ’ ll carve you up !
1	just then a gust of wind sprang up , dashing fallen leaves against the window paper
1	so was not it simpler for me to bring them here myself ?
1	she nodded in assent , and this was at once reported to jia rong , who went back to inform his father
1	the three sessions were over
1	before chi could question him further , the boy brought in a visiting card
1	i ’ m too young to know the right way to talk ; but you , dear as an elder sister to me , can teach me
1	how did she come to hear of it ?
1	i have kept you all busy for a whole day , and being a monk i ca not offer you a proper feast but merely some wine and a few vegetable dishes
1	they found the old man wearing a new felt cap , a padded gown of thick blue cloth , and warm shoes
1	how much money can those young fellows ’ parents give them to throw away like this ?
1	mind you show it to your mother before you go out , the lady dowager charged him with a smile
1	with this , he shed tears
1	i was not prepared for this
1	asked mrs zhou stepping forward
1	she told the maids to close the cases at once , and pinger and fenger made haste to help daishu and the rest put the things away
1	as the saying goes , no one grows fat on just one mouthful
1	so next time you know where to find her
1	the day came to fetch the bride , and not being the type to make a scene however wronged she felt , she let herself be carried off in the sedan-chair , deferring her decision till her arrival
1	that offering was for diguan , who died
1	i would rate her chances of recovery at three out of ten
1	sneered concubine zhao at this point
1	he declared to his wife
1	why are you wearing so much ?
1	who can be sure that in future they won ’ t equal me today ?
1	she picked them up , reread them twice , then sighed :
1	once there was an old gentleman whose son had already reached high position , who still insisted on taking the examination himself
1	the others simply picked out one or two titbits which took their fancy , but granny liu had never tasted anything of the sort before
1	if you carry on like this with them , you will get another scolding
1	now baoyu had been so struck by xiaohong the previous day that he would have liked to have her wait on him , but he feared this might upset xiren and the others ; besides , there was no saying how the girl would turn out
1	we hope you will honour us by taking part in the sacrifice , sir , said chih
1	why look at those , miss ?
1	if he hasn ’ t had a change of heart , i ’ ll kowtow farewell to you , ma , and you can count me as dead , for wherever he goes i ’ ll go too , content even if we have to beg for food
1	there was a feast and opera performance at honouring the classics pavilion , andpeople flocked in from all the country around
1	when he reached the house of his mother 's relatives , the lu family , at granary lane , his nephew lu hua−shih invited him in and they exchanged greetings in the hall
1	this is mr kuo tieh−shan , replied wu
1	starting today , i shall leave you in charge of the shop and all the business — you will do the buying in , selling and giving credit
1	but ting shoved him over first , and he rolled to the foot of the bridge where he started howling and cursing
1	later this incident was used as a classical allusion to describe love between men
1	i have only one line rather a crude one , too but i wouldn ’ t know how to go on from there
1	your brother is no good ; but you must go on showing him the same respect that you would me
1	pay your respects to your uncle , miss , prompted the nurse
1	wang mien had genius
1	that 's how it is
1	tanchun was the first to finish
1	pinger called out , nanny li , what are you doing ?
1	the messenger kowtowed and presented the announcement , on which was written : the provincial governor of kiangsi reports that an officer is needed for the prefecture of nanchang
1	for having heard daiyu crying and vomiting and baoyu threatening to smash his jade , they did not want to be held responsible should any serious trouble come of it
1	lai da ’ s wife came in just then followed by the wives of zhou rui and lin zhixiao to make their reports
1	but my maid is so silly she asked that woman about it , and of course that put her back up
1	when i called on aunt xue just now , i ran into a very handsome young woman whom i didn ’ t think belonged to our household and wondered who she could be
1	no , they have all gone ashore
1	you must have hidden it , miss , she said playfully
1	i daresay she has set her heart on one of the young masters , most likely baoyu or possibly my son
1	butcher hu was not up to appearing in public , but he bustled about between the kitchen and his daughter 's room , helping to measure the white cloth or weigh meat
1	the report of the post-mortem which they sent to the prefecture omitted to mention that the blow on the temple cracked the skull , making a gash one-third of an inch deep , and that there was another bruise in the small of his back
1	we left on the twenty-eighth of the third month and only got back the day before yesterday
1	no matter whether it was xiangling or baochan , someone must have bought it for her
1	qingwen ’ s the prettiest among the maids , xifeng replied
1	so they went inside to have their tea
1	you do look ahead , do not you ?
1	this is none of my business
1	the king of chu invited lao lai−tzu to court , but his wife persuaded him that it would be undignified to accept an appointment
1	the day that daiyu abstained completely from food , zijuan felt that the end had come and , for a while , remained weeping at her side
1	we have a school for members of our clan who can ’ t engage a tutor , and some other relatives attend it too
1	some suggested calling in exorcists to drive out evil spirits ; some , getting a witch to lure them out by dancing ; others recommended the taoist zhang from the jade emperor 's temple pandemonium reigned as they tried all conceivable remedies together with incantations , divination and prayers
1	but your pieces there are all dead , so what have i to fear ?
1	yoo invited cheng to join them in the hall , and the old man saw servant after servant passing the door to the kitchen
1	it may be big , but what makes you think your son can move in ?
1	he came to luxuriant woods and bamboo groves set among hills and interlaced by streams , with a temple half hidden among the foliage
1	in the hope of soothing her he said , your unfilial sons have brought this trouble upon our family , alarrning you , madam
1	in my humble opinion , it would be better to send tien to their valley to reason with the miao chieftain and persuade him to hand feng back , so that no more need be said
1	daiyu called after him
1	by now chou chin had stopped crying
1	i knew you would not be able to leave yesterday , replied li wan with a smile
1	relinquishing her resentment zuuan is
1	we have no flies or mosquitoes , i know
1	and all members of the academy had to be palace graduates
1	presently pinger took her leave to attend to xifeng ’ s business , and mrs wang followed her out
1	she loosened the strings of these and took out two silver ingots
1	he decreed , since the widow was made a wife , she should not be considered as a concubine
1	three or four days later the captain invited pao wenching to a meal at which chi wei−hsiao , who had come first in the examination , accompanied them
1	no thank you , daiyu chuckled
1	sorry to have troubled you for nothing these days , she said
1	soon it was time to sleep
1	we have several hanging in our study
1	both put down the bucket in surprise and hurried in
1	that 's all right , countered xifeng quickly amid general laughter
1	aunt xue wiped her tears with her handkerchief
1	after you returned they came twice to call on you—did not you know ?
1	she decided to sound her out and questioned her
1	or has someone put her up to this to get yingchun to knuckle under first , and after that xichun and me ?
1	tsang liao−chai had prepared a good meal , and he invited tu very respectfully to be seated and poured him wine , after which they chatted at random
1	so that ’ s how it is , said the doctor
1	the game went on and this time huan was caught holding the flower
1	yuanchun praised all these verses , then remarked with a smile , cousin baochai ’ s and cousin daiyu ’ s are specially good
1	sit down and drink a cup , then tell us about it
1	today the second master heard outside that uncle was travelling here posthaste , and was only two hundred li or so away when he died on the road !
1	he told my man that he was a cantonese , but i have no such relative
1	all the ideas you express are heterodox
1	it 's not my job to look into this unsubstantiated charge
1	xue pan ’ s pages were too afraid of him to follow him against his orders ; jia zhen , however , was so worried that he sent jia rong with some men to track them down
1	wei is in disgrace and has been sentenced to exile in hochow
1	as a result of child−bearing , mrs yu 's health failed ; but a tutor 's pay was not enough to buy medicine
1	but the capital is far away , and it 's the governor who reports on everything here
1	re had to make ready at once and proceed to the city to await the governor 's orders
1	but to know what happened to the head , you must read the chapter which follows
1	he went to sleep as soon as we got back
1	for the sake of the flowers the door is closed by day
1	sleeping beneath roses induces sweet dreams
1	when i came back from school , he countered quickly , li gui said my father wanted to see me after my meal ; so i asked at once for one dish and one bowl of rice with some tea , then went over there
1	still , she ’ s cousin pan ’ s concubine too , so how could she then it occurred to him , jingui has never shown the least sense of propriety
1	the people led a wretched life , and the contradictions in society were sharply reflected in the conflict within the ruling class itself
1	the trouble your aunt had getting rid of the xi as !
1	but it was too late then to pay my respects
1	there was also a set of jade ornaments for a man ’ s belt and a bundle containing a man ’ s sandals and socks
1	the ankle−screws broke into six pieces
1	though she 's not expecting you to win her honours , if you turn out well that will please her and the pains she 's taken over you wo not be wasted
1	qin zhong was born when his father was over fifty
1	delighted , the lou brothers ordered servants to bring ironarmed chang a fine old sword which gleamed brightly when he unsheathed it beneath the lamp
1	she glanced at ha lan who , although more handsome than most , could not compare with either of them in looks
1	mr niu prevailed on him to have some tea too , and niu pu bowed to him also
1	i have been running to and fro in connection with tai po 's temple for some time , replied chih
1	what a pity there is no painter here to paint these sprays of lotus
1	after four or five cups , mention was made again of the novelties from the south
1	please look after this place for me until i come back
1	the zhangs have no son , and a property worth millions ; but they won ’ t agree to a match until they can find a young man from a rich and noble house who is himself outstanding
1	and why should a mere licentiate put on airs ?
1	so now baoyu was reflecting
1	this news reassured aunt xue that her son would be released and her daughter ’ s wedding could be carried through , although she could see that baochai looked rather unwilling
1	he had not~lived up to the old lady 's expectations
1	then a man there told me : 'this official is not your son
1	may i know your name and where you come from ?
1	no , he still isn ’ t up to that , madam
1	he is between fifty and sixty , wearing a square cap and a silk gown
1	this cottage was built on the bank of a stream by a hill
1	if he still refuses , we can discredit him without spoiling our own reputation
1	do not speak of it !
1	he prescribed one pill each time an attack comes on
1	we ’ d better not make it public , in that case , until aunt xue has decided
1	daiyu made no reply and to keep her awake — for he feared sleep might give her indigestion — baoyu played a new trick
1	baoyu , back in his room , heaved sigh after sigh but baochai , knowing the reason for this , ignored him
1	when he threatened her with a knife , she stretched out her neck and challenged him to kill her
1	you would not know if a thief came in the night , he said
1	she scrapped a few things too , taking me and xifeng as her main targets
1	i heard you coughing half the time
1	asked the stranger when they had bowed to each other
1	and where could the girls get hold of it ?
1	clever tanchun devises a scheme to make
1	this is your big cousin yun
1	i prefer cold wine
1	they made plans then to send stewards to find a house , have trinkets made and the bride ’ s trousseau prepared , as well as the bed , curtains and other furnishings for the bridal chamber
1	he inquired of an old serving-woman who chanced to come along just then what had happened
1	suppose i won ’ t let you go ?
1	but once you stopped him , he found out about his medicine
1	jia lian went off to work out the accounts for xifeng 's funeral
1	in a big family like ours , outsiders think our wealthy young ladies must be very happy
1	since you are related to the duke 's family , when will you become an official ?
1	most of the people here , from the old lady down to those in the garden , are very partial to crabs
1	that reminds me : i noticed one day that wuer , the daughter of mrs liu in the kitchen , was the image of qingwen , and i decided to take her on
1	she told me , too , not to mention this to her grand-aunt
1	she was going to order the attendants to seize the abbess , when she saw they had disappeared !
1	i can speak frankly to you , shao−ching , he said
1	the old woman wanted to go to the garden to say goodbye to baoyu , the young ladies and lady wang , but yuanyang prevented her
1	you sent him goodies but he didn ’ t eat them
1	the dead may have no
1	li wan and the others read :
1	half a month later another despatch arrived , this time with a clear description : the malefactor yu yu−chung is a senior licentiate of wuho , of medium height , with a white face and thin beard , in his fifties
1	why should he be arrested ?
1	we ’ ve met baoyu several times
1	then the hay−vendor left
1	although we have met by chance , we are both scholars
1	now do you know who i am ?
1	you reckoned on three hundred taels , but i am afraid it will cost you five hundred to finish the job
1	i ’ ve given her my heart
1	if you think , uncle bao , i could grind your ink or wash the inkstone for you , let ’ s try to fix it as soon as possible
1	i hope you wo not take this amiss
1	i told him to keep them for others
1	how could my heart be wrested from its end ?
1	waking in west pavilion , no trace of man
1	there are classical sources too
1	in one year he must make about a thousand taels of silver
1	meanwhile the lady dowager was gleefully telling everyone who came in that another family had a baoyu just like their own
1	she threw herself at concubine zhao and dared her to slap her again
1	jia rui had been orphaned early and left in the charge of his grandfather jia dairu , a strict disciplinarian who allowed him no freedom for fear he drink or gamble outside and neglect his studies
1	provided i make money , i do not care whether it is much or little
1	baoyu wanted to rush straight over , but baochai laid a restraining hand on his arm
1	one day emperor hung wu went to his house in disguise , just like the emperor in the old story who called on his friend one snowy night
1	the filial son knelt there , and would not rise
1	but on account of their good looks and charm they were nicknamed sweetie and lovely
1	go and ask the stewards presently they will tell you
1	the main thing is to lose no time in painting in baoqin and her
1	his lordship made second master lian fix up new quarters for them
1	kuang replied that he could
1	i ’ ve company now and don ’ t feel in the mood to tell you at the moment
1	at breakfast in the other house this morning there was a plate of beancurd dumplings
1	but how could i guess it was the lou family ?
1	the man in the second seat was hsiao po−chuan
1	is not that what you said ?
1	these are what i call worthwhile jobs , which wo not be wasting your time , said pan
1	the gate of the nunnery was still locked
1	but in silence , smiling coldly , they all went away
1	when butcher hu had finished his noodles and left , the abbot took the silver and set off for the city
1	running distractedly in , he was relieved to see her sitting there sobbing
1	since all the lucrative jobs had been taken by others , i was sitting there in the capital with nothing to do , spending my own money
1	hongyu stood at the gate watching till he was out of sight before finally turning back
1	what would be a suitable name for this spot ?
1	what is the pear garden list ?
1	pinger drew closer to whisper , since her period last month she ’ s been having fluxions off and on non-stop
1	otherwise both your families will be ruined
1	i am happy to have the honour of meeting you
1	it won ’ t do to neglect them
1	as for baoyu , he could see that while saying what was right and proper baochai was also trying to put him at his ease
1	after old chin had served tea , he led the envoy to wang mien 's house , and pushed open the door
1	at once baner set up a clamour for some meat , but his grandmother slapped him and told him to keep away
1	when they had drunk the tea and exchanged the usual compliments , lou feng pointed to the announcement
1	jia she and the others laughed , and jia she asked to see the poem and was full of praise for it
1	it ’ s lucky for you i haven ’ t told anyone else
1	there 's a short cut to it by the steep path behind my house
1	in the thirteenth year of hung chih i conducted a séance for mr liu , minister of the board of works , who wanted to ask the oracle what would be the fate of minister li meng−yang who had been imprisoned for impeaching lord chang
1	over my illness there are so many family affairs to see to i ’ ve naturally no time for such things i ’ ve even given up doing what ’ s most urgent
1	although she kept this a secret , everyone could see from her pallor and loss of weight that she was not taking proper care of herself
1	'why did not you tell me earlier ?
1	here ’ s the only other one i have , she said
1	what fine sights and monuments had she seen on the way ?
1	what about flowers and grass , or bricks and tiles ?
1	ask the young ladies to call that child back
1	have halls of jade ,
1	i am nothing but an ignoramus , replied chu hsien−fu
1	a minister of the state of chi in the sixth century bc
1	but since you ’ re the go-between , madam , will you find us someone to take charge of the betrothal ceremony ?
1	where the phoenix alights
1	the more he drank , the hungrier he grew—the poor man suffered torments
1	in your testimony at the first trial you said you witnessed the fight , said the magistrate sternly
1	two generations ago , the head of the seventh branch passed first in the palace examination , and his son was prefect of kanchow in kiangsi
1	this was just what baoyu had been hoping for
1	in any case , her husband 's illness had proved to be consumption , so that he was in no immediate danger
1	it ’ s not as if you were an outsider
1	i simply guessed at what the oracle meant
1	i would become a monk if you died , baoyu declared
1	jia jing , jia she and jia zheng each received two new books of his majesty ’ s own composition , two cases of rare ink-sticks , four goblets , two of gold and two of silver , and lengths of satin identical with those described above
1	why is not cousin lin here ?
1	peasants from all around contributed to the upkeep of this temple , and only one monk lived there
1	i ’ ve had a change of heart and mean to turn over a new leaf , but i must find someone congenial before i ’ ll marry
1	the mistresses have been away for a few days only , yet we ’ ve heard of nothing but squabbles of all sorts in every household before one ’ s over the next one crops up
1	as wang mien watched , he thought , the ancients said , 'in a beautiful scene a man feels he is part of a picture
1	he was really out that day , said pu
1	his secretaries and attendants bit their lips or fingers in dismay and hastily withdrew as they heard him raging at baoyu again
1	once more the runners raised a warning shout
1	xiren answered for him , of course he would like it
1	with tears too he replied , your subject , poor and obscure , little dreamed that our flock of common pigeons and crows would ever be blessed with a phoenix
1	baoyu has his first taste of love
1	niu leapt to his feet
1	fame and profit are vanity
1	are you niu yu−fu ?
1	like ancient kings austere who sought their mate ,
1	still they paid no attention
1	exasperated as he was , tu had to consent , and he wrote a note for the lad to take back
1	after discussing it we can write to report this to uncle lian so that we wo not be held responsible
1	she asked him , coming out
1	we have been out here enjoying ourselves every day recently
1	when jia zheng had written this out , the secretaries said , the third line has a classical flavour and is vigorous too — excellent
1	who knows my misery ?
1	in fact , for years i ’ ve been thinking that a family like ours should invest in some real estate — sacrificial land , manor houses or burial sites
1	they can profit by your edifying conversation
1	lianhua went back then in a huff to tell siqi all that had been said , embroidering her account too
1	excuse me if i do not see you out , said wan , giving a casual salute as he went back inside
1	i pointed out , what ’ s the good of fat mutton if it ’ s too hot to eat ?
1	seeing baoyu ahead of him , the boy stopped short
1	he ’ s asking twenty thousand taels for all four
1	xifeng assented and left to send jia lian to aunt xue ’ s place
1	while she went in to poke up the fire and make tea , fangguan took a cake and thrust it under chanjie ’ s nose
1	li wan told some servants to accompany him , but daiyu stopped them
1	he had not brought much money with him , and as a result of staying a few days extra and having to tip the attendants at the provincial government , by the time he hired a boat for nanking he had not the three taels for the fare
1	the elder of his two sons , jia fu , died at the age of eight or nine leaving the younger , jia jing , to inherit the title
1	they recognized him as the servant of mr lu , a compiler of the han lin academy who came from their district
1	evidently he 's not to be tempted by wealth or rank , much less by mention of his wife and daughter
1	then jia lian called for wine , saying , i ’ ll have a couple of drinks with elder cousin
1	how can i mark this first meeting ?
1	acting on the sly is no good
1	i told her quietly , 'granny lin wants to leave , so as to reach the city gate before it 's closed
1	yes , she 's stopped taking medicine today , replied cuimo
1	peifeng reported this to madam you , who had shares sent over to the different households
1	according to them , apart from all these jias here in the city there are plenty of others in the provinces too , and not long ago a number of their servants were put in clink
1	being close enough now to hear this remark , he could hardly come any further
1	do you mind sitting here for a minute , miss , while i take a turn outside ?
1	i do not really know how much she had left
1	how dare you answer back , you scoundrel !
1	why take on like this ?
1	yes , every year when they write home they say how exceedingly good you are to them , madam
1	take these keepsakes to remind you of me , she said
1	she did her best to please lady xing , aware that aunt xue was so easygoing there would be no problem there
1	wan and the buyer came in from the other cabin , they could not help laughing to see her in such a state
1	a roar of laughter went up , and jia huan told the eunuch that the answer was a head-rest and an animal-head tile
1	because the abbot was to say masses for his mother , fan chin was impatient of any delay
1	which is the one-tael mark ?
1	when she heard angry voices she knew that nanny li was on the rampage again , working off on baoyu ’ s maids her annoyance over her gambling losses today
1	no more fist-fights for me
1	the horse came back with another horse , and the old man 's neighbours congratulated him
1	though she ’ d been unfairly treated and left , if we couldn ’ t find any other way to help her , we should at least go to see her to repay her former kindness
1	i don ’ t trust you with it , he chortled
1	in all the years i ’ ve served you , madam , you ’ ve never laid a finger upon me , she said
1	now cousin baochai has gone home , even xiangling can ’ t come here any more ; and on top of that , yingchun has left us to get married
1	you have a distinguished visitor today , pin−niang , they said
1	she asked them the reason
1	i am on my way to tienchang , to visit the mr tu whose grandfather was a number one scholar
1	and round the foot of this hill , as the magistrate 's chair advanced , came a little cowherd riding back to front on a water buffalo
1	but can you tell me where that jade of his came from , and what the inscription on it is ?
1	the man 's clothes were so threadbare that a few more holes had appeared since he went into the cell
1	you are partial , madam , disclaimed aunt xue with a smile
1	you sit down and chat with us
1	now then , do not talk like that , nephew , said pu cheng
1	you ’ re lively here , she remarked , starting your horseplay so early in the morning
1	and the man who wanted to move the grave shall be executed like a parricide , by being sliced into pieces
1	we ’ ve been like real sisters since we were small and were only having a joke among ourselves
1	ho mei−chih carried out the dishes and his wife the wine
1	at that , niu pu−yi , an old secretary , suggested , if he is from wenshang county , why not look through the records of the dozen or so who have already passed the prefectural examination ?
1	she is beyond saving
1	i like plantains best so i will call myself the stranger under the plantain
1	the grandfather leads his grandchildren
1	like ancient sages were to cauldrons brought ''
1	don ’ t you think it would be better , madam , to lose no time in arranging their marriages ?
1	wait till we have had some tea , said hu
1	so don ’ t you go calling her a simpleton
1	that way , don ’ t i get more of your food than by eating here ?
1	how eager you two gentlemen are to do good !
1	they ’ d have something to fall back on , and there would be no break in the sacrifices
1	hua−shih , you should be able to give fifty taels too , he urged
1	qingwen , when he looked round for her , was nowhere to be seen
1	of course it is , agreed xifeng
1	it 's true that his grandfather held some official posts , but their family has come down in the world
1	she broke down and sobbed
1	the chieftain and feng chun−jui escaped by a small track to another miao settlement
1	i went to bed early , that ’ s why i woke early
1	she 's showing me the way
1	there 's no need to go in
1	he slipped over to the window and looked out
1	i owe a great deal to you , brother !
1	why didn ’ t you say so before ?
1	if you must drive him out , said the two neighbours when they found they could not talk her round , at least give him some money so that he can start a business
1	but no more of their discussion about baoyu ’ s marriage
1	just then , abbess daliao of scattering flowers temple arrived
1	it is not time yet
1	if she ’ s in a bad way , of course she can ’ t talk , said xiangyun
1	if you ever do such a thing again , we shall tell your father when he comes home and he ’ ll give you another beating
1	or maybe , because she bears sister baoqin some grudge , she ’ s playing this dirty trick to get me into hot water and give me a bad name — that ’ s possible too
1	after the lantern festival i shall come with the lou gentlemen to new market , and we shall call at your sister 's house , he told him
1	those old women deserve a rest after waiting on you all day , and the girls ought to have some fun too after a day ’ s work
1	when they had greeted each other and sat down , ma chunshang looked at chu hsien−fu 's card
1	this is the affair of us all : it 's everybody 's duty to help out
1	still , since you have mentioned it , i shall make a contribution
1	what is there to live for if everybody shuns you ?
1	of course i have
1	now that those notes of yours have been confiscated , the financial loss is of secondary importance , but think of the damage to our reputation !
1	what does she know ?
1	how am ito know on what terms you ’ ll be ?
1	if you want to know what this meant , read the next chapter
1	prince ning was trying all the time to kill the emperor ; but the emperor killed him first , and he wanted to kill prefect wang too , but prefect wang ran away to chekiang
1	the rice you buy outside isn ’ t to our taste
1	tell me , which family is she from after all ?
1	because of these services , he was treated with special consideration in our great-grandfather ’ s time and nobody likes to interfere with him now
1	i beg you , venerable saint , to instruct the ignorant
1	if their faces aren ’ t disfigured in some way , the pampered sons of great houses all look rather handsome
1	friends should put their property at each other 's disposal , said lou chan
1	is it all right if i take a stroll ?
1	we may as well try some other western medicine to set that right too
1	come and try some
1	why not say under madder-gauze window , a young lording filled with longing ’ ?
1	if you continue in this way , these two lines won ’ t stand out so well and the poem may seem padded and forced
1	he had come with the others today to see his friend , never expecting to find mrs liu there too
1	the other three swarmed round as well , weeping and wailing , tearing at her and butting her , so that she was surrounded on all sides
1	why come and ask me for old lady and my other elders
1	if you ’ ll tell me , miss , we ’ ll keep it in mind and recommend it to others with the same trouble
1	the small boy replied , uncle wang has gone to wang market , seven miles away
1	these gentlemen are stars in heaven , replied sixth master gravely
1	in which yu yu−chung takes the blame for his brother
1	there , the abbot and the woman , still tied together , were pushed up to a stage in front of a temple to wait for the magistrate , while ho was thrown out
1	if he gets wind of this and escapes , it will be difficult to send an answer to hsiaoshan county
1	i am going to have a look
1	shut up , you bitch !
1	are there not holy mountains where you could cultivate truth ?
1	hupo agreed to this , and yuanyang went out
1	jia rong , twenty , state scholar of jiangning district , jiangning prefecture , jiangnan
1	ching took the man aside and asked him the reason
1	and all feng did was smile : he would not confess
1	i haven ’ t said a word against you , madam , retorted xifeng laughingly , but now you ’ re trying to put the blame on me
1	you simply must not refuse !
1	what more do you want ?
1	so the people here knew that learning was an honourable thing
1	his protégés said , the second young master is composing his carefully
1	i ca not expect her to look after me , but only hope she ends up like yingchun - yes , that would please me
1	she really is silly , she told baoyu
1	my memory 's not what it was , and if i keep forgetting what to say it will make a bad impression on my father
1	while the boatman made his boat fast to the boy 's and was weighing out the water chestnuts , the brothers asked from the window : where do you live ?
1	it 's about this business of my son taking the examination , sir
1	tradition had it that the earth god kept his eyes closed all the year round , opening them only on this evening
1	we ’ ll do as you say , they agreed
1	at this signal the other eunuchs said , her highness is coming !
1	she always knows how to cope
1	his name was wangmien , and he lived in a village in chuchi county in chekiang
1	liu chi had nothing to do with it !
1	this order made jia zheng 's household exchange consternated glances , while the runners gleefully rubbed their hands , eager to ransack the place
1	during her funeral we saw all the mistresses except you
1	so from then on yinger was assigned to wait on baoyu with some younger maids
1	what a poor return for my kindness !
1	so qingwen put down the handkerchiefs and left , puzzling her head all the way back over this gift
1	ma chun−shang was tall
1	the moment he was back in his lodgings , chuang took off his cap
1	i want you to go and borrow one of miss lin ’ s
1	of course you ’ re right , madam , answered lady wang
1	at breakfast time the man who usually took the lead , shen hsiang−fu , walked in , followed by seven or eight others
1	the girl spoke so concisely and prettily that jia yun wanted to ask her name
1	as they grow up they start getting ideas and cause trouble
1	in your honourable company there 's an actor called qiguan who 's known all over the country , but i have never had a chance to see him
1	now jia zhen and jia lian went up to the lady dowager ’ s couch and , as it was low , knelt down , jia zhen holding her cup and jia lian , behind him , the wine-pot
1	the two story-tellers as well were in fits of mirth
1	baoyu saw sense in this and called in one of the old nannies
1	she whispered to yindie
1	you would better make haste to get together the clothes and things you need
1	soon the tally was returned and the amount entered
1	flowers strew the ground , the affrighted birds have flown
1	so many visitors all day long must have tired you ; do have a rest now
1	of course there will be no charge
1	celestial spheres my witness be on high ,
1	one containing the word 'fragrance '
1	it was so well done and quickly done that the magistrate was impressed
1	quietly loiter about the mountain path ;
1	after the family meal , shiyin had another table laid in his study and strolled over in the moonlight to the temple to invite yucun over
1	go along then , she said
1	as they walked along it they saw that the willows , now turning green , seemed hung with golden threads
1	how do you — a merchant of our gabelle — come to be so drunk and disorderly in the street ?
1	even if i do not see any clothes , maybe the mistress will think me so trustworthy that she gives me two taels of silver a month from her own allowance too
1	he reflected , the ancients said , 'one who has attained the way makes no show of it ; one who makes a show of it has not attained the way
1	the rest need not be enumerated here
1	she invited the two girls into a side room , where baochai sat on a couch and daiyu on miaoyu ’ s hassock , while the nun herself fanned the stove and when the water boiled brewed some fresh tea
1	his mind made up , he slipped out to look for zijuan
1	a censor brings a charge against
1	then she turned with a smile to tanchun
1	i do not mind not giving him the jade , he replied , but i must see him once more
1	all right then , said madam you
1	it seems pointless to make such a fuss over a fan
1	the two girls chatted with them as if nothing had happened until xiaohong saw xifeng beckoning from the slope
1	touched on the raw xiren lowered her head for a while , at a loss for an answer
1	no more of this
1	she often thinks of you and would like to come , but she ca not get away
1	then suddenly recalling the inscription for the painting of a mat and flowers , he glanced at xiren and tears started to his eyes
1	travelling by day and resting by night , kuo tieh−shan came to the province of shensi
1	when will you young gentlemen be setting out ?
1	fancy meeting you here !
1	yuanyang and the other maids could not suppress smiles either as they showed the gifts one by one to the old lady
1	our two apartments ’ accounts are so muddled , put in zijuan gaily , i can ’ t even remember the day , the month or the year when these things were left here
1	we must decide on forfeits for mistakes like that from now on
1	after a short silence she said , i suppose i should get that old woman to give me some acupuncture treatment too
1	his father , who had passed the military examination in the capital during the same year in which prefect hsiang passed the civil one , was now at home waiting to take up a post as a second captain
1	as soon as tang received this order , he summoned the clerk of the prefectural garrison , and had him shut up in the library
1	they also bought white cloth and asked a tailor to make mourning clothes as quickly as he could
1	frailer the girl within than any flower
1	magistrate tang is kind and benevolent , said yen
1	don ’ t treat it so lightly !
1	she flushed crimson and hardly knew whether to go on or not
1	xifeng smiled sarcastically at madam you
1	reed snow cottage is out of luck today , all messed up by xiangyun
1	at that she gave a great cry of despair and , taking him in her arms , started weeping and wailing
1	another small door in the inner room opened on to the back garden with its large pear-tree , broad-leafed plantain and two tiny side courts
1	maids were sent on ahead to see that all was ready ; and because the concubine zhao had excused herself on the grounds of an indisposition , there was only the concubine zhou to help the serving-women and maids raise the portiére and set out the back-rests and cushions
1	i entrusted baoyu to you thinking you had some sense
1	moreover , now that it was growing warmer , it was pleasant in the garden and they decided not to move till autumn
1	our household ’ s so big , it ’ s a mixed lot , xifeng answered
1	baochai ’ s boy cousin looks and behaves quite differently from xue pan , more as if he were her real brother
1	little did i know that baoyu was a spirit who had come to earth to undergo certain trials , and who managed to fool the old lady for nineteen years !
1	to the moon , past and present are one ;
1	early one spring morning when baochai awoke , parted her bed-curtains and got up , she found it rather chilly
1	it must be our bad luck that ’ s brought the second mistress to this pass or may be someone ’ s horoscope clashes with hers
1	no one else would do for her
1	when they reached fan chin 's house , butcher hu shouted : the master is back !
1	before she could finish the others , knowing that she was poking fun at xichun , asked , and then what ?
1	madam you agreed to this
1	this strange couple clamoured to see his masters , but would not give their names
1	having made this apportionment she told jia zheng , you spoke of debts outside ; well , they must be cleared
1	he was not his usual cheerful and talkative self , however , for he lay down , still wearing the cape , on the kang
1	my name is kuo , and i am a native of hukuang on my way to chengtu
1	for you are as fair as a flower
1	wuer ran forward to call her
1	i shall , so there !
1	but my benefactor is some distance away , and i need five hundred taels to repay him for his kindness
1	their host welcomed them and they sat down in the hall
1	the spirit must have returned to heaven , said chen hofu
1	as huan and lan had recently written several poems in company , they no longer lacked confidence
1	thus cui yingying and su xiaoxiao were immortals with earthly desires , while song yu and sima xiangru were writers of genius whose works were wicked
1	they then carried her back to her room where pinger and fenger gave way to a storm of weeping
1	one day whiskers mao received a letter from home
1	i told you to call to ask after her , not to go in
1	but at this point xiangyun and baoyu disappeared
1	after kowtowing three times he said , i can never repay the mother who gave birth to me
1	i shall take the chance today to break my fast
1	the next day wu shu came to tu 's house , and after breakfasting they went to palace pool
1	they crowded forward to intervene , expostulating and warning the fellow off
1	re was feeling listless one day when cuimo brought him a letter on fancy note-paper
1	it 's better not to cross mr chang 's path
1	what is the meaning of this ?
1	we are collecting the proceeds of our gambling to welcome you home
1	if not , then the executioner , who must stand by when the grave is opened , shall cut off that dog of a geomancer 's head
1	she wondered how best to avert such a dreadful calamity
1	do get me a whole lot more , and i will make you another pair of slippers
1	this belongs to the future , said shiyin with a smile
1	then baoyu realized with delight that they were announcing his father ’ s promotion to be vice-minister
1	the girl herself is agreeable and never seemed to be against the match , but those two old creatures have grander ideas for their daughter
1	her fragrant spirit is lost in the infinite none knows whither it has fled
1	an old magistrate takes a bribe
1	the two maids were just able to catch her as she was collapsing and carry her inside ; then qiuwen left zijuan and xueyan to attend to her
1	however , now that he 's married what does it matter ?
1	in the hope of distracting her he kept up this idle chatter for a while
1	but to know who this man was , you must read the next chapter
1	on her way back the maid met qiuwen
1	after all , they told lady wang , it ’ s because your house is a virtuous one and you yourself do so many good deeds that these young girls have been influenced in this way
1	no , no , i would better not go
1	apart from the sections just mentioned , wu ching−tzu 's style is characterized by his ability to express the profoundest ideas in the simplest language , to select from all the phenomena of life what is most significant , and to go to the heart of every problem he tackles
1	yucun accepted the silver and clothes with no more than perfunctory thanks , then said no more of the matter but went on feasting and talking
1	the weather turns warm so early now in nanking , observed hsu , the plum blossom comes out before the tenth month is over
1	then kuo crawled out of the pit
1	so i crept behind you , and after you came out i hid where you ’ d been hiding
1	while i was standing at the gate , lied niu pu , i saw the assistant magistrate from our county pass by
1	that may be true , said chu hsin
1	you ’ re quite right , said the lady dowager
1	the next morning qingwen woke sheyue before it was light
1	besides , if you bury yourself in this village , who will recognize your talents ?
1	just go ahead and trounce them , she concluded
1	both refused to take back their money -- - both wanted the girl
1	this made the old lady weep still more bitterly
1	the country has been at peace for so long that local government has become a mere empty show , he said
1	his parents were in the inner room
1	do not trouble to pour any more
1	i know , i know !
1	besides , being old and experienced she could see how delighted the old lady was and how eagerly the young people were listening
1	the whole party waited until he had walked on before going their different ways
1	one tea-spoon in a bowl of water is delicious
1	the prior invited them into a room on the ground floor of another building , where four large dishes were served
1	don ’ t stand on ceremony , anyone , said the old lady when all was ready
1	through a moon gate to the right they reached a long , whitewashed wall , and passed through a small door at one end of it to a covered walk
1	in this world , things don ’ t always turn out the way you want
1	did you hear this extraordinary business about jinchuan suddenly drowning herself in the well ?
1	jia zheng , looking closely at him , saw that this was not the same monk as last time
1	xiaoyan and sier , who had felt dizzy too , had already gone to bed
1	clasping him to her she wept bitterly
1	now the mayor takes his seat
1	in consternation jia [ ian promptly withdrew
1	the other house does seem to be in difficulties , sir , remarked his son
1	the customary fasts and sacrifices were observed , the death announced and the funeral rites carried out ; and niu pu helped to entertain the guests
1	would he kill my parents if i refuse ?
1	one of her maids whom i met told me she ’ s in paddy-sweet cottage , so i was on my way there when i came across you
1	it 's no joke adopting a son
1	on being told that it was the third watch , she observed :
1	angry as i was , i dared not quarrel with him ; i just gave pinger a couple of slaps and asked her why she should want to murder me
1	don ’ t be angry , madam
1	evoking the grief of separation , its pain ,
1	as baochai was a new bride and baoyu was crazed , neither objected to being taken over ; for although baochai knew how things stood and at heart blamed her mother for this injudicious match , it was too late now to protest
1	other tasks may be beyond me , but i ’ ve every confidence when it comes to copying sutras
1	you ’ ve guessed right , ma
1	however young and flighty i may be , i wouldn ’ t want such trash
1	before she could finish the old lady spat in her face
1	that would be fine !
1	she returned his greetings and they sat down to talk
1	he was invited into a small library in front of the shrine
1	that ’ s what ’ s so odd
1	not knowing what to make of this , xifeng called the messenger in
1	that ’ s the first thing
1	jia zheng , having been appointed this year an examiner of provincial education , chose the twentieth of the eighth month to start his journey
1	the proverb says , amagistrates can ruin families
1	if we leave it to a few of our household to search , they could search their whole lives long without finding it
1	fetch a red card , wei−hsiao , said tu
1	do you think someone living in the provincial governor 's yamen will be impressed by duck and pork ?
1	they all tried to comfort her
1	to know what followed , read the next chapter
1	smashing their noses and slashing their lips , he cut off their retreat
1	when did you come ?
1	it 's all right if you are both willing
1	invite him into the hall , he ordered the gate−keeper
1	they chatted and joked till evening , when music sounded and chi wei−hsiao was led to the bridal chamber
1	baoyu seized this chance to urge zhen baoyu to go in and the latter accordingly went ahead , accompanied by the others to lady wang 's apartments
1	i assume there must be some reason
1	if i hear of such goings-on i ’ ll have something to say
1	i came to see the old lady enshrined !
1	but this gambling night after night leads to drinking and unlocking the gates to buy this , that and the other or send to look for someone
1	imperceptibly , his spirits rose again as he gazed at the hibiscus , sighing
1	besides , it 's too hot for ceremonial dress
1	he 's been going through his stock , giving some things away , selling others cheap , and presenting the more valuable stuff to relatives and friends
1	just now several moslems got an old man to bring me fifty catties of beef and to plead with me saying that if i stop the sale of beef they will be forced out of business ; and begging me to be more lenient
1	i certainly don ’ t want her to leave us , and i certainly won ’ t let her
1	it has nothing to do with her
1	with your talents and reputation , and living as you do in such a fine place as this , you ought to take a beautiful concubine who also possesses literary gifts
1	he 's a man named yu yu−ta from wuho county , a senior licentiate who is well up in the examination subjects
1	about a month later yang sent another letter to chuan , urging him to come at once ; and on the receipt of this chuan put together a few things and took a boat to huchow
1	quite so , madam , agreed lady xing
1	some time after this , the lady dowager asked aunt xue over for a consultation
1	in no mood to check what they were doing he entered his mother 's room , where one and all were in tears
1	let 's be frank and put all our cards on the table : a few dozen taels are not going to settle anything
1	the date fixed is the day after tomorrow , so i have come to notify you
1	so at coming of age ceremonies , marriages , funerals or sacrifices in big families and in the halls of the local gentry , nothing was discussed but promotions , transfers and recalls in the official world
1	what do you think he did ?
1	for five silver cents they had a vegetarian meal in a mohammedan eating−house
1	are bound to stump the flower
1	the correction , though a little flat , will pass muster
1	it couldn ’ t be , he objected
1	the hail was thronged with nurses and maids in attendance
1	then jia zheng and the others made obeisance too
1	as she was talking they heard melodious fluting
1	chin was thrown into a panic
1	but to revert to baoyu : he had expected nothing more than a perfunctory check-up , little dreaming that his mother would come down on them like a thunderbolt , taking them to task for things they had said in secret — which she had got word for word
1	well , our family should be safe , ha she observed
1	well , let us hear what shao−ching has to say , suggested mr chih
1	she seemed elegant and quick-witted with an air of distinction
1	there 's the famous twelve pavilions , replied ting−hsi
1	you must not be touchy or imagine i look down on you , because this is between friends
1	xifeng accepted this task
1	i am honoured to be your colleague , said wan
1	but you ’ ve never even kowtowed to us each year
1	though you can ’ t handle affairs yet , you should learn from your elder cousins
1	all men long to be immortals
1	the discerning beauty his true worth foretold ;
1	but since you know about it now , i will bypass uncle and beg you , aunt , to show me some kindness
1	when daiyu assented faintly she gave the bowl back to xueyan to hold while she helped the patient sit up
1	that ’ s why she said she had none , not wanting to boast about it
1	jia lian could not presume to rest at home and had no time to remonstrate with xifeng
1	laughing at the idea she went on , i know what : i can arrange a match for her
1	clasping his hand tightly he said :
1	so jia zhen told his son , go with your uncle , and mind you go too to pay your respects to the old lady , master and mistresses of the other house
1	the next day her brother came and asked the lady dowager ’ s permission to take her home for a rest
1	when he sends to fetch her back we won ’ t let her go , not even if he sends a hundred times !
1	you must be blind not to know your master , cried xinglian
1	you are talking more and more nonsensically
1	the four of them were still at loggerheads when a summons to dinner arrived and they went through the dusk to the lady dowager ’ s quarters where lady wang , li wan , xifeng and the three jia girls had already assembled
1	now baoyu had always been deplorably eccentric
1	our sons should study too ; but if they ’ re a bit more intelligent than average and look all right , they can hardly fail to get some official post
1	told that he was asleep she was turning to leave when xiren said with a smile :
1	how good it will be to meet again next winter after you have soared up to dizzy heights
1	the matrons on duty at the gate burst out laughing
1	meanwhile aunt xue had tea and other good things ready for them
1	second sister pretended that this was the first time she had met them , then stood there with lowered head while the lady dowager looked her up and down
1	that mistress of yours brought in thieves to rob our family , he swore
1	wan hsueh−chai shall hear about this !
1	they laughed at that , and went on drinking
1	i ’ ve read of many talented beauties in ancient history , she said , whose lives were sometimes enviable , sometimes tragic
1	what brings you back ?
1	mortals mistake carnal appetite for love , and
1	just then a gust of wind carried them the strains of distant music
1	she was therefore sure baoyu would be in good hands
1	you may just as well go tomorrow
1	he is an unassuming , generous man who takes after his grandfather
1	nobody else can remember all the clothes and trinkets the old lady has , but yuanyang remembers
1	first , he had embezzled large sums of money ; secondly , he had hushed up several murders ; thirdly , he had used the official seal of the county yamen and the vermilion brush for fraudulent purposes ; fourthly , he had forged several official seals ; fifthly , he had kidnapped women ; sixthly , by usury he had driven people to suicide ; seventhly , he had bribed the school officers and found substitutes for candidates for the examinations
1	why carry on at him like that ?
1	if the runner had haled huan−cheng before the magistrate again , the youth would not have escaped a beating and the girl would have been sent back to the chu family
1	they gazed at the green , fresh mountains across the river , and the boats plying to and fro—they could see each sail quite clearly
1	he had paid scant attention to baoyu ’ s jade before and now took a good look , a careful scrutiny disclosing the inscription warding off evil
1	after digesting~all this information the old woman remarked , fancy , in town it ’ s not only the people who have class , the birds are high-class too
1	amid general laughter his mother had to sip some wine
1	next the magistrate asked wu liang , you were drinking with xue pan , weren ’ t you ?
1	chin lived on the ground floor of a house at the back
1	crows asleep by the well are wet with dew from the plane tree ,
1	that 's why i asked ~other to hold the wedding -but to do it quietly
1	i shouldn ’ t have waited till now
1	as long as your heart is pure , buddha himself will come to the sacrifice
1	besides , most breeze-and-moonlight tales deal with secret assignations and elopements , and have never really expressed the true love between a young man and a girl
1	my name is yu , and i live in unicorn sash village
1	now it happened that a few of the jia family pages who were friendly with the young patient called to see how he was
1	why don ’ t you sleep instead of talking such nonsense ?
1	the little mouse laughed
1	seeing that baoyu was tipsy , she asked him what had happened and he told her in detail
1	if you weren ’ t a beauty , i ’ d trample you to bits !
1	several of the royal consorts have presented offerings of this kind in our convent
1	when we don ’ t want it there ’ s plenty ; when we do there ’ s none , she exclaimed in exasperation
1	for the last dozen years i have been in peking , said hsu
1	the figure on the couch sat up
1	so you take that line too ?
1	i can tell you , that would be harder than climbing up to heaven
1	when jia huan saw them set off to take the examination he was furious
1	ordered jia zheng sternly
1	in a dream , rosy clouds bar the way to mount luofu ,
1	then he set out with the order from his superiors to take grain to the huai valley
1	with that she got down from her chair to walk coolly in , and the runners let her pass
1	thus the examination system not only corrupted scholars , but had a bad influence on society as a whole
1	our fingers washed , the reek of its oil will remain ;
1	when xiren comes back , you can talk it over with her and cook up some excuse for dismissing the girl
1	baochai 's warning against fooling about outside and his mother 's charge that his careless talk had caused baoyu 's flogging made him stamp with rage
1	when they started discussing his marriage zhen baoyu had taken his leave , and baoyu escorted him back to the outer study where jia zheng had returned
1	without stopping to change her clothes , she went over happily to see her mother
1	you may be sure she does it to make a show of poverty , because she knows they ’ re spending too much and making inroads into their capital , and she wants to cut down on expenditure
1	you have already got one
1	oh , they have their merits too , just as those with smooth tongues have faults
1	even if she could not talk , her golden unicorn could
1	now i am going back , i do not know who will plot against me again !
1	to bring you back again
1	she had asked mrs lai to take him into service in the rong mansion
1	it always irritates me to hear people praise a handsome man by declaring he looks like a woman
1	to the best of my recollection , said pao while the steward was drinking , the old lady in your family must be seventy this year
1	he sent me here to watch out for you and let him know as soon as i saw you coming , madam
1	maybe i shall , for the winter solstice has passed and i ’ m no worse
1	meanwhile the two commanders had reached chair mountain with the main force , but did not know whether hsiao had crossed it or not
1	yes , this really is very strange , madam
1	but would such an intelligent man really go off with the priest ?
1	as he went in , xiren emerged from the inner room
1	luckily for them , the assistants had taken quickly to their heels ; so none of them lost their lives
1	going back inside , they discovered daiyu just about to sit down on a chair , panting for breath
1	miaoyu was wearing a nun 's cap , a pale grey plain silk tunic under a long , sleeveless checked jacket with dark silk borders , a yellow silk sash and a white skirt with dark designs
1	these are coarse creatures steeped in fleshly lust
1	daiyu had not intended to make a special trip to thank baochai that could wait until next they met
1	the other day i was walking under a plum tree when a bee brushed past my face , and just as i flapped it away that aunt of yours spotted me
1	what 's happened , dear sister-in-law ?
1	justify their immorality by calling themselves romantics and passing it off lightly
1	if the mistresses ask about it and i ’ m able to cover up for them , they ’ ll be in luck ; if i can ’ t , there ’ s no more i can do
1	so he enrolled as a student
1	they forced me to drink half a goblet
1	now that baoyu has recovered , he said to his wife , '~how are we to raise the reward ?
1	the bawd went out and saw it was pen huei , abbess of long life nunnery , who had come to collect the monthly offerings
1	but if things go on this way i really can ’ t cope
1	and when lady xing and lady wang followed suit , aunt xue and aunt li had to drink up too
1	the next day before setting off on her journey , tanchun came to say goodbye to baoyu who was , of course , most reluctant to see her go
1	once over this a choice of paths lay before them ; but their attention was caught by an airy house of smooth brick with spotless tiles and an ornamental wall on one of the lesser slopes of the main hill
1	and now there ’ s this fellow bao er !
1	one of the secretaries was instructed to make out an invitation , and the following day servants were sent with a carriage and sedan-chair to fetch miaoyu
1	now just have a good rest while we go to see the old lady
1	i have not seen you for a long time , said tu
1	it is more fitting for us to call on him first
1	you do not want to buy it
1	recently , moreover , since they hoped she would get a job in the garden they had let the matter drop , assuming that after a few years when she was released from service she would choose someone else outside
1	from your explanation it seems one needn ’ t bother with these rules , provided the line is fresh and original
1	xiangyun , li wen and li qi invited her to take the best seat at their table , but she declined
1	when xiangling , ordered to sleep with her , demurred , she accused her of thinking her bed too dirty or of being too lazy to wait on her mistress at night
1	the next morning , after calling on jia she and jia zheng , jia lian went to the ning mansion
1	bending over daiyu , zijuan asked her softly , do you want some water , miss ?
1	on the fifteenth you can go out with our nephew to watch the lanterns , and on the seventeenth or eighteenth we will call a boat and go with you to mr yang 's house
1	an old man like you should be thinking of doing good deeds , instead of cheating people all the time
1	we ’ ll soon cure him of this nonsense
1	but jia huan had not a cent , having already squandered his mother 's savings , and was unable to help anyone else
1	that 's how i acquired some borneo camphor and musk
1	hurry up , sir , said the page
1	even at that post in the provinces , sir , scrupulous as you are yourself , i suspect that those grasping servants of yours damaged your reputation ; so you had better watch out
1	she had brought back a whole library of books , and lost no time in tidying her bedroom and setting out her things
1	on that day , drummers played outside the yamen as the two masters of ceremony ushered in the bridegroom
1	we are nanking−born and nanking−bred , they replied , and some of us are over seventy or eighty
1	by the third day the patients were lying at death 's door and the whole household despaired
1	but do you know who the girl is ?
1	old chin , holding a small white lantern in his hand , saw him to the end of the village and , shedding tears , bade him goodbye
1	going in some mystification to lady wang ’ s reception hall , they found it crowded with people
1	how heartless he is !
1	because i did not understand a word
1	today we have a female entertainer too
1	i suppose it ’ s your cousin ’ s illness that ’ s worrying you ?
1	ma chun−shang walked on till he came to a huge gate on which was written in letters of gold : the monastery of pure compassion , founded by imperial decree
1	besides , she ’ d no idea you were ill she must have come to talk to sheyue about something else and , happening to find you in bed , said she ’ d come to ask after you
1	as he left he pulled he san out too
1	the two of them drank till dusk , when sheep−horn lanterns were hung from the hundreds of trees , some high some low
1	his landlady , mrs tung , came out leaning on a stick
1	but when he reached the house and saw four attendants in red and black caps in the doorway holding whips , he was too frightened to go in
1	they cried out merrily , we ’ ve gate-crashed to offer our congratulations
1	why should i go on to make fun of myself ?
1	who knows what dirty old woman has been using them ?
1	est are to be confiscated according to regulations
1	daishu , who had not yet left , came over to greet her
1	that ’ s what i ’ ve done , but you may not approve
1	the first of the third month is the mistress ’ birthday ; the ninth is cousin jia lian ’ s
1	they had just started their meal when the old lady sent for xiluan and sijie to join them
1	my son is only an ignorant boy , he said to the student , while you , sir , are a respectable scholar
1	with that he told the servants to take wu jinxiao away and entertain him well
1	please wait here , mr kuo , while wu shu and i fetch the letter
1	i am not being modest
1	they were still at it after midnight when they heard a clamour from the inner apartments
1	does xiren know this ?
1	tu read : a despatch from governor li regarding the recommendation of men of talent
1	we do not need such a large junk , said feng
1	only daiyu teased , drag her off , quick !
1	a handsome young man answered from the crowd , and when he came forward the examiner asked him : are you related to mei chiu who was here just now ?
1	he then led the two young maids behind a rockery
1	and even if your ladyship didn ’ t slap our faces for coming , your stewards might take us for tramps
1	i was just a little too anxious for him to grow up quickly
1	but what 's to be done about madam 's illness ?
1	ching lan−chiang bowed deeply to express his admiration ; but the two old men did not trouble to ask their names
1	of course i do
1	i ordered all the maids to keep quiet , said xifeng
1	why haven ’ t i seen her all this time ?
1	mr tung was the first to speak
1	lord she , once he had the fans , asked master lian , how did he succeed where you failed ?
1	a hen-pecked young profligate takes
1	though caught out at last by her mistress ,
1	baoyu hung around for a while before going back to the garden , and as soon as he had gone the old lady said :
1	spring departs with the flowing water and fallen blossom , far , far away as heaven from the world of men
1	there ’ s no need to dose her with medicine
1	he has merely to mention the matter and , if you will pardon me for saying so , you will find yourself like a rat in scalding water !
1	recently , no doubt , he has frequently asked your advice
1	why have you come ?
1	i ’ ll recommend someone to take charge for you
1	it 's his birthday today and all our friends will be there
1	if your daughter does get a good post , seems to me she ’ ll be wanting our help even more often , and only if we give it will she do all right
1	do not jeer at me as rootless ,
1	and the men i showed it to said you had done a very careful job , in addition to being so fast
1	finding the one who should fulfill their fate
1	but i found you ’ d gone to bed early , and as baochai told me you weren ’ t feeling too well i didn ’ t like to bother you
1	qin zhong took advantage of the fact that nowadays xue pan had virtually stopped coming even to roll-call to make eyes at sweetie and secretly signal to him
1	she had better give directions for him to move in there too
1	but as for this ginseng , madam , although it ’ s of the best quality and costs more than thirty taels of silver an ounce now , it ’ s too old
1	you don ’ t understand , tanchun told her
1	then either you or qiuling could be the mistress — wouldn ’ t you like that better ?
1	she ’ s even prettier than you
1	in a couple of days i shall make a full report , and that will take the wind out of your sails
1	how could a family like theirs be ruined ?
1	demanded hsiao , staying his hand
1	that evening an attendant announced : someone has come from mr hsun 's family
1	my criminal incompetence deserved punishment by a thousand deaths , but instead the court with gracious clemency sent me to this border region
1	her eye falling on lady wang beside her , she cried , so you ’ re all deceiving me , putting on a show of being dutiful but plotting against me in secret
1	the officer also left without a word
1	but of course , if you want to be an official and at the same time enjoy dr chao 's happiness , that 's asking too much !
1	a few days later , in the palace , the emperor consulted the prime minister
1	still , i don ’ t think that xiang for sweetness in your name is right , i ’ d like to change it for another word , if you agree
1	and then his lordship came out and confirmed this
1	two days later tu returned the call , and the three men went out to greet him
1	he ’ s lived so long as an ascetic , we can already consider him an immortal
1	proud recluse , with what hermit are you taking refuge ?
1	xiangling answered with a conciliatory smile , a iya , madam !
1	although they prescribed various medicines , his condition only grew worse
1	shen chiung−chih , who lived in one of the houses at palace pool , went out with her landlord 's wife to burn incense too
1	sheyue and qiuwen had stopped and averted their faces
1	the runner 's first action on reaching home was to hide the certificate and make out a bill covering the money huan−cheng had borrowed from him as well as his board and lodging and court expenses
1	they were all afraid i was done for after that ducking and chill , but i recovered
1	i ’ m not feeling too well , i may not be up to going over tomorrow , he said , clapping his hands
1	you know , aunt and cousin xifeng , how it is in our family and that i ’ m not fibbing
1	all the officials came to see him off , and having taken his leave of them he once more hired a carriage and drove out of changyi gate
1	and the special meal your highness is conferring on jia baoyu is ready now
1	at sight of it baoyu became lost in thought
1	the worthiest man nanking has produced , past or present , is tai po , who founded the kingdom of wu
1	pinger was reduced to tears too
1	it 's up to you to choose , madam , said lady wang
1	then xiren released baoyu , who said with a smile , you people think more of the jade than you do of me !
1	the first half of this made sense to yinger , not the last
1	she had been meaning to raise a great ballyhoo over her daughter 's corpse , then appeal to the court for justice , little thinking that the others would inform the authorities first
1	a small token of my devotion
1	the nuns nudged the maid
1	jia qin was a romantic
1	come on , quick , madam you cried
1	these three were the ring-leaders
1	when wang heard this , he shed tears
1	meanwhile they were looking at the plum-blossom bough
1	a pine in a lonely valley
1	no , he had not drearned last night either
1	he took the examinations for more than thirty years but never even passed the lowest , because he ca not talk sense
1	it 's prime minister lou , of course
1	no , i have not trained him for the stage
1	since ma had read enough history to know that the capital had been moved south during the sung dynasty , he was able to calculate that this man must be over three hundred years old
1	she just blushed and went away
1	commissionerfan wanted to leave yesterday , replied mr hu
1	after all , women are so kindhearted , she 's bound to excuse my presumption
1	it ’ s because i was driven to it by poverty that i thought up this shameless scheme
1	the only sun now in the capital was a police commissioner named sun shaozu , not yet thirty
1	dairu stood up as jia zheng entered the classroom and greeted him
1	they were not joking this time , i assure you
1	you may still be able to fool others , but you ca not fool me
1	men laugh at my folly in burying fallen flowers ,
1	even after the lady dowager 's sedan-chair had gone a considerable distance , these attendants were still mounting their carriages at the gate , where a babel of voices was heard :
1	hastily asking one of the younger maids for some paper , she set about loosening her clothes
1	mercy , kind master , spare me !
1	stay where you are
1	since tai po was such a great sage , we all feel it is only fitting that the master of sacrifice should be a man of spotless character
1	a reeking wind swept down the fields of wheat ,
1	how can you say such a thing , sister , not leaving me a leg to stand on ?
1	then tea and refreshments were served
1	this is too kind of you , sir !
1	the other yearns in vain ;
1	but it is better to have nothing to do with forbidden books
1	you are right , of course
1	whenever they get a whole root they cut it into two or three pieces and graft other rootlets on to these to be sold , with others , as if they were whole roots ; so the size is nothing to go by
1	good sister , wait for me !
1	would you be so impertinent to the second mistress ?
1	daiyu shook her head with a sigh
1	when baoyu said that was right , his father read on :
1	they invited him into the hall and greetings were exchanged
1	true , there wasn ’ t much coming and going outside their gates , but over the wall i caught glimpses of most imposing halls and pavilions , while the trees and rockeries of the gardens behind had a flourishing , opulent look
1	though i ’ ve money , i can ’ t spend it as i want
1	she had three or four slave girls and nurses to wait on her , as well as two maids called tsai−ping and shuang−hung , both of whom were exceedingly pretty too
1	shiyin , hearing this clearly , wondered what it meant
1	together : a lonely boat moored by a chain
1	it 's all right now !
1	why do not you protest ?
1	but if heaven takes pity on me and lets my children live to see times like those under emperor hung wu , i shall die content
1	you stupid creature to frighten me so , cried daiyu
1	with a laugh , prefect wang rejoined : it shows that the old saying 'three years of good government—one hundred thousand taels of silver ' is not always true
1	he rounded on beiming
1	when it snows , i ’ ll excuse myself on the pretext of illness , so as to save you trouble , while xifeng and i reap all the benefit
1	quite apart from the girl 's looks where would you find another with such ladylike manners , so polite and yet so firm and principled ?
1	what do you know of this fellow chang ?
1	chin told his steward to go to the back of the study and see who was shouting
1	not everyone is a termagant like you
1	baoyu tossed and turned for another hour or two , not falling asleep till the fifth watch
1	after the customary greetings , mr tsung declared that while with the prince of chao he had written poems with the seven famous scholars of the capital ; whereupon tu remarked that two of them were his uncles
1	that ’ s all right , chuckled zhan
1	just give me that small one , she said hastily
1	yuner had no choice but to take her pipa and sing :
1	he had a rather sallow complexion and eyebrows which rose obliquely , like a portrait of the god of war
1	after deducting taxes and expenses , we should still net a profit of several hundred percent
1	last time i went home i had an embroidered dress made for mother too
1	tanchun boxed mrs wang ’ s ears
1	the milky way is twinkling ,
1	she wept and sobbed at home but no one took any notice , till they found she would disappeared
1	with another glance at baoqin , xiangyun said , she ’ s the only one here fit to wear this cape
1	pinger and xiren had paired off together too , and were indicating the numbers they guessed with their fingers , which set their bracelets tinkling
1	just then zijuan heard daiyu coughing as if she had got up
1	with that she retired angrily to her room
1	but she also had a daughter two years younger whose infant name was baochai , a beautiful , dainty girl of great natural refinement
1	what 's happened now , fourth brother feng ?
1	this elder sister of yours is a very good daughter-in-law , not like my elder son ’ s wife who ’ s so afraid of her husband she only makes a show of compliance to me
1	good sisters , let me off , she begged
1	what can this mean ?
1	in less than half a year , when my money comes in , i ’ ll redeem them and return them
1	it 's only right for me to help you
1	lost in admiration of everything about him , he asked the fairies ’ names
1	what is your personal name ?
1	no , what you want to do is to send someone to frighten him into giving you several hundred taels and letting you have the girl for your wife without payment
1	what nonsense you do talk , you stupid thing
1	if a relative of one from our household died , how much was given ?
1	with that she went off in her carriage
1	though the sun 's set , the ground is still hot
1	just leave it to me , replied xifeng , rather puzzled
1	we can ’ t afford that !
1	xue pan was overjoyed and passed on this message to his mother , who promptly set to work with baochai , xiangling and two old nurses to prepare his things
1	now that sobbing and wailing assailed him wherever he turned , his mind became more unhinged and when others wept he joined in
1	a young girl , to while away time ,
1	so i am an only child like you , and i thought that would make for an affinity between us
1	that to what purpose did i linger still ?
1	he has no sense of shame , and neither have you !
1	he crept out to try the gate and found it securely closed
1	if i had not told them , retorted the boatman , they would have smashed up my boat , the savages !
1	today you two gentlemen have come neither to take advantage of me , nor because you suspect me
1	xue pan had already been there for some time with a number of singing-boys , jiang yuhan , an actor who played female roles , and yuner , a courtesan from brocade fragrance court
1	when they entered the room , teng bowed to wang
1	that ’ s why i ’ ve had no time to call on you
1	he had charged straight in
1	there were two hundred sampans at the shore , and out from the bank sprang two hundred savage−looking men
1	he started by carrying a little merchandise only , but later he sold licences and was able to trade on a big scale
1	a wretched crank they call the stone idiot had twenty old fans as it happened , but though so poor that he ’ d hardly a bite to eat , he ’ d sooner die than part with them
1	sir , said chih heng−shan , if the ground is dry and warm and free from wind and ants , you can bury your parents safely
1	after two months here i can see that master bao , with his disposition and scholarship , will go far
1	after chanting this he burned the silk and poured a libation of tea , still reluctant to leave the place
1	do not you worry about me
1	we ’ re all cousins alike , so when they offend anybody i ought to apologize
1	ifyou wear clothes like that , what can the scholars wear ?
1	after all you gentlemen left for the capital , he told them , my father looked after the graves and did so well that he was able to buy some nearby fields
1	i shouldn ’ t do such a thing , of course , but as i ’ ve already got a bad name — why not ?
1	it ’ s too good for the rest of us
1	you don ’ t have to help out here
1	why not come and stay with me ?
1	lots of people are getting married
1	xifeng promptly sent for the actresses and gave orders for tables to be brought and a red carpet spread
1	you ’ ve met your match now
1	as she started out he said with a smile , wherever you go , i ’ ll go with you
1	you would better be on your guard !
1	but baoyu would not take no for an answer and at last she yielded to his importunity
1	this worthless young master set in charge
1	that doesn ’ t follow , put in yucun , grown suddenly grave
1	when he came out of the rocky grotto that day after a séance , he saw you reading in the bookshop ; and when the shopkeeper asked you your name , you told him you were the mr ma who had edited that volume of essays
1	he paced up and down , hands clasped behind his back , unable to hit on any way out
1	yet when they sent to make inquiries , it seemed nothing was amiss
1	they ’ re inlaid not with jade but with the finest marble carved with landscapes , figures , pavilions , flowers and birds
1	miaoyu commented , another stanza , but how mournful !
1	that will save the money in her chest the trouble of beckoning twice
1	then one of the women continued , one year , old mr wang sent his son to take the examination in the capital
1	at the end of the courtyard were five great halls , the largest of which held tai po 's shrine , with a table before it bearing incense urns and candlesticks
1	it 's you bitches who have hounded him to his death
1	____________________ a native of the state of chi in the sixth century bc
1	i ’ m going home to rest
1	from these two incidents , viewed dispassionately , i saw how obliging he is towards us girls he knows how to make himself agreeable to us
1	another thing , continued lady wang
1	after asking her for a written statement , the magistrate decreed that the matter should be decided by the clan
1	is baoyu the king of heaven ?
1	the two vessels were lying alongside , and although on different boats they were very close , so the young man petted her till she smiled and climbed into his cabin , and they had a night of love
1	xifeng did not know what had happened , and the others were mystified too until hupo explained :
1	she burst into tears
1	then with final thanks granny liu took her leave and withdrew with yuanyang to the maids ’ room
1	granny liu , who knew pinger 's status from her last visit , scrambled off the kang to greet her
1	then he presented the letter to baoyu
1	that ’ s the finishing touch , they cried , chuckling
1	i just came to see what you ’ re doing
1	and seeing that there was not much left , he gave the whole bottle to fangguan who took it away
1	you think you ’ re as rich as a mint-master
1	i do not know whether your excellency belongs to the same chou family
1	all was strangely quiet in lady wang 's apartments , where she sat in the inner chamber shedding tears all by herself
1	look , the only green things left are those bamboos
1	when i got tired of waiting i went on my own to pay my respects to the old lady , and i was just going to see lady wang
1	both of you should pay a forfeit
1	it ’ s kind of you to think of them , remarked lady wang
1	have we really passed it ?
1	smiling , baoyu told them what he had just eaten
1	since you have brought this up , madam , i would like to ask your advice about something that 's been worrying me for a long time
1	the young gentlemen have arrived , said chou chi−fu
1	though we live in the country , we have big money-bags there too who own thousands of acres of land and hundreds of cattle , not to mention pots of silver
1	but our friend dr chao is such a famous poet that all the high officials call on him ; and when people see a sedan−chair with yellow umbrellas at his gate one day and seven or eight runners in red and black caps they ca not help standing in awe of him
1	the senior eunuchs and ladies-in-waiting were also entertained by members of the staff of both mansions , leaving only three or four young eunuchs in attendance
1	her ladyship knowing doesn ’ t matter much , xifeng observed
1	wang teh gave a sarcastic laugh
1	i haven ’ t the heart to cut down their attendants , and i doubt if the old lady would agree to it either
1	if we meet too often we wo not enjoy it , predicted tanchun
1	i did not talk like an idiot , dad , protested chen ssu−yuan
1	they exchanged greetings and sat down
1	has miss lin ever talked such disgusting nonsense ?
1	to earth 's extremities i sought my bride ,
1	what 's wrong with having a bit of fun now that they are married ?
1	but there seemed to be a mill-stone round her neck and her legs were as limp , her steps as faltering , as if treading on cotton-wool
1	then you can come aboard
1	in the ning mansion
1	but now that i have some money , why should i ask you to spend any more on me ?
1	the jia family of the rong mansion
1	this matter is urgent
1	a few maids were emptying on to the floor some sacks of dates , pumpkins and other farm produce
1	if wafted by winds or pressed upon by clouds , it is thrown into agitation and traces of it may escape
1	we ’ ll see if you can go on being so cheeky then
1	go ahead with whatever you have to say , prompted tu
1	a true confucian is born in changshu county
1	the bystanders and neighbours could hardly suppress their laughter
1	a little thing like this might throw other people into a fearful flurry , but i know you ’ d have no trouble handling bigger things than this , madam
1	and hsiao made a mental note of this
1	he and fan chin made way for each other ceremoniously , and once inside the house bowed to each other as equals and sat down in the places of guest and host
1	zhan ziliang paints excellent pavilions in the meticulous style and cheng rixing does superb beauties
1	this is too much of an honour , he said
1	let ’ s amuse ourselves outside
1	chou chin and fan chin lead miserable lives before passing the examinations , but once they pass they feel as if transported to heaven
1	— that ’ s why she dislikes her
1	he 's not here today , is he ?
1	are you two from hao village ?
1	disclosure of a secret
1	trust you to think up such a phrase
1	now what ’ s the girl up to ?
1	why should he be such a miser ?
1	now that he 's gone , we shall have to beg our way home
1	the renegades qing bu and peng yue were doomed to be slaughtered ;
1	you must have seen a good deal , uncle , in the seventy years of your life
1	if the horse is here , the rider can ’ t be far off
1	let us turn back now to zhou rui 's godson he san
1	what other petition have you ?
1	there ’ s nothing to be afraid of
1	he is the gentleman who wants to marry
1	the two women stood up , beaming , to thank her profusely and make a show of declining ; but on xiren 's insistence they accepted the tip
1	for all you ’ re so handsome , you ’ re nothing but a fire-cracker without powder — good only for show
1	and though madam you came over every day she dealt only with routine matters , careful not to overstep her authority
1	yet to riches and rank each aspires ;
1	he cried , gnashing his teeth
1	but it has never yet been put to the test
1	jia lian went ahead to the old lady 's place and whispered to jia zheng that all the preparations had been made
1	he was just about to leave , when two men came in to appeal to him , and he ordered them to approach for questioning
1	because of this , she wouldn ’ t touch any breakfast
1	the emperor ordered ping chih to return to peking , the two commanders were to wait at their posts for promotion , and hsiao 's appointment as a lieutenant was confirmed
1	i am going to my shop
1	the girl 's sorrow : her husband falls mortally ill
1	when lady wang sent to ask for baochai , arid baoyu knew that the monk was outside , he hurried all alone to the front crying out , where is my master ?
1	if i wish you harm , may heaven and earth destroy me too , she sobbed
1	i told them i belonged to the west mansion and broke out , but those fellows would not let me go
1	if anyone is unkind to her , she must say so and not treat us as strangers
1	her eyes brimmed with tears again
1	her boots were of green leather
1	i have already spent a few taels , and must keep a few more for my journey to hangchow
1	baoyu stamped his foot and sighed
1	is the answer flower ’ ?
1	xichun told her all that had happened the night before and showed her the ingots found among ruhua ’ s things
1	it should not take more than a couple of days to mend them , and i shall ask you only for the midday meal
1	that same instant up come two stewards ' wives from the feng family
1	how farsighted and circumspect pinger is !
1	tang shih joined them at table
1	the two stewards whose indents she tossed back withdrew very sheepishly
1	it had to be kept a secret , and i was just beginning to feel better , able to get out of bed
1	zijuan nodded and said to jia lian , the gentleman is absolutely right
1	luckily there was still a bit of cow bezoar left , and it ’ s ready now
1	yuanyang went back to report this to the old lady , who in elation sent her back to urge aunt xue to explain the situation to baochai so that she would not feel unfairly treated
1	if the blossoming of the crab-apples was a good omen , he shouldn ’ t have lost the jade
1	she came over dizzy and after a fit of coughing spat out a mouthful of blood
1	it wasn ’ t because they had offended me
1	why is xiuyan engaged to my younger cousin before my brother ’ s engaged ?
1	then manao was sent by the lady dowager to ask :
1	there are even inscriptions on the jade , isn ’ t that extraordinary ?
1	yet instead of trying to keep her away she blatantly brings her here to carry on in that shocking way , not caring if people laugh
1	that was my misfortune , replied jia yun with a smile
1	your honour will naturally be invited
1	wuer decided to share the gift with fangguan ; so she wrapped up half of it in a piece of paper and as it was now growing dark , with few people about , slipped through the flowers and willows to find her friend
1	i ’ ve sent to find out what ’ s up
1	closely connected as we are , it was my duty to attend to your mother 's funeral , said mr chang
1	they asked in surprise
1	i must be off to see to some business
1	on no account protest for feat i lose face
1	even in her own quarters she ’ s turned down two or three requests
1	that 's a large printing centre
1	he stamped frantically in anger
1	throw him out , quick !
1	but although she lay down her thoughts turned to the crab-apple trees
1	then in his own hand he drew up a moving appeal on white silk , signed it with his own name and sealed it with the tungkuan county seal
1	this is made of peacock feathers and gold thread , she observed after examining it carefully
1	if your son disciplines his son , it is for the honour of our ancestors , he pleaded
1	the clear notes woke the echoes all around , and the birds alighted in the boughs to listen
1	dear cousin , do make me another sachet tomorrow
1	don ’ t you know who this miss pinger is ?
1	she brought out another plate for fangguan , adding , wait , i ’ ll brew you some good tea
1	we ’ re never told the details of their intimate family life or daily meals
1	after a few moves , ma realized that this was no common player
1	welcome guests who were treated with favour they announced ; but those who were cold-shouldered they turned away , even if they were relatives , fobbing them off with excuses
1	tossing it into her lap , he turned to go
1	jia zheng went out and saw it was jiao da
1	it really is egg—plant , they assured her
1	i shall be delighted to participate in such an important ceremony , replied tsang
1	what ’ s there left for me to live for ?
1	choking with anger daiyu burst into tears
1	if you have any trouble , uncle , he said , do not be afraid to tell me
1	otherwise people might say we ’ d drunk monkey ’ s piss
1	we mustn ’ t ever mention it again
1	let 's all give our ideas for general discussion
1	this would be only right and proper
1	that ’ s why , in my dilemma , i told you that fib to see how you felt about it
1	set out too was a crimson gauze screen in a carved purple-sandalwood frame embroidered with flowers and calligraphy
1	i wonder where it comes from
1	by the third watch when all was still , armed with daggers and narcotic incense they climbed on to the high wall and saw from the distance that there were still lights in green lattice nunnery
1	after a second 's thought he said , since moving out of the garden because of my illness , i have been living in the hack and have not been allowed to come here for months
1	did no one ask where you were going ?
1	he greeted niu yu−fu and asked : what brings you here , great−uncle ?
1	his eyes were red with weeping
1	and on both sides below the steps , tall vermilion candles blazed like golden dragons
1	she ’ s by way of being your honour ’ s benefactress
1	i ’ m better today , remarked daiyu
1	busy as you are every day , madam , do you still have time to do needlework ?
1	they took their places at both ends of the hall and the courtyard
1	now you are dead i come to bury you ;
1	that evening , in strict confidence , they sent mrs song off on this errand
1	then daiyu told a maid to fetch her favourite chair from the window for lady wang
1	you ’ re using the same image again , objected daiyu , but went on :
1	they made a clean breast of things , both admitting to sleeping with the assistant , and the assistant joined in the quarrel too
1	we ’ re afraid it ’ s epilepsy , was the reply
1	or xi shi 's mournful spirit fair as jade
1	vain are all these idle tears ,
1	what do you say to that ?
1	li wan made some lucky throws and captured several of the old lady ’ s pieces , at which yuanyang inwardly chuckled
1	the assistant magistrate says that mr wan has one really intimate friend and that if you mention that you are on good terms with that man , he will have complete confidence in you and trust you with everything
1	as each of them has two maids , that makes one string less
1	if you ’ ve no consideration for his mother , at least have some for lady wang
1	yen worshipped heaven and earth and the ancestors , then sat down to a feast with his new wife opposite him and the nurse and child sitting at one side of the table
1	now the time had come for the wake
1	her wanton coquetting had deprived them of speech
1	then the two of them began to lay their plans
1	just before you went over to the other house you told me to have them pasted above the door , yet now you ask where they are
1	then sheyue threw nineteen and it was xiangling ’ s turn
1	slightly reassured he pleaded , sister , why should you threaten me too ?
1	sheyue quickly passed it to him and while he wrapped the cape up turned to wink at xiren
1	in this passage the sage explained how his learning and understanding improved with the years ; that is why he specified clearly his attainments at fifteen , thirty , forty , fifty , sixty and seventy , to show different stages of development
1	i went to your honourable house yesterday , replied lu , and came on here today
1	there were about a dozen serving−women with them , who changed their dresses too
1	with a cuff , he knocked pin−niang over
1	depend on it , this is the reason
1	even if she wanted to , it ’ s not in her power
1	after grieving awhile he reflected :
1	hsiao went to his bedside to ask after his health , and described all that had happened since he joined the army
1	nowadays we ca not count on others help~ng us out , replied jia lian
1	you must consider yourself above the rest to disobey me like this
1	scholars like myself who reach officialdom through proper channels are imperial tutors whose pupils are the sons of nobles
1	one of my works published the year before last has already been reprinted three times
1	why ask me if i ’ ll have her ?
1	when they had breakfasted , mr wei brought out the wine and added ten catties of new wine to it , then ordered the servants to light plenty of charcoal and pile it when it was red by the cassia trees , setting the jar of wine on top
1	ca not you take a joke ?
1	but let us return to baochai who reached home to find her mother doing her hair
1	even your sister knows it was you
1	but before he could answer a young maid came out , and he and hongyu hurried towards the house , walking side by side , not keeping their distance from each other
1	i ’ ve forgotten to bring my pouch of betel-nuts , he said
1	qin ye was a poor official , but the whole jia household , high and low alike , thought so much of riches and rank that in the interest of his son ’ s career he had to pinch and scrape to get together twenty-four taels of silver as a handsome entrance gift
1	the next day aunt xue invited zhang dehui to a meal in the study at which xue pan presided , and standing in the back corridor she urged zhang very earnestly through the window to take good care of her son
1	i lost no time in summoning the bailiff and sent word to zhang ’ s mother too
1	the others had been surprised by beiming ’ s report
1	who ’ s been asking the servants for money ?
1	as second master ’ s personal attendant , you must know the whole story
1	this is all there is left , so he ’ s given it you with the bottle , fangguan explained
1	besides , that part is just by the ancestral temple
1	they heard another commotion , and jia zheng was wondering what to do when a wailing went up inside , master bao is dying !
1	she exclaimed , what is it ?
1	when madam you sent a servant for the third time to fetch her she said to keqing , take good care of yourself
1	far better come to us
1	the door opened and out stepped pinger with a large copper basin which she told fenger to fill with water and take in
1	'if you do well elsewhere , so much the better , he said
1	when doctor wang found such a company assembled , he paid his respects to the lady dowager before taking baoyu ’ s hand to feel his pulse , while zijuan had to stand there with lowered head , to the doctor ’ s astonishment
1	baoyu made no answer but found the path and walked on
1	when ma chun−shang had asked after the tombs , he brought the conversation around to the casket
1	this said , he darted off to catch up with the chair
1	he said his boss , wan hsueh−chai , has two boatloads of salt which will be sent off in the next couple of days , and he hopes we will travel with them and keep an eye on them
1	my late husband had a little property , said the widow
1	in three or four days , after reporting to my superior , i shall set out on a surveying trip
1	mu nai , at his side , could not understand what had upset him
1	xinger fell on his knees to kowtow
1	then he noticed how each time his nephew opened his mouth it was your worship this , and your worship that
1	there ’ s no need for that if you ’ ve already made the proposal
1	i ’ ll go and have a look
1	presently baoyu and baochai threw dice with the same number
1	she burst out crying
1	i also reprimanded the servants several times , and lately they ’ ve behaved better
1	and before it was light he called a servant−boy , and secretly bade him send in two of the stewards in charge of rents
1	feng questioned him closely and learned that the night before , when everyone else was sleeping , he had leaned out of the cabin to watch the girl in the sampan
1	if you can get someone he 's afraid of to slap him in the face and say , 'it 's all a joke
1	so the matter was settled and old pu went home
1	then although so eager to hear more , she confided , dear child , i am glad you are so understanding -- that 's exactly how i fed
1	xiren , who had overheard them , now hurried in
1	tea had been served three times and they now took off their outer gowns and sat down to discuss the transfer
1	if nothing is done , they can make things hot for him
1	let none disturb these chequered shades ,
1	the scholars , looking round the pavilion , saw that it had windows on all four sides and was surrounded by water
1	she therefore came over the day before the wake , when she recalled the old lady 's goodness to her , then thought of her own wretched fate
1	if your boy wants it , make haste and write out a statement of his antecedents
1	i had a husband-and-wife orchid , she told him
1	i promise not to
1	three days later a mourning service was held and further masses were performed while waiting for jia zhen
1	so you knew we ’ d lost some things recently , remarked baoyu with a smile
1	i thought you were ill , child , the old lady exclaimed
1	baoyu appeared very willing
1	in future i promise to do better
1	baoyu noticed that her eyes were red from weeping
1	who has planted this flower before the frost under the moonlight ?
1	what a good girl !
1	i know you are good at drinking games , madam , chuckled aunt xue
1	our dynasty lives up to this prediction
1	suddenly granny liu recalled having heard that rich folk had in their houses some kind of full-length mirror
1	accordingly , the first thing the next day , jia rong went back to the city to see old mrs you and tell her his father ’ s proposal
1	in our family except for madam lian who ’ s too busy with household affairs and , besides , can ’ t write all the ladies are going to write copies , some more , some less
1	if you dare kick feng in the groin , you will deserve your reputation
1	after my second sister 's marriage , though , all the girls died or were married off
1	now tell me this
1	her deafness made baoyu frantic
1	i ’ ve never heard of such an orchid , douguan protested
1	however , xiren , keeping quiet , heard it clearly
1	you can be together every day , but it ’ s rarely i have a chance to visit you ; yet you pay no attention to poor little me
1	lady wang said soothingly , you ’ ve already married this oaf , so it can ’ t be helped
1	meanwhile qin zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that nobody was about to go in search of zhineng
1	according to ming dynasty regulations , a special seat was set in the room of a successful candidate , who sat down while attendants bowed to him
1	still , at least the sentiment suits the scene
1	won ’ t you wait in the other room for a while ?
1	having got what she required from them she hastily made caiming list these things , then handed them over to the serving-women
1	now i hear he ’ s out and you ’ re not going over there today ; besides , this early autumn weather is neither too hot nor too cold ; so i ’ d like to go and pay my meet
1	she means to return all yours to you as well
1	quite a good effort
1	we always live quietly behind closed doors—why do you need me at home ?
1	could your memory have played you a trick ?
1	attendants promptly brought him a longan decoction and after sipping a couple of mouthfuls he got up to adjust his clothes
1	if he gets into trouble , i ’ m afraid we ’ ll be involved
1	take this to zijuan , she instructed her
1	three pairs of screws were brought ; but all that remained of them was eighteen fragments scattered all over the floor
1	here in our cave we have few fruits or nuts ; we must go foraging
1	let me just put it in a nutshell for you
1	the rest agreed , all right
1	today we may as well let ourselves go , continued the old lady
1	all admitted that such a thing was even rarer
1	i will , promised mrs wang , reassured by this
1	have you always been in the zhen family or only worked there for a few years ?
1	how much will it be ?
1	pointing to the flower basket on the rock she fumed :
1	please excuse me , she said
1	baoyu stepped forward and knelt to do as he was told , but his mother instantly stopped him
1	he has just gone to sleep after taking his medicine
1	then xiangling curtseyed her thanks , and xiren went off with the soiled skirt
1	besides , both the elder uncle who 's dead and the second uncle who 's alive should be grateful for what you are doing
1	he was just going to ask for water to wash when a sedan−chair stopped at the gate
1	jia zheng knelt down and kowtowed
1	he ’ s in a bad mood these days mind he doesn ’ t beat you
1	you have done so many secret acts of kindness
1	pointing an accusing finger at her she swore
1	you ’ d better look out , she warned
1	she pretended that she was , but in fact stayed awake all night
1	after they had greeted each other , daiyu , who was also there , asked baoyu where he had been
1	he asked baoyu many questio~number as the two young men saw him out , then left in his carriage
1	with a smile this girl announced :
1	he found xiren leaning in the doorway of the entrance hail
1	when the woman had stepped outside she called :
1	tell me , what 's the relationship between you and baoyu ?
1	asked li wan and xifeng
1	in happy red court
1	in that case , joked xichun , when the old lady becomes guanyin you ’ ll be her dragon maid
1	as long as i ’ ve someone like her , i don ’ t have to worry about going short of anything even if my daughters-in-law or my grandsons ’ wives forget it
1	do you expect silver coins to come rolling in of themselves ?
1	then the whole troop , escorting baoyu on all sides , galloped off
1	though i still have my son lian , he always listens to his second uncle , and now that we have to live on him naturally lian and his wife will take their side
1	the hall itself , ablaze with candles and lamps , was so brilliant with silk hangings and embroidered curtains that the ancestral tablets , ranged in their places , were hard to make out distinctly
1	this speech effectively silenced the young man 's scruples
1	a gift of local products makes
1	her pink satin breeches were lined with fox fur
1	now lin ruhai had taught his daughter the virtue of moderation and the harm caused to the digestive system by drinking tea directly after a meal
1	i know nothing of this affair
1	you strolled here by accident
1	but he rushed back to stop her , begging , dear cousin , spare it !
1	i do not suppose you will come to serious harm , sir , in this lawsuit , he said
1	she shook the container , took out a slip , and smiled when she saw what it was
1	he asked then where he could get hold of an incense-burner
1	the two brothers were wearing official robes and the go−betweens auspicious dress
1	you haven ’ t yet drunk the bridal cup but already you ’ re doing her hair
1	but if our old ancestress gives too much for baoyu , it wo not be good for the boy and may even spoil his luck
1	i do not intend to use it
1	balked at every turn , yen did not know how to save his face
1	this man had a dingy beard , high cheekbones , sallow complexion and piercing eyes
1	aunt xue was most grateful and gave them news of xue pan
1	not seeing daiyu that morning , baoyu went to look for her and found her curled up on her kang
1	xue pan , jia zhen , jia lian , jia rong and some other close relatives of the rong and ning households were entertained in the outer hall
1	you were laughing at us not long ago , chin told feng
1	daiyu made no answer to this
1	filled with misgivings , cheng began to be hungry
1	why , miss , what is it ?
1	as soon as the visitors had gone lady wang asked xifeng what she proposed to do now
1	then they took off their official robes and sat down , while tea was served
1	may i ask how many sons you have , and whether your wife is in good health ?
1	he can get someone else to make him a better one
1	by now the show had ended , and pao ting−hsi took his leave
1	don ’ t overdo your praise
1	but in my humble opinion , now that he and the young ladies are no longer children and , what 's more , miss lin and miss bao are not members of the family , cousins of different sexes should live apart
1	ghosts from outside don ’ t come in unless they ’ re invited by some family devils
1	xiangyun stared at xifeng until she said with a smile , here ’ s another about the lantern festival
1	the lady dowager , apparently at her last gasp , feebly opened her eyes and quavered , my son , i never thought to see you again !
1	accordingly they changed her name again
1	i weep with longing and shed tears , not knowing where to go
1	in the garden , the lady dowager led her party to enjoy the osmanthus in bloom , after which they returned to the feast and fresh wine was heated
1	i must say i have not the courage to pass myself off as someone else
1	when we go back we will fix a date , they told him
1	without further ado he asked :
1	your cousin zhen ’ s wife isn ’ t an outsider , so such formalities are uncalled for
1	and they were on such intimate terms , it was no wonder that their schoolmates suspected the worst
1	they can be excused their lessons today in honour of our guest from far away
1	whom shall we find as master of ceremonies ?
1	ha she is to be shown lenity and sent to the frontier to expiate his crime
1	i was wrong , but in future i ’ ll do whatever you young ladies tell me
1	that line about ministers of the celestial court must mean that you will be promoted to the rank of prime minister
1	plenty of glass vases and agate bowls have been smashed before without your flaring up
1	all right , go and report me to the old lady
1	zijuan handed the bowl back to xueyan and gently laid her young mistress down once more
1	where did you learn to behave in this scandalous way ?
1	when feng yuan demanded her back
1	said they live in some monastery
1	when jia rong heard this he told the lady dowager and xifeng , zhang hua and his father have fled for fear of being punished for bringing a false charge
1	you do not think i would let you get into trouble , do you ?
1	if i don ’ t , and my father knows , he ’ ll call me an idler
1	no matter how styles change , the reasoning remains the same
1	she ’ s frantic , that ’ s why she ’ s sent me to beg you to help
1	it 's not serious , someone shouted
1	not only can he count on the support of those three other families , he has plenty of influential friends and relatives both in the capital and in the provinces
1	we ’ ve been doing nothing but reckoning accounts for others
1	but if you try to conquer by force , weak as the people of chekiang are , i am afraid they will not submit
1	when she saw baoyu fit fangguan out as a boy , she followed suit by dressing kuiguan up as a page too
1	then those relatives and friends streaked off like lightning , leaving jia zheng , jia she and their households livid and trembling with fear
1	since she was so occupied , the girls called on li wan
1	after that he knew he could expect trouble , and planned to move to another town
1	i must meditate at the fifth watch , miaoyu remarked
1	meanwhile baoyu had scuttled back to grand view garden
1	recalling what bao yong had said , she felt sure the thieves had seen miaoyu and returned last night to kidnap her
1	you can ’ t trust these people an inch , miss
1	in addition , in an unoccupied room behind her kang hung a seven-star lamp , and under it were straw effigies — some with iron bands round their heads , some with nails stuck in their chests , some fastened with locks
1	he was wearing an old felt cap , a tattered grey silk gown , the right sleeve and seat of which were in shreds , and a pair of shabby red silk slippers
1	he washed and rinsed it several times , after which he picked up the pot and poured out half a bowl
1	jia zheng did not know what rejoinder to make to this
1	i lost no time in summoning the bailiff and sent word to zhang ’ s mother too
1	the general 's rank is so high and his sons are both so talented , an old dunce like myself can hardly set up as their tutor !
1	civil officials are even worse
1	chin 's face turned the colour of earth
1	he had never been treated like this by jingui and baochan before ; yet as the latter said it was to thank him for helping xue pan , this seemed to him quite natural
1	so instead of praising you , sir , they complain that you do not understand the situation
1	do us a favour , won ’ t you , and calm down
1	well , when you sent me these things , i knew cousin lin must have her share too , explained b ’ oyu
1	when daiyu heard that jia zheng was coming home , she knew he would certainly check on his son ’ s studies and was afraid baoyu would get into trouble
1	let ’ s quietly invite miss baochai and miss daiyu over to play for a short time
1	when he reached the inner courtyard he found the wicked monk seated on the couch in the central room , a bright sword in his hand
1	and facing you i treasure every moment
1	she wanted to send wuer there as a maid but had no one to recommend her
1	as soon as he arrived , he grabbed all the business with official families
1	can ’ t we talk if we want to ?
1	that 's what was so strange
1	his dejection made his old illness flare up again , and instead of answering he grinned inanely
1	aunt xue said with relief , i was hoping you ’ d come back to see to our family affairs
1	sheyue urged the woman , steady on
1	and now you are sighing again
1	but the next day he returned mr huang 's call , and when they met they started comparing notes
1	cried baoyu , i may as well wash here to save the trouble of going back to my room
1	i will set a subject then , and you can write on it tomorrow
1	i can ’ t remember too clearly , was xifeng ’ s answer , but i felt i couldn ’ t control myself , as if someone was pushing and tugging me to kill people
1	the red-jade shadows of caltrop apart has tossed ;
1	they all went the nest day to the temple and offered incense , then slept there at the foot of the altar while their spirits waited for the king of hell to appear
1	yoo suppressed a snort of laughter , and kept old cheng to lunch
1	xifeng had already left on the pretext of some business , while yuanyang had retired to her room to sulk
1	she ’ s worked for me all these years , so i slipped in to see her
1	their graves are a mass of briars
1	so saying she entered the room , inspected the embroidery and praised it loudly
1	get up , ordered lady wang , have another careful search made
1	in the second place : she gets on well with the older and younger mistresses alike here , and never tries in my name to ask this mistress for clothes or that for money
1	he waited , listening intently , but no one came
1	this type of appointment is worse than none at all , rejoined chin
1	first soldiers and runners marched past two by two
1	if you pass it , madam , it can be sent over
1	in the absence of ha she , jia zheng was the head of the house
1	but as people say this sutra , like taoist canons , is only the shell of truth whereas the prajnaparamitra sutra is the kernel , this second sutra must be included as well to make the offering more meritorious
1	and after tea had been served three times , he was taken into the bridal chamber for the wedding ceremony , which we need not describe in detail
1	i knew you ’ d be no use
1	i propose that we carry the coffins back into the main hall , and choose a day for the interment later
1	she has work to do at home
1	what do you say ?
1	the metropolitan examination was held by the ministry of rites , the test examination by an official appointed by the emperor , and the palace examination by the emperor himself
1	forty years ago , i spent whole days with your father
1	is he a relative of yours ?
1	make haste to despatch your business
1	the two friends rushed furiously in to complain to jia rui of jin rong ’ s uncalled-for insult
1	two or three times xue pan , emboldened by wine , stormed at his wife and threatened her with a stick , but jingui simply dared him to beat her
1	at least we should agree on how often to meet , urged baochai
1	huge horn lanterns high on both sides of the main gate of grand view garden cast a brilliant light , while all the paths were lit with lanterns too
1	yuanyang cheerfully assented and cried loudly , the table is covered with legs
1	in that case , i beg you to be the go-between
1	even if he ’ s still living he ’ ll be in a coma , so it wouldn ’ t be any use sending for him
1	she announced that all the men-servants ’ wives were to come to her early the next morning for instructions
1	i have plenty of rooms , he said , when he learned their business
1	this morning , our teacher set huan and lan some couplets to write
1	but to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
1	we ca not count on it , though
1	i want you to buy something for me today , but don ’ t let anyone see it
1	fan chin 's wife wailed as she prepared the food in the kitchen
1	~you need not raise money outside , replied jia lian
1	the old lady frowned
1	within three years an end will be put to famine
1	this is your wedding day , she answered
1	although it could not be called a large party , they had collected quite a number of people
1	under the peach-blossom behind seeping fragrance pavilion
1	she ordered some matrons to deliver the hamper of crabs and tell xifeng that she was keeping pinger there
1	by the time this was done it was nearly the second watch and after sitting up for a while to chat she sent them all to bed , then retired herself
1	some suggested a monk , others a taoist , yet others a marionette
1	then pao wen−ching also ordered his son to stop weeping ; but he himself fell ill
1	i was not in a chair , however , but riding on a donkey ; and when i wanted to alight , the attendants would not let me
1	yingchun was vexed and depressed by her nurse ’ s disgrace
1	when jia lian finally came home after completing his business , he went straight to the new house
1	just tell your master that we are from the minister 's house , and he will understand
1	failing that , i can kill myself
1	i ’ ll get you some more
1	both my son and daughter−in−law have died , leaving me only this lout of a lad who is not yet married although he is already eighteen
1	won ’ t you teach me a few of them
1	who will go with me to keep me company ,
1	it would take too long to tell you that in full
1	a man often gets a thrashing too when he ’ s drunk
1	this should have been cut long ago , said the maid with a smile
1	i asked them just now , said tanchun
1	in his fury he ordered his own pages to beat them
1	if i wait till my mother calms down it ’ ll be too late , because qingwen ’ s illness won ’ t wait
1	the next day as soon as he was dressed , he sat down by the window to grind ink and practise writing in real earnest , instead of going straight to his grandmother
1	chunyan told him tearfully all that had just happened to her and yinger
1	no matter with what pains he schools his sons
1	why treat her so unkindly ?
1	i wasn ’ t expecting the honour of this visit , so i didn ’ t come out to meet you , she apologized
1	petition on behalf of his brother , a victim of foul play who-has been unjustly accused
1	fame and achievement depend upon study , not upon any supernatural forces
1	niu pu returned to the temple in a very bad temper , to sit there glowering
1	a jar of lichees preserved in honey
1	wiping her own eyes , she patted the maid on the shoulder
1	with that she shoved huan forward
1	when they had finished eating , they washed their hands and rinsed their mouths
1	she 's been spoilt since she was a child , declared the bawd
1	one can never be too careful , was baochai ’ s reply
1	so it 's all the same whether she sees me or not
1	the old lady must be waiting for you to start dinner
1	convinced that he had met the goddess of flowers and determined not to let slip this chance , he persisted , if you are in charge of this plant , sister fairy , there must be others in charge of those countless rare flowers
1	then chih hengshan rolled it up again , and they went on talking
1	from first thing this morning till now you ’ ve done so much talking , and you ’ ve a different argument each time
1	and praise on this sagacious reign bestow
1	you must have caught cold
1	he escorted them out , and tu and chih left
1	go in quickly , chou chi−fu told her , and bid your daughter prepare a meal for the two gentlemen
1	an old man like you should not behave so disgracefully , when it will make things worse for you !
1	now that he had made this row outside , they seized the chance when jia zheng was free to report that bao yong had been drunk and disorderly
1	it doesn ’ t really matter whether you listen to me or not , but why carry on like that ?
1	by the time she reached home she had over two hundred
1	how stupid of me !
1	don ’ t worry , poor old thing , said aunt xue , laughing
1	after that they washed their hands and lit incense , and a pint of beans was brought
1	since you are going to the magistrate 's yamen , you had better travel with me to antung and stay with me while you prepare clothes for your visit to the yamen
1	she 's right , agreed old chin
1	xiren and sheyue were nonplussed
1	though mrs zhou was not in charge , as the maid who had attended lady wang to the jia mansion at the time of her marriage she was a person of some consequence , and so quick-witted and ingratiating that all the mistresses liked her
1	it would be better for me to make the proposal
1	that evening , as baoyu was quieter , his grandmother and mother returned to their own quarters but sent several times during the night for reports from the sickroom
1	she turned to keqing
1	i haven ’ t drunk any cold wine , he protested
1	wei−hsiao , said tu , nobody irritates me more than these people who can talk about nothing except their official connections !
1	when presently the meal ended , the lady dowager and some of the others adjourned to tanchun 's bedroom for a chat while the tables were cleared and another laid for li wan and xifeng
1	he has now risen to the rank of under-secretary
1	on the sixteenth the villagers sent in contributions to shen hsiang−fu , who prepared a feast for the new teacher to which he also invited mei chiu , the new scholar of the village
1	yes , i meant to tell your daughter-in-law , but i was so busy i forgot , said xifeng
1	we ’ ve told qingwen and sheyue to attend master bao
1	i didn ’ t hear talk of that but of some scandal
1	so mrs hua and her son did not press the point
1	this goaded baoyu into sitting up
1	xifeng in to sit down
1	if they just dropped in for a call , well and good
1	now fangguan brought in a cup of freshly brewed tea which had been cooled in cold water ; for even in summer they dared not use ice , as baoyu was so delicate
1	it ’ s a present from cousin tanchun
1	at this , li wan could no longer restrain herself
1	a man called pao is here from nanking , he announced
1	although the daughter of a cook , she was just as good-looking as pinger , xiren , yuanyang or zijuan
1	i was only making a suggestion , said whiskers wang
1	the next moment whiskers wang came flying in
1	she ordered her maids to fetch lin zhixiao ’ s wife to drive the woman away
1	it ’ s enough if just pinger stays here
1	all this was preying so much on baoyu ’ s mind that the honour conferred on yuanchun failed to raise his spirits
1	he produced another plot ; and this time he bribed a man living to the left of it to say that one night he had dreamed that old mrs shih in ceremonial dress had pointed out this plot to him and signified that she wanted her grave moved here
1	madam you and madam lou joked to li wan , the one who ’ s drunk monkey ’ s piss is playing innocent !
1	no matter what small alley you enter , you are bound to see at least one house where a lantern is hung to show that tea is sold ; and inside the shop you will find fresh flowers and crystal−clear rain water on the boil
1	the third master has just arrived from peking
1	it was reported that the culprit was a servant of the former senior imperial tutor jia hua , which reminded his majesty of my ancestor 's name , and he asked me what it was
1	let me tell you , then
1	it 's too bad that in our time even those in refined ladies ' chambers have been contaminated
1	so they abandoned all thought of buying her freedom
1	her dimpled smile is peach-blossom in spring , her blue-black hair a cluster of clouds
1	which of the girls is that ?
1	the two brothers received him , and kept him to a meal
1	before he had gone half a mile , however , he heard someone calling : abbot huei min !
1	baoyu turned to whisper to sheyue , i didn ’ t know yuanyang was here too
1	ask fangguan to come out , urged wuer
1	we must set out by boat the day before , so that we can reach his house early and spend a whole day there
1	what 's the idea , lashing out in all directions ?
1	when xifeng was up and about there was someone to scare them , but now they ’ ll be taking advantage
1	go on , do not worry about that , said pinger
1	besides , everyone here from their ladyships down is ever so fond of you
1	old mr cheng was the head of the brokers ' guild
1	who ever heard of a man falsely claiming a father ?
1	in the ning mansion
1	beside himself with joy , although he sometimes talked nonsense he behaved quite differently from when he was demented
1	he was a handsome young man
1	but i ’ ve already reported it , and they ordered me to take her there
1	there haven ’ t turned to ashes yet , but they have dried up and lost their potency
1	i have some slight skill in archery , and can hit anything i aim at within a hundred paces
1	chih and wu said nothing
1	soon it was time to go to the examination in the capital
1	the other day i was sent a couple of bottles of scented flower juice and meant to give them to him , but thought he might waste them
1	they watched as feng rolled up his right sleeve
1	he swung himself into the saddle then and his pages escorted him to jia she 's house , where he found that his uncle had nothing worse than a cold
1	after a hasty leave-taking she mounted her carriage with baoqin to go back , amid general consternation
1	the next day a number of suspects were summoned to court and yucun cross-examined them carefully
1	the young people laughed and exclaimed , what an idea !
1	after they had talked for some time , chu hsien−fu rose to leave ; and ma chun−shang asked where he lived so that he might return the visit the following day
1	the new wife brought the wang brothers in to see how he was before they left for the provincial examination
1	seek the cause of untimely death in a part existence ,
1	now the music , on top of the wine , set granny liu waving her arms and beating time with her feet for sheer delight
1	wang told him their names , and teng sighed
1	he charged forward , knocking into everything in his way
1	i must go to cassia pavilion to find him
1	he stood up in surprise to greet tinghsi , and invited him to be seated
1	at once out came several fairies , lotus sleeves swaying , feathery garments fluttering , lovely as spring blossom , entrancing as the autumn moon
1	now that she was married , she felt it incumbent on her to behave as the mistress of the house , not with the gentle shyness befitting a girl — she must show her authority to keep others under her thumb
1	she made an old nurse put the broth and dishes in a hamper and carry this behind them while they walked empty-handed to happy red court
1	when chin reached his door he was shown in by two attendants in brand−new clothes
1	how can we respect a mistress ’ like that ?
1	if my sisters , brothers and cousins are nice to me , i will be nice to them too , regardless of which is the child of a wife or the child of a concubine
1	are not you my uncle pao ?
1	it was now feng ziying 's turn
1	and his successor too did faith inspire ;
1	and it ’ s too early by far to talk of learning
1	our meeting reminds me of mr cheng lien 's voyage on the ocean , responded tu
1	of course , in that society and under the influence of the literati of the time , it was impossible for any man to be completely indifferent to officialdom
1	baoyu grabbed hold of the cup and started drinking , and before he could speak again zhishan came to fetch zhineng to lay the table
1	although there ’ s baoyu , he ’ s not cut out for the job even if i win him to my side he ’ s not much use
1	she knows very well how it is with our young mistress but never shows the least concern for her
1	i have heard say , went on the old man , that our dynasty would have been as perfect as the chou dynasty during confucius ' time , if emperor yung lo had not seized the throne and ruined everything
1	you must listen to me so that later , when you become an official , we may meet again
1	you can punish her any time you please
1	though baoyu was married last night he didn ’ t share the same room with his bride , so today we should make him see you some way on your journey
1	but first zijuan went in to have another look at their young mistress , and found that she had kicked off her bedding again
1	so xue ke had to let her leave the wine
1	some others are up on the roof
1	suppose i first feel the pulse to make my own diagnosis
1	daiyu for her part was also remorseful after her quarrel with baoyu , but could think of no pretext to go and make it up
1	why are not you eating anything ?
1	i ’ m most grateful for you help , sister
1	the young maids there also denied any knowledge of his whereabouts
1	what about the third of next month ?
1	tell me all these things clearly , you dog , and i may spare your life
1	niu pu−yi chanted poems , iron−armed chang performed his sword dance , chen ho−fu cracked jokes , the lou brothers appeared extremely cultured and chu hsien−fu extremely elegant , while yang chih−chung looked venerable and chuan wu−yung eccentric : thus the party was unique
1	i see now that it 's no good basing your opinion of somebody on hearsay
1	yuanyang assented and withdrew to pass on these instructions to serving-women , who went off to relay the message
1	his hair was tousled , his face streaked with mud , and one of his shoes had come off
1	i ’ ll follow suit , said aunt xue , and give twenty too
1	her maids ca not stop her !
1	at sight of her qiuwen smiled
1	why should he rush in if not to loot the place ?
1	they made merry till midnight , when the brothers left with their lanterns
1	staring about her she saw a box-like object attached to one of the pillars in the room , with a weight of sorts swinging to and fro below it
1	jia rong let go of his aunt then and grabbing hold of the maid kissed her on the mouth
1	when shall we see you again ?
1	you know the proverb , the empire ’ s officials control all in the empire
1	pin−niang was overjoyed , chin hsiu−yi drank his tea and left
1	please sit down , said mr hsiang , and i will tell you about it
1	jia lian knew that madam you had made this proposal because she was not on good terms with xichun , who could not take effective charge ; and xifeng was too ill to cope
1	and now a letter came from xue ke which aunt xue had read to her
1	she had only just married a talented , handsome husband with a cheerful disposition , but then he had contracted this fatal illness which might any day carry him off
1	her heart is loftier than the sky ,
1	is not your mistress taking medicine ?
1	this girl is perfect for you
1	ma was seriously wounded , and died a couple of days later , but his body has not been found yet
1	daiyu , her eyes half closed , took two or three sips , then shook her head and would not drink any more
1	there were only miao women there
1	have you recovered completely ?
1	there are some pleasant rooms over there that you should see
1	turning away , li wan saw that zijuan had vanished and asked xueyan where she was
1	it was not xiren but qingwen
1	and at each prefectural town or county seat you come to , show this scroll to the local officials
1	i won ’ t have you coming here again tomorrow !
1	there ’ s no need to send a feast to the other house
1	lady xing of the other house often takes yanhong , cuiyun and other young concubines there
1	i put you to so much trouble the whole year round , don ’ t stand on ceremony now , urged the old lady
1	when he shows so little interest in all those who belong to his household by rights , what time has he to waste on you ?
1	tomorrow i will send sedan−chairs to fetch your wives
1	this is better than being squeezed by those stewards outside and having to pay them
1	if you are fond of me , mother , take my advice and now that you are old take better care of your health
1	at last everyone was able to breathe again
1	you are drunk again , talking so wildly , they objected
1	jia zheng arrived in the middle of this dispute
1	i ’ m not coming here any more , sobbed qin zhong , if jin rong is allowed to stay
1	beaming all over his face he said to his second aunt :
1	baoyu fails to find a true friend
1	once this trouble blows over we must hurry up and arrange your wedding , and that will be one less thing on my mind
1	after drinking a few cups of tea niu pu went back to the temple
1	kuo tieh−shan and i were equally famous in our young days for our skill in the military arts
1	the patriarch , holding an arrow , asked , who will go and steal sweet taros ?
1	and the next morning niu pu collected the seals , stamped the two volumes and put them away in a safe place
1	the pages outside say he was at a loss because you would not let him have the jade
1	i know him , of course , but not well
1	if they need help , madam should use her own discretion
1	on second thoughts he decided , never mind
1	simmering with resentment they cursed their fate , for separation in life is harder to bear than separation by death , and saddest of all were the people seeing them off
1	so now with a radiant glance at him she complied
1	if he ’ d never shown up , i ’ d have stayed single all my life
1	the prince of xiping will deterrnine what other measures to take according to the earlier decree
1	just now , said niu , when i learned from your uncles that your father was no longer with us , i felt very sad
1	next time your master wants baoyu to meet or entertain guests , you can tell him without reporting it to me that i have forbidden the boy to set foot outside the second gate until after the eighth month
1	as he and his wife watched by the bedside , weeping , he gave orders for the funeral ; and when evening came the old lady breathed her last , so that the whole household was in a ferment all night
1	i am ashamed to display my incompetence before a connoisseur like yourself
1	steamed-bread convent was the popular name for water moon convent because of the good steamed bread made here
1	the other two seeing that he was drunk ignored him , simply putting out the light , then lying down to sleep as best they could
1	what do girls like you know about such things , child ?
1	the lady dowager smiled and pointed at daiyu
1	i know what to do when i am sent for
1	your cousin knows best whom to send
1	theat ’ s all we ask
1	yu yu−ta was disgusted by the way they talked
1	go to cassia pavilion at the end of the north corridor , he read , and ask for lai hsia−shih , who is newly arrived from yangchow
1	being a cosseted girl from a wealthy family , the anxiety on top of her night-long exertions brought on a fever , she was unable to eat or even drink water
1	if he 's a minister 's son , how dare people cheat him ?
1	don ’ t be afraid , my child , said aunt xue
1	the meal at an end , baoyu went back first to the garden as he had qingwen on his mind
1	re then retired to his room
1	jia lian stood up hastily too
1	yu yu−chung felt relieved of a crushing load , and wrote to recall his brother
1	i ’ ll keep it for you , and let you have whatever you want when you need it
1	jingui had meant to make a show of annoyance , but now his flushed cheeks , sparkling eyes and appealing expression had melted her anger away
1	as long as i live i shall try to repay your kindness !
1	the wine ’ s cold but you ’ d better take a sip , old ancestress , to wet your gullet before debunking their lies
1	how should i for my sallow features care ?
1	because yuanchun had borne no son , her posthumous title was virtuous and noble imperial concubine , according to the rules of the imperial house
1	baoyu , disappointed as he was , could hardly leave at once
1	it 's true that in a place like nanking even cooks and porters are cultured !
1	chen ho−fu , at your service
1	the two brothers were chuckling to themselves , when the boatman opened the cabin door and asked lou feng to step on deck where the bullies could see him
1	but soon repenting other counsel heard
1	the instructions read , all the feasters must drink a cup by way of congratulations , for this is the queen of the flowers
1	i ’ ll make a guess , said daiyu
1	don ’ t believe a word of it
1	baoyu stopped eating , rinsed his fingers and sipped some tea while exchanging a few more remarks with the two nurses , who then took their leave and were seen off to the bridge by qingwen and some other girls
1	the constable protested , if they did not break in openly with torches and clubs , how can you call them brigands ?
1	responded lung san reproachfully
1	even if you didn ’ t see me , we called you at the top of our voices a dozen times , but that only made you run the faster
1	how long can you go on like this—neither fish , flesh nor fowl ?
1	how do you know ?
1	one of the servants accompanied the chair to a house with a big gate by the riverside
1	unfurl the sail and fit up your oars to row back
1	and now that he has a fortune he has come to settle down in nanking
1	to miss baochai ’ s place
1	he was my father , replied tu , surprised
1	at any rate you will have to go
1	at this , daiyu broke out in a cold sweat
1	at last , at about eight o'clock , his sedan−chair turned up , with two men running before and behind it carrying two torches each
1	last year , chu−ko told hsiao and chi , examinershen set a poetry test for students from twenty−seven counties in our prefecture
1	after i left , did sister xiren send anyone to see sister qingwen ?
1	i use one hundred and twenty different ingredients which complement each other just as do a prince and his ministers , and co-operate with each other just as do a host and his guests
1	we shouldn ’ t play this game , she declared with a blush
1	next came a picture on a beautiful woman hanging herself of a tower , with the verdict :
1	it need not worry us , agreed mrs pao
1	xiren sent a maid to urge them , stop that noise
1	as people say , the way to happiness is never smooth ’ and nothing can prevent a match made in heaven
1	but hitherto i have had no opportunity of making your acquaintance
1	baochai and xiren too , it goes without saying , encouraged him to work hard
1	strolling in he found the bamboo portiere down
1	and in that case , if xiren 's pay is not cut cousin huan ought to have a maid with the same pay as well , to be fair
1	the mistress made people help her back to sleep ; but because of that commotion outside we did not get her a doctor
1	at sight of zhen baoyu he felt as if they were old acquaintances , while young zhen too had the impression that they had met before
1	do as you think fit
1	how can we put up with that ?
1	alas for the ning mansion , once so grand !
1	the girl 's delight : a good fuck
1	in those days the price of a salt licence was high , and when he had made forty to fifty thousand taels of silver he bought his freedom , purchased this house and set up in the salt business himself
1	haven ’ t you noticed recently how she ’ s been avoiding you ?
1	now that jia zheng had inherited the title and apparently still enjoyed the emperor 's favour , they hurried over to offer congratulations
1	but what reason has anyone to hate baoyu ?
1	he was unable to leave before the end
1	as he said this he winked at his second aunt
1	dear cousin , let me off
1	then all the family , great and small , began to wail and prepare for the funeral , placing the coffin in the central hall of the third courtyard
1	whenever i miss some dead friend , whatever the date , i burn incense and offer some fresh water or tea , or maybe flowers or fruit , or even meat or vegetables
1	old chin hastily called his son to make tea , kill a chicken and cook some meat to entertain the bailiff , and asked wang mien to accompany them
1	we told aunt xue , and she was only too willing
1	after jia lian reached pinganzhou he called on the governor to settle his business , and was told to come back again before the tenth month
1	this is only everyday family fare , put in lady wang
1	xiren overtook him to ask what was amiss
1	when she entered xifeng ’ s room with her hair dishevelled and her costume rumpled , like a frail beauty just aroused from sleep , lady wang immediately recognized her as the girl she had seen
1	as she was not wearing a skirt , he could see her pomegranate-red trousers with floral designs and her new embroidered red slippers
1	she 's nothing to do every day and needs something to keep her out of mischief
1	when the men who were friends with the first ten actors on the list saw the notice , they were delighted
1	but though baoyu was recovering steadily , he had not overcome his infatuation and he insisted on going to mourn for daiyu
1	we can not look for a speedy recovery
1	being at a loss , she could do nothing except berate xue pan
1	they were crying out for joy
1	even if she 's busy , you would think she would put in an appearance to please the lady dowager and lady wang
1	have no fears about that , his secretaries assured him
1	in this packet the medicines : plum-blossom powder , purple-gold pills , tonic for the blood and restorative pills , each kind wrapped up with directions for its use
1	i managed to fill that whole dark blue porcelain pot , but it seemed too precious to use so i ’ ve kept it buried in the earth all these years , not opening it till this summer
1	first of all , your hearts are at peace , so you are more spiritual and have quiet perception
1	when the others had left as well , baochai asked xiangyun where she had found the ticket
1	worried because she was not likely to recover , jia zheng sent to ask leave from his yamen and be and his wife attended her day and night
1	they may take a little finding
1	besides , you will need to take quite a few servants south , and as that will leave fewer here i can cut down on expenses and get by
1	why , this wine has body all right , said lou chan
1	cousin lin is talking like a southerner , teased tanchun
1	don ’ t laugh at me , miss , cried xiangling
1	who else is there to see to things ?
1	there 's something else i want to ask you , she said
1	where does that luting come from ?
1	terrified , niu pu asked : what have i done to offend you , great−uncle ?
1	arguing that shooting at random could not improve their skill and might even spoil their style , he imposed certain penalties and set stakes as an incentive to all to do their best
1	when he comes out , we ’ ll give him some more silver and that will be that
1	then the lady dowager saw them out no farther than the inner ceremonial gate
1	one was that piece , she answered , in which li kui abuses song jiang and then apologizes
1	now you two are getting on fine , but i ’ m left out in the cold
1	before you have got over it , here you are starting again !
1	regarding himself as the master now , he decided , here 's my chance to avenge
1	strangely touched by this , she stopped to listen
1	she ordered more wine to be heated , saying , i ’ ll drink a few cups with you and then we ’ ll have our rice
1	hurry up and take that wine back to the temple , and on no account show any despair or panic
1	why leave your post and come here ?
1	tomorrow we shall have to change this for her
1	so why not use that line from an old poem :
1	since the child was so delicate , her lessons were irregular and this meant that his duties were light
1	since you are one of the ablest officers in kiangsi , if you surrender i will have you promoted
1	why did not you come last time we sent to invite you ?
1	but he demanded that i pay the interest for all these months
1	have you asked any other guests ?
1	you just have a good rest
1	how many girls are there in your family ?
1	to tell you the truth , gentlemen , scholars of the five northern provinces respect my name so highly that they often light incense and tapers to me on their desk , calling me ' master kuang of sacred memory
1	this is no time for jokes !
1	the attendant sneered : your honour is right , of course
1	just then , as luck would have it , up came a nurse with a kettle of boiling water
1	the girl playing wenbao ad-libbed :
1	by now the contributions had been counted and they totalled just over a hundred and fifty taels
1	chu−ko 's arrival put a stop to this conversation
1	it must be the pill i took this morning
1	kuang ta had just finished gathering together his wares
1	what more apt than the spring of wuling ’ ?
1	composing herself a little she said
1	a whip cracked three times , eunuchs trooped out from the inner palace bearing golden censers of ambergris , and palace maids with long−handled fans escorted the emperor to his throne
1	go on , he said
1	tell these novices to get ready at once to drive to town
1	when did i ever have money from you ?
1	i am very ill , and do not know if i shall see you again
1	if i were you , i would go to another province to lie low for a time
1	i do not believe it !
1	which of us would dare ?
1	baoyu started off with one line :
1	he says he knows mr wan too
1	if not for this rumpus you made , our party would have broken up long ago
1	and when the woman had kowtowed her thanks they left
1	i have twelve taels here , which have been given me
1	who was your patron ?
1	we have left it behind the temple until you go back for the burial
1	wasn ’ t that a young lady i examined just now ?
1	she asked with a smile
1	this is the green gauze you admired yesterday , she said
1	i wouldn ’ t think of troubling you
1	do you think you play better than i do ?
1	presently chuang shao−kuang came in , greeted tang , and sat down
1	after dinner , when baochai had gone to see the lady dowager , she went to bamboo lodge
1	she rolled up her hair , removed the false tongue dangling from her mouth , took off the iron halter round which the rope had been fastened , and divested herself of the red garment
1	then jiang yuhan took over
1	so baochai must have moved out for some other reason
1	you ’ ve written just five poems , cousin , he said
1	take your hands off me !
1	if so , how did the name come to be handed down ?
1	you ’ re wrong there , old ancestress , laughed xifeng
1	he said a whole lot , too much for me to repeat , answered mrs lin
1	if you find an insufficiency of grain , horses or other supplies , please use this sum to make good the shortage
1	we shall see if anything comes of it or not
1	even if i had two mouths , i could not get through all the eating
1	so far no evidence has been produced
1	otherwise you might abuse me for selling it too cheaply
1	then a messenger summoned them back to xifeng , who had washed and changed to remove the dust of the journey
1	we must celebrate for a few days and invite all our relatives
1	by painted pavilion grow willows and flowers untold ;
1	that 's not hard to settle , said old pu
1	the mutilated pouch , the fan-case in two or three pieces and the snipped off tassel were on the little table ; and daiyu , clutching two old handkerchiefs with writing on them , was gazing at them in tears
1	her powder and red chamber , her youth and beauty wasted ,
1	the fact is , this old woman had only one son
1	she went along the covered corridor to the gate and discovered baoyu there , drenched as a drowned cock
1	the idle screens gay ducks and drakes enfold ;
1	she played until it was late , then called zijuan in to clear up and went to bed
1	or am i forbidden to see him ?
1	shutting his mouth and closing his eyes , he munched slowly
1	feng really ought to give me that silver
1	now she remarked with a smile , if we are to play drinking games we must call yuanyang back
1	yours is bound to be good , so let ’ s hear it
1	the mystified taoist placed refreshments on the table and busied himself with the tea ; then he produced a volume of poems from his sleeve and asked for tu 's criticism
1	then later , if you pass the examinations , you will find better teaching jobs
1	she lodges in handkerchief lane by palace pool , where clients will find her signboard
1	the old lady 's waiting for you
1	no , i really must be going
1	don ’ t ask me , said xifeng
1	oh , no , you don ’ t , laughed baochai
1	they control this household and run everything but pay no attention to you , their only younger sister
1	then there are others like li guinian , huang fanchuo , jing xinmo , zhuo wenjun , hongfo , xue tao , cui yingying and zhaoyun
1	so jia qin became their lover and whenever they had the time they would get together and learn how to sing and play the fiddle
1	why pin it on me ?
1	but after one sip he put it down—the tea was cold
1	all our income and expenditure were entered in the accounts by lai da , wu xindeng and dai liang , and you can check on them by asking them , sir
1	xiren drew a picture of peach-blossom with the motto exotic scene at wuling ’ and the line another spring returns and the peach blooms red
1	recently i was entrusted with the purchase of flowers , and thanks to your great influence i have been able to make the acquaintance of many gardeners and visit many celebrated gardens
1	but it ’ s not very fair for the two mistresses to give less themselves , only sixteen each , and not to pay for anybody else either
1	you ’ re my goddess , he panted , going all out
1	in one respect only had she been unlucky
1	so she said , fetch them , and we ’ ll see
1	and i came back too late in the evening to see her again , so how else can i have offended her ?
1	i thought you wanted to pass the examinations in order to go up in the world , and that you had bought essays to study
1	especially when , a few days later , some old eunuchs came with gifts and silver from her , announcing that her highness wished to express her gratitude for the family ’ s concern , and apportioning each one ’ s share
1	but as the proverb says , 'public business comes before private affairs
1	mourning with bitterness my years ill-starred ;
1	they went to a tea−shop , sat down and ordered tea
1	he told a young maid to light a fire and burned the scraps of the letter
1	the instructions were : all must congratulate the one who draws this lot and make her drink three cups , drinking one each themselves
1	the twenty-four young buddhists and taoists from the dharma convent and jade emperor ’ s temple in the garden had now been moved out , and jia zheng had been thinking of sending them to various temples elsewhere
1	she can wear new ones every day if it comes to that
1	wouldn ’ t that be nice ?
1	what does it matter ?
1	since your second uncle went to this provincial post , instead of sending home a single cent he 's spent a whole lot of the family 's money
1	he 's afraid to come
1	zhang hua , given this cue , acted on lai wang ’ s advice and wrote out his plaint , taking it the next morning to the court of censors
1	he will tip you for your trouble
1	yuanyang , standing there , now whispered to the old woman , do not forget !
1	baoyu pointed at xiren
1	when your mother was alive she was ten times better than concubine zhao , so you should be superior to tanchun
1	she went into the bedroom to tell xifeng the same story
1	what ’ s the matter with her ?
1	she ’ s an honest old soul and on good terms with yinger ’ s mother
1	he found in it both condemnation of treachery and criticism of flattery and evil , but it was clearly not written to pass censure on the times
1	xifeng standing near them smiled
1	then yuanyang came to announce that dinner was ready
1	i would not tell this to anyone else but you
1	the other day , however , when mr lu met prefect chu 's grandson in your honourable house , he was struck by his genius
1	take my word for it , it will be best for you never to meet her all your life
1	jia zheng , aware that his mother might well be anxious , said with an ironic smile , so sometimes you are at a loss too , you young rascal
1	though you ’ ve done some calligraphy , that doesn ’ t amount to much
1	i can see the only one who counts for you is xifeng
1	do not tell him , for instance , how good prefect hsiang was to you
1	it 's only a few months since last i saw you , and now you look so ill !
1	search all the cells
1	how are you , granny ?
1	a couplet on the two pillars read :
1	it ’ s baoyu — he came here specially first thing this morning and talked like a silly boy
1	his father is an outsider — he dares not enter
1	but what can we do when he was born with such a strange cranky temper ?
1	then lady wang and her sister sat up half the night talking
1	she told zijuan to go back for one then catch her up she would be walking on slowly
1	caiyun lowered her head in thought and then agreed
1	he could not tell whether this was said by baochan or jingui , but it convinced him that they were up to no good
1	they presented the paper , and he read :
1	why , uncle , i ply my small trade and all i ask is not to lose my capital
1	still , when i was young and your kinsman mr jia yucun was my tutor , i read a few essays too
1	hsiao chin−hsuan knelt to pass the grain to dr yu , who placed it on the table
1	li wan and madam you laughed
1	you would much better tell the truth and say that your brother is in nanking now , so that they can send a writ there and you will be cleared
1	he was one of the party at oriole−throat lake , with mr yang chihchung , mr chuan wu−yung , mr niu pu−yi , mr chu hsienfu , iron−armed chang and the two lou brothers
1	luckily mr chen the apothecary was on hand
1	but we need not dwell on this
1	she was too far away to see what i was doing and thought i was picking plums , so she let out a screech , then started squawking at the top of her voice that this fruit hadn ’ t yet been offered to buddha , that their ladyships being away hadn ’ t tasted it yet , and that after the best had been sent to the mistress the rest of us would get our share , carrying on as if i were dying for her plums !
1	as luck would have it , it was just the time for the preliminary test for the provincial examination
1	she was followed by baoyu , xiangyun , the three jia girls and li wan , and their choices were put on in turn
1	could not these people have protected them ?
1	our mistress had some peeled for her to taste , but she refused as she ’ d just been drinking hot tea and said she ’ d try some later
1	and butcher hu cursed him again
1	saying this he took two volumes of poems from his sleeve and presented them to wan hsueh−chai
1	have you forgotten , sister , that even you sang one too ?
1	he passed her the book
1	if bandits attack us , i need only draw my crossbow and they will be done for
1	all present were both frightened and amused
1	the jia family ’ s cure for a cold or cough , among masters and servants alike , consisted mainly of fasting supplemented by medication
1	luckily her ladyship gave me twenty taels of silver yesterday to make clothes for the maids , and i haven ’ t yet touched it
1	his father was furious and swore he ’ d grow up to be a dissolute rake
1	i ’ ve even got the title ready for you
1	when lung san , all his bluster gone , had thanked chin tung−ya and slunk off , the prior took his guests downstairs , greeted them again , and begged them to be seated
1	at the gate of mr lu 's house they sent in largesse to the attendants ; then the gates swung wide open and music struck up to welcome them
1	a stop was put to this discussion by the arrival of wenguan with xiangling , siqi and daishu
1	soon it was the end of the sixth month
1	and not wanting her to grieve too much , as baoyu was still bemused xifeng quietly sent someone with the trumped-up message , baoyu is asking for you , madam
1	sweating with fright , i woke up and rubbed my head , and it still seemed hot
1	this quip rankled so much , however , that she reddened and laughed sarcastically
1	i told them you were away , and they put up at an inn , but they have been back every day since
1	you have obviously bought it to make fun of us , yet you ask whether i like it
1	would not that be more flexible and greater fun ?
1	they bustled in and out non−stop , and it was our mistress this , and our mistress that all the time
1	you ’ re to go to see your father after dinner
1	in time they ’ ll turn back into soil
1	the only thing that worries me is leaving my mother here by herself
1	he came into the world with three horns on his head and four eyes , eight feet in height , with arms reaching to the ground
1	shiyin with his innate intelligence at once grasped the other ’ s mean-
1	her highness wants more pines and cypresses planted in the northeast corner of the garden , as well as more flowers at the foot of the tower
1	second sister had married a scoundrel
1	mrs wang started with the other girls ’ cases and , finding nothing exceptionable , went on to open siqi ’ s case
1	most of their attendants were pages of less than fifteen , all grown men-servants being debarred from the place
1	don ’ t talk about pawning things for a mere thousand taels when i know you could easily produce three to five thousand of ready cash here and now
1	let me , stupid as i am , explain this to you
1	they were prefect chu 's nephews
1	the ladies are all in the gallery , one of the girls told her
1	such things can ’ t really happen
1	once you see i ’ m gone , you can slip out and no one will notice
1	let me go and notify them , said ting−hsi , smiling
1	the old lady and lady wang have their titled status of course , but your ten taels a month is twice as much as we get , and yet the old lady and mistress still pity you as a poor widow with no means of support
1	let us send out a notice for you , sir , suggested yin chao
1	you ’ re so intelligent you know the saying : if your arm is broken , hide it in your sleeve
1	ting leapt in his rage
1	all the maids admired her goodness , all the nurses praised her kindness
1	we certainly ca not complain about the way mr chi treated us
1	there , however , he ran into two of his father ’ s proteges , zhan guang and shan pinren , who hurried forward smiling
1	this is all owing to the virtue of our old ancestress , she said with a smile
1	thereupon xifeng ordered a halt
1	kaoyao is one of the most famous counties in kwangtung , he continued
1	how come you don ’ t realize how heating wine is ?
1	if you ’ ve taken a fancy to someone , say so outright , and we can make her your concubine to avoid any hint of scandal
1	can this count as foretelling the future ?
1	seeing the maid kowtow now , she hastily raised her to her feet , shedding tears of contrition and distress
1	the whole company burst out laughing
1	why is not rong here ?
1	and so the three of them settled down to sleep
1	i have no use for the likes of you , was his retort
1	wang han−cheh clasped his hands in salute without bowing to niu , and took a seat
1	a trifling matter like taking a man ’ s life wouldn ’ t frighten him away
1	hurry up and bring us some of the birthday noodles !
1	could this refer to cousin lin ?
1	on the way he heard of the general amnesty and received another letter from home confirming his pardon and official reinstatement
1	she reported that you ’ d just started the feast and wouldn ’ t be back for some time
1	asked baoyu in dismay
1	i just want to be prepared
1	people may call me crazy , but you ’ re even crazier !
1	where ’ s your elder sister-in-law ’ s contribution ?
1	yes , i have not seen you all for so long , today i had to come
1	at this daiyu forgot her nausea and rushed over to snatch the jade , seizing a pair of scissors to cut off the tassel
1	after chatting a little longer , wang hui left
1	baoyu hastily changed his clothes , then paced up and down frantically , calling for his carriage
1	even if she were out , pinger and fenger would hardly be out as well
1	she ’ s young and inexperienced in these matters , said lady wang
1	the page did so , saying exultantly , why go yourself , sir ?
1	the other day you even beat xiren , and now you are picking on me
1	you know that pair of shoes i started the other day ?
1	hupo , knowing that she meant to worship buddha , had placed a red felt cushion on the ground
1	if you stayed at home you would only sleep the whole day long
1	my mother ’ s sister ’ s child
1	it ’ s unheard of for servants from outside to enter the young ladies ’ rooms without any reason
1	it sounds as if the two of you are already of one mind , second sister chuckled
1	at that lung san lost his head , and removed his chaplet and clothes himself
1	here ’ s the bezoar , madam , she said
1	pinger paid no attention to such remarks , but when jia lian learned of them he was disgusted and each time he lost his temper would swear at qiutong
1	baoyu threw back his head and laughed
1	no , you ’ re obviously fibbing
1	what is your relationship , sir ?
1	yingchun ’ s maid siqi and tanchun ’ s maid daishu raised the portiere at that moment and stepped out , each carrying a cup and saucer
1	if you want it to be within your power , so do i !
1	then came a sudden knocking on the gate , and the maid opened it to admit zijuan and cuilu with some old nurses come to look for daiyu and xiangyun
1	the next day they invited the go−betweens to a feast ; but because ting−hsi had to go out with his company , kuei helped entertain the guests for him
1	i do not need any at the moment , but if we run out i will send somebody to fetch it
1	so considerate as you are to her ladyship , and kindness itself to those of us beneath you
1	but let us turn our eyes to the roseate clouds
1	we always sent off a few kites every year , so why begrudge one today ?
1	he fetched fifty taels for huang ta , who took the silver and left
1	the main pavilion became grand view pavilion , its eastern wing variegated splendour tower , that on the west fragrant tower
1	now that tanchun had gone and baoyu was staying indoors to recuperate , there were even fewer pleasure-seekers left
1	besides , if you want an official career , this is the scholarly way to go about it
1	on the eleventh , vice−minister hsu saw chuang to wu men , and waited in the waiting room while chuang entered alone
1	when my master came back to the governor 's yamen from nanking , he sent someone to peking to fetch the mistress
1	men laugh at my folly in burying fallen flowers ,
1	while baoyu was changing his clothes before setting out , a gift of sweetened junket arrived from the imperial consort
1	how thoughtful you suddenly are !
1	according to the last letter from nanjing , jin cai has had a stroke , sir , replied his son
1	when you have extra money , you should give it to the guild head to buy silk
1	they sat there till the sun began to sink in the west , and two dung−carriers set down their empty pails on the hill to rest
1	you do not know , madam , said baoyu , cousin lin suffers from an inherited weakness and has such a delicate constitution that she ca not stand the least little chill
1	at sight of him they stood at respectful attention
1	they mustn ’ t come in
1	sheyue and qiuwen had been waiting in the old lady ’ s place with two younger maids
1	and as human beings in a real society , they can not be perfect
1	she hid in the doorway to watch
1	did you read the end of the letter , uncle , where grandfather urges us to study hard ?
1	and now i am going to match you with my younger sister jianmei , number whose childhood name is keqing , and this very night at the auspicious hour you must consummate your union
1	after tossing off the cup of wine , in the hope of wine , in the hope of raising another laugh she observed :
1	it was only to ask you to stay for dinner with the girls
1	when she saw me she gave me two handfuls of cash -- how much it is i do not know
1	after that affair with bao er ’ s wife , the master seemed to be restraining himself and behaving much better
1	the other day i was asking our elder sister-in-law about you
1	she smiled at xiaohong
1	it soughed through the trees , and made the waterfowl take wing , crying in alarm , while wang mien and old chin hid their faces in their sleeves for fear
1	but what does the last line mean ?
1	i will pay it for you
1	i know nothing about it , he cried
1	mr shen agreed to this , and looked on while his daughter adorned herself as a bride
1	awake , to whom can i describe my grief ,
1	when the music ceased , chih bade them prostrate themselves four times , then rise
1	i can ’ t be bothered right now
1	the box was opened and the gift explained
1	when shall we go for an outing , taking wine with us ?
1	hastily checking through the entries , he found that the first name on the list was hsun mei ; and his face lit up in a smile as the anxiety he had felt all day vanished
1	but not wanting anyone to see her weep , she went back in a pique to her room
1	thereupon she sent out to consult fortune-tellers , who returned the reply that the trouble had been caused by a woman born in the year of the rabbit
1	xifeng put both hands to her cheeks with a show of astonishment
1	i was just going to tell you myself when you hurried off
1	in the course of conversation jin rong ’ s mother described the quarrel in the school the previous day , giving a detailed account of the whole affair
1	by rights the old lady should have a handsome funeral
1	wang mien had not really gone far
1	they chatted until it was time for the meat
1	by now they had reached a fine palace blazing with colour , with a clump of bamboos in the courtyard , outside the door several pines
1	but how did you guess ?
1	personally , i can ’ t stand poplars
1	i haven ’ t seen them , said baochai
1	if i would known , i would not have found him a wife or ruined your daughter 's life !
1	they had now reached the back door of the pavilion of heavenly fragrance , where baoyu was amusing himself with some maids
1	if we do anything wrong , i was sent here by her ladyship and you can report me to her
1	i was an actor by profession , and when i came home i had nothing to do , so i have been making a living by training a small company
1	not wanting to mention the maid 's suicide , baochai sat by her aunt in silence until asked where she had come from
1	that 's right , agreed xifeng
1	how can you sleep just after a meal ?
1	everyone in the room burst out laughing
1	as her quarters are in the back and she 's such a tartar , nobody
1	pray ask them to join us , said wan
1	there are no respectable wangs left now , and we could not invite people from this house just after the old lady 's funeral ; so only cousin lian helped out a little
1	he went to chujung to see to the college repairs
1	the children were a wild lot
1	whatever business he had , he shouldn ’ t have gone out today , said li wan and the others
1	i ’ m not too cold ; i won ’ t wear it
1	the painting , propped against one wall , was covered by a piece of gauze
1	kuang chao−jen went in to him
1	he 's gone with whiskers mao to nanking to sell silk
1	after digesting these and laying a foundation with these three poets , go on to read tao yuanming , ying yang , xie lingyun , yuan ji , yu xin and bao zhaonumber in less than a year ’ s time , with your intelligence , you can count on becoming a poet
1	now the men putting up the funeral sheds outside want several hundred taels , but no silver has been issued
1	my father used to say that in the good old days of emperor hung wu from two pecks of rice you could brew twenty pints of wine ; but later , when emperor yung lo usurped the throne , everything changed , and two pecks would yield only fifteen or sixteen pints
1	while speaking she had copied out the prediction and handed it to the maid
1	and the steward went off to make his preparations
1	granny liu pays her first visit
1	they ’ re the image of each other , declared the four women
1	are you inviting some of the other young ladies ?
1	i ’ ll die before i breathe a word about this
1	did you see aunty ?
1	don ’ t worry , baoyu assured her
1	she gave an evasive answer
1	jia zheng at once fell on his knees
1	as a rule she meditated in solitude and she was therefore reluctant to call in someone today to keep her company
1	as the boat rowed across the lake , pu mo−ching remarked to mr hu : i heard there was some trouble in mr
1	baoyu promptly slipped off the kang and went to his cousin ’ s door , before which hung a somewhat worn red silk portière
1	but what a scoundrel that lampoonist must be !
1	you spoke of 'friends
1	what would people think if they saw ?
1	everyone passed this , and so the game ended
1	coming a few croppers should cure him
1	the old lady nodded and sighed
1	we should not wrong innocent people
1	i don ’ t want to go out , replied madam you , but madam zhu over there is unwell and xifeng is laid up too
1	please go back as fast as you can , nephew , and send a messenger to convey my regards and say i shall call on him tomorrow
1	baoyu told them with a chuckle
1	let her move in now , and after a year they can be formally married
1	while they were sipping tea , another maid announced , the new wife asks permission to pay her respects
1	only his neighbour , old chin , realized how remarkable he was ; for old chin was an intelligent man , though a peasant , and he had seen wang mien grow up
1	at once xiuyan came out to greet her with a smile
1	she scolded ruhua for her stupidity , saying eating too much rich food had addled her wits
1	— who saved his life , yet we never thanked them for it
1	have you heard the news ?
1	he was not back till dawn
1	accordingly , the next morning when their case came up , the magistrate simply gave them a brief warning and drove them out
1	i have read much of your distinguished work
1	mind the old lady does not scold you !
1	play 'the air to delight the spirit , cried chin
1	he has two other novelties : a screen and a musical clock , jia lian informed them
1	a servant reported , miss xichun has quarrelled with madam you ,
1	i shall have to wait for him to come back before i know what to do
1	so standing there by the table she finished all the food except two cream puffs , saying , i ’ ll keep these for my mother
1	zijuan ran to the kang to attend to her while the two other girls fell silent
1	the two brothers could not repress a sigh of admiration , feeling as if they had wandered into fairyland
1	only the dead are described as 'of sacred memory
1	stop versifying and writing couplets , and concentrate on studying eight-section essays
1	how about paddy-sweet cottage ’ ?
1	she 's the one who gave you your name , so she 's your godmother in a way
1	i must ask her where she 's actually gone and offer regular sacrifices to her
1	we ’ ve sent to ask him round and he should be coming tomorrow
1	after jia lan had left the court and thanked his examiner , he heard of the general amnesty and reported it to lady wang
1	aren ’ t you going to tidy yourself up ?
1	fan said , since you have business at home , do not let us detain you
1	we may not be afraid of him , still it ’ s something to worry about
1	hsiao chinhsuan and his two friends had run up bills at the shop and eating house , and could not leave till they paid ; so they asked tu to help them out
1	now , abashed by the memory of baoyu 's past friendship with him , he treated her even more kindly , deliberately showing her the pale green sash which baoyu had given him in exchange
1	but the officials i have seen have all come to a bad end
1	kuang asked his brother−in−law to take his wife home with a letter to his brother explaining that she would invest some money in the shop and draw what she needed each day
1	she reached seeping fragrance pavilion as li wan and the , girls , just back from lady wang ’ s apartments , were laughing at baochai ’ s account of how xiangling had been versifying and talking in her sleep
1	but siqi had just emerged from a cave and stopped to fasten her skirt
1	and what could i give her to eat ?
1	decoction to improve the respiration , fortify
1	the lady dowager and the others believed her story
1	but at least let us leave jung here to serve you wine
1	men may say that in idle moments i ape children
1	if you kept me for no reason , it would do you no good and would break up my family
1	tell me as soon as the old lady comes , she said
1	may i beg you , sir , not to condemn him ?
1	if i would known you would keep talking so long , i would have put on something warmer
1	so baoyu was left to amuse himself with the other maids at dice or draughts
1	mind you don ’ t fall !
1	a limited number of licentiates each year were made stipendiaries or salaried licentiates , so called because they received a stipend from the government
1	and i ’ m always the one that gets into trouble
1	nothing too common , said tanchun
1	of all us girls here i ’ m the only one to lose face through my maid
1	it was my idea , said li wan
1	and as the proverb says : poverty at home is not poverty , but poverty on the road is killing
1	on the twentieth he left the yamen , to travel back to wuho by way of nanking
1	you do not say so !
1	by this time they had entered the kitchen where lianhua showed her the bottle
1	finally they went to sleep
1	and the answer is a single word
1	were you vice−president chou 's student ?
1	when you were in nanking , said their host to yu yuta , did you hear that the mayor of nanking had gone to peking ?
1	on either side stood a smart row of stewards , and behind them were hat−stands bearing official announcements
1	he has gone back to the garden
1	and if i stoop in order to show respect to talent , future compilers of the local chronicles will certainly devote a chapter to my praise
1	spring , summer , autumn and winter , in wind and rain , what time have we to sit idle ?
1	and since the girls gave themselves no airs but were all good to her cousin , she tried likewise to make herself agreeable to them
1	caiping brought them tea
1	this is an unexpected encounter
1	now daiyu naturally preferred solitude to society
1	the jade hill crumbles , never to rise again ;
1	if your sisterin−law and nephews are stubborn , that will be your bad luck
1	with petals a fresh red , leaves emerald green ;
1	and that young lady would do , as far as looks , intelligence and family go
1	now aunt xue , lady wang and the others withdrew one by one to spare lady xing embarrassment
1	no other family here has lanterns like these
1	by now the fire was more than ten feet high and balls of flame were falling into their courtyard
1	if he wants a good party , why does not he invite those newly−rich scholars who have passed the provincial and metropolitan examinations ?
1	chrysanthemum adorning a desk with style
1	your old friend and fellow-provincial from jinling , i was posted to the capital last year , delighted to be near you ; and you did me the honour , for which i shall ever be grateful , to agree to link our families by marriage
1	what i like about baochai is her sense of dignity
1	once in the back room with lady wang , xiren threw herself on her knees and burst into tears
1	i think your husband is already very accomplished ; did not your father like him because he was a brilliant young scholar ?
1	luckily for me , yesterday i dipped into the selected writings of different dynasties and found this name
1	xiangyun remarked gaily , questions like 'with what hermit are you taking refuge ?
1	how can you say such things !
1	lin daiyu in life was no ordinary mortal ; in death she is no ordinary ghost , said the apparition with a scornful laugh
1	i would rather look after buffaloes
1	because your lawsuit dragged on for a year , you imagined it must be the runner
1	he ’ s the nephew of mrs jia huang of the east lane , called mingyan through the window
1	i must have it out with that young devil !
1	in chapters forty−four to forty−seven , in the sections dealing with the morals and conventions of wuho county , the author 's views are sometimes directly expressed
1	so suppressing her grief she bade them all farewell , heart-rending as she found it to leave the other maids
1	i sent in my card today as a sign of respect
1	she took the reel and paid out the cord
1	he bowed and raised his clasped hands in salute , but daiyu simply ignored him , walking straight off to find the other girls
1	then they chatted a while
1	better tell the purveyors to have a whole lot of small gauze bags made
1	she had uncommon features , bright eyes and graceful eyebrows , and although no great beauty she possessed considerable charm
1	it was a mistake my marrying you because that ’ s made me step down one generation , as if i were the one chasing after power and profit
1	thereupon the runner produced two hundred coins with which he bought wine and meat
1	that sister-in-law there brought me some just now , put in granny liu hastily
1	on their return , baochai asked , did you see madam [ ian ?
1	we must have been fated to meet , sister-in-law
1	when they found the courtyard so quiet xiangyun walked towards the servants ' quarters in search of xiren , but daiyu peeped through the gauze of baoyu 's window
1	she is here now , and our master would like to marry her to you , sir
1	the ladies uttered cries of astonishment and hurriedly tried to slip into the inner room
1	the more i see of it , the less i want to leave
1	baoyu in front pretended not to have heard them and walked on a few paces , then stopped
1	why carry on like this ?
1	tomorrow you must try to persuade the master not to question those girls , but instead to fetch a broker to take them away and sell them
1	the old lady said everyone worked so hard while baoyu was ill that , now he 's better and all the vows have been paid , each one would be rewarded according to grade
1	she may do something for us for old times ’ sake
1	at first he ignored these rumours ; but when more and more people began to talk of it he secretly packed his belongings and , without telling old chin , slipped away by night to kuaichi mountain
1	i ’ ve already sorted out all her clothes and things and put them aside
1	if you have some-thing on your mind , why not ask her tomorrow ?
1	with her brother in jail , how can his sister get married ?
1	a table and chairs were arranged , the table laid , and they had dinner with the girls
1	jia lian replied thoughtfully , yes , was not it zhou rui 's godson whom master zhen wanted to punish that year ?
1	then the two brothers went in , not changing their manner to him , and expressed their indignation on his behalf
1	hurry up and kowtow to her
1	the two brothers hastily stopped him
1	i ’ m for ever finding him fooling about with them
1	a boat was moored at his gate , and to visit any of the other islands he had simply to ferry across ; but without this boat , not a soul could reach him
1	those are two sets of clothes given to the old lady on previous birthdays , she said
1	jia zheng promptly rose to his feet
1	getting up rather sheepishly , he dusted off his clothes and walked down the hill to make his way back again to happy red court
1	please rest here , your
1	the reincarnations of some former lovers have recently gathered here , and so i have come to look for a chance to mete out love and longing
1	i ’ m going to fish like hang taigong , number he announced as he walked down the stone steps and sat down by the pool
1	they had feasted for some time when whiskers wang led in four servants carrying a chest
1	she wants him to explain that she ’ s not well enough to go herself
1	scrap this one and write another
1	what a silly girl !
1	yen 's room , and they went in
1	she gave me a scolding for that
1	do not worry , said baochai
1	miaoyu promptly ushered them into the courtyard , luxuriant with trees and flowers
1	he regretted having passed on the news to lai wang , and was scared stiff for worrying what to say when jia jian returned
1	there are several different designs -- sprays of blossom , floating clouds and bats , butterflies and flowers -- the colours so vivid and the gauze so soft , i have never seen anything like it
1	you are so tickled at selling her life for a hundred taels , you would have been even better pleased that year to have given her to the elder master for a still bigger
1	chunyan had to accept it then
1	if you are not well looked after outside and catch cold , that will be bad
1	but why not talk openly instead of in this hole-and-corner fashion ?
1	since that woman has no son living , one of our sons should inherit my brother 's property
1	tearing himself loose he rounded on baoyu and qin zhong
1	she exclaimed in surprise
1	then only can we send a report to the government
1	thanking him again and again , hsun mei saw him off to the boundary of the county
1	gentlemen like that are certainly rare !
1	then they finished their meal and paid the bill
1	you must see to things too
1	he ordered some pages , go in and get one of the old women to have a quiet word with master bao and ask him to come out
1	in the old days when the sixth patriarch huineng of the southern sect went to shaozhou in search of a teacher , he heard that the fifth patriarch hongren was in the monastery on mount huangmei , so he took a job as cook there
1	of course i ’ ll say goodbye to you , promised xianglian
1	tu shao−ching went to the inner chambers
1	being an orphan with no one to care for her , this girl had been given the name she meaning waif ’ and assigned rough jobs to do
1	why try to hide this from me , friend ?
1	when pao wen−ching returned to the yamen he praised chi wei−hsiao 's fine features to prefect hsiang , predicting that the young man had a great future before him
1	who do you mean ?
1	since kao was afraid of being involved , he encouraged feng to go
1	one day kuang chao−jen was standing at his door when a man in a big cap and blue gown came along
1	this year in the capital , because of my good calligraphy , i was promoted to the post of secretary in the imperial patent office
1	jia zhen found the lady dowager and with a bow informed her :
1	last year when i had a chill and a bilious attack , and doctor wang examined me , he said i couldn ’ t take strong drugs like ephedra , gypsum and citrus trifoliata
1	this is that iron−armed chang , who tricked my uncles with the false head !
1	small groups of village children would tag after him , laughing ; but he did not mind them
1	caressing her daughter aunt xue told daiyu , this child means as much to me as xifeng does to the old lady
1	at once i kowtowed and replied that it was jia daihua
1	it stings a bit but it 's nothing serious , baoyu assured her
1	kao and wan came down from the pavilion and walked up to them
1	mingyan was the first to be hit
1	having tucked the quilt around mr chen , she snuggled up to him to sleep again
1	but to be fair to your cousins , i pity the poor girls
1	whoever wins first place among the palace scholars shall drink a cup
1	but i would not advise you to go to mr wan 's house , because you wo not be admitted
1	gazing into the mirror at her emaciated face ,
1	granny liu edged forward and said , greetings , gentlemen
1	this is an inspiring occasion
1	writing of men i knew in the yangtse valley has made me sick at heart
1	xiren saw that baoyu was wearing his red archer ’ s tunic embroidered with golden dragons and lined with fox-fur under a fringed bluish-grey sable coat
1	a former student of mine who lives in wuhu passed the examination the other day , and when i went to congratulate him he gave me twenty−four taels of silver
1	tall bamboos tempt the phoenix to alight
1	the lady dowager however protested , just after a death their house is unclean
1	zhang san happened to be stooping to pick something up , and my brother , whose hand slipped , struck the top of his head with the wine bowl and killed him
1	since sheyue was asleep , wuer had to get up
1	hence madam you and xifeng remained standing while , after a show of declining , lai da ’ s mother and three or four other old nurses sat down
1	she blushed crimson again
1	crawling into the cabin he thanked all the passengers , then lay down to sleep ; and in two more days he gradually recovered
1	jia lian hurried back then to ask xifeng for money for the coffin and funeral rites
1	in jia she 's absence , she had to send jia lian to the sun family to find out the situation
1	the autumn wind makes moan ;
1	each time this happened zijuan had to comfort him
1	if i tell you , it will upset you too
1	fancy letting them have their own way like this !
1	a great force of infantry and cavalry has reached drum tower slope !
1	not till nearly midnight did the brigade general go to the library to see the clerk , having ordered his attendants to withdraw
1	these reflections upset him again , reducing him to tears , and as xiren and the others had left the room he indulged in a fit of weeping
1	she has induced her young lady to join her lover
1	this is not my affair
1	jia zheng and jia she told jia lian to see him out
1	put in the runners hastily
1	all right , said li wan
1	when you lost your jade , she asked miaoyu to consult the planchette ; and when nobody could understand what it wrote she assured me secretly that maioyu could foretell the future and had attained enlightenment
1	it was only right for him to pay his respects
1	then entrusting the family affairs to some clansmen and old servants , he left with his mother and sister
1	otherwise just take yourself off , i won ’ t have you kneeling to me
1	which maid is going to catch it this time ?
1	why have i never seen one ?
1	i ’ ve always wanted to take a peep at them , remarked madam you
1	seizing tight hold of zijuan he refused to let her go
1	i am tu shao−ching , agreed tu with a smile
1	if someone really offends you , you pretend not to hear so as to keep out of harm ’ s way
1	from his fourth uncle 's grave
1	you will have to spend the night here and take a boat tomorrow afternoon
1	out of curiosity , ma went up to the young man , pretending that he wanted to have his fortune told , only to discover that the youth was reading his own new selection of essays
1	yesterday xiangyun treated us , she said
1	with these reflections , he felt put out at not being able to identify the girl and he studied her more closely
1	a thousand lithe east wind blows ,
1	baoqin was young and warm-hearted , intelligent too , and well-educated from an early age
1	and when he had finished she put the list away
1	there must have been a reason
1	how can you be so soft , miss ?
1	and xiuyan had a sense of self-respect
1	kuo tieh−pi agreed to this
1	he was a provincial graduate , and had served as a magistrate in his time
1	we ’ ve only just arrived , he told her
1	he is the grandson of our uncle who was prefect of nanchang
1	let others pluck laurel in the moon and dance
1	she accepted me as her mother , so she ’ s my daughter , was the reply
1	all these questions you ask show that you are a pig-headed pedant and wo not get you anywhere !
1	if you smash them because you like the sound , all right
1	we are born to put up with hardships , madam , and you to enjoy good fortune , replied granny liu with a smile
1	it will assuredly record anything said
1	kao is here , he announced
1	so they gave me this nickname
1	that evening yingchun stayed in her old quarters , and her girl cousins and the maids lavished affection on her
1	they had therefore asked leave to return to attend to the funeral
1	he was hesitating when he heard his name and turned to find that the old lady , lady wang , baochai and xiren had gathered round , tearfully calling him , and he himself was still lying in his bed
1	the moon , now in mid sky , was more dazzlingly lovely than ever
1	they found her lying on the ground , foaming at the mouth
1	do wait a bit , cousin lin
1	the prince of beijing in ceremonial robes had come out to the corridor to meet them
1	presently they were invited into the library to eat , but still they made no reference to the matter
1	some questions to ask him
1	but more of this in the next chapter
1	and when i asked about their daily life , her eyes filled with tears and she made some evasive answer
1	i suckled you , i raised you ; but now that you don ’ t need my milk any more , you push me aside and let your maids insult me
1	can her highness make over the imperial treasury to us ?
1	instead of making good use of the proceeds , however , he kept the silver at home to use as he needed
1	curiously enough , writers and scholars nowadays refer to wang mien as the commissioner of records , though actually he never served as an official for a single day , as i have tried to make clear
1	we mustn ’ t raid miss baochai ’ s quarters
1	for not doing that you fully deserve a beating
1	i am under such an obligation to you that , if i am spared , i am determined to repay you in full
1	pouring out respectful greetings as he entered , fan chin kowtowed again and again
1	lady wang asked what all this was about , and xifeng reported what had happened the previous day
1	it ’ s you who ’ ve spoilt her
1	not so vulgar , was it , that sudden idea of mine ?
1	it would take one of fan chengda ’ s poems on country life to do justice to this place
1	are you going to sleep outside again tonight ?
1	meanwhile baoyu and tanchun had also arrived and sat down to listen to this disquisition on poetry
1	after consulting together they write their prescriptions , but the medicine hasn ’ t done her the least bit of good
1	there are still some ways in which he could make use of some of us leading citizens
1	they are having the time of their lives !
1	it was not until the candles had been lit that a clatter of hooves was heard in the street
1	and if he is not able to save you , they will kill me too for talking !
1	it ’ s true you re one grade lower , but i know you ’ re all rich
1	baoyu , listening , was overwhelmed with grief
1	will it come back next year to see the blossom , i wonder ?
1	the consequences may be serious
1	give it to lai sheng
1	i have my share of literary fame , responded kuang
1	meanwhile the lady dowager had been looking through the window gauze at the back yard
1	do tell us before you leave what 's your good luck in a stretch of bad , urged baoyu
1	just then someone came in to announce , we ’ ve made everything ready
1	only when xifeng had sent this woman away did she go over to the old lady ’ s place
1	is there only one kite like this in the world ?
1	but during the new year festival we wanted to invite you to drink a few cups of wine with us
1	i then appointed an auspicious day
1	they have squeezed enough and no hard work ever comes their way
1	why come crying to me ?
1	then lady wang gave way to weeping too until caiyun who was attending her tugged her sleeve
1	she has maids in the garden to wait on her hand and foot , and i ’ ve prepared rooms for her in our place exactly like my own , where i meant to take her as soon as the old lady knew
1	let all three of them tangle together , that will be amusing
1	but we hope you wo not be long , sir
1	such creatures talk nothing but nonsense
1	i don ’ t believe it , replied mrs lin
1	not stopping to ask any questions she sprang up and hurried out , followed by suyun and biyue
1	the boy handed it to them
1	suppose we ask aunt xue over for a consultation here this evening ?
1	although , not to mention a concubine ’ s child , even one of the maids in our family is better than the daughters of other households
1	this is all xiangyun ’ s doing , said daiyu
1	in place of trees and flowers there was a profusion of rare creepers , vines and trailers , which festooned the artificial mountains , grew through the rocks , hung from the eaves , twined round the pillars and carpeted the steps
1	having agreed on this they retired for the night
1	why are you standing here all alone under the eaves ?
1	the splash it made startled the four girls
1	baochai said , that ’ s good sense from a flibbertigibbet like you , but you still talk too bluntly
1	he first met old mrs you and third sister ; then second sister came out to greet him , and he addressed her as before as second cousin
1	they all admired the subtlety of these riddles , baochai , however , commented , the first eight deal with authenticated incidents in history , but it ’ s harder for us to understand the last two fictitious ones
1	lin zhixiao ’ s wife agreed and left
1	yet cold the fingers from chess played by quiet window
1	if you use green jade ’ again , won ’ t that look as if you ’ re challenging her judgement ?
1	seeing fangguan still sleeping on the edge of the kang she got up quickly to wake her
1	make it five catties a day then , said the lady dowager
1	they were told to sit down and handed a fiddle and a lute
1	i think he ’ s better anyway than huan
1	besides , i know nothing about writing on sand
1	we have been waiting for you for some time
1	fangguan lying on her back in a flowered bodice , red pants and green socks was thrashing her legs wildly , quite out of breath from laughing
1	daiyu asked with a smile
1	i did not expect to bump into an official who would make so much trouble for me
1	better let master bao take the blame to keep us all out of trouble
1	let ’ s drink a few cups , then those who like can leave first
1	i ’ ve just put some scented rouge on my lips , she whispered
1	he says he won ’ t come because the master hasn ’ t invited him
1	the truth is , gentlemen , i am growing old and useless , said chou , now in his cups
1	not one of the bastards is here !
1	the dream of the southern tributary state
1	i do not know how to express my gratitude !
1	is mr wei a friend of yours , uncle ?
1	when hare and tiger meet ,
1	after hearing of such a feat , we should consume a whole gallon of wine !
1	then they went their different ways , pinger rejoining xifeng who asked her what tanchun had wanted her for
1	say one word more , and i ’ ll bury a white blade in you and pull it out red !
1	i was so frantic that , before coming back , i faced northwest and burst out howling
1	xifeng clowns to amuse her elders
1	though the lute is a refined instrument , i don ’ t think much of it
1	granny liu 's seat was on the east ; below it
1	that same evening the body was put in the coffin , and the next morning they hired eight carriers to bear the coffin to the ancestral graveyard
1	tang went neither to the city nor to call on other officials , but had a villa built beside the river , installed his books and lute there , and taught his sons
1	even those relatives and friends at your feast either went home or are keeping well away until they know the upshot
1	can ’ t you make do by finding other commissions at home ?
1	lai wang ’ s wife came with the interest on that three hundred taels , which i put away
1	master bao , it ’ s getting colder ; better put on more clothes , he advised
1	he fetched his horsewhip and gave him a few dozen strokes all over his back till xue pan , pretty well sober now , yelped with pain
1	that ’ s a good idea
1	jia lian called from the room
1	now the jias are the bridegroom ’ s family and the wangs have no one in the capital
1	i don ’ t think accounts need be turned in at all , said baochai
1	baochai was just giving xiangling some instructions when aunt xue suddenly let out a cry :
1	but if you kill him today , it means you want me to die too
1	swallowing her resentment she went on and found xifeng , sure enough , chatting in li wan 's apartment
1	if the dead man is zhou rui 's godson , then from her ladyship down the whole household is involved
1	the runners told him
1	but he was thinking : our third and fourth masters are a queer couple
1	but please , miss , for old time ’ s sake , let me die here with you !
1	she sobbed even more bitterly , so distraught that she threw up the herbal medicine she had just taken
1	told to pay his respects , he complied
1	he was to accuse him of marrying during a period of state and family mourning , against imperial decree and unknown to his parents ; of relying on his wealth and power to force zhang hua to renounce his engagement ; and of taking a second wife without the consent of his first
1	i ’ ve reported this to the mistresses
1	well aware of what he wanted , she only made a show of resisting
1	when , after the meal , tu mentioned that he wanted to find a house , chih heng−shan was delighted
1	now that baoyu ’ s ill , just-leave it to-us to do our very best to find it
1	at first his father tried to discipline him , but he ’ s long since given that up
1	why ask for trouble ?
1	the dice is thrown and wins the dots are red
1	if you really love me , aunt , will you be my foster-mother ?
1	so daiyu accompanied her to alpinia court
1	they hired horses and , accompanied by attendants , set off for kaoyao county
1	yoo bowed to him and tea was served
1	when this man saw niu yu−fu he put down his brush and came over
1	the imperial envoys asked after his father and instructed him , come tomorrow to the imperial treasury to receive your bounty
1	yuanyang ordered some maids to drag granny liu back to her table
1	why , cousin , he cried , surely you are sufficiently well versed in ancient and modern literature to know the title of that opera
1	do bring him in and let me have a look at him
1	i will get him to meet me in my uncles ' home to impress them
1	nowadays baoyu talks in such an ambiguous way , blowing hot and cold by turns , i can ’ t tell what he means , she thought
1	after jiang yuhan had moved on , there was some speculation about him
1	madam you and li wan shared a third table with xiren and caiyun
1	why , sir , chuckled the nanny , lowering her voice , i see now why the boy told me they ’ d invited a new doctor
1	this done , he fetched a big iron lamp he had brought from hangchow , filled it with oil and sat by his father 's side to read essays
1	then tanchun came to ask me to call on xifeng with her , but i felt too lazy to go
1	i remember when i first went there , i no sooner presented my card than he sent two attendants out to help me from my sedan−chair
1	it ’ s one that madam lian gave me
1	i have long wanted to make his acquaintance , but never had the opportunity !
1	this has always puzzled me
1	no need to tether these fine steeds with ropes , galloping round the walls how fierce they seem !
1	if they see this account of your exploits , i am sure they will be glad to write of them
1	and grub for money all their lives
1	in a few more days we will pack up and go back
1	but this time it was really my own fault
1	the old woman reached out with her chopsticks but failed to secure an egg
1	the saint 's image occupied the middle of the temple ; on the left was a stork and on the right a stone slab inscribed with twenty characters
1	he roared to baoyu ’ s other pages chuyao , saohong and moyu , all of whom were ready for mischief
1	so she treated her with contempt
1	i never expected you to grow so proud that flow you have no use for me while you are so fond of outsiders like baochai and xifeng
1	the more modest you are , the more respected you ’ ll be
1	would you like to meet him ?
1	i can easily fetch them for her
1	the reason for their fall , not far to seek ,
1	if you copy sutras now , i ’ m afraid you ’ ll wear yourself out
1	have you all finished ?
1	and since he came from a good family , pao would not train him for the stage but made him study for two years before taking him into the business
1	convinced by this reasoning , xifeng replied , in that case , i will go tomorrow and try
1	doctor wang felt the pulse for some time , then that of the other wrist , after which he and jia lian withdrew to take seats in the outer room
1	he ’ s raving again , they said
1	if i find you being too soft , i shall make no allowances for you , even though your family has been in service here for three or four generations
1	do not you really understand ?
1	after some talk about home affairs , they went to bed
1	the fact is , this business is more or less solved ; we ’ ve even found out as well who took the things missing from the mistress ’ place the other day
1	don ’ t let baoyu run wild
1	such was her plan
1	won ’ t you stay here for a few days , aunt ?
1	but my mother recently contracted a chill and has been out of sorts for two days
1	as my uncle and cousin are away , we mustn ’ t leave her here too long as this is a minor funeral
1	if there 's poison in the dish , xifeng explained , the silver will show it
1	i ’ ll put it away at once
1	the heaviest responsibility devolved upon xifeng , who , unlike the others , had not a moment ’ s respite ; but she was always so eager to shine , so anxious to give no one a handle against her , that she strove to carry out her many tasks as if they were nothing
1	if you both agree to be more careful in future , so that nobody loses face , i ’ ll ask master bao to take the blame
1	i was afraid she would scold me for over-salting it , and did not know what to do ; but then she moved to the hack of the room , and while she was not looking i changed the bowls round
1	in that case let me settle the rhymes , said yingchun
1	the prefect had invited them to a meal
1	husband and wife fell out
1	leaving the others to chat , she strolled into the bamboo grove before the steps and concentrated on thinking , deaf and blind to everything going on around her
1	concubine chao must keep her place
1	by the way , i have something to ask you
1	there were still some famous actors then
1	let me find out for you
1	go on with your fun , and don ’ t stop eating or drinking , she said when she had sat down on the rug
1	distressed to hear her talk like this , jia zheng and the others knelt down again and pleaded , do not take it so hard , madam !
1	your presence here contaminates this place and contaminates my door
1	until then i ’ ll fast , chant sutras and look after my mother while waiting for him to come and marry me , even if i have to wait a hundred years
1	mrs lin advised xiren and qingwen to brew him some puer tea
1	as for using his name , we ’ ve done that since he was a child , as well you know , on the old lady ’ s orders
1	i have seen the poem myself
1	look , cousin lin ’ s already left — she couldn ’ t last out any longer
1	don ’ t drag me in
1	it seems to me time to arrange a match for the young master
1	i did not ask for a single cent
1	i understand , he cried , clutching hold of them both
1	several maids dressed in red and green rose from the terrace and hurried to greet them with smiles
1	but in my seven or eight months here i have had nothing but a little meat and wine—not a copper have i seen
1	why did miss xue get the same as me and not miss lin ?
1	too frightened to pick up his scissors , the boy scrambled to his feet to run outdoors
1	tell her i wanted to send her word that her husband is staying in sweet dew temple in wuhu county
1	it was you who told him that
1	suspicion poisoned her mind
1	so miss shi is frantic
1	as the proverb says , injustice will cry out
1	touched by her besotted master
1	there are reasons against it , replied mr ma gravely
1	now magistrate tang happened to be the son of a concubine , and when he read the statement he thought , laws are one thing , but the human factor has to be taken into account too
1	we shall have to hire some for the servants , but how can the ladies take hired mourning carriages ?
1	his father-in-law tricked him , however , by pocketing half the sum and buying him some poor fields and a ramshackle cottage
1	whatever happens , do not let my aunt come over here !
1	what shall we do ?
1	asked one of them
1	why do not you lend them a room for a couple of days ?
1	senior licentiate yen invited them to take the seats of honour and , offering them wine , said , i should have invited you to my poor home , but i felt it was unworthy of you ; and , since you have to go to the yamen presently , i wanted to avoid unnecessary delay
1	i seem to glimpse some vision ;
1	so little by little these turned into gambling parties
1	the next loser was uncle xing , who when asked for a song said , i ca not sing
1	dear cousin , how fascinating you make it sound !
1	but servants of the throne like ourselves should be careful how we discuss affairs of state
1	all the villagers came and bowed to the ground to thank him
1	i worry too much about my children , she sighed
1	now jia zhen and jia rong urged their elders to mount their chairs or horses
1	what else is there ?
1	recently it has been rumoured that he has entered buddhist orders too
1	now that 's settled , put in baoyu , let 's go to paddy-sweet cottage
1	when i said i lost it outside , you wouldn ’ t have it , he reminded her
1	but some vestiges still behind the screen we discover
1	what else could fami
1	once outside , lai wang presented a packaged gratuity to the peasant family , whose womenfolk came to thank them
1	i didn ’ t want to invite some people , not others
1	when he had been served a meal , the old nurses , li gui and others strolled with him through the temple grounds till he was tired , when they took him back inside for another rest
1	are you escorted by the god of clouds ,
1	they petitioned the emperor on his behal { and the sovereign in his great goodness granted him an audience
1	it may be important
1	gaze up to catch the message from the phoenix , and sigh your answer to the azure air
1	not yet divined the fate in store for me ,
1	she hurried across and pulled the nurse aside
1	i want to go back but have none of you with me
1	but as yu leant out from his cabin window to watch , he saw another man on the bank opposite throw himself into the river !
1	then he borrowed a few taels from tu shen−ching , packed his luggage , and crossed the river to travel to tienchang
1	baoyu clapped his hands
1	yuchuan tastes some lotus-leaf broth
1	aunt xue ’ s anger over the scene with jingui upset her liver , bringing on a pain in her left side
1	it had papered latticed windows on all four sides
1	what brings you here ?
1	baoyu had to comply then
1	big as he is , he ’ s unique in never having had any proper schooling
1	she also allotted them the sanrie monthly allowances as were issued by the accountants ' office to members of the rong mansion
1	it would be still more senseless to offend any of these girls
1	stay here for a couple of days , he said
1	when no one else was about but zijuan , he took her hand
1	when i was young we had a pavilion like this too at home , she said
1	my name is pao , and i am a native of nanking
1	thus we can not arrest him
1	as you went in you saw three rooms with an eastern exposure
1	let 's go back to your place , shall we ?
1	he is for ever taking his wife to taverns
1	but with your cousin pan in this fix and your cousin ke away to sort things out , there was only baochai at home — and what could she do ?
1	in agony , he bowed
1	pao wen−ching and his son wept as if their hearts would break
1	until it was revived by being watered every day with sweet dew by the attendant shen ying
1	if we did , people would complain
1	when his father died he shut himself up and dared not see a soul ; so he was always being cheated , but had no one to complain to
1	but there ’ s another thing : people are bound to be worried by our absence
1	now , though life on a farm is hard , we have bought quite a few mu of land and sunk a well
1	surely not crude , one of his protégés remonstrated
1	we ’ ve been like brother and sister since we were small and played naughty tricks together
1	so this is where you ’ d run off to
1	the other made no answer , looking torn between grief and joy
1	xue pan stamped his foot frantically
1	when all were assembled and they had talked for a while , jia zheng 's messenger arrived and presented his letter , announcing that the master would soon be home
1	a native of kwangtung , who was sentenced to exile at the border of shensi and was travelling there with his wife , had died here
1	if the master beats you to make you confess , your only way out is to refuse to admit it
1	into grand view garden
1	are you a friend , sir , of prefect li ?
1	there was a mr niu pu−yi too , but unfortunately i only knew him by reputation : we never met
1	but now his wife had stepped forward to say : i am the only one who understands you
1	today she had been catching crickets there when she saw behind a rock a gaily embroidered sachet
1	besides , i thought , it ’ s sharing our masters ’ good fortune that ’ s brought us this undreamed-of honour , so i don ’ t mind even if it bankrupts us
1	i ’ ve met this cousin before , he declared at the end of his scrutiny
1	lu has important business and asks master chu to go back
1	he entered , holding his breath , and saw the son of heaven in civilian costume on his splendid throne
1	then there is your cousin lin 's
1	that ’ s the best of the lot
1	she kowtowed sullenly a few times , without offering tea or shoes , then went straight back to her room
1	jia zheng saw his brother , sons and nephews next , and when the younger ones had paid their respects he informed them that the next morning he would sacrifice in the ancestral temple
1	i joined the expedition against green maple city , and , because i spent too much on reconstructing the city , have only just succeeded in making good the deficit
1	where would she have seen one ?
1	not the kind you would get from perfumed pastilles , scent-balls or sachets
1	taking only eight runners in red and black caps , and with bailiff chai in attendance , he went straight down to the village
1	above its door was the inscription warm scented arbour , and perfumed air struck warm on their cheeks as attendants lifted the red felt portiere
1	only as she stepped into the courtyard was she quietly apprised of this by some serving-women ; but it was too late to retreat now that her arrival had been announced and lady wang had come out to meet her
1	though he 's supposed to wail by the coffin , when the ladies come he spends all his time peeping at them round the curtain before it
1	chu−ko can not recognize jelly−fish either
1	if you want to talk about character and foundation , tell me who has achieved the supreme primeval state ?
1	i hope i get something good , she thought while drawing a lot
1	you ’ d better write out the half you ’ ve done , tanchun
1	here he invited them to sit to enjoy the quiet beauty of the bamboos and boulders , the birds and the fish−pond ; and presently prefect chu , who had changed into country dress , came out leaning on a stick to accompany them
1	so this romance was an empty dream , a chance encounter between an ill-fated young couple
1	now there were many girls , temperamentally different , in the garden ; and as xifeng considered it unnecessary to open up another house for xiuyan , she decided the best thing would be to put her up with yingchun ; for then if later lady xing heard that her niece was dissatisfied , no blame would attach to xifeng
1	each used a different approach
1	i know all about it
1	in the gold tray by it , on which zhao feiyan once danced , was the quince thrown in fun by an lushan at lady yang , number which had wounded her breast
1	i dropped a hint to the old lady , and i suspect she must have told xifeng
1	xifeng ’ s plans were already laid
1	my health is not up to it , replied tu
1	after reading them ca not you understand ?
1	what do you think , sir ?
1	all right , you go over first , but don ’ t let a word leak out
1	exclaimed the lady dowager
1	by now some maids had brought him a rinse-bowl and some strong tea to rinse his mouth
1	but zhang the taoist immediately objected , that 's a charitable thought , master bao ; but even if these things are of little value , some of them are well made
1	those who like to look at the moon from a height can come here ; those who prefer to see its reflection in water can go there
1	he had to run away
1	just now , though , i had a dream
1	passes on any news to her
1	, 'waxed sandals come from far away , and 'chants endless poems ' describe visiting the chrysanthemum all right ?
1	she treats my cousin like her own sister ; in fact she ’ s even fonder of her than i am
1	when the waiter asked what dishes they wanted , ching ordered twelve cents ' worth of assorted meat , one plate of pork crackling and one of bean sprouts
1	scores of torches were lit , and scores of devils leapt forward with iron prongs and spears
1	just think of your health
1	do not trouble , had already made himself scarce
1	it 's my turn next , and if i ca not think of a line i will drink with you
1	get her another pair
1	for instance , there are profligates in the world who delight only in physical beauty , singing , dancing , endless merriment and constant rain-and-cloud games
1	you are old , said the girl
1	once home , the two brothers had to see to some business and entertain guests for several days
1	zijuan and her other maids pleaded hard with her
1	this reduced aunt xue once more to tears
1	it was weighed by the market balance , which gives thirteen and a half cents less to the tael than the official balance
1	may i trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me ?
1	it ’ s a pity to give a lecher like him the insignia of the fifth or sixth rank
1	when i have recopied my poems , i will bring them to you with my notes on old texts and other miscellaneous writings for your criticism
1	then drink this cup of wine
1	daiyu could not suppress a laugh
1	now that she 's coming to the capital you can feel much easier in your mind , madam
1	dozens of different suggestions were made , all of them stereotyped cliches ; for jia zheng ’ s secretaries were well aware that he meant to test his son ’ s ability
1	he described the dressing-down they had been given
1	let us revert to jingui , who had sent baochan with refreshments to sound out xue ke
1	at sight of him , they exchanged knowing glances
1	what is your honourable name ?
1	stop teasing , sister , he begged
1	in fact , it ’ s bad for a patient to have to change her clothes four or five times a day and sit up to see the doctor
1	i ’ ve my own means of reckoning , though
1	kuang chaojen bowed and knelt down , but his brother raised him up and made him sit in the hall while he told him of the hard times they had had
1	lady wang suggested , go and entertain him first , sir
1	the old lady had these directions sent to jia lian with instructions to see to -this quickly
1	that 's why you can keep my son-in-law in jail
1	it ’ s still early , said the duke , coming over to press him to stay
1	so far her home beyond the distant mountains
1	you must not take it so to heart
1	you are the one who started this
1	ouguan went off cheerfully with the other two
1	while they were talking , two priests came out from magnolia monastery to invite niu pu 's companion to a meal , so he said goodbye and left
1	the others saw that after baoyu 's revival his mind had cleared , and by taking medicine every day he steadily recovered his health
1	we must use the name baoyu a couple of hundred times a day ; so it ’ s strange that you should choose this to pick fault
1	in the afternoon , you ’ ll expound texts and read essays
1	missed ; but since master lian left there have been fine goings-on in the outer quarters !
1	the servants had been afraid that jia lian on his return would bring them to book , not grasping the situation ; but to their surprise he knew more about it than they did
1	then we all burst out laughing and the old lady had to laugh too
1	here ’ s a granny asking for you
1	promising to do so , xifeng left
1	how old are you ?
1	on no account look into the front — remember that !
1	yet already you are full of worldly desires
1	but leaping again , with all its might , it came within a foot of kuo
1	standing petrified baoyu asked , what is this place ?
1	but recently she ’ s stopped coming here so often , and i have to go to school
1	give us a few more taels of silver , and tomorrow we shall act as hosts and invite over a hundred of your relatives to a feast
1	daiyu commented with a smile , you ’ ve no lack of ideas but the language lacks elegance , because you ’ re restricted by having read so few poems
1	but he 's extremely timid
1	let ’ s play some drinking games , baoyu proposed
1	having taken her seat granny liu picked up the chopsticks , but found them too awkward to manage
1	now as jia lian was on his way out a page had approached and reported , the elder master wants you , sir
1	the woman who admitted them reported , thieves were fighting here , and our young lady passed out for terror
1	the next morning he got up early , took the silver to the market and bought about a bushel of beans and several pigs which he kept in a sty
1	quite right , agreed li wan
1	but when you just ignore me and i ca not tell why , i am at my wits ' end and do not know what to do
1	i ’ ve kept xiluan and sijie here , she said
1	raising his eyes to her face he
1	these two volumes contain all the poems i have written , he said
1	striking his fist on the table , wang jen declared , the great thing about us scholars is our adherence to principles
1	the old lady , recollecting the zhangs ’ proposal , reminded lady wang , you should go and let your husband know what we decided
1	we ’ ll look in again by and by
1	tanchun ’ s totally different from huan , whom nobody could like
1	where are you going ?
1	' the servant brought in five bowls of noodles , and their host offered them vinegar , then heaped their bowls with cauliflower and meat
1	his wife ’ s sudden change for the better may mean that his luck will change too
1	she ’ s never to set foot inside the inner gate again
1	this clever imp had really kept some good lines up her sleeve
1	we are all good friends , not mere strangers who meet on the road , quoted hsiao
1	where did this come from ?
1	in the tea−shop he saw a man in a tall hat , sapphire−blue gown and black shoes with white soles , drinking tea alone
1	xiren and sheyue reminded them , that year when the jade was lost , lin zhixiao consulted a fortune-teller ; and after madam bao married into our house we told her that the character he came up with was the shang meaning reward
1	wang grovelled on the ground , kowtowing as fast as a pestle pounding onions ; but that only made the two scholars more angry than ever
1	chou chin 's travelling expenses and clothes were provided by chin
1	now our father is dead and we have too many mouths to feed — my brother and i ca not manage
1	you ’ re quite right , mother , agreed xue pan
1	are you trying to hasten my death with your wailing ?
1	let me have it
1	pinger agreed to try and hurried off , coming back before long with ha huan
1	he happens to be here , said chuang
1	this is no time for tea , declared chi wei−hsiao
1	but when he started to argue , yen 's sons took the bolt of the door and a rolling−pin and beat him within an inch of his life
1	all i ’ m wondering , madam , is this : which of the two , miss baochai and miss lin , do you think baoyu prefers ?
1	where their ways parted baochai said to daiyu :
1	you must call on him yourself
1	i am going to join in
1	we belong to different households
1	the lady dowager was feasted by hia she on the eleventh , by jia zhen on the twelfth , staying with them on each occasion for half a day , while time forbids us to enumerate all the feasts to which lady wang and xifeng were invited
1	now the sight of ouguan , to whom her sister had such an aversion , added fuel to the fire of the anger
1	when people are fated to die and the king of hell summons them , he sends small devils to fetch their spirits away
1	her heart beat wildly
1	and so having drunk enough , he went to bed
1	he at once sent men out of the city to tie up zhou rui and take him to the police to be cross-examined
1	tang called out his three battalions , as well as his two auxiliary forces
1	yingchun mentioned that at the time of her father 's departure she had wanted to see him of { but her husband had forbidden her
1	once home , unable to check her grief any longer , the old lady dismissed lady wang and sent baoyu to see off his uncle and cousin
1	too angry to speak , she fixed him with furious eyes until his cheeks were burning
1	granny liu didn ’ t know whether to sit or stand and longed for some hiding-place
1	meanwhile runners had swarmed in to guard all the doors , so that no one
1	i did not mean to kill you
1	with that profit you can buy more silk and get more from the pawnshop
1	baoyu made no reply , and lady wang was too worried to get a word out
1	anyone who sends word to the inner apartments will be killed on the spot
1	i am old and foolish , answered yu
1	what were the subjects ?
1	they would be wasted on beggars , who would have no use for them
1	you won ’ t be able to give a thought to eating once you start reading it
1	when she had this trouble before , replied the bawd , she would not swallow so much as a drop of water
1	i will come back tomorrow to see how you are , she assured him
1	then baoyu exclaimed , i ’ m done for !
1	it ca not be helped : i must go
1	if you wanted these things why didn ’ t you tell me before ?
1	how can you touch their fruit ?
1	when he came back she had gone
1	why do such a thing ?
1	it 's up to you whether you marry again or not
1	the tutor sat in the highest seat , with tang erh opposite him , mr yao in the place of a guest , and yoo as host
1	put in li wan with a smile
1	a long poem with tricky rhymes had to be padded out a bit
1	yu wrote to his younger brother : what is this trouble ?
1	but as she ’ s engaged it ’ s no use bringing it up
1	one of the gamesters made a note of this and after a few more throws remarked , i have lost quite a bit but wo not try to win it back now
1	they bundled the woman off
1	better put the blame on us here
1	i will do something more for you later
1	doctor wang and doctor zhang , who come so often , aren ’ t paid for each separate visit
1	knitting her sulky brows , her eyes flashing with anger beneath half-drooping lids , she pointed a finger at baoyu in accusal
1	the other , meant for baochai , in addition to writing-brushes , ink-tablets , inkstones , stationery , perfume-sachets , scented beads , fans , fan-sheaths , powder , rouge and pomade , had in it all sorts of toys from huqiu in soochow
1	go and check up to find out what ’ s really happened
1	that was just wild talk when i was too young to know any better
1	thereupon the old lady made lan sit beside her
1	order a good meal for her
1	just then a serving-woman came in to report that bao er ’ s wife had hanged herself
1	have you ever heard anything so funny ?
1	what do you want a new one for ?
1	did you really give him the cow for nothing ?
1	they want us to move out , but he wo not give up the house ; and so they take it out of me
1	xiren and sheyue , listening outside , compressed their lips to check their laughter
1	fit for a king ,
1	'you are a smart fellow yet now you are broke , said the man
1	just listen to our advice once in a while
1	though simply an empty lament , they voice my distress
1	your worldly obligations have been fulfilled , they declared
1	no wonder i caught nothing , she said with a smile , then told suyun to adjust the hook and bait it with another worm on which a reed had been fixed
1	as an old hand here , surely you know this rule ?
1	indeed , the fact that i brought a letter from shensi for your father sets us apart from the ordinary run of new acquaintances
1	so the wailing in the room grew louder and louder till the womenservants keeping watch outside hurried off in alarm to report this to the master
1	i ca not even suffer instead of her
1	baochai made servants open the cases and cabinets , but all were empty
1	that was smart of her , said the lady dowager
1	recognizing jia lan 's voice , baoyu stood up and called cheerfully , come in !
1	this is for your journey , fourth brother , he explained
1	you , madam , why everything 's still topsy-turvy though today is the third day
1	they were laying into xiaohong in turn when an old nanny arrived with a message from xifeng
1	still clutching his cane , jia zhen made an effort to kneel to greet and thank his kinswomen
1	let him off and send him packing
1	it was xifeng with her persuasive tongue who succeeded in consoling them a little and urged them to go back
1	baoyu hastily put his hand over her mouth
1	she sent for ha zhen ’ s wife and daughter-in-law
1	all right then , but i can ’ t return this favour
1	so i ca not take the case to court
1	a man carried a fire-cracker as large as a house out of town to let it off , and thousands of people followed to watch
1	mother he saw that her daughter had darted up to baoyu , who had taken her hand
1	she never gets up before noon or lifts a finger in the house
1	and when niu yu−fu spoke up for wang they spat at him
1	if things go on like this we will have no peace either
1	we ’ ve not even been allowed to write poems , retorted tanchun
1	the girls and baoyu crowded round to read it and took it to mean that the jade could not be found quickly , but it would turn up some time when they were not looking
1	after a while he said , why should i worry about other people ?
1	judging by what i have heard of him , he must have been a fine man ; and had i known him i would certainly have asked for his instruction
1	first think about chronicle
1	yucun went to court to make his report , and by the time he returned to his office this incident had slipped his mind completely
1	then , taking up an old brush and dipping it well in the ink , he stared at the paper for some time , and wrote a line all in one breath
1	you seem to think the world of xiren , but who is she ?
1	if baoyu ’ s uncle wants to offer congratulations , daiyu ’ s uncle ’ s family can celebrate her birthday too
1	why get so excited ?
1	i liked it , retorted daiyu
1	zijuan clambered on to the kang beside her , the cup in her hand
1	it would be futile to reason with her now , seeing that she was so stubborn
1	he had better return to the garden and go out again the next day
1	in the end they were so devoted that when diguan died she nearly cried her heart out , and to this day she ’ s never forgotten her
1	fenger hastily stepped forward to put in , miss [ in sent a maid with a note several times to invite her over , so finally she went
1	do i have to stay here ?
1	but i hear you ’ ve another mistress who ’ s a widow , and several young ladies too
1	i have not been there
1	cousin bao 's too reckless !
1	who else is she going to put in ?
1	this soft-mist silk comes in four colours only : light blue , russet , pine-green and pink
1	his cheeks burning , he left the room
1	as soon as the party was seated the lady dowager proposed , let 's begin with a few cups of wine
1	as regards both character and learning , the yu brothers had rarely been equalled
1	baochai knew from the poetry he had recited that morning that he
1	the girl 's worry : she has no money to buy pomade
1	as baoyu followed her in , daiyu called from the inner room , zijuan , bring master bao in here
1	luting was truly an art the men of old cultivated to achieve tranquility and integrity
1	they took to having breakfast there and returning to their own quarters about noon
1	that reminds me , i ’ ve not fetched your pewter bed-warmer
1	one of these girls named lin , the fourth child of her family , was a surpassing beauty and expert too in military arts
1	presently a maid raised the portiere and two others carried out the table
1	i lie here getting worse and worse , and your uncle keeps trying to turn us out because he wants to repair these rooms
1	jia zheng summoned the twenty-one men-servants then working in the mansion to question them about the family 's income and expenditure in the past
1	he seemed very upset when i explained all that had happened
1	give me back my husband !
1	how could she possibly know ?
1	she really is a treasure
1	promise me this and i shall die in peace
1	re takes that talk about 'leaving the world of men ' seriously , she reflectedno good will come of it in the long run
1	is your master well ?
1	baoyu made no objection as baochai stepped forward to take the jade from his hand
1	the manager here has asked me to select a few essays , and i have to hurry to get them ready for the printers
1	the maids who saw her hastily scurried away
1	mrs zhang , weeping , testified , my husband , zhang da , lived in the southern suburbs and died eighteen years ago
1	ever since you ordered it , madam , xiren has been giving me one every evening
1	all the relatives had arrived and were discussing whom to appoint from the clan as his heir
1	he asked all the servants and maids , but none of them knew
1	pinger stepped forward to mix the lots and picked one out with her chopsticks
1	in that case , said yu , how can a man who 's only just passed the provincial examination abandon family relationships and consider himself his uncle 's fellow−candidate ?
1	when the truth is discovered , they will all be punished
1	its one fault is that it is too luxurious
1	if you want a couple of hundred taels , that ’ s nothing
1	for no matter whom she marries she ’ ll still be within my reach , unless she dies or remains single all her life , in which case there is nothing i can do
1	actually , goodness is something inherent in human nature , yet people don ’ t hanker after it
1	give us a couple of examples
1	as soon as i ’ ve done my hair , we ’ re both going , over to your place
1	you even bully your own foster-mother , to say nothing of other people
1	helping baoyu to alight , he called out from the yard :
1	what a devilish monkey you are !
1	these forty , divided into two shifts , will have the job of burning incense , keeping the lamps filled with oil , hanging up curtains , watching by the coffin , offering sacrificial rice and tea , and mourning with the mourners
1	once the buyer was asleep , the woman stole four packages of silver worth two hundred taels from his baggage
1	don ’ t move , just wait , and it ’ s bound to surface
1	it 's not impossible , she said
1	struck by this scene of desolation , he could not contain his feelings but then and there made up a song which he chanted as follows :
1	every single flower has its goddess , and there ’ s
1	taken in by foolish uncle 's fabrications she consulted wang ren , who gave her even more blarney
1	her obvious distress made the lady dowager give way to tears
1	he was just raising his chopsticks to his mouth when something black hurtled from behind the table to smash the two plates of sweetmeats
1	i used to have a flair for decorating rooms , but now that i am old i have not the energy
1	her thoughts turned to xiangyun and she sent to fetch her
1	this jia lian , who has bought the rank of a sub-prefect , takes no interest in books but is a smooth man of the world , so he lives with his uncle jia zheng and helps him to manage his domestic affairs
1	shaking with mirth and pressing her hands to her heart , daiyu cried , do start soon
1	pinger had barely regained her feet when xifeng came in and told her : get the patterns out of that box for the mistress , quick
1	have they gone off to amuse themselves while you run wild ?
1	peacock-feather cape in bed
1	we traced him today to you , sir , and i am here to ask for him
1	his stepmother could not forget that he was an adopted son and did not love him as she did her own daughter and son−in−law ; but pao wen−ching loved him more than if he had been his own son , because he came from a respectable family
1	we are separated in form only , not in spirit
1	he observed that third sister ’ s behaviour had indeed changed out of all recognition , and as second sister was managing the house diligently and prudently he had no need to worry
1	qingwen switched then to lashing out at the younger girls
1	what is this prescription from across the seas ?
1	in order not to worry him on his journey , she did not tell him of baoyu ’ s relapse
1	really egg-plant , is it ?
1	said the old lady playfully
1	if there were , you ’ d be crying for fright
1	tell aunt not to worry
1	the next morning he had barely washed his face when the servant came in
1	lady wang , dumbfounded , collapsed
1	you can enjoy the moon again tomorrow ; it ’ s still bright on the sixteenth
1	lady wang felt thunderstruck on hearing this , borne out as it was by the case of jinchuan
1	this is all the doing of that minx xifeng
1	three carts were hired for the luggage , and four sturdy mules
1	he passed with the taoist through a large stone archway on which was inscribed : illusory land of great void
1	by this time the tea had been drunk , and chi bowed his visitor back to his chair
1	this xue family mentioned just now is one your honour can ’ t afford to offend
1	red in the face , wuer mumbled , he did say something i could not catch it clearly in the first part of the night
1	when the second seventh day had passed , fan chin gave his father−in−law a few taels of silver and told him to go to the temple in the market to ask a monk there whom he knew to invite other monks from the big monastery to recite the buddhist scriptures , chant intercessions and say masses so that mrs
1	has your mistress had her meal ?
1	however , winning as his appearance was , it was difficult to tell what lay beneath
1	a creature black as coal was sniffing at her with out-stretched nose , its two eyes shining like lamps
1	the writer , chuang ting−lung , had died ; but his body was exhumed and cut into pieces
1	i will ask governor chi to give you my whole salary for this year to bring back to nanking as capital for a business or to buy some property which will bring in rents
1	xiren chuckled , all the rest of us can go , but not you
1	as you ’ ve nothing here to cut it with , you ’ d better put it away , miss , and pick something smaller
1	when our family 's hard up you do not come near us !
1	apart from the usual greetings , the letter said that jia zheng would definitely be back by the middle of the sixth month
1	even strict sticklers for the truth can not beat such entertaining fantasies
1	and being in a towering rage , he did not trouble to weigh his words carefully
1	seeing that he paid no attention , the neighbour went up to him and tried to grab the hen
1	then she turned with a cold laugh to mrs lai and the stewards ’ wives
1	baoyu must wash and dress quickly !
1	the maid assented , but as she was about to go on this errand yuanyang put in with a smile :
1	zijuan refrained from trying to comfort her , for fear of making matters worse
1	my game isn ’ t worth watching , said zhan guang with a smile
1	or am i prejudiced ?
1	we thieves all have ready tongues , retorted tanchun
1	six maids and ten stewards ’ wives in all would be going , in addition to men-servants ; but yuanyang and yuchuan were to stay behind to see to things at home
1	last year my mistress did speak of doing it , but with all the bustle over new year she forgot
1	now that your mother 's dead you must be guided in everything by your second grand-uncle and me
1	xiren hunted frantically round , clutching at shadows and searching under each rock , but there was no trace of the jade
1	a long silence followed
1	there is a mr chuang , too , who was presented with lotus lake by the emperor
1	this sort of thing can ’ t be helped
1	i feel dizzy and there 's a bitter-sweet taste in my throat
1	but you should reconsider which is the better , lady alpinia 's or queen bamboo 's
1	lady wang , however , who had brought yingchun up , was bitterly distressed
1	his son and grandson are to escort his coffin through the lower north gate into the capital for a funeral ceremony at his own home , so that his descendants can mourn for him as is fitting before escorting his remains to their ancestral district
1	wu liang should be flogged and sentenced to hard labour
1	hurry up and stop qingwen from spanking me !
1	upon hearing this , chu hsien−fu hurried home to congratulate his father−in−law
1	at soochow wang changed boats again , then went ashore at west water gate in nanking
1	this is a good family anyway
1	i must go back to the hostel for a while , said ni ting−chu after one cup of tea
1	are you sure you can cope ?
1	you have done me a bad turn !
1	a hsun family servant in mourning rushed in and kowtowed
1	she chose as inscription for this convent the words , ship of mercy on the sea of suffering
1	though these men often come to the shop , goodness knows where they are now , he thought
1	i was fed up with hunting for it , and as soon as i saw it i said to myself , 'at last !
1	and this is what he heard :
1	it never occurred to me that you would have trouble here , sir ; but i have heard something about the east mansion 's business
1	a day later , when the steward in charge of the kitchen came with a request for money , jia zheng had to pay him out of his own pocket
1	one day mr chang called , and asked to speak to mr
1	i realized they must have come with an alms list , or to make their annual requests for donations or incense money
1	they need materials for the job
1	as yucun went closer , the man 's face struck him as familiar and he suspected that they had met before , though he could not remember where
1	in that case , said the others , let ’ s first look near by
1	the abbot was warm after his walk , and sitting down in the yard pulled open his clothes to cool his chest and belly
1	so he first discussed it with master rong , asking him to act as go-between and arrange the match , and promising him presents if he pulled it off
1	she started getting up
1	so you ’ ve noticed that too
1	you are looking more handsome than ever
1	but of course it ’ s good
1	just then the clock on the shelf in the outer room struck two
1	tell me what it is , quick !
1	it ’ s nothing , pinger answered
1	otherwise i may have to hand in a blank paper , making a fool of mysel { which would reflect badly on you , uncle , as well
1	my uncle was an honest officer , who did not add anything to the family estate and left no more than ten thousand taels at his death
1	at the risk of offending him i ’ d like to say that if he remembered to pay us back all he ’ s borrowed , goodness knows how much that would come to
1	having sent the servants out of the room , he opened a chest and took out two packets of silver , each containing a hundred taels
1	at the end of two years , the prince was defeated and captured by count wang shou−jen , and his puppet officials were either killed or fled
1	no need to tell her that these are my instructions
1	talking of baoyu , she went on , i want to consult you on something
1	hurry up and bring me their bodies !
1	you ’ ll see for yourself by and by
1	the friends brother pan has been making these years !
1	after all she 's good girl , said lady wang
1	how can you say such a thing !
1	i shall never beat him again
1	i did not bring enough money with me , he concluded , and i have only five coppers left
1	if you are going to sleep , mother , i will curl up in my quilt too and think over my lessons
1	for essays which read like commentaries will simply lack the literary flavour , whereas those which sound poetic will not resemble the words of ancient sages
1	when he had taken the examination , magistrate li called on the examiner , bowed and said : this kuang chao−jen , whom i passed first in the county examination , is a poor scholar and a good son
1	but he 's a handsome young man , and , from what we have seen of him , very easy-going
1	but he ’ s roaring drunk and using foul language again
1	but no more about that night
1	but he had to go out to send the countrymen away
1	she wanted to urge him not to cry , but feared that bottling up his resentment would be bad for him ; on the other hand , comforting him might seem like slighting daiyu
1	they were roofed with glazed tiles and set within winding red balustrades
1	fun — don ’ t take it seriously
1	the whole room was pitch dark , and yet i saw it clearly
1	they helped him aboard and began to carry his luggage to the junk
1	yu fu took the clod and turned it over under the light
1	and if you are not lucky enough to pass all the examinations , you will at least be able to become a stipendiary which will enable you to be a tutor and apply for titles for your parents
1	asked the lady dowager
1	don ’ t try to get to the bottom of it now , madam , they urged her
1	he sent men ahead to the temple to spend that night in redecorating the repository and in seeing to refreshments and the reception of the funeral party
1	since you come from kwangwu , sir , said wu , am i right in assuming you were posted here from the capital ?
1	by now they had reached the door
1	that was our young master ’ s room , and your patient was one of his maids , one of the more senior ones , true , but no young lady
1	maybe things were getting so out of hand he was afraid there might be some big scandal and therefore accused him of negligence to get him off more lightly
1	the abbot was most disconcerted
1	then , tired out , he walked stiffly back through clear stream gate to his lodgings , closed the door and went to bed
1	in that case , said the young man
1	when the results were published , he had passed ; and he bought more examination paper for the next test
1	anyway you must understand what i meant just now
1	as jia zheng was a vice-minister of works , though there were rules concerning the construction of an imperial consort ’ s tomb , the minister had to consult him more specially regarding the building of this one , while his colleagues also called to ask for his instructions
1	as soon as she had gone jia lian went in to see xifeng , who had woken up and heard him ask for a loan
1	here was a narrow stone bridge , which looked difficult to cross ; but holding the vine at one side , ma chun−shang walked over
1	is not the reason obvious ?
1	never mind those other things , rejoined li wan
1	prostrate yourself four times !
1	wild geese wing slowly through far-flung frosty clouds ;
1	suppose he does pass the prefectural examination and have a sun falling on his head — what about me ?
1	estimating that his funds would be rnnning out , he had no choice but to write to magistrate lai shangrong , the son of lai da , to ask for a loan of five hundred taels of silver , instructing the messenger to overtake him with the requisite sum
1	hill after hill like crouching elephants
1	how can we taste them first ?
1	i went to my uncle ’ s house , and because it was late he kept me for the night
1	daiyu had in fact determined to ignore him , but this speech proving that she was dearer to him than anyone else , and all the endearments he now poured out , made her break down again
1	it was kind of your master and mistress to think of us , and another day we will go over to express our gratitude
1	i ’ m the one , if anyone , who deserves to be punished
1	are not such people born any more ?
1	then li wan asked lady wang , have you read the master 's letter , madam ?
1	you sleep in his room , sheyue
1	thinking this fellow was making fun of him , fan chin pretended not to hear , and walked forward with lowered head
1	it shows he 's on the mend
1	the two girls went off then and sat down to sulk while xiren helped baoyu to bed
1	now maids came in to pour wine and bring in dishes , while outside the performance had started
1	have you ever seen me take any advantage of your family ?
1	it ’ s our mistress who put us in charge here ; so how dare they call us thieves ?
1	this must have been done by a spark from a hand-stove , she commented
1	in that case you can have mine , offered baoyu
1	why do not you go and see the shows ?
1	her eyes intent on the board , she was thinking hard , toying with one hand with the draughtsmen in the box
1	now he ’ s really gone and killed a man !
1	unlike the girls , she was richly dressed and resplendent as a fairy
1	when i said i was too clumsy to wait on the young master , the old lady scolded , i ’ m not asking you to look after him , you don ’ t have to be smart
1	don ’ t worry , said second sister
1	the day before yesterday the sixth mr fang made a bid for it , and the owner would have sold it if the tenants had not protested
1	this is only poor stuff , and it 's not for you but to entertain two honourable guests here
1	you worry too much , li wan and xifeng told her with a smile
1	pinger and li wan approved but tanchun teased , i ’ m only afraid they may forget friendship for profit !
1	chi fetched a card , and took up his brush
1	she told the younger maids to bring a table , and sheyue waited on baoyu while he finished the soup and rinsed his mouth
1	if you have the guts to go , i ’ ll have more respect for you
1	then ting−hsi 's wife sulkily took off her brocade gown , put on an apron , and went to the kitchen
1	demanded the fifth mr yao
1	after feeling the pulse for some time he declared :
1	first you tackle only the idea of no resentment ’
1	their ladyships felt reassured , but after waiting for a while lady wang sent a young maid in search of him
1	she ’ s really most lovable
1	i suppose she and baoyu must be destined for each other
1	come and look at this
1	the next day the runner reported : i have been to the imperial college , sir
1	yes , said baochai thinking back
1	in any case , he was the one arrested , not i
1	presently a maid invited them to mrs
1	then fangguan had to give them a careful rendering of a verse set to the melody the season for enjoying flowers
1	by the time this scene ended he was firmly convinced that jiang was a romantic , completely unique
1	the lady dowager , being in a good humour , took lady wang , aunt xue , baoyu and the girls to spend half a day in lai da ’ s garden
1	fancy forgetting a ready-made phrase like that
1	lending money is always a risky business
1	in the same way , xifeng has you
1	he ’ s in the right too , so why not make an indictment ?
1	baochai shot daiyu a warning glance , making her regret her indiscretion ; for in her eagerness to tease baoyu she had forgotten until it was too late how sensitive caiyun was
1	he was offered a seat in his study and served with tea
1	meanwhile yuanyang had guessed that lady xing would be going to discuss this business with xifeng , and that other people were sure to come to sound her out again
1	wang zhu ’ s wife stepped forward , very flustered , to urge her , please takea seat , miss , and let me explain
1	why do not you wait for him in my shop ?
1	it must be destroyed before it does any more harm
1	this was the first time chi had heard pao 's name mentioned , and as it emerged that pao was an old actor the captain began to raise his eyebrows
1	take good care of the mistress and wait for my good news !
1	only for little more than five years and eight
1	these four families are all closely connected , said the attendant , injure one and you injure them all , honour one and you honour them all
1	why gad about outside so shamelessly ?
1	she said playfully to sheyue and the rest
1	the young ladies don ’ t know her
1	to cut short such wild talk xiren said she was tired and gave up answering him
1	knowing how delicate and hypersensitive she was , they all made allowances for her , overlooking any lack of hospitality and courtesy
1	such talk ’ s enough to set one ’ s teeth on edge
1	now i have only been away a couple of months , yet look at the chaos here !
1	it must be yang chih−chung !
1	your petition is rejected
1	i am delighted to meet you
1	he mounted a horse and rode back out of the city while she , afraid xichun might commit suicide , sent fenger to comfort her
1	then , dressed in ermine cloaks , pheasant feathers and the brightest costumes , the players raced in , leaping , somersaulting and forming figures
1	he shook the tube , intoning , the yin and yang of the primal order have interacted ; sacred symbols have appeared with infinite changes ; divine manifestations must answer the prayers of the pious
1	so i ’ ve come to ask you how we should deal with this
1	that time we sent him wine , he said he could not drink ; but just now i saw him going to see the mistress , red in the face and tipsy
1	if he has food , he can eat ; if not , he ’ ll just have to go hungry
1	i ’ d rather scrap the whole thing than give up this new madder-gauze ’ image
1	i have a guest
1	and as rong is not involved , should not he be released as well ?
1	no need , rejoined xifeng
1	between ourselves , i do not mind telling you that although i have a few thousand taels of ready money , i do not want to spend it at the moment
1	go back and tell miss tanchun and miss xiangyun i ’ d like them to drop in if they ’ ve time after lunch
1	why should i be afraid of his laughing at me ?
1	get up now , you shameless creature !
1	but now see what ’ s become of me !
1	all but lady xing and lady wang had risen from their seats and were standing by them , with their hands at their sides , to show respect
1	he left his eldest grandson jia rui in charge
1	asked her business , mrs lin pointed at the woman
1	you are right , of course , sir , replied li with a smile
1	my own servants have clocks and watches , because everything large or small must be done on time
1	how could she work herself into such a passion ?
1	now that you ’ ve given me this lesson , auntie , do please do your best to settle this with the court
1	may i trouble you then to step into that tea−shop with me ?
1	what a terrible tongue madam lian has !
1	then you wo not have to dance attendance on me
1	you have madam bao and sister xiren , both as pre~y as goddesses , yet you insist on fooling around with others
1	with your poor health you ought to look after yourself
1	the mistresses certainly have good judgement , she thought
1	please , please speak up for me , madam !
1	i decided to see if he was with miss [ in , but i ran into some of her people who told me he wasn ’ t there either
1	he hurried into the hall and paid his respects to his grand-mother and mother
1	i sha not be writing now
1	asked mrs zhou , sitting on the edge of the kang , i haven ’ t seen you over on our side for several days
1	why should my fate be so cruel ?
1	as they were chatting , the lady dowager ’ s party returned
1	we ’ re here on the prefect ’ s orders
1	xifeng went over to whisper something into her ear , at which she nodded and smiled
1	from his pit kuo watched furtively as the tiger loped off to a mountain peak about a mile away , whence it looked back with blazing eyes to see whether he had moved or not
1	but although qingwen had departed this sea of woe , the thought that they could never meet again inevitably filled him with grief and longing
1	when he saw these matrons marching into the maids ’ rooms , he asked xifeng what they were doing
1	at number one scholar square they saw some new book covers pasted up in a bookshop
1	i know the kidnapper who sold the girl , and i knew the poor devil who bought her
1	if investigation proves that it ’ s true , there will be a fearful scene
1	she ’ ll get the stewards to have them made
1	the servant on her return slipped in to find yuanyang , but could not enter the old lady 's room where yuanyang happened to be with lady wang and others
1	this commissioner 's name was tsui and , as the nephew of a eunuch , he had started life with a hereditary title and later been promoted to his present position
1	her aunt saw her to the ceremonial gate and after giving the maids some further instructions waited to see them off
1	then ha rong went out chuckling to himself
1	jia zheng nodded his approval but said nothing
1	i want our kinswoman to sit next to me
1	drive that boat away , quick !
1	even so , that 's hard to say after two provincial appointments
1	siqi had no alternative but to kowtow to yingchun and take her leave of the other maids
1	how is it that i don ’ t remember a thing ?
1	he only comes back every ten days or so
1	how did it go last night ?
1	i have not much to say , he faltered
1	we used to be colleagues in the same yamen
1	she spies on me as if i were a thief
1	after a few cups , feeling randy , he ordered the maids to clear away the wine and dishes , then closed the door to undress
1	she and cousin daiyu have the same birthday , that ’ s why she remembers it
1	tu is known for his brilliance , and his poems are generally admired
1	why talk such nonsense ?
1	as jia rong was rattling away so wildly he noticed that the old lady had woken up , and made haste to pay his respects
1	he came back presently and was reproached by old chin , who said , you are too obstinate
1	his eye fell on the inscription on a large stone which was still discernible and he read it through
1	( ming dynasty scholars called all those who passed the prefectural examination classmates , and those who only qualified for this examination juniors
1	by rights , jia zhen and his wife of the ning mansion should both have assisted at these obsequies ; but as that would have left no one in charge at home , after much discussion they decided to beg leave from the court for madam you on the plea that she was with child , so that she could take over the supervision of the two mansions
1	the other fair flawless jade ,
1	there you go again , talking in that heartless way !
1	you may be able to fool newcomers but you can ’ t fool me
1	jia yun walked out to question the page , who told him :
1	moreover , i ’ ve been re-instated by the emperor ’ s favour and am in fact beginning a new life
1	it 's just dawned on me that these books count for nothing
1	but to learn his name , you must turn to the next chapter
1	on the fourteenth he sent chou erh home
1	it 's too bad she was born into such a rich family , said one of the girls
1	now that you have been recommended , shaoching , you must do some good work for the government , to justify this generation of scholars
1	i don ’ t need her services here
1	tipsy snow-sprites over shattered rainbows have sped ;
1	after all , to be honest , which of us can compare with her ?
1	please give me that book then to take back with me , and i ’ ll read a few poems tonight
1	but on pay-day or when sweets are shared out , she ’ s always the first to come running
1	then mingyan brought round his horse , and they left by the back gate
1	do not worry , he replied
1	she ’ ll be married next year
1	the two men laughed and stood up
1	i hardly like to say this , sir , said yin chao
1	that ’ s silly talk maybe , still there ’ s something in it
1	but no more of this
1	if the flower seems able to understand , we are so thrilled that we want to get closer to it ; hence nine is wearing the chrysanthemum
1	but by the fifth watch , shivering with cold , she had just decided to summon her maid when a sound outside the window startled her , recalling what had happened the previous night
1	this letter , far from angering xifeng , amused her
1	the jade in the box hopes to fetch a good price ,
1	this was a stroke of luck !
1	i am afraid the young fellow knows too much and is going to bad places
1	little did i think you would honour me by reading it
1	as pan handed over two hundred coppers as largesse , the door which had been closed at the bridegroom 's arrival was opened and old mr cheng came out ; and when he and his prospective son−in−law recognized each other as fellow passengers on the same boat some years before , they felt this marriage must have been predestined
1	the emperor sighed , then ordered the prime minister to decree : permission is hereby granted chuang shao−kuang to return home
1	you all think me silly , she told him , shedding tears
1	whenever you get wind of any perks of handouts to one of the stewards ’ wives , you dash off like dogs with wagging tails to announce it
1	pin−niang spread her scarlet handkerchief on chen 's knee
1	is it cousin xiuyan ’ s birthday too ?
1	say these are my instructions
1	feeling a little more reassured , they were waiting blankly for xiuyan ’ s return when they saw baoyu ’ s page beiming beckoning outside the door to a young maid
1	he doesn ’ t practise medicine for a living and only came as a favour to our friend feng ziying
1	or because the horoscopes don ’ t match
1	i ’ ll soon be turning in
1	jia rui , anxious to smooth things over , urged jin rong softly , remember the proverb a murderer can only lose his head
1	how can you accuse me of spending your money ?
1	niu pu−yi went on alone by boat down the yangtse , past nanking to wuhu , where he lodged in a small temple called sweet dew temple at floating bridge
1	when i am out , zijuan chats quite happily with her ; but as soon as i come in she goes away
1	____________________ the fourth son of the first emperor , he seized the throne from his nephew in
1	i have decided to leave with him tomorrow , said feng
1	i have invited my cousin to teach him some moral principles , so that he wo not turn out a low , obsequious character
1	that 's a long story
1	even if i do this , i mustn ’ t be too casual about it , he told himself
1	i had meant to invite mr wan myself : now i shall have to wait till the day after
1	this girl ’ s muddled up the message
1	in the half year that i have been in nanking , she tells tu shao−ching and wu shu , all the men who have come here have taken me either for a prostitute or a member of some brigand 's band
1	they can only judge of our delivery and voices
1	in desperation , the magistrate said : judicial commissioner tsui sent you here , and if i treat you discourteously he will take it as a slight
1	entering , he saw on the wall a picture by tang yin of a lady sleeping under the blossom of a crab-apple tree in spring
1	for instance , what would the old lady do without yuanyang ?
1	the next day , jia zhen came over to attend to certain business
1	lady wang now summoned yuanyang 's sister-in-law to attend to the coffining
1	your officers must have slipped up and allowed thieves from outside to break in and rob you
1	you must not think of declining
1	if you do not obey him , he will enforce our monastery 's rule and have you carried to the back courtyard and burnt !
1	she sent to have her fetched from the maids ’ room
1	he handed her the card on which was written the date of the wedding , and when she had made a polite rejoinder and nodded her consent he hurried back to report this to jia zheng
1	after that , they performed the fairy brings a boy , and golden seal
1	her spirit 's purity surpasses jade ,
1	moreover , this enabled him to write more trenchantly , and make the best use of the satire in which he excelled
1	and urged my train through all the heaven wide
1	if the properties entered in our
1	owing to the disturbances , i have been stranded in these parts for five or six years
1	ouguan said nothing to this , not even when baoyu repeated his question
1	his name used to be on the ning mansion register
1	these men thought themselves remarkably shrewd , whereas in fact they were thoroughgoing fools
1	well , you may be right to keep out of his way , but you mustn ’ t really go off on a long journey without letting me know beforehand
1	and on her return , jia lian himself took the money to lady xing while xifeng and pinger went on trying to guess who had let the cat out of the bag
1	come back early tomorrow then , stipulated pinger
1	fortunately there were enough of them there to restrain her and talk her round so that , eventually , she left off storming
1	yen asked them to be seated , wished them success in their coming examination , and offered them refreshments
1	the next day captain sun rose before it was light to bid his muleteers bestir themselves ; and when the porters had carried out the silver , he paid the bill and left
1	the two brothers sat up talking by candlelight until nearly midnight , when they heard a thud on the roof and a blood−stained man dropped down from the eaves carrying a leather bag
1	she took the things and came ; then the master told me to watch out for you , madam
1	what ’ s to be done ?
1	seeing them talking together , baochan slipped inside
1	i do not think that 's necessary , said the old lady , as we were relatives before this marriage
1	when i provoked him too much , he swore he would become a monk
1	by this time it was also decreed that each province should have one governor
1	from his baggage he took magistrate yiu 's letter , which he gave to hsiao yun−hsien
1	do not worry , she answered
1	he did something even more amusing , said wu shu
1	the servant went home as instructed
1	she was naturally delighted and , taking him by the hand , urged him to work diligently to repay the emperor 's kindness
1	dr chao ranks high among the poets after kuang chao−jen left to take the prefectural examination , his father missed him so much that twenty days ' absence seemed to him like two years ; and every day , with tears in his eyes , he watched for his son 's return
1	the two young actors , accustomed to such scenes , knelt down to offer xing a drink
1	but he dared go no nearer , for fear of the sword
1	yuanyang went on to morning emerald hall and , sure enough , found all the inmates of the garden there chatting
1	you are still young , ting−hsi , and i promise to find another wife for you later
1	zijuan , arriving with tea for them , supposed they were bickering over something again
1	the waiter disappeared with the order into the kitchen , to reappear shortly with one portion of duck and two pots of wine
1	take my advice and go home for a couple of days
1	then ma chun−shang told him how the runner had reported the matter to him , how they had discussed it together and how he had had to pay ninety−two taels of silver to redeem the casket
1	the boatman dared not protest
1	you will know that when you draw one tomorrow , madam
1	it was a quite nondescript quatrain , but of course she praised its ingenuity and pretended to be thinking hard although she had guessed it at once
1	after talking for some time , they went back to their rooms
1	li wan , the jia girls , baochai and daiyu were waiting with pinger and xiren in the outer room when they heard that the patients had come to and eaten some gruel
1	the skin was broken , blood spurted out , and very soon he died
1	the young maid came back with a hamper for their inspection
1	baoyu put the list away then and they chatted
1	my eldest daughter is a widow at home
1	then those low types will be sorry they sized me up wrongly ; and when second master comes back and sees this , he as our husband will regret his mistake
1	baoyu hurried out to meet his cousins , beaming
1	if they heard , they ’ d give you another slapping
1	pao then made ready all he needed for the trip , buying ribbons , soap and other nanking specialities for the yamen servants
1	so it did not last very long
1	although the object of general admiration , so that others also had designs on them , they were left unmolested for fear of xue pan
1	just hold out till master huan grows up and gets an official post
1	all else takes second place
1	he asked xiren , do you still have that red sash which you refused to wear the other year ?
1	we must hurry up and stop yun from going there
1	in which four new characters are introduced to link the past with the present , and the story ends with an epilogue by the twenty−third year of the wan li period , all the wellknown scholars had disappeared from nanking
1	just say , is she prettier than me ?
1	then the nurses and attendants made baoyu lie down and slipped out leaving only four maids xiren , meiren , qingwen and sheyue to keep him company
1	although artificially made , the sight of it tempts one to retire to the country
1	if he makes some small mistake you can set him right
1	the third young master is only a couple of years older — he ’ s not reached manhood yet
1	lady xing and lady wang were completely flummoxed , frightened out of their wits
1	by his bed the old gentleman had a number of packages of charcoal which would turn into silver if you heated them above a brazier
1	jia rong withdrew to see about buying the medicine , which was then prepared and given to his wife
1	don ’ t take it so seriously , said the old lady , smiling
1	just look at the story of the lord of ngo and his embroidered coverlet
1	by the time of baoyu 's marriage and daiyu 's death , as xiangyun had also left and baoqin had moved home very few people remained there
1	before this trouble of his , when he invited us to taverns he would order at least two ducks , to say nothing of mutton , pork , chicken and fish
1	i can join in the feast to celebrate !
1	he reddened and could not answer
1	xiangyun spat in disgust
1	the next morning the local authorities sent over a student accused of gambling , for dr yu to discipline
1	in the outer room , baoyu softly begged xiren to fetch zijuan
1	of course i know the importance of discipline
1	i must go and have a look
1	tanchun , however , had sense enough to see that it was not for lady wang to clear herself of these false charges , nor for aunt xue to defend her sister , nor for baochai to defend her aunt , while li wan , xifeng and baoyu were in no position to protest either
1	he himself remained on call in the outside study , daring neither to go home nor to confront his father
1	why don ’ t you say anything ?
1	guessing that she was on her way to see their grandmother , he waited for her by the pavilion and they left the garden together
1	i ’ d like to stay and keep you company for a bit
1	he ordered the wet−nurse to unlock the door of the room where wine was stored , and went in with two servants
1	you ’ ve turned up just in time , master bao
1	stepping forward she boxed her ears
1	her voice was so clear and tender that the listeners were entranced
1	you should be thankful i ’ m not borrowing from you , just asking you to put in a word ; and yet you still demand interest
1	and swear he must clear himself
1	seeing the state he was in , chin and the guild head tried to lift him up , one on each side ; but he refused to budge
1	frightened out of her wits , bao er ’ s wife flew in to report this
1	come and keep her company
1	he grabbed his own inkstone ready to let it fly
1	no wonder you ’ re unwell then !
1	just come with me , and i guarantee you a good time
1	you are all on your own , and in our group you wo not want for food or clothes
1	that fence there is covered with rambler roses and monthly-roses , as well as honeysuckle and other flowers , all of which fetch a good price in tea-shops and pharmacies when they ’ re dried
1	this is just as well , she remarked to mrs zhou
1	by the long river at sunset a ball of flame
1	then she will have to change her ways
1	recently she was ill again for over ten days , and the doctor diagnosed it as consumption ; so then and there i dismissed her with instructions not to come back when she ’ s better , giving her to her family to marry off
1	there 's no satisfying some people
1	baoyu promised to do so , and from that day on he had to apply himself harder to his studies
1	he took a look at his retinue -- the men were slouching and straggling
1	tell them the master 's going to beat me
1	there were three men in the cabin : mr cheng was sitting in the middle with his son on one side and a traveller from another district on the other
1	she turned to yingchun
1	xiangyun had been leaning on the back of a chair and , this being none too steady , her weight on it as she laughed had toppled it over , upsetting both girl and chair
1	the pimp had heard her ask this simple customer for a tip ; so now he climbed the stairs
1	i have not seen you for many years
1	but a five it was
1	before jia yun could get out of the way , the drunkard grabbed hold of him
1	prefect hsiang ordered their luggage to be put in the library where they were to stay
1	thank you , miss , for taking so much trouble , she said
1	as the proverb says , you can ’ t judge by appearances , madam
1	when dogs started barking outside , shen hsiang−fu went out to welcome the guest ; and the villagers stared as chou chin came in
1	you know , do not you , that all the ladies have come today , so not a single outsider must be allowed in
1	if that ’ s so , he did right to go , observed li wan
1	daiyu was not seriously ill , simply suffering from the heat
1	with no means to banish grief ,
1	why give me a bad name ?
1	i shall just sit here to help keep an eye on things , and you can consider me as an old assistant
1	and mr chih has gone to chujung to see to the repairs of the college ; so i know he wo not be coming
1	wouldrink our family 's tea , a daughter-in-law to be ' !
1	this depends on the unknown merits laid by for one ’ s children
1	baoyu made qiuwen and sheyue open the hampers , and as they did so the two women squatted down
1	this morning , uncle bao f~ni shed his papers first and waited for me to hand them in together
1	she tells her parents : don ’ t grieve for your child
1	high and low alike in both mansions were kept hard at work
1	staring at niu yu−fu 's face , niu pu lost his footing and fell into the lake
1	grabbing the osiers she brandished them in chunyan ’ s face
1	baochai told sheyue and wuer to make a bed for him in the outer room and to sleep lightly themselves and see to his tea
1	then she gives a scream of laughter and falls unconscious too
1	the next day hsiao called on these four scholars , and they returned his call
1	one or two had not , but all alike expressed their admiration
1	the paddy fields and vegetable plots in paddy-sweet cottage are only for fun and don ’ t need to be cultivated seriously ; still , it would be better to have her there in charge during the different seasons
1	thus both were lost in equally foolish reflections until baoyu abruptly asked qin zhong what he was reading and , the latter answering frankly , they embarked on an animated conversation which soon made them feel even more drawn to each other
1	we need not dwell on the details
1	then one of our household , a man called 'numberao , managed to get on the roof and beat them off
1	she turned to baoyu
1	it was a bolt from the blue !
1	that 's why i advised them , when his birthday came round , to pay back the opera so that we would not be beholden to him
1	he did so well that he became a millionaire
1	rong will write separately
1	one is madam lian ’ s mother-in-law , the other ’ s her father ’ s sister ; yet instead of taking their side she sides with someone less close
1	hsiao took it , turned over a few pages , and was full of praise
1	old yu supervised his sons ' work on their vegetable farm
1	his hand slipped — that ’ s how the wine bowl hit zhang san ’ s head
1	the lady dowager nodded
1	tradesmen like us ca not dream of passing the examinations , said niu pu−lang
1	i would like your opinion on this
1	i shall seek your advice on all matters in future
1	the oracle never lies , said chen ho−fu
1	five catties or seven at the most would be ample
1	wherever he goes now , people will know about him and will have to send him back
1	and please ask cousin zhen to lose no time in settling this lawsuit
1	then , under pressure , he thought up another trick
1	as regards her looks , conversation and behaviour , she was superior too
1	let ’ s go to her place to look for them
1	what has this to do with her ladyship ?
1	yingchun , reading retribution for good and evil with baochai , had not even heard what tanchun was saying
1	in this autumn season ruled over by the white emperor , i dream in my lonely bed in a deserted room
1	the maid did as she was told , coming back to report , miss lin says she received presents too ; she wants you to keep yours
1	let 's talk about something else
1	maids moved back the brazier and set out two tables in front of the old lady ’ s couch
1	she asked , even more bewildered
1	then he went to his own room to rest
1	that essay of yours , sir , which won the first place , said wan , has been carefully studied by everyone in our province
1	after a little further chat he took his leave of xifeng and went back to the garden
1	i will call on the others first and mr chin last
1	not like our children , who as soon as they can walk are scampering all over the graveyards
1	when he mentioned that his grandfather had been a pupil of tu 's great−grandfather , tu addressed him as an uncle
1	this time he passed , was placed in the second rank in the palace examination , and recommended by the authorities for membership of the han lin academy
1	he led his troops to defeat fang kuo−chen , and ruled over the whole province of chekiang , so that villages and towns were at peace once more
1	she told you , sir , pinger retorted
1	both his parents died when he was young and he had no brothers ; he lived as best he could on his small property
1	but all the repair men , carpenters and masons will work half time only
1	by this time the passersby had heard the crash , and a crowd gathered round to watch
1	she will distribute it as soon as she 's collected the interest
1	they can ’ t keep them for ever either , so how can you ?
1	having put down the incense-burner , mingyan stepped aside
1	you do not know , old ancestress , all the solemn warnings there are in the buddhist sutras about the sons born into noble families , who are always dogged by evil spirits who pinch them , nip them , knock their rice-bowls out of their hands , or trip them up on the road
1	i went all the way to straight eye cave , he reported
1	untiring they relentless means employed ;
1	in this dilemma he rose after a few remarks and ordered the meal to be served
1	so jia zheng did not insist too much on baoyu working for the examinations and had recently treated him more leniently
1	then the prime minister approached vice−minister hsu
1	if you have nothing better to do when you return , do come to yangchow , uncle
1	like the shadow of peaks , her grief is never gone ;
1	she keeps an eye on everything down to the least details of our father 's affairs at home and outside
1	if you could take me to see her , that would be nice
1	the lady of the alpinia
1	noticing that he seemed lonely , the old monk often brewed tea and took it to his room to talk with him till midnight ; and when there was moonlight they would sit in the courtyard to talk over past and present
1	since you ’ d left they shouldn ’ t have called you back again , making a trip for nothing
1	though she had lived with xue pan for several years , because of irregular menses she had never conceived a child
1	parted from his valleys and streams ,
1	why not weigh out two hundred and ten taels to lend him ?
1	having said this she hurried away
1	the musicians are very busy in other families—how can i get them here ?
1	seizing all the flowers on the plate , she stuck them this way and that in the old woman 's hair , reducing everyone present to helpless laughter
1	growing old now and worn out by his heavy responsibilities , he was so happy after this long time away to be reunited with his family that banishing all thought of business he passed the time reading , and when he was tired would play chess or drink with his proteges or enjoy the domesticity of the inner quarters with his mother , sons and wife
1	in future when i am with the old lady and you have something to report , it can wait
1	the muddy worm made no objection , for provided he had wine , meat and money himself he cared for nothing else
1	now third sister is going to marry far from home , so we will never meet again !
1	but xichun although young had a will of her own and was most uncompromising and eccentric
1	you produce six ministers in four generations , and your pupils and former dependents are to be found everywhere
1	embarrassed by this question , jia lian sheepishly changed the subject , then left her on the pretext that he had business
1	i have something to discuss with you
1	only a long poem in the old style— some song or ballad—can convey the spirit
1	baoyu , watching , decided that this way of dressing her hair was an improvement and regretted having sent her to comb her hair before the job should have been left for baochai
1	will you pay the chairbearers for me ?
1	but now that i have found my benefactor , i ca not let slip this opportunity
1	light a stick of that tibetan incense , she told zijuan presently
1	in a daze he forgot his search for yuanyang and boldly opened the first cabinet , in which he found several albums
1	we can enjoy ourselves here every day , unlike tu shao−ching , who has to take his wife to chingliang mountain to see the blossom !
1	there are a few dozen big willows there too , so that it is quiet , shady and cool ; and if the buffalo is thirsty it can drink at the water 's edge
1	when i called him he could not answer , and soon he died
1	i have a favour to ask you , shao−ching , said dr yu
1	it was nearly dark when they left the tavern , so mr ni went home while pao went back to tell his wife what he had arranged , and she was very pleased with the suggestion
1	i agreed to it only because he struck me as clever and pleasant
1	he has not been preparing very hard for the examinations , but recently in my spare time i have taught him to write verses as a pastime ; for , whatever fate may have in store for him , i want him to know how to rest content
1	come hack and change
1	but do you know that minx qingwen in baoyu ’ s place , madam ?
1	the secretary straightway sent the following memorandum to the magistrate : this licentiate yang is connected with the lou family , and two of the lou gentlemen have sent in their cards and instructed their steward to act as guarantor
1	feng raised the front of his gown
1	i needn ’ t remind you that we must all do our best during this period
1	i know anyway , so do not think you can hide it from me
1	so we have to make do with pearls worn by living people
1	with that warning she went in again with tanchun
1	he wanted to know
1	i ’ ve always maintained that you were cut out for great things
1	please take these two cents of silver to buy some wine
1	after leaving him the old lady went in to see baochai , who having been married less than a week behaved shyly in company
1	walking along the verandah into the outer room , she found his maids sprawled on their beds having a nap
1	aunt xue was only too glad to comply so as to have some check on her son , who was likely to get up to fresh mischief if they lived outside
1	it 's his birthday today , and when i went to congratulate him everybody was talking about this
1	xifeng promised to do her best , and after a little further talk they dispersed
1	yung lo is the name of his reign
1	pity the pure white mingling with the mud
1	how is that possible ?
1	in the cold clean scent i hug my knees and chant
1	then the others thought no more of the matter , and there it rested
1	no need to come in
1	the scandalous goings-on in that east mansion of his don ’ t bear speaking of
1	aunt xue had already come , so all took their seats and started the meal , baoyu just eating half a bowl of rice steeped in tea to keep them company
1	just now i went to miss lin ’ s place , said zhou rui ’ s wife after transacting her business
1	dr yu saw them out
1	he took from his wallet a mirror polished on both sides and engraved on its handle with the inscription : precious mirror of love
1	i will come when i have changed my clothes
1	just get the money from the treasury
1	in any case , i could never bring myself to speak of such a thing
1	shen escorted him in , and only then did mei chiu rise slowly to greet him
1	when baochan saw them coming with ropes to bind her she screamed , but the maids from the rong mansion silenced her and trussed her up
1	it was only a joke after drinking , said lady wang soothingly
1	if you take my advice , i shall die happy !
1	as they were boon companions , on the pretext of helping with family affairs they often joined in ffie ganri
1	it ’ s all very well for you ladies to have your fun , but i can ’ t take it , was pinger ’ s reply
1	people are waiting outside , they reminded him
1	why do not you come with us ?
1	who told you that ?
1	he wrote out a prescription
1	on top of that you have to meet the expenses of the elder master and master zhen , not to mention your debts outside ; besides , recently you were robbed , and the police are not likely to catch the thieves or recover your stolen property
1	at sight of him she stood up
1	you know how she is
1	besides , i can ’ t seek out xue ke myself , i ’ ll need her as go-between
1	it ’ s just after the festival and the old lady ’ s had a happy day
1	jia lian , when he had paid his respects , described his trip to shilitun to help arrange for wang ziteng ’ s funeral
1	lady wang and the maids pleaded in consternation , if you are so angry , madam , think what a rage the master will be in !
1	what girl can see her parents starve to death ?
1	where would we find one out in the open country ?
1	don ’ t hurt your hand let me slap myself instead
1	to this mr kao said nothing
1	suddenly dense clouds gathered , and there was a heavy shower of rain
1	better put them back and try somewhere else
1	this message pleased jia lian on qin ’ s account
1	may i ask why your honour sent runners to arrest me in a different province ?
1	but this is anticipating
1	what is this if not a case of predestined fate ?
1	i suppose baoyu ’ s not here because he ’ s forgotten this refined gathering in his eagerness to join in the fun
1	as for master qin , i ’ ll leave you to deal with him
1	miss lin can stay for the time being in his green gauze lodge
1	she must have come to summon me
1	i would like to ask you , sir , with your great literary gifts , to write a few words in prose or verse so that my achievements will not be forgotten
1	only selected scholars took the test examination , in which there were seldom any failures
1	later i was the abbot of the defender 's temple in peking
1	not a day has passed without my pulling them up , replied li
1	all those at usurious , illegal rates of inter
1	they will come to no good end
1	i ’ m glad you reminded me , cried xifeng gaily
1	on the lot she drew they saw a rose with the motto flower of final splendour ’ and the line when the rose blooms , spring flowers fade
1	and then half the girls in the household , who are grown up anyway , should get married
1	monk , said the headman , old kuang is one of the best men in our village , and his son has such fine features he is sure to make good in future
1	she 's a strange crafty creature if ever i saw one
1	green lattice nunnery is in our own grounds and i can practise my devotions there , while if i need anything you can see to it
1	a native of huzhou , he was the last of a line of scholars and officials
1	you used to live together in the garden , so i am sure you know what i mean
1	still yuanyang simply hung her head and said nothing
1	he will reflect such credit on you that you can be sure of receiving a title
1	my cousin tu shen−ching of tienchang , who 's in the capital , gave him a letter for me
1	then a note of alarm was sounded
1	he 's a public nuisance
1	why no report this to madam zhu ?
1	take them back and add some more bricks to the wall round the coffin , till it 's strong enough to last a few years
1	we can punish him when he comes back
1	come and sit down
1	but for a long time he said nothing
1	xifeng was convulsed with fury , convinced by their praise of pinger that the latter must have been complaining about her behind her back too
1	thoroughly depressed and not knowing how to work off his feelings , he went back to the garden , straight to bamboo lodge
1	but let us return to baoyu and qin zhong , who were fooling about in the hall when zhineng came in
1	to know how xifeng coped , read the following chapter
1	this doctor we had is the best-known , was the answer
1	it was before you were born
1	every day the blade goes in white and comes out red
1	the ning mansion is yours to live in again
1	we ’ re no one , though , who understands such things
1	if i ’ d any pride , scoffed tanchun , i should have dashed my brains out long ago
1	fan , whom i helped to look through the examination papers ; but for some years now—ever since my father was promoted to nanchang and needed someone to help him—i have been with him here
1	then baoyu , taking his book , took leave of daiyu and went back to his own room with xiren
1	just then a messenger arrived to fetch them , and they went into the yamen
1	what should be inscribed here ?
1	when ma heard this he was appalled
1	how heartless and stingy you think us !
1	weeping and cursing her fate , she put it in her mouth and after several desperate attempts succeeded in swallowing it
1	are you expert in that too , sir ?
1	having made his report to lady wang , he found out from the ministry of civil affairs that jia zheng was in no trouble - only the magistrate of taiping county had been dismissed from his post
1	since mr feng and i are friends , we are travelling together ; but i shall leave this boat at yangchow to take the nanking boat down the yangtse
1	so don ’ t you have a warm scent to match her cold scent ?
1	do let me choose my own rhymes , good cousins , he begged
1	have you finished those pills prescribed for you the other day ?
1	i am over seventy now , and i read the buddhist scriptures
1	then the truth dawned on everyone
1	and when mingyan saw who it was , he fell on his knees to beg for mercy
1	having taken a boat to yangchow and discovered from the college list that chi was staying in the temple of religious renewal , he made his way there immediately
1	i was at home that day when this mr xue asked me out to drink with him
1	let 's play a different way , suggested pin−niang
1	right , agreed tanchun
1	just then xue ke came in
1	you would better go back
1	now on this envelope he ’ s written uncle
1	`` take office high or low as days afford ,
1	our two young ladies are with miss daiyu , she told him
1	since heaven creates such wonderful girls , what use are we filthy males except to contaminate the world ?
1	baochai accordingly often helped her in secret , not letting lady xing know for fear of giving offence , with the result that now that this unexpected match had been arranged xiuyan felt even more closely bound to baochai than to xue ke
1	i want you to take this jade cup to drink from
1	although her face burned with shame , she forced herself to pocket her pride and explain her reason for coming
1	and in she came with xiangling
1	zijuan , standing to one side , jerked her chin towards the bed , and baoyu taking the hint walked over to have a look
1	if you want to know what followed , read the next chapter
1	you can talk , but you don ’ t dare go either , he muttered
1	what is your name , sir ?
1	then they drank till nearly dawn and put the guests up in the library ; for now chuan wu−yung and iron−armed chang were honoured guests in the prime minister 's house
1	before bao yong could reply he went on to ask , is it true , as i heard , that your younger master ’ s name is also baoyu ?
1	i ’ ve read the book of filial women , and a fortnight ago i started on the lives of chaste martyrs
1	baoyu fixed his eyes on her
1	so she had to tell a maid to take the gifts
1	it ’ s nothing serious : i just feel a bit limp
1	at this juncture , mr ni was in tears
1	just then baoyu arrived to pay his respects
1	even the imperial gauze used in the palace today is not so soft and fine
1	at her approach they rose and yuanyang asked :
1	he had sold all his other possessions , but could not bear to part with these precious volumes
1	that evening baochai invited xiangyun to stay with her , and by lamplight xiangyun outlined her plans for entertaining the others and setting subjects for poems
1	when she asked what had happened and i told her , she said :
1	he causes a great uproar , yet in the end is allowed to punish the moslems in order to preserve his face
1	there are pearls in the palace , said chen , but i do not think they are used as candles
1	i ’ ll hire a carriage to bring her , and you can question her in the lady dowager ’ s presence
1	i ca not go back till i have accepted his invitation
1	opposite was the table for the old lady accompanied by lady xing and xiuyan
1	but i am going to finish the lot , even if it kill me
1	but later , i do not know why , he started dabbling in the occult and persuading people to practise alchemy
1	he counted the strokes -- vertical , horizontal , dotted and curved -- there were seventeen in all
1	they asked when they saw the chair
1	since sixth master was a mohammedan , another twenty to thirty eggs were brought and boiled hard , and a lamp was lit
1	disconcerted by this , jia zheng answered with a smile , you have so much experience of people , madam , if you approve of him and think him promising , you can ’ t be wrong
1	in the third place , of all the ladies of our house i ’ m the only young married woman , but there are plenty of servants ’ wives younger than me who are for ever dropping into the garden then going home again at night
1	i entered orders as a boy , protested the monk
1	he recognized baochan ’ s voice but made no sound , pretending to be asleep
1	i was young at the time i took it and did not set much store by it , so i left it in the case
1	there are real-life images ready at hand — why not use one of those ?
1	we only wish you would come more often
1	why trouble to order the meal yourself , old ancestress ?
1	baoyu took her hand
1	dai quan ordered one of his attendants , take this to old zhao , chief of the board of revenue , with my compliments
1	a few steps from here is tu shao−ching 's house
1	they announced too that the house had been made ready , as the new mistress would see for herself when she moved in
1	the other day we saw some inscriptions written by you , young master
1	you have good sense , lian
1	the next evening , however , when the concubine cried as she poured out all her fears again , the wife said , very well
1	i went to anching to see a friend , and on my way back the wind held us up here
1	out of spite , they went to congratulate mr hsun on being the father of a metropolitan graduate , until he was so angry he could hardly speak
1	two days later , however , hung kan−hsien breathed his last
1	if not for that , it wouldn ’ t matter going back late
1	you are a good player , mr chen , said tsou
1	on entering the presence of the commissioner , magistrate tang took off his gauze cap and kowtowed again and again
1	then jia zheng dismissed them and went back to the west mansion
1	you are to retain your post in the ministry of works
1	if , however , you can not write paku essays well , then all your writing will be unorthodox and third−rate
1	did he start school this year ?
1	and jia zheng not knowing the reason said , you wanted to work here ; now you want to leave
1	the fifth son is not twelve yet , and if i adopt him they can trust me to love him and bring him up properly
1	he presented the letter with both hands
1	overjoyed , he ordered servants to wait on the visitor , then hurried in to let the old lady and lady wang identify the stone
1	send someone over at once to go with me ; i sha not want my full escort , ordered hsiao
1	he pulled up short , hanging his head
1	clean rooms were also prepared for the two doctors who would take it in turn to attend the child and make out prescriptions for her , remaining there in residence for twelve days
1	if you take that line , complained xiren , he ’ ll be even less willing to go
1	in the end , though he had two pieces more than tsou , he was worn out with the effort !
1	when i came in you ignored me and lay down in a huff — i ’ ve no idea why
1	he halted then with lowered head and said , you ’ re right , of course
1	now what i suggest is this
1	as it was the depth of winter the nights were long and an icy north wind chilled him to the bone
1	what ’ s rare about it ?
1	only too eager to believe this , wang hui felt overjoyed
1	very well , as her father approves , get everything ready and choose a day for setting off on this long journey , said the old lady
1	though xiaohong did not want to drop the matter , neither did she want to arouse the suspicions of others by questioning the young man
1	wang mien nodded assent
1	are you mrs xia , madam ?
1	chanjie was first speechless with anger
1	just look at ruhua : she was here for some years as well , but she left when she was told to
1	at that everyone laughed , knowing that she was referring to how xiangyun had fallen asleep earlier that day on a stone
1	if the hour of her birth is correct , she must be a sovereign lady
1	thereupon he wrote out and gave jia rong the following prescription :
1	but the scamp has fallen short of her kind expectations , he answered
1	now you ’ ve caught cold
1	for life is short
1	but do not ask me to go to the country ; i am not used to that kind of life
1	there are no such things as devils
1	and at my expense this time
1	you ’ d better let them off
1	suppose i get them tomorrow ?
1	but noticing some unusually beautiful water-fowl of various species unknown to her splashing about in the pool by seeping fragrance bridge , she stopped for a while to admire their brilliant colours
1	so cousin yun 's here !
1	he made the girls sit down and told qiuwen to take half the fruit to miss lin
1	ghosts are wailing below green maples ,
1	was that of lady wang
1	as baoyu had not yet seen what was on the paper and did not know what daiyu ’ s reaction would be , he dared not answer outright
1	after lunch i shall learn the emperor 's will
1	the fifth sign shows another ghost ; hence i fear your mother 's illness is quite serious
1	it ’ s no use asking her now that she ’ s in trouble
1	what maid here had any reason to throw herself into a well ?
1	i think another dose should set him right
1	cousin baochai was sitting on the edge of the kang , with cousin bao standing in front of her
1	nobody has died in your family
1	but i thought to myself : sour things are astringent , and when he was beaten and could not cry out some choleric humours must have rushed to his viscera ; plum juice might affect them , bringing on a serious illness , and that would never do
1	as wu shu saw him out , one of the college servants came rushing up
1	i don ’ t have to name him
1	after this yuanyang seldom went to the garden after dark ; and reflecting that if even the garden was the scene of such strange carryings-on , other places must be still worse , she went nowhere else either if she could avoid it
1	incense is burned on the ground
1	thou canst not one by one the crowd persuade ,
1	what a pity chi wei−hsiao is not here !
1	he retorted with a grin
1	it ’ s all very well for you to talk , cried qingwen
1	then jia yun left the compound
1	after driving xue pan away she had no one to squabble with as qiuling had gone to stay with baochai , leaving only baochan with her
1	we must think of some way out but on no account act rashly !
1	most certainly , agreed yoo
1	the bezoar is being brewed
1	soon a maid announced his arrival and an old nurse stepped forward to draw the bed-curtains
1	with clenched teeth he rained down dozens of vicious blows until his secretaries , foreseeing serious consequences , stepped forward to intervene
1	at first he had thought her one of the old lady 's attendants , never dreaming that she was xiren
1	so now his memory has come back again
1	and that would be too bad
1	ma chun−shang went in
1	by rights , i shouldn ’ t bring this up at our first meeting , madam
1	when jia lian escorted them out , he saw several countrified carts which the servants were forbidding to draw up there
1	he immediately wrote his name on a card and carried it to the library to pay his respects to the new teacher , taking his nine−year−old son with him
1	why should you be upset because of me ?
1	your fine family mansion with its garden , summer−houses and flowers was the best north of the yangtse , he said
1	being unable to sit with xiangyun and baoqin , he took a seat by the old lady and started toasting the guests one by one on baochai 's behalf
1	why does the jinx have to be found here ?
1	what did your clan say , cousin ?
1	he listened for some time
1	whatever she says goes , and no one dares stop her
1	leaving her question unanswered he exclaimed , what a swine this young yun is — ridiculous !
1	a man who wants to be both will succeed in neither !
1	after searching the city for him without success , we instituted careful inquiries
1	they ’ ve already been sent to your rooms
1	feng ziying only laughed
1	all those officials have pots of money , dignified faces and big ears
1	it was as follows :
1	all this made her suspicious
1	going back inside tanchun found xiangyun in tears , holding daiyu ’ s hand
1	i had no idea such trouble would come of it
1	well , just go with an easy mind
1	your single-mindedness should move the gods to pity
1	a rumour comes true and the imperial
1	li wan and the others read them
1	but your family has never thrown its weight about like that in the past
1	on that date we can all meet here
1	reasoning like this , he felt as jubilant as if seeing daiyu herself
1	he may have served his first master well , but still he ’ s only a servant and ought to show some respect
1	we should enjoy ourselves while we are young
1	she left this sentence unfinished
1	we send things to the garden , then they send them back here again — our own people doing the sending and the accepting !
1	the prince of beijing announced , '~we have summoned you today on his majesty 's orders for an interrogation
1	lingguan writes on the ground
1	beaming as he ate and drank beside the kang , xinger regaled old mrs you and her daughters with a detailed account of the rong mansion
1	of course , you ’ re inviting me to go and have everyone kowtow to me because it ’ s my birthday , but it would be a hundred times more to my liking if you had my annotated rewards and punishments neatly copied out and printed
1	he wrote something you might like to look at
1	i asked her to let us know what flower she ’ d be in charge of , she said , so that in future we can sacrifice to her
1	in his generosity he is actually encouraging his nephew 's bad habits
1	i presumed too much on your generosity in the past ; yet you are still so good to me
1	some busybody ’ s been talking to xifeng
1	and as i came through your main gate , i saw some pages carrying off your carriage for repairs they said it was cracking up
1	he packed his things , said goodbye to yu yu−chung , crossed the yangtse , and came to tu 's riverside house
1	just now i gave her mother fifty taels
1	chu hsien−fu came in to greet them , and they exchanged the usual compliments
1	the feast was served at three tables in the western hall , and the food was excellent though there was no opera to watch
1	re pulled her sleeve and pleaded , wouldo talk to me , cousin !
1	as there were many people standing round murmuring that it seemed there was no hope , hupo had to hold her tongue
1	what shall i do ?
1	daiyu rose at once to go
1	she was sipping her wine to keep him company when jia lian ’ s old wet-nurse nanny zhao came in
1	aunt li nodded and jia lan went off with the letter to find baoyu
1	did he come here the other day ?
1	tanchun asked her with a smile
1	aren ’ t you a girl too ?
1	so those who want a beating , just come late
1	now this prefect is one of your clan , and it 's not a big favour to ask
1	i have started on a pair of slippers but have not been able to finish them because i have been poorly for the last couple of days
1	that ’ s right , you must help me , madam , agreed aunt xue
1	baoyu , his eyes still blurred from sleep , took the jade and without so much as looking at it threw it on the ground
1	if you asked after talent or moral character , the reply was still , mr
1	the old lady said , they ’ re not married yet , and it wouldn ’ t look good to seize someone promised to another man
1	she prayed to heaven then with tears in her eyes , born a shi , i married into the jia family , and i earnestly implore holy buddha in heaven to have mercy on us !
1	when she had gone the two or three other elderly servants who were left , not being over-conscientious , slipped out to enjoy themselves
1	you mustn ’ t tell a soul though
1	in this way we shall cover all the fine sights and occupations of autumn
1	how could you strike even pinger yesterday ?
1	yingchun was so weak that none of the servants were afraid of her
1	you have nothing to worry about !
1	daiyu lay peacefully with closed eyes , snugly wrapped in an apricot-red silk quilt , while xiangyun ’ s black hair had tumbled all over the pillow , her quilt barely reached her shoulders , and she had flung one white arm adorned with two gold bracelets outside the covers
1	she declared i was the bane of her life , the way i demanded and grabbed everything i saw in her place
1	i have not yet congratulated you
1	wants to go in we will keep him company
1	we don ’ t know them , but they ’ re your relatives
1	i saw a lot of them for a couple of months , so of course i know
1	the wardrobes alone are bigger and higher than one of our whole rooms
1	let us return to baoyu
1	and by the lake is a belt of green where all the buffaloes of the village browse
1	what a barrier there is between wealth and poverty
1	today after lunch she did some reading but soon became bored with the book ; then she did a little needlework with zijuan and xueyan , but found this even more tedious
1	it 's late now ; you would better go back
1	li wan interposed at this point , i ’ ll go and see about getting some wine heated for you
1	now the days are so long , i was afraid you might alt be bored while i was out and go to bed after your meal , which might make you fall ill , i ’ m glad you found a way to amuse yourselves
1	but not daring to say so outright , she just tried to comfort her
1	cried li wan hurrying to meet her
1	go back quickly then , urged the old lady
1	the answer should be a line from the four books
1	after a little more chat xifeng took her leave , and having paid various other calls she went home
1	what you would just said was not right , ni er chuckled
1	i ’ ve been trying hard to console her , but it ’ s no use
1	every evening he continued to read poems in the temple
1	is it snowing outside ?
1	yen put on a scholar 's cap , a blue gown and red silk sash , while concubine chao dressed herself in crimson and put a gold chaplet on her head
1	now yuanyang after a bout of weeping thought , i have been with the old lady all my life , and i have found no niche for myself
1	she called the others to come to serve him his meal
1	leave the curtains as they are , he can see me like this
1	them out or recall them
1	but after standing there for a little while , they decided it was no use creating a disturbance , and went back to the river
1	you look like a precious object , but you still lack real value
1	the whole family , lady wang and baoyu too , have had a dressing-down
1	after a little drink i feel better , she answered
1	the world is full of strange phenomena ,
1	i agree to them all , dear sister , good kind sister
1	two sparrows were fighting over there , improvised xiren hastily
1	i will get you another , he promised
1	yoo liang went in to bow before his great−aunt 's shrine , then carried it to the stand
1	when she had dressed she kowtowed twice , then left the boat with the cuckold looking thoroughly ashamed
1	it 's time to write poems now
1	will you never learn to adapt yourself to circumstances ?
1	'we ’ d never do that
1	he was playing draughts one day with zhan guang , and both still had about the same number of pieces ; but in one corner the issue was not yet decided and each was trying to enclose that sector
1	do not denounce me to the king of hell !
1	you mustn ’ t trouble , sister !
1	the company roared with laughter
1	she chased after him regardless , expostulating , last time you lost the jade it nearly cost me my life !
1	now that your honour ’ s come to this post , said the attendant , surely you ’ ve copied out the officials ’ protective charm for this province ?
1	the runner laid hold of him
1	she giggled , i was kind enough to keep this between ourselves , yet you start manhandling me
1	i want you to live in harmony as a happy family , he told them
1	apart from my clothes and bedding i have nothing but a casket with a few old books in it , said wang hui
1	but it would not be right for us to stay here and wait while he sends a man all that way to fetch us
1	you must give me time to manage it
1	the two children , being only seven or eight , had no sense and just went on crying and pleading with her
1	recognizing baoyu 's voice jia yun hurried in
1	you also have to collect twelve drains of dew on the day white dew , number twelve drains of frost on the day frost falls , number and twelve drains of snow on the day slight snownumber these liquids are mixed with the other ingredients , then twelve drains of honey and twelve of white sugar are added to make pills the size of longans
1	that ’ s why , at the risk of a beating , i slipped over to see her
1	i ’ m always urging you not to listen to that vulgar talk or think about those vulgar matters
1	they rejoined yen , and after a little more conversation and a cup of tea , their servant came in to tell them that classmates were waiting for them to go to a literary meeting
1	if she were officious or spiteful , i ’ d never have dreamed of it either it would look as if i were trying to show her up
1	if he wouldn ’ t agree , we could say he was the one who killed zhang san then laid the blame on an outsider
1	if he 's in the outer gaol i know how to reach him
1	what ’ s this under the inkstone ?
1	madam you ceremoniously presented tea to the lady dowager while jia rong ’ s wife served the other elderly ladies , after which madam you served lady xing ’ s group and jia rong ’ s wife the girls
1	just now miss lin didn ’ t know it either , agreed the women
1	then pan the headman arrived on the scene , and persuaded the other man to quiet down
1	we ’ d never have thought of such a thing
1	now this woman was so curiously constituted that the touch of a man seemed to melt her very bones , so that he felt as if bedded in cotton-wool , while in her wanton tricks and amorous cries she outdid any prostitute
1	i ’ m on duty all day long at the inner gate , stammered lai wang
1	in that case , why have you been hiding at home for so long , instead of bringing your money here to give us all a good time ?
1	but those things are in some cases in the east attic
1	why , what valuables are you afraid of people stealing that you carry these keys about on you ?
1	after dinner they chatted for a while before retiring for the night , and xiangyun went back to daiyu ’ s rooms , with baoyu escorting them there
1	if i do , may a thunderbolt strike me dead !
1	every girl , not to mention yuanyang , wants to rise in the world and become someone of importance
1	when jia lian saw how things were , he was very pleased with second sister ’ s virtuous conduct
1	i ’ ve had insomnia a long time now , daiyu sighed
1	all noble ladies come from the realm of love and retribution
1	smiling , xifeng returned her greeting and hand in hand they entered the house , where xifeng took the seat of honour while second sister ordered her maid to bring a cushion , then knelt to pay her respects
1	second sister ordered wine and food to be prepared
1	she had heard a great deal from her mother about the magnificence of her grandmother ’ s home ; and during the last few days she had been impressed by the food , costumes and behaviour of the relatively low-ranking attendants escorting her
1	be a good fellow !
1	ting−hsi 's eyes nearly started from his head , and for a moment he was speechless
1	as the fireworks went off with a series of bangs , tu leant back in his chair and roared with laughter
1	an imperial decree has conferred on him the rank of grand secretary and the posthumous title of duke wenqin , he announced
1	just now our mistress sent to find your cousin xifeng ; but she wasn ’ t at home and they said she ’ d come to the garden
1	when hupo saw her she exclaimed in surprise :
1	his king chanced there and happy proved the day
1	his glorious dynasty ere long was lost
1	the lady dowager made her sit down and suggested , what about a game of cards ?
1	i shall call to tell him
1	the sturgeon has its tarn ,
1	so if you have no objection i would like to sleep outside for a couple more nights
1	give me something to take then , or ask to borrow something
1	drive out those dirty nuns , quick !
1	no , there are not any in yangchow , replied wan
1	we ’ re not as well off as we used to be
1	why be so stupid ?
1	his aunt promptly sent for the best wine in the house
1	yen 's cheeks as he pointed to a chest and said , yesterday the pawnshop sent three hundred taels of interest over
1	on hearing this , the two scholars came
1	that ’ s why i secretly stopped her pay as a maid and gave her two taels a month from my own allowance , so that she ’ d understand and look after him even better
1	but you may fall ill if you can ’ t write good poems
1	as soon as this man came in he ordered the attendants to clear away the tea things
1	i know his middlemen
1	then pay the chair−bearers and send them away
1	without coming here , i could not have appreciated the old poet 's way of putting it !
1	first brother has eight corners ,
1	how can i save you ?
1	it was mr lai who paid for my tea just now
1	no end to their victuals and clothing , but at last
1	when pao knelt to pay his respects , mr hsiang raised him up with both hands
1	jia she kept summoning more bonzes and taoists , but because these could do no good jia zheng lost patience and tried to dissuade him
1	the girls were laughing too much to hear his knock , so that he shouted and pounded for a long time before they finally heard
1	do not alarm the old lady
1	she then turned to pinger
1	studio of autumn freshness
1	your third sister ’ s rather smart , remarked daiyu
1	what do you mean ?
1	lady wang opened the packets but could not recall what they were , and there was no ginseng among them
1	you would better give your money to the pimp at feng family lane in yicheng !
1	but to her surprise , upsetting her even more , he simply sighed , how sublime !
1	as they went out she said to mrs wang , i have a suggestion , if you agree to it , and that is to restrict the search to our own family
1	someone told me he was in chiangnan , so i have been there three times
1	she turned to baoyu
1	he put these on the counter and they started drinking
1	but the doctor would not tell me
1	when xiren heard knocking at the gate , she got up at once and sent to ask what was so pressing
1	because he and daiyu both lived in the lady dowager ’ s quarters he was closer to her than to the other girls , and being closer had grown more intimate ; but precisely because of this he sometimes offended her by being too demanding and thoughtless
1	i don ’ t want them
1	so eat early and go and rest
1	buddhists and taoists hung up long banners , chanted their scriptures and performed the funeral rites ; while the widow and her little son wailed morning and evening before the coffin
1	there was no fixed standard of scholarship , however
1	she went to the bridal chamber where wuer was setting out candles
1	but you must not let him know i put you up to this
1	not that her mother pays any attention , and her father does nothing either , so poor yingchun 's worse off now than one of our third-grade maids
1	she then thought the whole business over carefully once more , and hit on a cunning plan to kill several birds with one stone , working out the safest measures to achieve this
1	of course , if your tastes are simple you can have less
1	i don ’ t know , ma ’ am
1	he travelled all day , stopping only to refresh himself when he was hungry or thirsty , staying in inns at night , and he had been three days on the way when a caravan of pack-horses came towards him escorted by a dozen or so men on horseback
1	xiren asked where they were taking the hamper and what was in it
1	qingwen was wasting away , having touched no food for four or five days ; but now with dishevelled hair she was dragged from the kang and two women carried her off
1	if you want to study quietly , sheyue said , who ’ d dream of disturbing you ?
1	the next instant she started at a loud dong like the sound of a bronze bell or copper chimes repeated eight or nine times
1	it ’ s a mystery to me the way things turn out
1	have you written the letter yet ?
1	aunt xue was already upset on this score
1	you must explain more clearly
1	if he had , heaven knows how wildly he ’ d carry on !
1	she insisted i come to see if you would made it up
1	instead of answering , she stepped forward and threw the powder in fangguan ’ s face
1	he sighed appreciatively , this is certainly unexpected
1	with that he tucked the stone into his sleeve and hurried off with the taoist
1	i shall take part too
1	when the old man went to the yamen , yoo sent a servant to find tang san
1	you ’ ll catch your death after that sweat you were in , she scolded
1	the other , shaped like a small alms-bowl , bore the name in the curly seal script : rhinoceros cup
1	her sweet soul gone with the wind ,
1	if i died today or tomorrow , this year or next , i ’ d die content
1	even if you don ’ t see her ladyship you must see her , or your visit will have been wasted
1	how can you refuse ?
1	you must excuse us
1	if they make scathing remarks , just pretend not to hear and go about your own business
1	in which a monk invited to say masses is involved in a lawsuit , and a country gentleman out to raise money runs into trouble when fan chin 's mother realized that everything in the house was hers , overcome with joy she fell senseless to the ground
1	i hear our master is leading troops to suppress the miaos , he said as soon as he saw them
1	with their lady ships letting her down , who else is going to help poor xifeng ?
1	the two runners , waiting at the gate , barred her way
1	they have all changed since last i was here
1	wei−hsiao , replied the captain
1	who took my sister-in-law 's things ?
1	bonzes chanting sutras burned incense , sacrificed to the hungry ghosts and intoned the water penitential while thirteen young nuns in red slippers and embroidered robes recited incantations before the coffin to lead the soul on its way
1	why did not you put more on before bringing my tea ?
1	why ask me that ?
1	as there was insufficient room on the kang , xiaoyan and sier set two chairs beside it
1	i ’ ll get the blame if you ’ re seen leaving , said jia qiang
1	then , having taken his leave of the lady dowager , he went over to the other mansion
1	they were all wearing brand−new headdresses and jackets
1	on that day all the neighbours brought congratulatory gifts , even kuei contributing his share , so anxious was he now to keep in with them
1	dairu had crossed out child and substituted at fifteen
1	under the impression that daiyu was unconscious , and as zijuan was away , xueyan took daishu ’ s hand and asked her in a low voice , was it true what you told me the other day about some mr wang proposing a match for our master bao ?
1	and she sent messengers posthaste to take the news
1	seating herself on the steps leading to the small courtyard , she made the girl kneel down
1	i can truly never repay her tremendous kindness
1	what were you doing ?
1	that nephew of hers was an odd fellow too
1	i come from south of the yangzi , but my parents are dead and i ’ m all on my own , with no brothers ; so i have to put up in my grandmother ’ s house
1	if he discovered that i ’ d sent someone else , in the temper he ’ s in now he ’ d vent his anger on
1	though i have a son , it ’ s as if i had none
1	what have i got to say to you !
1	he sat there for a long time , but not even a ghost appeared
1	there ’ s a reason , answered pinger
1	but before the ropes could be pulled another crack was heard , and the ankle−screws broke once more
1	lady wang had taken baoyu on her lap
1	his anecdotes on painting when he described the frescoes zhang sengyou painted in a monastery
1	idly my orchids into wreaths i bent
1	the neighbours brought eggs or wine , lugged along sacks of rice or carried over chickens
1	presents they don ’ t expect , but she should at least kowtow to express her thanks
1	i ’ ve felt worried for you all these years with no father , mother or brothers to care for you
1	i only beseech you all to stay and watch over me until the day that i turn into floating ashes — no , not ashes
1	i came simply to pay my respects to the third master
1	indicating jia lian , the young man said , i have come to have a word with second uncle
1	you ca not hurry him
1	just sit where you are
1	crafty xifeng kills her rival
1	they look so refined one would expect them to be understanding , but they ’ re stupid fools with no insight at all into other people ’ s hearts
1	and your commanding presence—so unlike mr chih 's mature dignity—struck awe into my heart
1	baoqin , standing up too , continued :
1	jumping to one side , he whirled round to confront a man with a club ; and as this fellow lunged at him , hsiao shot up a foot to send him sprawling
1	one ’ s too greasy , the other too sweet , complained the old lady
1	yes , replied mr wei
1	li wan assented and did so , after first calling for water to wash her hands
1	all he could do was to wait
1	just say yes ’ to whatever he tells you and you ’ ll be all right
1	editing nowadays is going to the dogs , declared mr wei
1	i wish i were dead !
1	then the emperor demanded angrily , 'how can your family allow your servants to abduct a good citizen 's wife ?
1	and how much damage has been done inside ?
1	i know you wo not look at me , but let me just say one word
1	i want to give them as presents
1	presently we should write some poems on red plum-blossom , she suggested
1	as they skirted the back of a rockery , baochai inquired :
1	ting−hsi dared say no more , but asked kuei to go with him to call on the go−betweens
1	the other day a man came from my district and told me that my father was ill at home ; and i am miserable because i do not know whether he is alive or dead
1	is this the place for you to bawl abuse ?
1	you minx , you don ’ t deserve such luck , madam you teased
1	go on , you little bitch , chuckled her mother
1	so one of the small girls went to ask her sister to speak to old mrs fei
1	why spank me for something my mother said ?
1	i have already made one
1	to return to daiyu
1	to live quietly and contentedly in a green plot in the city as you do , uncle , is as good as being an immortal !
1	when you see the old lady , please give her my respects and tell her i ’ m a bit poorly , but it ’ s nothing serious she ’ s not to worry
1	have bao er and that fellow he san tied up
1	that would do just as welt
1	will take their natural course ' , he said
1	you came here to have a good time
1	it must be zijuan , she thought with relief
1	ni er 's spirits rose again
1	that should take us over the whole grounds
1	if she doesn ’ t , no harm will be done as no one else will know
1	two imperial eunuchs have come , asking to see your lordships , he announced
1	he and the girls stayed to dine with the old lady , after which they dispersed , aunt xue staying on to sleep in the old lady ’ s annex
1	from that hour baoyu treated xiren with special consideration and she served him even more faithfully than before
1	and where is your honourable yamen ?
1	if this food is poison , ours is pure arsenic
1	i am sorry to have put you and my cousin to such trouble
1	they can ’ t do a thing if i withhold the tally
1	how silly can you get ?
1	even more embarrassed than earlier on with daiyu , he turned away to talk to the others
1	since this made it out of the question to wait any longer , yucun went through a passage to the side gate and left
1	are you my uncle chuang cho−chiang ?
1	our examinations are a great affair of state , and since we were busy on state business , even if we had to neglect our own relatives we need feel no compunction
1	that ’ s apart from what else they filch
1	in which mrs wang quarrels with her husband , and ni ting−chu finds his brother big foot went home to report that mrs wang was willing , and shen tien−fu announced this to kuei when he arrived the next morning for news
1	i do not want to flatter you , he said , but i know something about fortune−telling and you have noble features
1	after reading the title he looked up thoughtfully to ask baoyu , have you studied mencius already ?
1	what a coincidence , meeting you here
1	consoled by these reflections , she forgot the fatigues of the day and started reading again , till zijuan who was worn out urged her to sleep
1	he is the third son of the former minister hu , and his name is hu chen
1	after i was twenty i learned how to be a secretary , and i have worked in a number of yamens
1	pinger shook her head
1	if that 's what you want , those things are dirt cheap
1	she shook herself and changed into a lovely girl with a most bewitching face
1	is anything there that shouldn ’ t be ?
1	lou feng agreed with him
1	it was supported by those with official positions , who contributed according to the size of their stipends , and an elderly man of good reputation in the clan was elected to take charge of the boys ’ instruction
1	by now xichun was feeling more wretched than ever
1	why has not he come to welcome mr chou ?
1	lady xing insisted that she stay for the evening meal
1	just give him jia yucun 's name , and tell him what you want of him
1	admittedly , her two messages were not long , but she spoke to the point
1	don ’ t let anyone give her the wrong medicine , though
1	how did we come to take on someone so stupid ?
1	the lady dowager turned to tell xifeng , go and fetch xiangyun , baochai , baoqin and daiyu , and ask tanchun to come with them
1	you can wear them when you ’ re better
1	but please go and beg her ladyship to let me off
1	in the other were tiny fried dumplings no more than one inch long
1	they are simply natural forces , but whatever they enter assumes a form
1	although a court purveyor , he knew nothing of business or worldly affairs but prevailed on his grandfather ’ s old connections to find him a well-paid sine-cure in the board of revenue and left all business to his agents and old family servants
1	it 's nearly time for the examination and your grandfather has it very much on his mind
1	how old are you ?
1	meanwhile lady wang and the others had finished their melons , and after some further talk the party broke up , the girls returning to the garden
1	with the capital so far from your honourable district !
1	you have reason to worry , madam
1	it was so amusing that i stayed to watch
1	i am overjoyed at this encounter here !
1	it must be lord zhen ’ s fault
1	there was an omen this spring
1	a true gourmand should also have wine ;
1	on the left 'two aces ' combine
1	when your mother died i was far away in peking , and could not come back to mourn for her in person
1	and one night she said : all i pray for now is that buddha will take me away in your place and let you get well
1	we ’ ve just got her to stop crying
1	if nothing had happened , well and good ; as it is , high and low alike we are all in trouble so who can get you off ?
1	do not be in such a hurry !
1	the latter assented but waited till the old lady had washed her hands , rinsed her mouth and left the table to chat with lady wang
1	if you can ’ t make her drink , chuckled the old lady , i ’ ll go out presently and toast her myself
1	his rooms were filled with the pungent scent of herbs and qingwen was lying all alone on the kang , her face flushed with fever , her forehead hot to his touch
1	after a short rest , however , he asked abruptly , is not there someone missing ?
1	still , you ’ re in too much of a hurry to give her a job
1	from joy and grief alike your heart was free ;
1	you ’ re only joking , cousin , said xiangyun , but some people are really jealous
1	xiren remarked , as your parents aren ’ t on the spot , they must have spoken to your sister-in law
1	my brother should never have agreed to that match
1	we know what ’ s in your heart
1	there should not be any difficulty
1	xifeng told hongyu , take those things and see master yun out
1	do you work here ?
1	miaoyu would not drink out of any cups but her own ; however , before long her maid brought over her things and xichun herself made the tea
1	if there ’ s anything of use to you , you can have it ; and if you ’ ll make out a list of what ’ s still missing , i ’ ll send people to buy it
1	when i stopped him he was not his usual self , the rough way he pushed and shoved me without any feeling at all ; and later he had less patience with madam bao and not the least feeling for the other girls either , as if he would awoken to the truth
1	when you two fall out , why put the blame on me ?
1	the salt merchant will have nothing so good to offer me !
1	that was why he gave her the name li wan and the courtesy name gongcai
1	i do not know how you feel about it
1	i did not go , said wang teh with a frown
1	and here is the song to summon her spirit :
1	thanks to the imperial favour and the virtue of our ancestors , your noble highness embodies the finest essences of nature and the accumulated merit of our forbears — such fortune has attended my wife and myself
1	it 's nothing like in the old days
1	jia rong , knowing his game , rejoined , if you ’ ve taken such a fancy to her , uncle , i ’ ll act as your go-between to make her your secondary wife
1	she had to send xue ke to smooth matters over with the county court
1	why , even a number of tigers , wolves , snakes and insects have now entered nirvana
1	nowadays we have these disgraceful scenes — not like a respectable family , she said
1	we can only hope that from now on he will stick to the right path and never be influenced again by those evil spirits !
1	what a poor opinion you have of other people !
1	by the afternoon , however , more relatives and friends arrived , entailing even more work , and she could not see to everything at once
1	we have no scholar there by that name
1	then he reported the matter to lady wang , and obtained permission to leave the corpse for five days in pear fragrance court before its removal to iron threshold temple
1	it ’ s nothing but a cold , said the doctor
1	why should miss lin be angry ?
1	we ’ re all women , only a bit different in status , so i can ’ t think why anyone should be so cruel
1	the lady dowager and the rest sat at tables on either side , while madam you , li wan and xifeng passed round dishes and poured the wine
1	i am worried too by his illness
1	the old lady isn ’ t here to keep an eye on him today~~
1	all you know is how to enjoy yourself
1	when she passed on her instructions , baochai , baoqin , daiyu , tanchun and xiangyun all went with her to the garden where they were introduced and paid their respects
1	if it 's not , we will let whoever it is get a soaking
1	but of them all xue pan was the most frantic , being afraid that in the crush his mother might be knocked over , baochai stared at , or xiangling exposed to indignities -- for he knew what libertines jia zhen and the rest were
1	li wan , baoyu and the rest , on receiving these presents , tipped the messengers and told them that they would thank baochai when next they saw her
1	xifeng had no choice but to do as she was told
1	watchful pinger quickly followed her and took her arm
1	baoyu reckoned on his fingers
1	daliao answered with a smile , why , madam , with your broad knowledge of past and present , have not you heard the story of how wang xifeng of the han dynasty found an official post ?
1	say what you have to say , but keep your hands to yourself
1	that fortune−telling is a low profession goes without saying ; but even teaching and secretarial work are not proper careers
1	dismissal was the last thing mother he wanted
1	i wish you a good journey , he said
1	this is made from the essences of the different exotic young plants which grow in all famous mountain resorts
1	if mr wei respects him , i should respect him ten times as much , magistrate shih reflected
1	jia lian was released , while all ha she 's men and women bondservants were registered and sequestrated
1	in addition there were two other maids and some old nurses from the different apartments , as well as some stewards ' wives
1	where did you put up last night , sir ?
1	what do you want two coffins for ?
1	the lady dowager sends for her motherless
1	the brigade general ordered his three forces to encamp at wild goat pool
1	if we asked caiyun in confidence and she owned up , yuchuan could stop worrying and everybody would forget about it
1	and doubting the use of this , aunt xue prevailed on xifeng to send jia lian with several thousand taels to buy off the magistrate , while xue ke at the same time squared the others involved
1	that ’ s a good child too
1	let me recite you a verse , sir
1	after one beat on the gong the music started
1	jia zheng described the raid to him and asked him to make inquiries
1	twenty branches descended from the duke of ningguo and the duke of rongguo
1	before she could finish lady wang rapped out , we ’ re talking about the jade
1	as lady wang raised no objection , the serving-woman brought in granny liu and greetings were exchanged
1	we have two types of miaos — the wild and the tame , said the prefect
1	as they were speaking , servants brought in tea ; and after the tea mr hu stood up and invited them into the library
1	there was nothing the magistrate could do but send the feast to the servant 's quarters and ask his stewards to eat with the actor
1	do not be in such a hurry , objected li wan
1	but not too much salt has been lost , and your honour has already punished the helmsman , so that he will be more careful in future
1	i ’ d better raise a rumpus in miss lin ’ s place instead
1	jia yucun had no choice but to say goodbye to the priest and leave the temple
1	puzzled to find them all with red eyes , granny liu presently asked , what 's wrong ?
1	we ’ re a happy family of kith and kin i must say , all like game-cocks fighting to finish each other off
1	when nothing can be called a test
1	clouds from the islands make a haze over the ocean ,
1	it did not matter your asking me to take in the tea — you could not do anything else
1	what do you want incense for ?
1	it ’ s made two hundred and twenty ingots in all
1	what does it matter ?
1	in spite of their depleted numbers , however , it was quite a merry family feast
1	well , it 's not often they spend their money on me
1	leading a hard life , uninfluenced by the imperial examinations , they retained their sterling qualities
1	she told the two young maids to accompany him
1	how is it my mother knows all the faults of the other girls but not those of you , sheyue and qiuwen ?
1	she asked what they were
1	she sneezed so violently , five or six times in succession , that her nose and eyes started to run
1	we have some families of tribesmen here just say i ’ m from one of those
1	yinger stepped forward to report , when i saw master bao going out i told sister xiren to go with him
1	he drew back instantly as if obeying an imperial decree or a mandate from buddha
1	and i , though i may be ill-fated , do not deserve this
1	he tendered them thanks one by one for coming
1	governor hsu of chekiang province invited our master to visit the west lake with him , he was told
1	he left the study and had just reached the main gate when he saw xue pan there bawling , who let that lad liu get away ?
1	baoyu , on the other hand , was the one with the least to do and the most leisure
1	it ’ s because of him that i was dismissed , she told her mother
1	then he suddenly burst into tears
1	they actually kowtowed to me too , and called me a living buddha !
1	with cress leaves green my simple gown i made ,
1	nothing , was the reply
1	the proverb says 'even the longest feast must break up at last
1	at the main entrance her pages withdrew and maid-servants raised the curtain of the carriage
1	and though they hadn ’ t met for so many years , as soon as he visited her family old mrs xia , having no son herself , sturck by your cousin ’ s good looks shed tears of joy , more delighted than if he had been her own son
1	why should you talk like this ?
1	and , as they were cursing away , a family servant arrived from kweichow with a letter from their father , which they read together
1	till death seals up their eyes
1	take any of them you like
1	however , madam you 's exhortations only made xichun more eager to kill herself
1	when did you go to court , sir ?
1	at this everybody laughed
1	white snow and red plum-blossom make
1	zijuan promptly tucked daiyu ’ s quilt round her and put down the bed-curtains , while xueyan hastily tidied up the room
1	if any minor points had to be settled , jia zhen and the others would explain them to him or send him a written report , while he passed on his instructions through jia lian and lai da
1	she certainly seems a strange case , said wu shu
1	it seems there was no other course to follow apart from that of yang zhu
1	if i tell you , you mustn ’ t let her know , said xueyan
1	thought kuo , and fell unconscious to the ground
1	the lady dowager burst out laughing
1	i am always scolding him , pleading with him , getting angry with him or crying over him , but after a short improvement back he slips
1	spend every morning on that
1	i know you ’ ve come out to avoid the big feast and the racket at home today
1	she was afraid she had a spring rash again , and would like some rose-nitric powder to apply to it
1	the next morning his mother took him to the chin family next door
1	still , she thought , she ’ s a girl who ’ s always been submissive and a model of propriety
1	go in and congratulate the old lady , quick !
1	xifeng swore at pinger , other people ’ s cats catch mice for them , but mine just steals my chickens !
1	questioned about the theft , he mentioned zhou rui 's involvement
1	i ’ m sure i could acquit myself quite creditably in the examinations ; but i have no money in my wallet for travelling expenses and the capital is far away
1	we ’ ve only just now learned it
1	'~your elder brother connived with provincial officials to oppress the weak , and allowed his son to organize gambling parties and abduct another man 's wife , who took her own life rather than submit
1	i don ’ t see this working out , was her verdict
1	how can you be so stupid ?
1	let us now return to jia zheng who was escorting the old lady 's coffin south
1	she was just leaving to do this when they heard daiyu 's voice outside , and baoyu lost no time in inviting her in
1	censor shih was the first to break the silence
1	they urged me to join it too !
1	longed in the wilderness to roam at will
1	i must find some great occasion to assemble you all again—that would be worth doing
1	where have you been all this time ?
1	and on top of all that she has two or three gold bracelets , two pure gold tiaras , and more pearls and jewels than you can count
1	please come in and take a seat , miss , she invited when she saw who it was
1	was i telling the truth , or not ?
1	the lady dowager and lady wang welcomed these guests most warmly
1	she had started back to rejoin the other girls when a pair of jade-coloured butterflies the size of a circular fan appeared before her
1	exclaimed the old lady , laughing
1	with that they all got up and set off for paddy-sweet cottage , baoyu reading the poem on the way
1	looking round to make sure she asked :
1	when his father died he would not let his brothers pay a cent of the funeral expenses , but shouldered the whole cost himself
1	he knew then that this was no ordinary child , so carried him back to his cave and brought him up
1	she was interrupted by the cry thank goodness !
1	realizing from this tirade that their master was quite beside himself with rage , they hurried away , feeling constrained to send word to the inner apartments
1	i have no time , so i recommended you
1	just choose two lengths to make your little cousin some clothes
1	look at all the good deeds he has done at the frontier and the number of lives he has saved
1	she was interrupted at this point by xifeng , who heaved a long sigh
1	i am the one hoping to learn from them
1	mind you rest well
1	xifeng has hallucinations and
1	only huan was unchanged , and his father could feel no real affection for him
1	if you ’ ve something good for me , hand it over quickly , i ’ ve other things to attend to
1	you sent for me , sir , the diviner said to jia rong
1	one about the end of the tang dynasty and the five dynasties , they replied
1	i have lost by half a piece !
1	at least leave us a little face
1	together they went home and arranged mrs hsun 's funeral
1	high and low in the ning and rong mansions knew of this , and none of them but deplored it
1	as soon as the river ’ s crossed you pull down the bridge
1	that year our mistress came to the capital , master bao fell very ill he lost consciousness for so long that his father was frantic and had all the funeral preparations made
1	but now that you have passed the examination and become a scholar , you will be able to support the family by teaching
1	aunt xue had been so delighted to hear of xianglian ’ s betrothal to third sister that she had decided to buy and furnish a house for him , prepare the bride ’ s trousseau and then choose an auspicious day for the wedding to express her gratitude to him for saving her son ’ s life
1	did he manage to write the couplets ?
1	a word with you
1	and finally he collapsed in a fit of delirium
1	they drink and gamble whenever they have the chance , sleeping during the day so as to play cards at night
1	are the others all dead ?
1	then the actor took his list away
1	by nature fair as an orchid ,
1	to roam alone in coir cape and bamboo hat ,
1	she had to get up twice just before dawn , which left her tired out this morning
1	we still have to buy our own with those two taels
1	but in what way are you precious ?
1	alarmed and scandalized , jia zheng summoned baoyu , who hurried in without knowing why he was wanted
1	pinger inclined her head and accepted it
1	a young maid put the dice-pot before yuanyang , who did as she was
1	as baoyu was finely-featured and as the thick foliage screened all but the top of his face , she took him for a maid
1	she happened to come in at that moment with two dishes
1	if she takes it regularly every day , after two or three years her health should be much better
1	the attendants had simply observed him look into the mirror , let it fall and then open his eyes and pick it up again
1	i have lost track of all these ladies and mistresses
1	all right then , i ’ ll see to this
1	presently they reached the rong mansion and found all its gates , too , open right up to the main hall
1	but they took the money , protested madam you
1	that 's natural , said chi
1	instead of helping you , i should just be a burden to you , and that would make me unhappy
1	the runners came back and reported : none of the stewards are there
1	we may fill a page with sorrow and self-pity ,
1	you should see what i ’ m wearing underneath , chuckled xiangyun
1	since you dare hold people up , you must know some of the military arts , said kuo after eating
1	the lady dowager and other women were sobbing too bitterly to make any reply
1	and miss baoqin as well
1	when questioned , explained her threat made in fun of going back to suzhou
1	marvelling , he had to turn back
1	baoyu ordered them to fetch the silver medicine-pot and brew the decoction over the brazier
1	no sooner had they buried the blossom than xiren appeared
1	he told the other servants to search with their lanterns , but all they found on the ground were a few empty cases which he asked them to put away while he himself went to the mistresses ' quarters
1	they say these are things the master bought for himself , not included in the bill of goods
1	no , said chin tung−yeh
1	upon reaching the library door , he saw tu shao−ching sitting there with a guest
1	who are the honourable guests you said were coming today ?
1	but let us return to baoyu , who felt so lackadaisical after jia yun left that he curled up as if for a nap
1	you ’ d better not go in till they ’ ve finished
1	the others all urged him to go out to question his page , and stepped into the corridor themselves to listen
1	there ’ s no danger of the two young people meeting , and it shouldn ’ t worry you if she sees aunt xue and the two cousins of the other family every day
1	delighted to hear that an official would be calling at their house , his uncles consented readily
1	he protested , but the heart isn ’ t anywhere near the ribs
1	and xia jingui observing this tried to control him more strictly step by step
1	this is good enough
1	i have got a good job for you — but you must not forget to thank me for it !
1	although i have eyes , he exclaimed , i have failed to see mount tai !
1	have pity , heaven , on a pious woman !
1	do let me stay with you , madam !
1	marshal ping triumphs at green maple city a few hundred yards from here , the old woman told the abbot , is a hill called bright moon ridge
1	i must insist that you come to my house tomorrow
1	chi wei−hsiao clapped his hands
1	baoyu lit the incense , bowed , poured libations and burned sacrificial paper , then went to do obeisance in the clan temple and the ancestral hall in the ning mansion
1	in the fields spring leeks are green ;
1	you are wrong there , your honour , said tang
1	for example , how did i get here , when i ’ m a southerner ?
1	but first i must warn you that the wooden cups aren ’ t like porcelain ones ; they come in a set , and you must drink from every cup in the set
1	she wanted to summon zhuier then and there
1	if you open it there , you will have no difficulty in finding him
1	she should have come , but we have no one to keep an eye on things at home , so she has to stay in , aunt xue explained
1	what is it that ’ s so urgent ?
1	he is on the boat and will not be coming into the city since he is leaving in a few days
1	it was so as to make us laugh
1	where did i put that new brush the other day ?
1	now that we relatives have met , you must not leave with nothing to show for your visit
1	if you keep sitting up you may catch cold
1	while talking she had slowly finished the wine and now she started examining the cup
1	before new year i heard the old lady say she wanted to engage miss baoqin to you
1	if you go to the board , they ’ ll fleece you
1	where were you all the time ?
1	of course i know him
1	falling like drops of blood on each bare bough
1	if you will just pass me the bowl , you can report back so much the sooner and have your own meal
1	fang stood up too
1	you are better off without them
1	jia lian was very put out when he heard this
1	he went to talk the business over with lin zhixiao , then sent people to negotiate and finally hushed the matter up by paying two hundred taels
1	the overawed boatmen did their best to please these important passengers , and the journey passed without incident
1	i will return the indictment to huan−cheng , and he can do what he likes with it
1	don ’ t let on a word about this when you go home
1	jia lian and xifeng were having their meal together when this summons arrived
1	by this time the opera was over
1	the old lady was under the influence of wine , and in the still night , under the bright moon , the plaintive music touched her heart and she could not hold hack her tears
1	it ca not count as disclosing any secret , as this was fated
1	no matter how angry you are , miss , do think of your health !
1	if we dismiss her , i am afraid she will be unwilling , or threaten to kill herself ; but i doubt whether my husband would agree to keeping her
1	after being told off by sheyue , this woman was afraid that she might not be allowed to remain in charge of fangguan , and that would be very much to her disadvantage
1	caiping went out to usher in yuanyang , who had brought a young maid carrying a small yellow silk bundle
1	that provoked our old ancestress into baiting me
1	powers of darkness derange the inmates
1	he 's even done me out of my rent !
1	of course nobody brings her anything ; but even if they did , she ’ d only send presents to those who have power and big face
1	you can ’ t get by if i don ’ t curse you every other day !
1	only lady wang and baochai behaved as if this were a separation for lifetheir tears coursed down and they nearly burst out sobbing as baoyu , laughing like a maniac , went out
1	he found the lodge there quiet and deserted , with only a few old women in charge of the place at night
1	what has your grand-aunt come for ?
1	– the crowd roared with laughter and dispersed
1	after this she asked mrs zhou to convey xifeng ’ s thanks to aunt xue
1	tell li gui that i ’ m going to call on the prince of beijing , and that he must stop anyone going out to look for me
1	we had wine ready in the evening , but you did not come
1	she can put up with poverty , and wealth wouldn ’ t spoil her either
1	her dressing−table and embroidery−stand were stacked with essays , and every day she annotated and punctuated a few
1	it ’ s outrageous to make a scene here
1	we were waiting here on tenterhooks while you had a good time , she said reproachfully
1	what friends has mr chu ?
1	what do you intend to do now ?
1	tears of distress welled up in qingwen 's eyes
1	xifeng was anxious for news of her husband but had not liked to question zhaoer too closely in the presence of others
1	may i ask your honourable age ?
1	thank you , said tu
1	i went home at the end of last year and stopped here on my way back to the capital to look up an old friend
1	do not accuse this flower of ignorance—
1	pinger hetd her up and called for help to carry her back to her room , where they laid her gently on her bed and ordered hongyu to give her a drink of warm water
1	his grandmother assured him
1	cousin xue would never do such a thing !
1	peach-blossom , trampled , stains the ground with red
1	though they may be poor they ’ re the same as our own young ladies , so you must look after them well
1	some day when you have time , you can listen to us using his name to the old lady and lady wang ; then you ’ ll understand
1	ordered by jia lian to ascertain what had been left by the thieves , all they could find were some clothes , some lengths of silk and a money-box everything else had gone
1	i knew it wouldn ’ t rise
1	pinger had just scooped out the yellow flesh of a crab , and at this gibe she aimed it at hupo 's face , laughing
1	he was the only son i had left
1	the two brothers listened with grave respect , then bowed to him ; and the old man took their hands to escort them outside the front gate
1	do you think somebody offended her ?
1	i would like you , father , to go home and tell my mother , and ask her to come so that i can say goodbye to her
1	without venturing to answer , the nuns left
1	silver is nothing to him
1	overjoyed at being received , he hastened in and greeted her effusively , beaming with smiles
1	over a month later , when his money was finished , during one of his strolls he ran into a man at the end of his lane who bowed to him
1	as the lad greeted him , tu took him by the arm and looked him over
1	the selection of two words for the tablet is easy , said his father
1	let them carry me in now in this sedan−chair and we will see how he treats me
1	you don ’ t understand , baoyu sighed
1	so i ’ m very glad you came
1	there 's another thing i wanted to say , sir
1	i know these must be wooden bowls that the children use
1	if you are a scholar , cried the comptroller angrily , how dare you get so disgustingly drunk at night ?
1	yesterday your uncle told me you would already approached him
1	at first sight i saw nothing wrong , she said
1	what are you doing here ? asked mrs zhou
1	aren ’ t you tired after the last few days ?
1	they found that , although badly bruised on both face and body , he had broken on bones
1	it depends half on what one can do for him half on his own fate
1	we need money ourselves as well
1	but pounding the table and banging the bench she rounded on him tearfully
1	there ’ s no fun in hurried visits every day
1	fetch a dice-bowl and throw the dice in turn , starting with baoqin
1	sister xiren sent me to fetch you , and for fear you wouldn ’ t come i made that up
1	i am looking for her too , was the answer
1	by the time the period of mourning was completed , chu hsien−fu 's eldest son was four ; and every day his wife taught the child to read the four books and paku essays , while the young man stood by giving advice
1	mrs zhou greeted her with a smile as she entered and said , madam xue asked me to bring you these flowers to wear
1	take the two of us for instance
1	jia she and the rest prostrated themselves on the ground
1	so how could you , young as you are and junior in status , possibly cope with these people ?
1	it ’ s not even enough for the two fixed meals , so how can it be stretched to cover extras ordered by you girls ?
1	when mrs zhou had taken them to the east room , xifeng called her back to hear what lady wang had said
1	they are small and far from the court ; it can not be very convenient for you to live here
1	they were given my brother by lord zhen , she faltered
1	but my patron charged me personally to get this man , and if i fail to produce him , mr wei will think me incompetent
1	today , however , he was pleased because baoyu looked as if he had really recovered
1	once the gates on both sides are locked , no one can come through
1	seeing her so adamant he reddened and said , in that case , aunt , i ’ ll look for something more acceptable to show my respect
1	if you ’ re so powerful , why not strangle me ?
1	by this time there was less terrorism , but the threat of it still remained
1	everyone loves roses , they ’ re so red and fragrant
1	they did not part until the third watch , when shiyin saw his friend off and returned to his room to sleep until the sun was high in the sky
1	the maids opened second sister ’ s door then
1	so tell me honestly what you ’ ve come here for
1	mr shen accepted the post
1	i have come to see you home , sixth master , he said
1	if you won ’ t agree to coming back with me , i ’ ll gladly move out to live with you here and wait on you like a younger sister
1	for over a fortnight , she wailed , you ’ ve monopolized my baochan and won ’ t let her come to my room , leaving me only qiuling to sleep with me
1	he himself sat at the lower end of the table , and the two prostitutes one on each side
1	after the younger sister came for news , as she was free that evening she went to enlist ha zheng ’ s help
1	no clank from their armour in the chilly night
1	we have only women at home
1	as soon as old pu reached home , all sorts of tradesmen came to demand payment , and he promised them they should have their money
1	now this merchant wants
1	i am in charge of a small company here , said ting−hsi after greeting the young gentlemen
1	this is no laughing matter , said li wan in desperation
1	you ’ ve got quite enough face , so stop nagging now
1	i tried not only weavers and the best tailors but embroiders and sewing-women too , she said
1	his knowledge of the first half of mencius was so sketchy that if suddenly give one sentence from it he would be unable to recite what followed , and the whole of the second half had slipped his mind
1	a white jade bed ,
1	after drinking the tea and finishing his meal , he hurried to the market−place and spent what remained of his travelling money on a pig 's trotter for his father to eat that evening
1	its body is square ,
1	so she replied very frankly , treating xifeng as a trusted friend
1	then he declares that this cow is his father and goes crying to the owner to ask to have it given him ; and when he gets it he sells it
1	aunt xue had the seat of honour , the others sitting down in a row on each side according to their ages and the seniority of their family branch
1	and he grumbled , 'if i would known all the trouble involved , i would have left it alone
1	as the nurse shook her head , from xifeng ’ s room came the sound of laughter and jia lian ’ s voice
1	third sister was in fact a born eccentric
1	when baoyu was born with jade in his mouth , i knew it was uncanny and
1	what will people think ?
1	in vales below a single gibbon calls
1	then , pointing to an old man who was better dressed than most : not to mention others , mr hsun alone sent you fifty catties of oil on new year 's eve
1	only at the end of the road does one think of turning on to the right track
1	if we ’ d drunk to our full capacity , it wouldn ’ t seem such fun looking back
1	let me write out the numbers , proposed baochai
1	that unicorn i got the other day
1	did you take me for a fool who wouldn ’ t know ?
1	of course i know that two men who pass under one examiner are called fellow−candidates
1	hearing this , chuang returned dr yu 's call
1	what a fine kite , remarked the other maids
1	if yung lo had not stirred up this dynasty , but left the government in the hands of that weakling chien wen , the empire would now be as weak as in the time of the six dynasties
1	this second beast was completely white , had a single horn , eyes like huge red lanterns , and held itself erect as it bounded forward
1	his office is not a lucrative one , they answered
1	there they found the other girls assembled , most of them in red capes of wool or satin
1	so that 's why it 's called happy red court , he thought
1	those used to eight maids can make do with six , those used to four with two
1	these three books have kept me so busy , i have had no time to teach
1	inhibited by xinger ’ s presence , third sister just lowered her head and went on cracking melon-seeds
1	then she made the red velvet pompon , the size of a walnut , bob up in front
1	my uncle has gone to nanking to sell silk , and i am going there now to accompany him back
1	the magistrate at once ordered them to be changed for a porcelain cup and ivory chopsticks ; but still fan chin would not eat
1	i can not leave you !
1	he wore a square cap and light gown of azure gauze , his beard was sparse and his complexion sallow
1	so after listening for a while outside the window , she entered the room with a smile
1	why play all these silly tricks ?
1	she can not forget her sorrows new and old ;
1	then second master felt safe enough to go boldly ahead
1	it 's best not to drink -- much better than landing in trouble through drinking like your cousin , so that when you take a wife she becomes a lonely grass widow like me , poor thing !
1	she burst out laughing
1	because the brewer 's family was not here , he had hired two big−footed country−women , and was carrying on with both of them
1	number cures mysterious diseases
1	she told yingchun , the mistress says siqi has grown up and her mother keeps coming to ask to have her back , so her ladyship ’ s giving her back to be married off
1	this is my cousin yu yu−ta , said tu
1	it 's your second uncle 's birthday he 's celebrating - did you know that ?
1	what 's so marvellous about running a little errand ?
1	by the tomb of flowers
1	tinghsi hired a donkey , and trotted along beside the chair
1	she told him then exactly what to say
1	if senior licentiate yen does not wish his son to be adopted , she may choose somebody else to adopt
1	since tsang was not a heavy drinker , by the afternoon he was sick and had to be helped home
1	what a great act of imperial kindness !
1	did you really put in a word for me ?
1	sit down , they urged
1	he does not use these chopsticks either , said mr chang
1	my cousin ’ s conversation is so illuminating , i could never tire of listening , he told her
1	as one and all said this , xifeng too accepted this interpretation
1	the trouble is that this examiner is very strict : we shall have to think out a new way
1	i suggest that , starting tomorrow , you ’ d better put aside all other business and concentrate on writing a few sheets every day to make up
1	presently tea was served , after which mr tsung left , while chi remained behind to chat
1	you ’ re so easy to scare , yet still you indulge in talking such nonsense , she teased
1	take it back at once to buy a few mouthfuls of food !
1	goes back to jinling
1	ah , such a thing only happens once in a thousand years , declared nanny zhao
1	asked the lady dowager
1	take , for example , the poems on wang zhaojun , all expressing different opinions
1	and four country fellows carried this lopsidedly along , without any retinue
1	surely you who understand me must sympathize with me ?
1	i can give you enough money for the journey
1	i have to go to the capital for audience with the emperor , so i will see you off to nanking first
1	excuse me , he blurted out
1	old as you are , you have no sense , she scolded
1	and his eye fell on a rectangular marble jardiniere in the alcove in which were arranged some single-petalled narcissi and rocks
1	i will send a maid to fetch it , daiyu promised
1	let us return to baoyu
1	he pleaded with her until she consented to wear it
1	her mind made up , she locked up her ramshackle cottage and asked the neighbours to keep an eye on it , after which she and her nephew took a boat to wuhu and found their way to sweet dew temple by floating bridge
1	daiyu tossed her head
1	one of the men asked , why isn ’ t brother liu here today ?
1	i don ’ t like putting you to so much trouble , objected jia zhen
1	whiskers mao saw the game was up , and had to come out
1	if they have any business they should tell you , madam
1	then here ’ s another passage for you to expound
1	now i have been sworn at all the same just for doing as i was told !
1	but what am ito say to the old lady ?
1	how can you leave it at that ?
1	the young man nodded , then raised his cup to drink
1	of titbits on the rocks
1	so now she had mentioned this request to fangguan , asking her to pass it on to baoyu
1	second master had two , but within half a year of her arrival she picked fault with them and sent them both packing
1	this done , he rushed back , seized his sister−in−law and showed her the way out , then carried his mother out too
1	having alighted in front of the main hall , he mounted the steps with a beaming smile and , facing south , announced :
1	xifeng agreed and went back to her apartments
1	as a result they ’ re worse than anyone else when it comes to making trouble , setting their mistresses against each other and covering up the faults of their favourites
1	you ’ re all wrong , declared baoyu , who had been chuckling to himself for a while
1	the judicial commissioner , of equal status , was the provincial judge and supervised the postal service
1	if you stand on your dignity , how dare i take liberties ?
1	i could hardly defy them could i ?
1	when lady wang rose to leave , she went out with her
1	they bowed to chuang shao−kuang and sat down
1	it was a maid picking flowers
1	when he saw her turn into palace pool , he wondered who she could be
1	baoyu told her , i am going now , cousin
1	i saw her coffin , it 's true , but who knows whether she was in it or not ?
1	let ’ s have something quieter
1	it was no other than jia yun
1	now they ’ ve sent to fetch you back , and the wedding will probably take place as soon as you get home
1	very good , said li wan
1	he heaved a long sigh , and turned his face to the wall
1	he ’ s nothing but a source of trouble
1	so it ’ s just as well she ’ s had it
1	after the meal , wine was served and dr chao proposed : we have a good gathering today : we must have some poems
1	baochai next read out the petition :
1	all i can do is eat pap , sleep , or amuse myself for a while with these grandchildren when i am bored
1	for what reason , may i ask ?
1	just then the gate−keeper came in to announce : dr
1	and when pure ginseng was prescribed this was beyond jia dairu ’ s means : he had to ask for help from the rong mansion
1	why should a man like that have all the luck ?
1	at last there was nothing for it but to adopt a son and find a child bride for him
1	no love is greater than that between the sexes , replied chi
1	the next day they requisitioned a large junk , and whiskers
1	his stupefied silence -- so unlike baoyu -- exasperated jia zheng , who had not to begin with been angry
1	baochai urged her to be of good comfort and called to the servants in the outer room , quickly go with master ke to deal with this business
1	it ’ s grown cold , daiyu told her
1	it ’ s all the fault of that upstart jia yucun the bastard deserves to starve to death !
1	raving been in the mansion all through baoyu 's illness , jia yun remembered most of the people of any importance there and knew that this was no other than xiren , who enjoyed a special status in happy red court
1	first i thought it was a cat chasing rats , but then i heard a sound like someone sighing
1	i may as well take some capital and travel around with zhang dehui for a year
1	more exasperated than ever baoyu cried , what are you talking about ?
1	very well , said lady wang on second thoughts
1	chuckled daiyu , tugging at baoqin ’ s sleeve
1	it 's not every day that you can see a head changed to water
1	then the same ceremony was repeated , chuang shao−kuang as second master of sacrifice , and different men bearing offerings
1	otherwise i would have heard
1	taste them and see , says hsiao
1	after a brief chat she urged him to go back and rest , and baoyu took her advice , being eager to question fangguan
1	when i was bought , it was to serve the old lady ; that ’ s why miss baochai gave me this name
1	the other scholars urged wang to join the feast , declaring that by bringing up such a virtuous daughter he had reflected glory on his clan
1	peeping through the lattice-work , he saw a girl crouching below the flowers and weeping all alone as she scratched the ground with a hairpin
1	it ’ s because aunt xue saw she ’ s not only pretty but really well-behaved , being even gentler and quieter than most young ladies , that she went to all the trouble of inviting guests to a feast to make her his concubine in proper style
1	if it ’ s not enough ask for some more
1	about how long can i take ?
1	mrs lin went off on this errand
1	suppose you cold-shoulder her but she befriends you ?
1	you ’ re right , agreed the lady dowager
1	raising his eyes , kuo saw an extraordinary creature squatting on the hillside in front
1	it will take me at least ten years to become a senior licentiate
1	then , uncertain whether this was real silver or not , he went to bed
1	so old , yet so hale and hearty !
1	if we ’ re sitting or lying about when he turns up , and we pay no attention to him , he never ticks us off
1	how can you let them have their own way ?
1	with his face fair as jade , his eyes bright as stars , he was truly a handsome figure
1	you don ’ t understand , she explained to the fairies
1	'since she immolated herself she ca not be treated as a bondmaid , he said
1	fancy you remembering so clearly , madam , the exact case and box it was in after all these years !
1	one expects a boy to be mischievous , but this extraordinary liking he has for maids has been preying on my mind
1	let me see it
1	just now sister sheyue brought us two plates of cakes
1	xifeng questions a page boy
1	baochai who had come up behind her chimed in , do make it up , both of you , for baoyu ’ s sake
1	we mustn ’ t send away the little buddhists and taoists , because they ’ ll be needed next time her highness comes , and it would be hard to get them together again if once they ’ d been dispersed
1	the older women intervened , enough of that , you two
1	if you don ’ t behave properly as a loyal servant of the state to be worthy of your masters ’ kindness , heaven and earth will surely condemn you
1	why not let the kitchen do it ?
1	she imagined his new wife would protect her and share her responsibilities , enabling her to lead a quieter life
1	then , too restless to stay with them he started fooling around outside , but still went on feeling disgruntled and frustrated
1	father sent me to fetch her
1	that 's too bad , he cried
1	we ’ d better go somewhere within easy distance so that it wouldn ’ t take long to come back
1	if we are afraid of mobilizing our forces , we should not feed so many idle men !
1	the old man was very pleased
1	she blushed but did not answer , simply putting the sweetmeats back into the hamper , which she then took away
1	i will go now and discuss this with her
1	i don ’ t usually feel there are too few of us , yet tonight i do , observed the old lady
1	the following year when the willows burst into leaf and the peach and apricot trees blossomed , hsiao rode out with mu nai to enjoy the spring
1	xifeng , as it so happened , needed some festival gifts and had been thinking of buying some spices and aromatic herbs
1	abject apologies , is it ?
1	the girl 's worry : her boudoir in the tower is blown down
1	kuang chao−jen dared not miss this opportunity
1	you shift the blame for not lending your things to us , to stop her complaining about you
1	presently it was reported that he was out paying a call
1	remembering what had been said the previous day , baoyu sent for his outdoor clothes and waited for them in the library
1	what does it matter between cousins ?
1	as they walked on they were greeted by xiangyun , pinger and xiangling , who had been picking balsam by some rocks and now left the garden with them
1	but how dared they tell her the truth ?
1	you can tell me when i come back
1	what should his punishment be ?
1	mr yu was wearing a square cap , an old sapphire−blue gown , and crimson slippers
1	besides , the prime minister has served so many times as chief examiner that he has innumerable members of the han lin academy as his pupils
1	we were chatting in cousin lin ’ s place in the garden , she answered
1	mine did not amount to much , daiyu observed
1	aunty , you used to be so fond of me , how is it that now you have forgotten me completely ?
1	whom were you going to propose ?
1	presently they all had a meal there and made merry with the old lady
1	congratulations on your return home , uncle , said hsiao
1	xifeng broke into a cold sweat
1	the fact is that baochai 's knowledge of her brother had led her to suspect that he was behind the visit of the prince 's chief steward , and xiren 's report confirmed her suspicion
1	still , there isn ’ t much she can do , she simply sticks to the old ways , not throwing her weight about like madam lian to show how smart she is
1	my name is chi
1	calling in the secretary , he bade him appropriate some of the salt tax to pay the merchant , accept tsin chueh 's offer to act as guarantor , and release licentiate yang immediately — there was no need to bring in a verdict
1	yuanyang left the side gate still blushing , in a flutter after this shock
1	you ’ ve made a mistake , they cried
1	still , this will not prove too serious
1	when we told the carters to drive on , some runners beat them up and made off with our two carts
1	as my daughter 's daughter you are dear to me ; but baoyu is closer to me even than you
1	that evening when mrs pao 's son−in−law kuei came back , she told him all she had heard , and asked him to make further inquiries
1	this was the form taken by the stupid stone from the foot of blue ridge peak in great waste mountain
1	in addition , jia zhen installed his own servant bao er and his wife there to wait on second sister after she moved in
1	the maids in the different lodges in the garden had heard of their arrival and summons to the palace , but did not know the real facts of the case
1	he immediately called for fresh tea and refreshments
1	if they court death in a fit of temper , is that necessary too ?
1	as she was busy during the festival she let things slide for a couple of days , but now she had come to inspect all the maids in the garden , not only to dismiss qingwen , but also because it had reached her ears that as baoyu was growing up , his maids who were hussies were teaching him bad ways
1	ting−hsi fell weeping to the ground , and ah−san had to help him up
1	even if you make her smash it , this is no job for you
1	only then did he remember that the green sash belonged to xiren and he should never have given it away
1	both those poems were original , not mere plagiarizing
1	he gazed abstractedly at the magnificent hall which he had certainly never seen in the garden , and halted to look up at the inscription enlightenment for the infatuated
1	by now jia she and jia zhen were also back and , meeting again , they described their experiences since parting
1	never mind , said madam you
1	and when this was eaten she told them , sit down and go on with your meal
1	as they filled their cups daiyu remarked to tanchun , you ’ re the apricot-blossom destined to have a noble husband
1	but what makes me angry is his lack of guts
1	an evening banquet is held on the feast
1	since when have you been so attentive ?
1	in that way he was just able to make ends meet
1	you can keep your end up with us , but what happens when you cross swords with daiyu ?
1	a salaried licentiate is a scholar , and all he has done is to use some money belonging to a salt merchant ; yet they want to deprive him of his rank and penalize him
1	there stood jia qiang , a taper in his hand
1	on his return to offer thanks , the prince spoke to him kindly again and suddenly remarked with a smile :
1	when false is taken for true , true becomes false ;
1	how long have you been a friend of brigade general miao ?
1	such a force would find expression in human dignity , in the upholding of ideals of justice and truth , in the love of life and creation
1	i agree , he replied
1	i know what to say when i am interrogated
1	occupied by these reflections he reached home , where ni er 's wife and daughter were waiting for him
1	have there been any poetry meetings ?
1	i will tell you why i sent for you , said jia zheng
1	i doubt if this merchant appreciates such seclusion , she thought
1	knowing the old lady ’ s partiality for lively shows and sweet , pappy food , baochai gave these as her own preferences , adding even more to the lady dowager ’ s pleasure
1	they did not suspect that there was anything behind this ; but when the prior opened the double door at the back and invited them to walk through , they came out upon a great plot of level ground , as high as any house , which had an excellent view on all sides
1	baoyu was doing his lessons when a wind sprang up , buffeting the window paper
1	he announced , tomorrow is the feast of winter gruel when all men on earth will be cooking their sweet gruel
1	what ’ s the row about ?
1	why did not you bring her a couple of red cornelian rings like those you sent over the other day ?
1	he went out at dawn to the east market to fetch pigs , and he ca not have come back yet
1	but as we ca not leave the coffin we entrusted them to you
1	but master bao had better wait till the charcoal is red before going there
1	i ’ m always hearing how good your plasters are , remarked baoyu
1	well , i do not blame you , she said
1	only faint moonlight falls on the lonely blind
1	that casing 's made of pigs ' guts !
1	you mustn ’ t take nanny li so seriously
1	chuang went out to meet him in civilian dress , and tea was served
1	suddenly his way was barred by a sword and he was ordered to halt
1	last time he was here he betrothed her to academician mei ’ s son ; but the year after that he died
1	duke ping of lu wanted to meet mencius , but chang tsang dissuaded him
1	he gave tsang chi a sheep and wine , and told him to go and rest
1	the master trusts you , mr li , said the others
1	since you ’ re unwilling , said pinger , i ’ ll tell you an easy way to fob him off
1	yuanyang continued , on the right wouldouble aces ' are found
1	don ’ t risk your little life like this , child !
1	they made yuanyang drink a cup and toss to see who should start ,
1	mr chi lent the young couple a room , and at the end of the honeymoon yu went back to his post
1	but now that there are two of you , next time you ’ re beaten for raising a rumpus you can run away to nanjing to find your double
1	because that kind of talk would get him nowhere : nobody would give him an official position
1	it was clear to her that he must have heard some gossip in the jia mansions which led him to believe her a shameless wanton , not fit to be his wife
1	xiren hastily picked up the pieces
1	this order given , jia zheng dismissed the stewards
1	tanchun put in , and what about the lady of the alpinia ?
1	but it would be worth dying , even with nothing to show for my life , provided i would won their hearts
1	there is really no danger , madam , i give you my word
1	as roaming wild the damsel fair i sought
1	he , too , wanted to bare his heart to her to console her , yet he feared this might offend her and make her illness worse
1	wang hui fell to , without inviting chou chin to join him ; and when wang hui had finished , the monk sent up the teacher 's rice with one dish of cabbage and a jug of hot water
1	pin−niang sprang up and opened a drawer from which she took a packet of powdered sandalwood and poured it into the basin
1	after new year i shall tell your second uncle lian to dismiss you
1	whenever the kitty is full , you can pocket the cash and let them start again
1	then she kowtowed , pleading , your honour , avenge me !
1	i should have held my tongue
1	today , as he has no time to look into this scandal , he ’ s told me to report it to you , madam , to do as you think fit
1	the censors have investigated the business by the coast and discovered a deficit during your elder uncle 's term of office
1	set your mind at rest , sir , replied hsiao with a smile
1	today he was looking forward to a visit from her , when the arrival of a xue family servant convinced him that here was another gift for him
1	one day a letter arrived from xue pan
1	bring huang chiu here and we will talk it over
1	you should let me pay my respects
1	i ’ m too tired to tell you
1	what more do you want me to say , except that you ’ re straight and i was wrong ?
1	if we start it again now in spring when everything burgeons , it ’ s bound to come to life
1	i ’ m not a ghost , snapped xifeng
1	yet autumn moon and spring flowers are soon abandoned ,
1	baoyu , a whole lot of things happened to make it slip my mind
1	for some time now he 's been asking me to find him a good wife , but i could not think of anyone suitable except yourself
1	i raised troops in chiangnan and was known as the prince of chuyang ; but now , because i hold nanking , i am called the prince of wu
1	i ’ d better keep out of his way
1	has he gone himself ?
1	recently , they say , it 's gone from bad to worse and her in-laws wo not let her come home
1	swallowing her anger , she started out with her daughter
1	tell me who ’ s dared to offend you
1	baochai , not knowing the reason , thought he was scoffing at her to show disapproval and therefore paid no attention
1	it would be all right in the old lady 's place , but all sorts of people go to her ladyship 's rooms
1	why xueyan and not zijuan ?
1	they left after calling zijuan to attend to her young mistress
1	i shall use three dominoes , announced yuanyang
1	that ’ s just it , she replied
1	since she hasn ’ t invited us this time , only
1	and you must present an account at the end of the year
1	a white silk belt from the heavenly loom is broken
1	i imagine you ’ ll be needing other things too , so why not go on another couple of ii to river goddess convent ?
1	these had come as tribute from different parts of the country , and although not very large they were most ingeniously made in different colours , ornamented with scenes from stories and fitted with all kinds of fire-crackers
1	may i know your honourable name and place of origin , so that i can tell them who you are ?
1	not one of your relatives will call on him
1	in future you will be responsible for this whole household
1	she wrapped up the cape and told an old serving-woman to take it out
1	once seated inside , they questioned him and xiren had to prompt him each time with an answer
1	do you know what those wafers were made of ?
1	jia xing , jia zhi and some others had ranged themselves in due order all the way from the inner ceremonial gate to the terrace by the verandah of the main hall , where stood jia jing and jia she outside the palisade , while the ladies stood inside
1	i shall brazen it out somehow in my shameless way
1	what do you think of this , madam ?
1	one flute played in the distance will be enough
1	baoyu insisted , it does not matter , if only you are clear-headed
1	so her dreams of future honour and splendour had gone up in smoke !
1	please remain seated , sir , while i clear up my things
1	they want you to go home to send off the heralds
1	feng is a champion of justice , he said
1	when over a month had passed , the lou brothers could not help feeling somewhat astonished
1	apart from incense and candles , a few catties of oil every day for the big lamp
1	each year by strict economy yoo saved a few more taels , then summoned brokers to ask the price of a plot of land or a house
1	i am not saying this as a compliment to aunt xue , but the truth is that none of our four girls can stand comparison with baochai
1	so that ’ s who she is !
1	xiangling had no choice but to carry her bedding over
1	stupidity and ignorance are characteristic of these men set on official careers
1	it was a hot day and the brothers began to be worried
1	do , do arrange it !
1	so you have such a treat without telling me !
1	and who knows what will have become of our family by the time he grows up ?
1	all you can do is to disparage other people
1	go and rest now , there 's a good boy !
1	she means well anyway , remarked sheyue as she started to lay the table
1	it isn ’ t easy for her
1	it 's bad enough your family cooping us up here to learn that old trash , she retorted
1	she may very well come here
1	though she did not hear everything , she caught the main gist and felt as if plunged into a raging sea
1	where did you see it ?
1	i ’ ll wait for you here
1	how could i know ?
1	no house but has its windows opened wide
1	all the ladies of the house called daily to ask after the old lady 's illness
1	then he overheard several passers-by in the street saying that an imperial concubine had died , and the emperor had suspended court for three days
1	and as xiren now turned her back on him and went in , he had to leave dejectedly with chuyao
1	i heard a customer call for wine , and soon after that someone cried , confound it !
1	no , you must go to my home
1	i must drink a big cup as a forfeit for forgetting
1	as her father just said , she 's a lady now
1	then she asked baoyu where he had come from
1	you come over so seldom , protested madam you , i do hope you ’ ll stay a bit longer
1	he unwound his puttees , and fastened himself to the tree
1	ma saw that he was wearing a worn cap and thin , threadbare gown
1	afterwards , however , although he still longed for xifeng , he steered clear of the rong mansion
1	if your ladyship tries to force me , i ’ ll kill myself rather than marry
1	besides i hope you won ’ t mind my saying this you country folk aren ’ t so well off , and a name given by someone poor like you should act as a counterbalance
1	i will tell the mistress you have reached the age to be sent home
1	hsiao and his friends reeled back to their lodgings as if in a dream
1	it ’ s only right to worry about one ’ s health , replied baochai
1	fan usually stands in awe of , said the herald
1	in that case , may i call to tell her my story ?
1	daiyu had been annoyed at first by baoyu ’ s immoderate language
1	it 's too late today , wu shu , said tu
1	turning round she saw xichun standing there and asked , why are you so thin , fourth sister ?
1	jia qiang was as intelligent as he was handsome , but he attended the school only as a blind for his visits to cock-fights , dog-races and brothels
1	our fortune−telling is nothing but a trick , sir , said ting
1	but since jia zhen had other ends in view , alleging the need to relax after their exertions he soon started arranging card games in the evenings and they laid wagers while drinking
1	inside , they heard the strings being returned
1	by this time , tsai−ping had married and shuang−hung was the only maid left to accompany the bride
1	her parents are dead now and she only has two old nurses and one maid to look after her
1	give me your programme , quick !
1	as for passing the provincial or metropolitan examinations , since i have never passed myself i may not be the best teacher
1	what is this gentleman 's name ?
1	let 's both go to the library now
1	that is why i have called today
1	yes , lord zhen is too short-sighted , said pinger
1	she told caiyun , fetch those bottles of juice which were brought the other day
1	kuang chao−jen was aghast
1	instead of answering , he merely took the bowl from her , putting it down again after one sip
1	for all we know , she may have been an immortal
1	chih heng−shan called upon the master of sacrifice , dr yu , and the second master , chuang shao−kuang
1	they quickly told her the rhymes
1	niu pu dared not go in , but the old monk caught sight of him
1	they hunted around for hours , even turning out cases and crates — but all in vain
1	as xiangling protested her innocence aunt xue came running over to stop her son
1	then you two must help the two nuns to pick some buddhist beans for me
1	i ’ m just telling you so that you ’ ll be on your guard
1	if you would told me earlier , this little business would not have taken so long
1	i treat you so well that you have lost all sense of respect
1	i will keep an eye on everything here for you , and see that your mother is all right
1	never mind , said baoyu
1	if he understood the meaning of 'careful study , he would be a high official !
1	his jaw dropped and he gaped in consternation
1	when they agreed to this arrangement , he sent word to lady xing and reported the proposal to lady wang
1	he has another good subject for poetry
1	please read the decree , your highness , then we can start the search
1	when she emerged the wine had gone to her head , and squatting so long had left the old creature too dizzy to remember the way she had come
1	just think , madam , the reason why buddhist sacrifices have been made throughout the centuries is because they have proved efficacious in safeguarding the country and enriching the people -- that 's why men believe in them
1	tell her to send for some more water to wash her hair
1	in that case , why are some people so red in the face ?
1	you might send her a couple of dishes
1	however , his grandmother was afraid that he might get over-heated there or catch cold , and that the place might upset him ; for though daiyu 's coffin had been deposited in a nunnery outside town , the sight of bamboo lodge might bring back his earlier grief for its dead mistress
1	if a gentleman like you , uncle , wants her as a secondary wife , i guarantee both her mother and my father will be willing
1	but let them clap their hands and jeer by the roadside
1	we have just come back after giving an allnight performance
1	you ’ ll make yourself ill if you sleep on this damp bench
1	we would have come before this to pay our respects to the mistress and to you , miss , but we have been very busy on the farm
1	you can have your say about it some other time
1	i came first in the first rank again
1	yet you were in such a hurry to get away
1	and this she held up a bundle of tibetan incense is for you to light while copying
1	together : the cherries ripen nine times in all
1	i have not seen you for a long time !
1	on the morning of the fourth day baoyu opened his eyes
1	xifeng spat in disgust
1	once through the archway they came to a palace gate , on its lintel the inscnption fortune for the good , calamity for the licentious
1	since my father died early i was brought up by my grandfather and occupied with family business : i had no time to study for the civil service
1	madam you and the others all came to meet them
1	she would make fun of me if she saw
1	before he could give this order , jia lian came in and paid his respects
1	your trouble is that your father gave you such a soft time of it when you were young that you ’ re a bad manager
1	tanchun , having decided earlier on that she could not compete , had been writing down their lines
1	and even senior licentiate yen when he comes back will have nothing to say
1	jia lian outside had also intimidated the son so that he was only too willing to go to the board of punishments to sign a statement that no inquest was needed as the cause of death was clear and to promise not to bring any suit later on
1	fragrant herbs and aromatic pine and cedar-wood were burning in the brazier
1	we ’ ll redeem it without fail
1	i was just whiling away the time to stop you from felling sleepy
1	jia zhen watched till the distribution of goods was finished , then returned to his rooms to dine with his wife , and the night passed without further incident
1	it pleaded poverty , and the silver sent was a paltry fifty taels
1	holding it he thought , i have a faint recollection of this ; it 's too bad that i ca not remember clearly
1	she died so long ago , what brought her here ?
1	whiskers thanked him and took the silver
1	by now mingyan had grabbed hold of un rong
1	inquired the old lady
1	one day prefect hsiang sat down with pao wen−ching in the library
1	she ’ s got a cape too , yet she ’ s dressed herself up like a saucy little tartar
1	aloud , he said with a sigh , if i ’ d known that you ’ d be going , i shouldn ’ t have taken you on in the first place
1	he clung like a limpet to the lady dowager , too terrified to leave her
1	before playing one must dress fittingly in a loose cape or long robe like the men of old , to be worthy of this instrument of the sage ’ s
1	what were you discussing ?
1	whether they call or whether they don ’ t , it ’ s nothing to do with you
1	baoqin told her maids to fly a big red bat kite
1	and liu ’ s neighbours when questioned said he had never come back
1	how could i get someone to pummel my back each time ?
1	his page mingyan tried to think of some way to distract him and decided that there was only one thing that might appeal to him as a novelty
1	the lady dowager then reiterated that baoqin , with the plum-blossom in the snow , had looked prettier than a picture
1	just now mr tu was kind enough to call and invite me to your house ; and now you are so good to me , madam , i feel i am among old friends
1	first cursed that i angelica should wear ,
1	her knots of clove and her hibiscus belt
1	don ’ t talk like that , friend
1	if i do , i ’ ll have asked for leave all for nothing
1	now what ’ s to be done ?
1	see , when spring draws to a close and flowers fall ,
1	when they had settled their luggage they went to bed
1	xiren hastily assented and withdrew
1	i have been waiting outside for sorne time but could not find a soul , and i dared not burst in i was frantic !
1	you ’ d prefer to be on your own , free to do as you please
1	much of wu ching−tzu 's humour is indirect : he excels in innuendoes
1	by this time sixty or seventy people had gathered round to watch ; and out of this crowd stepped a man with big eyes and a few brown hairs on his chin , wearing a military cap and black silk jacket
1	in the old days , at every festival the nuns would send her presents and the flower−girls would give her little trinkets , while those blind girls who often came to play the three−stringed lyre would not budge from the door
1	lady wang knew that this presented no difficulty for the xue family , and therefore agreed
1	i had to leave in too much of a hurry to wait for the double ninth festival , he explained
1	since you are a cheat yourself , why get so upset ?
1	the more the merrier
1	the breeze that softly fans the air is chill
1	you trouble-maker , she snapped back , gnashing her teeth , this is all your doing
1	tell me , friend , said ma , do you want to go on studying or to go back to see your father ?
1	were invitations sent out that you are here in force ?
1	this room of mine is probably fit for a god , rejoined keqing with a smile
1	you didn ’ t buy me
1	nonsense , her husband retorted
1	and when i asked how she felt , not a word did she say — simply cried
1	he 's outside the mundane world now and would not have anything to do with us , yucun assured her
1	at this thought , he felt a pang and could not hold back his tears ; and as they were mourning the lady dowager he did not restrain himself but sobbed aloud
1	if that 's so , get me a fan to tear up
1	don ’ t just eat , they scolded
1	they reached the courtyard as the three servants were squabbling
1	the concubine then called in a trusted old servant to whom she whispered certain instructions
1	how old is your nephew ?
1	i ’ d rather die than go south
1	the servants brought in four cold dishes and two sets of bowls and chopsticks and moved a table out for the meal
1	brother , said ni ting−chu , i was in peking when you were adopted by the pao family , so i knew nothing whatever about it
1	twice a month is enough
1	all will be well , but you must take precautions
1	if you ’ re not satisfied , you can complain to mrs lin and ask her to speak to master bao about it
1	when he heard bao er scrapping with zhou rui he joined in
1	overwhelmed with shame as i am , i would like to make over to the state my ancestral estate , emoluments and savings
1	qingwen happened to be unwell that day and had just got up from a nap , feeling out of sorts
1	presently she made her drink some vinegar soup too , after which xiangyun felt better
1	the lady dowager had sent to invite all the members of the elan
1	but at xifeng 's age i outshone her
1	cold is the green-sleeved girl as she writes a poem ,
1	since changan was only a hundred li away , within two days the matter was settled
1	but with the flowing water her beauty has gone ;
1	where shall i wear them if my head is shaved ?
1	i will after all the rest of you are gone , retorted qingwen
1	better , in fact , than some chinese could write
1	don ’ t worry about that , replied aunt xue
1	i shall have more free time here , remarked xiangling
1	regarding this company of yours , i can tell you somebody who can help
1	the bright moonlight , coloured lanterns , scents and incense evoked an ethereal splendour defying description
1	what is his rank really ?
1	if anything should happen to the old lady your marriage might be delayed , or else not turn out in the way you hoped
1	qin zhong plucked at baoyu ’ s sleeve and whispered , isn ’ t she fun ?
1	these words made baoyu laugh in spite of himself
1	so jia zhen responded with a smile , what sort of talk is this among friends ?
1	today he couldn ’ t go to school , and we ’ re sending for a doctor to prescribe medicine
1	more recent examples are ni zan , tang yin and zhu yunming
1	but the maids had gone back to bed after jia lian went out , not expecting him home so quickly , and had therefore not prepared tea ; so what pinger brought him was not freshly brewed
1	didn ’ t you go too , master bao ?
1	xiren , hearing this , covered her face and doubled up in a fit of giggles
1	so let me make a suggestion
1	the last of the local gentry , tang erh , held a notebook in which he was writing down a record
1	as soon as mother 's ready we are going to the garden
1	cried the old woman
1	a terrible disaster befalls miaoyu
1	just take it , second brother
1	here the villagers would come to discuss public business
1	at sight of yuanyang seated on the kang he halted
1	wouldn ’ t that be more effective than stealing outright ?
1	yes , that ’ s right , chuckled the lady dowager , now kneel to your mother and ask her not to feel hurt , but to forgive me for your sake on account of my old age
1	under the red flag squat the spirits of those the candidate has helped , under the black flag the spirits of those he has wronged
1	sure enough , at the fifth watch , the miao chieftain led forth a force armed with swords and spears from straight eye cave to slip silently over stone pillar bridge
1	five hundred strings of newly minted cash were also given as largesse to the cooks , actresses and jugglers
1	the four sedan-chairs were borne in behind some young eunuchs , while the gentlemen followed on foot
1	he set six chairs facing each other , and told his wife to light a charcoal brazier and boil a kettle of tea
1	do take her away quickly
1	and even though you were robbed it does not matter
1	in unison they quoted one of the sayings of confucius , and warned her , you must conform to etiquette
1	the desk was bare except for a rough crackleware vase with some chrysanthemums in it , two sets of books and a tea-service
1	ladyships because you have not pulled together , making our family look ridiculous
1	i had better made myself clear in the hope that then we may become close friends
1	but the two maids in ling 's house had grown jealous
1	your zijuan is looking for you too
1	ascribing their visit to the news that the jia family was no longer in trouble , she paid her respects to aunt li and to the old lady , said a few words to her mother , then greeted the li sisters
1	jia she came over at this point to ask jia zheng if he would be going the next day
1	a physician of the tsin dynasty , whose books are medical classics
1	with that , two of the older men led baoyu out
1	although as members of the prime minister 's house they could never get into serious trouble , the presence of a head dripping with blood on the steps of their inner chamber caused them a little uneasiness
1	the lady dowager urged her to come again and told yuanyang :
1	why , i ’ ve been like the frog at the bottom of a well , imagining that our girls here were unmatched ; but now , without searching far afield , here on this very spot i see others who surpass them
1	abbess pen stepped forward and greeted him
1	and overjoyed by this , she would not even hear of baoqin staying in the garden the girl was to sleep with her
1	this was hsia , the new village head for hsueh market
1	only that a number of brigands captured at the coast have been tried , and during their interrogation they revealed the whereabouts of many more , some of them lying low here in town and looking out for a chance to break into more houses
1	'all scholars must have self−respect , said dr yu
1	four other pages , yingchuan , saohua , tiaoyun and banhe , were up on the roof robbing a bird 's nest
1	soon the first seven days passed , and wang teh and wang jen returned from the provincial examination and came to mourn
1	now daiyu had discovered xiangyun 's whereabouts and knew that baoyu had hurried back , no doubt to talk about the gold unicorns
1	i wouldn ’ t dare tell a lie , sir , he exclaimed
1	if she were going to entertain visitors , she wouldn ’ t bother to set out an incense-burner first ; if she were going to burn incense , she ’ s not in the habit of scenting her clothes with it or having anything in the room except fresh flowers and fruit
1	and while in office he showed no respect for his superiors but simply tried to please the people , talking nonsense about 'fostering filial piety and brotherly love , and encouraging agriculture
1	then wagging finger at them all she scolded , you ’ ve really gone too far
1	zijuan felt constrained to ask xueyan , was it really true what you told me earlier on ?
1	on her way back with lady wang , they heard weeping in several apartments
1	then two of the family ’ s bailiffs came in and paid their respects
1	we don ’ t mean to notify relatives and friends because , as you ’ ve said , all pan ’ s friends are a bad lot and our only relatives are the ha and wang families
1	they paid for the tea , and went to a big eating−house on three mountains street
1	countered the old lady , laughing
1	on the twenty-eighth they would invite the prince consorts , princes , princesses and dukes of the imperial house together with their ladies ; on the twenty-ninth , ministers , military governors and their titled wives ; on the thirtieth , other officials with their titled wives , and relatives close and distant with their wives
1	your conduct and learning are unparalleled ; and your son in particular is a boy of extraordinary promise—you must bring him up to be an honest man
1	when swans fly off , crickets chirp , does your heart ache ?
1	what are you doing here ?
1	she went without supper that evening
1	i delivered the silver to the third mr tsang , announced the steward
1	someone behind them laughed
1	of course you will get what you need for the jobs you are given
1	the true root is she of the family ’ s destruction
1	to know whether she lived or died , read the next chapter
1	but water the whole world over in the last analysis comes from the same source
1	unfortunately she died and my son−in−law left home to do business ; but they had a little girl whom i have brought up
1	zijuan hastily got up and roused xueyan to help daiyu with her toilet
1	your ’ re the one trying to drag us into this
1	we ca not just arrange this between the two of us
1	he took baoyu attentively by the hand
1	if some future scholar should come across them and publish them for me , my ghost will rest content !
1	this will be a great act of mercy , and my whole family will for ever remember your ineffable goodness
1	let him be , said jia zheng
1	never mind whether it 's true or not
1	xifeng chuckled , it ’ s a case of talk of the devil
1	this is the end of my career as a licentiate
1	so yuanyang and the others kept quiet
1	though you had a short stay on earth , so deep was my feeling for you that i took careful thought and made detailed inquiries
1	if i had , i ’ d change it quickly and things would be all right for the time being
1	and his father , without telling him , had accepted ten taels of silver from old mrs you for cancelling the engagement
1	now i heard the master quote a classical tag i did not understand it something like 'in mourning , grief counts for more than appearances
1	they veil my virtue and the evil praise
1	how could he keep a girl so staunch and bold ?
1	if these girls think it wrong or there ’ s something i ’ ve omitted , then they can let me know
1	if i should push myself forward , they ’ d all start cursing me
1	i am afraid mr chuan may wonder at our presumption , said lou chan
1	something nice for me ?
1	just then the feast was spread
1	but she was not in the group
1	his mouth watering , he walked into a noodle shop to have a bowl of noodles for sixteen coppers ; then , still hungry , he went to the tea−shop next door and ordered a bowl of tea and two coppers ' worth of dried bamboo shoots which he munched with relish
1	of course , he could not know this , said chou chi−fu
1	and as he ’ s seen second aunt , who ’ s already related to our family , marrying her would be better than getting some girl from a family about which we know nothing
1	by emerald pavilion hangs a mirror of jade ,
1	those shameless slaves must have egged her on again to do this , using her because she ’ s a fool to get their own back
1	at sight of qin zhong , baoyu had felt quite eclipsed
1	once again , the prior could not stop them
1	i ’ d just taken miss xiangyun some tea when she suddenly disappeared
1	as he was turning back to the hall he found zhang the taoist standing beside him
1	he grimaced then hastily covered his mouth
1	but they ’ re carrying on worse and worse
1	as he finished his toilet sheyue said , it ’ s cloudy again and looks like snow , you ’ d better wear something woollen
1	he invited mr wei into the library with the southern exposure
1	getting slowly out of bed he recalled wuer 's remark during the night that both baochai and xiren were as pretty as goddesses
1	as for relatives and friends who came in person to invite the jias to a feast or to enjoy a feast given by them , she declined to meet all , making lady wang , lady xing and xifeng entertain the callers for her
1	he made his wife and mrs yao sit down to a meal with miss shen , then went to the room overlooking the river to find a volume of his own poetry
1	it will take the masons three months
1	i ’ m on my way there too
1	she then instructed zhou rui and lai wang , don ’ t take the presents through the main gate but by that old side-gate in the garden
1	glaring , he threatened to have him beaten and tortured
1	you know the ancient saying , put in baoyu
1	you will feel better once you are out
1	i saw it with my own eyes
1	xiren seeing this went out to brew him some tea
1	at the dead of night when few people are about , thieves may hide themselves there and debauchees and bandits can easily be smuggled in , and then anything could happen !
1	he smiled and walked in , asking , what are you doing , cousin ?
1	you wo not let me go , yet pin this thing on me for no reason at all
1	when the lady dowager had been ensconced here , more furs were spread on both sides and the few other ladies of her generation were invited to sit down
1	you may leave tomorrow
1	the examiner will soon be here , and my son wants to take the examination ; but i am afraid the college authorities will say i am an outsider
1	haven ’ t i enough to put up with , without dragging them in as well ?
1	and the day after that chang chun−min gave a feast in tu 's house , to which tsang and ting−hsi were also invited
1	the cooks and waiters had arrived in good time , and so had the actors , with their chest of costumes and stage properties
1	besides , how could i bring that up when it was our old ancestress aunty came to see ?
1	no more , said mr ni
1	this is how it came by its name as the mother of pearls
1	baoyu had been resting at home that day , wearing a fur-lined gown , when he noticed that the crab-apples had blossomed and went out to look atthem , sighing with admiration
1	then this craze might die out by degrees
1	he had a fight with bao er , and you saw him yourself , sir
1	you have been speaking of writing essays
1	nobody will ever come to fetch her
1	but you must want something of me , coming at this time
1	tanchun showed these items to li wan
1	they , too , left in order of precedence , and by about two o ’ clock all had gone except a few close relatives who would remain for the three day ’ s requiems for the dead
1	baoyu could not resist filling his cup with wine , which he tossed straight off
1	i would better pay the forfeit
1	as the actor stepped forward to put in a word , the surgeon rounded on him
1	and jia rui , afraid of being incriminated if this went any further , had to pocket his grievance and ask qin zhong and baoyu to forget it
1	'when the fragrance of flowers assails men we know the day is warm '
1	just amuse yourself with them here , but whatever happens don ’ t go to sleep and catch a chill , or the blame will fall on me again
1	and secondly , treat the servants here as you would your own , don ’ t be afraid they may resent it
1	there ’ s nothing difficult about this case , but out of deference to them it was never settled by your predecessor
1	i just wanted to have a try
1	seeing that he was obviously feeling better today , she deliberately ignored him
1	your father can barely support himself : he ca not feed you as well
1	cried granny liu , taking the bowl
1	a foolish scholar offers poems to a courtesan when pin−niang slept with chen mu−nan , she dreamed that he went to hangchow to take up his prefectship , then woke with a start to find the windows bright
1	she likes the writings of zhuang zi , from which she took that term the odd person
1	why were you away so long ?
1	then he said , ' i could have bought some pearls , but pearls for this medicine must have been worn on the head
1	i therefore felt my wisest course would be to ask for leave and return to see to some family affairs
1	their name is wang
1	it will spoil the fun if you go
1	he then looked into their land rents in the east province , which of late amounted to less than half the rent delivered to their ancestors , whereas the family expenses had increased tenfold
1	fan , and when i showed it to people they said he had written three characters wrongly ; it was disgraceful
1	who asked for your opinion ?
1	his mother stopped weeping to retort , is this ajoking matter ?
1	of course the young ladies should be provided with cosmetics every month , and they ’ re bought by the stewards in charge , then delivered by the matrons to us in the different apartments to be kept ready for when the young ladies need them
1	and he 's let them get away with such goings-on
1	presently a servant came to announce that other guests had arrived , and mr hu went out
1	can you tell me where it comes from ?
1	we can only make up the deficit by drawing silver from our clan funds down south and by selling our houses there
1	fetch the girls , her grandmother said
1	he does not want anything to eat , replied daiyu
1	you ca not do this , mrs pao !
1	when the yu brothers reached the temple , the four scholars greeted each other
1	after a little polite conversation the priest produced a book of poems , and kuo tieh−pi presented tu with two seals
1	they all approved this idea
1	baochai ’ s absence puzzled him too , and he remained lost in thought till daiyu ’ s arrival cheered him up and stopped him thinking about her
1	in that case , i ’ ll wait for you on the bridge outside the north gate
1	i had to harden my heart to tell the matrons to tie xiangling up and leave her in baochan 's charge
1	they want us to get her a doctor
1	as he walked out of the kitchen , the girls stepped forward
1	soon mrs wu came back with the old accounts
1	later on she married wang san−pang , who was waiting to be appointed to the post of assistant magistrate
1	this daughter of mine has never shown me any respect in this household
1	the villagers put down their chopsticks to listen , while he recited : foolish scholar fasted so long , whiskers covered his cheeks ; neglecting to study the classics , he left pen and paper aside
1	then jia zheng was forced to withdraw
1	what 's come over you ?
1	invoking buddha again , granny liu remarked : everyone says 'the great live in great houses
1	sheyue and qiuwen agreed and went off separately to make inquiries ; but nobody had seen the jade , and they were all alarmed
1	how can he say such a thing ?
1	~ighness , while i supervise the search before coming back for your instructions
1	this was covered by a painting in ink , not of any figures of landscape but of black clouds and heavy mist
1	it must sound ridiculous to you over there
1	it was not that to which my heart aspired
1	after wuer had poured out her thanks pinger took them to
1	when we have no visitors we should joke and chat , so long as the young people do not break the main rules of propriety
1	again he exclaimed in surprise , so yuanyang , xiren and pinger aren ’ t the only fine girls !
1	that evening they played the finger−game and drank till midnight , when all the two hundred coins were spent
1	you shall each have a string of cash , he promised them
1	vanished from heaven and the world of men , the bamboo frame bids us beware !
1	i shall be staying here for some time ; so i will wait for him to come back
1	this is quite clean , do use it
1	this is retribution for your sins
1	the scholar stood up to bow to him again
1	what do you mean ?
1	one tael , eighty cents
1	she chased after chunyan then to beat her again
1	next she scraped away the singed edges with a knife , sewed two threads across at right angles to each other , stitched in the outline in cross-stitch , and then darned the hole to reproduce the original pattern
1	our new management of the garden shouldn ’ t go through their hands at all
1	xiangling gushed , i simply love those lines by lu you :
1	tell mr hu to bring the money at once
1	and xiangyun , being young and straightforward , picked it up to have a look
1	this caretaker is new here and does not know our ways
1	on a board above the main gate was written in large characters : ningguo mansion built at imperial command
1	i am not saying you did
1	you know all about it , replied xiangyun with a smile
1	baoyu often made time to visit her after school ; but although she had so much she longed to tell him , now that they were no longer children she could hardly tease him playfully as before or express her pent-up feelings
1	construing xifeng 's silence as consent , pinger sat on the kang beside her and pummelled her gently
1	it had a small gong in its hand , which it now struck twice
1	baoyu cut in with a disarming smile , i did not know that sheath was your work
1	daiyu had been delighted to hear him make fun of baochai
1	open-eyed , she has to leave everything behind
1	then the four girls went off
1	when baoyu saw that he was indeed looking at himself in the big mirror , he also smiled
1	this was too much to bear !
1	the lady dowager glanced up again at the inscription on the board above her head , then turned to aunt xue
1	whose could that good-luck kite be ?
1	he intends to pass you
1	at an altar erected in the heavenly fragrance pavilion , ninety-nine taoists of the perfect truth sect should pray for forty-nine days for absolution
1	in the case senior licentiate yen found two brand−new sets of silk clothes , and in the package two hundred taels of silver
1	go and see what miss lin is doing , he said
1	in the same way , wine is absolutely forbidden
1	he called over his shoulder , smiling
1	this time , the rest of us should keep out of it and let just the three of them write
1	he was starting to leave when xifeng called him back , saying that she had something else to tell him
1	it makes you sad to speak of old times , said kai
1	she asked her grandmother
1	i just implore you to save me !
1	we would better consult chang yun−feng
1	see , when spring draws to a close and flowers fall ,
1	jia rong hurried back to the temple to report to his father that all was ready at home ; and that same night they assigned the various tasks and prepared all the pennons , poles and other essential paraphernalia
1	xifeng opened her eyes and felt a pang of distress
1	the clerk was terrified , not knowing the reason for this
1	they are sure to be doing themselves well !
1	well , it 's lucky no bones are broken
1	besides , it ’ s entirely up tp you to save me from getting a bad name
1	the new judicial commissioner has arrived
1	what do the rest of you think ?
1	i received lian 's letter about the elder master 's illness , but do not know if there is more definite news
1	for when your father lies ill in bed with nothing to eat and hears you declaiming compositions , no doubt about it but his heart will rejoice , his sadness will disappear and his pain will pass away
1	he bounded out laughingly then from behind the rockery
1	the day after that , the second mr peng 's daughter will be ten , and i must call to wish her a long life
1	under pressure from all sides , jin rong bowed to qin zhong
1	quite apart from your losing something , she ’ s gone too far , forgetting her place like that
1	next , xifeng was ordered to take her pick
1	wait till he arrives , and you can talk to him
1	all flowers must bloom , what makes you bloom so late ?
1	why should you be afraid qiang isn ’ t up to it ?
1	through withered leaves turned roan
1	it was dark by now , so lanterns were lit and the four attendants gathered at the stern to prepare dishes and heat wine ; and when all was ready they took the food to the cabin and lit a red candle
1	the second grade comprised sixty to seventy men
1	the next day her chest felt constricted ; however , she would not let yuanyang report this to jia zheng
1	another bowl was poured
1	after that we must go and see their ladyships and call the whole clan together to discuss this
1	but that day she told them to give me a few strings of cash , saying i was a 'poor , delicate little thing
1	where has he gone ?
1	you ’ ll still be in their clutches , and they ’ ll be able to fleece you
1	you can never tell
1	all of them gathered round to read the riddle :
1	we will see about that , was the reply
1	he left word that your ladyships need not worry
1	they crushed these willows and blooms—alack the day !
1	how can i put a thing like this down in writing ?
1	by this time baoyu ’ s hundred days ’ confinement was up and he was allowed out of doors
1	startled , they jumped to their feet to see who was there
1	daiyu had been listening intently , but now , at the mention of her own name , she spat in disgust and grabbed hold of baochai
1	emboldened by her previous experience of superintending qin keqing 's funeral , she was confident that here was another chance to display her ability ; and their ladyships both thought her the best choice
1	like drops of blood fall endless tears of longing ,
1	for the gatemen there watched their masters ' behaviour to visitors and acted accordingly
1	but after laying siqi in one coffin — without so much as a whimper — before anyone could see what he was doing he whipped out a small knife and cut his own throat !
1	that same moment jia lian rushed in with his sword , followed by a crowd of people
1	are you such a moralist ?
1	not knowing the reason , baoyu turned back grinning , holding his muddy hands away from himself
1	their faces radiant with pride , they broke into a tumult of talk and laughter
1	if you want a fight , you can have it
1	this morning i sent in a plea in my name , but it has not yet been approved
1	a concubine in secret
1	lai−kuan told the maid to clear away the crabshells and fruit dishes , wipe the table , fetch a stoneware pot and brew some fragrant tea
1	madam you , being unable to go home , invited her step-mother old mrs you to come and keep an eye on things in the ning mansion
1	so we had no idea what was going on inside
1	you have been standing here in the damp since first thing this morning
1	but why do not you pay for the pork you eat ?
1	one morning , as soon as he woke he heard giggling and muffled cries from the outer room
1	i will join you later , he said
1	and in came daiyu
1	having told the magistrate that he was ill , tu shao−ching did not stir from his home for some time
1	last night her illness flared up again , and she coughed all night , cuilu answered
1	your three cousins are excellent girls , and i ’ m sure you ’ ll find them easy to get on with during lessons , or when you ’ re learning embroidery or playing together
1	she returned , angry and discomfited , to report to lady xing , it ’ s no use , she just swore at me
1	he took the money , thanked them all and left
1	after some time , two boys who were staying in the house to study for the stage brought in a vegetarian meal which pao shared with mr ni
1	is the jade really lost ?
1	your interest in old books shows your respect for learning , sir , said chuang
1	players came in next , kowtowed to the feasters , then clashed their cymbals and beat their drums as they danced the dance of official promotion
1	this is woven of mermaid-silk
1	he surely ca not deceive many people that way , said the young man
1	snorting with rage , niu stalked away
1	did he really say that ?
1	yet she suddenly came to my home demanding her husband
1	if you take offence now , i shall be most upset
1	its adobe rooms with their thatched roofs and bamboo windows were surrounded by a wattle-fence , and it was possible to fish through the windows
1	but you spend it all gorging yourself on pig 's head and flaky cakes , and do not bring a copper home
1	the lou brothers unfolded the white sheet of paper and read the following lines : i dare not do anything wrong , because i have studied old books
1	there 's no need for that , baoyu objected
1	he summoned bao yong and reprimanded him ; but not liking to punish him ordered him to keep watch in the garden and not to leave the place
1	if you ’ d waited for the king of hell , he wouldn ’ t have known
1	i still have about a dozen coins left , which i mean to use to buy alcohol
1	xiangling ’ s whole heart was nowadays set on writing poetry , but she did not like to trouble baochai too much
1	my guest is in trouble , not i
1	madam you invites xifeng alone
1	you came just too late to see something still more ridiculous , she said
1	yes , go along , all of you
1	on the feast of lanterns
1	what could be better than pinpin ?
1	if he accompanies you to your post in fukien , i shall miss you both very much
1	but that would be rather lonely for baochai
1	of course , he chuckled
1	the more pleasure people find in parties , the more lonely and unhappy they must feel when the parties break up
1	i think i might
1	why did not you pick any of my things , as i asked ?
1	by now baoyu was thoroughly exasperated , but for politeness ' sake he made an evasive answer
1	this drunkard did not get out of the way but came charging at us , he reported
1	mingyan grinned and stepped closer
1	for another thing , after i moved into the garden that small side gate in the southeast corner was kept open for me to go through ; but other people wanting to take a short cut could use it too , and there was nobody to make a check there
1	for hosts and guests alike the same requital
1	baoyu 's grief for daiyu deepened as it led him to reflect on the dispersal of all her attendants
1	at once he stepped forward to bow respectfully
1	if i have three thousand or fifty thousand , i didn ’ t earn it from you
1	they entered the hall where the abbess had indeed prepared a vegetarian meal for them
1	when this tale later came to be read , someone wrote four lines of verse to elucidate the author 's meaning , as follows :
1	there was a pavilion at the top of the hill , and here tu strolled in the sun for a long time watching his shadow , while chu−ko went to have a look at a small tablet in the distance , then came back and sat down
1	this enraged their father even more
1	to his relief , after less than a month he found himself on familiar terms with half the jia sons and nephews , and all the rich young men of fashion among them enjoyed his company
1	you are resting now in peace ;
1	but lai wang had reckoned on their coming , and was already waiting out in the street , when he saw the runners he approached them with a smile
1	the two boys promised to do as she said and left
1	master lian simply answered , it ’ s nothing to boast of , if somebody is willing to ruin a family for such a trifling reason
1	haven ’ t you seen that censer on my desk ?
1	if you drag me in i ’ ll pinch your lips , warned madam you
1	after all your kindness , mother , not a word of thanks do you get !
1	ah , it ’ s too bad !
1	she was looking most put out
1	besides , when the imperial consort learned that these were the work of her beloved younger brother , she would feel that he had not fallen short of her hopes
1	when they are filled with vital force they grow well
1	when the fragrance of flowers assails men
1	of course not , said pinger
1	he chanted the couplet :
1	thus every sexual transport of cloud and rain is the inevitable climax of love of beauty and desire
1	every table in the tavern he entered was full , except for one at which a young man was sitting
1	why ruin her life for her ?
1	they describe plenty of ways and means
1	you ’ re just looking for trouble
1	time and again they had sent a go-between to propose the match ; and as they were in easy circumstances and fairly well connected , liu and his wife were quite willing , but they could not get wuer ’ s consent
1	a fortnight after this his selection of essays was published , and he was given a feast that evening at which he got very drunk
1	xifeng was just walking on when a snuffling and sniffing behind her made her hair stand on end
1	the xia family entertained him for three or four days , and those old pawnshop assistants of his as well , pressing them to stay even longer , and only letting them leave when they absolutely insisted
1	then she can go on staying in purple caltrop isle , eating and playing with us just like in the old days , instead of being bullied by that scoundrel sun
1	in that case i ’ m ready to go with you , said the taoist
1	and although baoyu ’ s childish efforts were far from inspired , at least they were passable
1	after they had talked for some time the vice−president entertained fan chin to dinner , and then he took his leave
1	even if you call your cousin the queen of bamboos she 's no ehuang or nuying how could my mistress be related to mortals ?
1	to them , xiangling would seem more likely to do it
1	you must have been in good spirits today to come here
1	from now on this will be cancelled
1	the present holder of the title , shui rong , was a charming and modest young man of less than twenty with remarkable good looks
1	passing through a second door in the east corner and walking down the eastern corridor past the main building , they looked up to see another placard bearing the gilt inscription : the pavilion for studying ceremony
1	she had heard that tanchun was difficult to handle , but thought this was because others were afraid to stand up to her
1	the fact is that xiren had tried to fob him off for fear that the sight of bamboo lodge , reminding him of daiyu , would distress him again
1	not knowing that this was pornography the silly girl wondered , are these two monsters fighting ?
1	when she took the skirt and unfolded it , she found it was just like her own
1	i was looking for a messenger
1	before my illness i could have figured it out , but now i ca not remember a thing
1	you are no longer young , and you should discipline those youngsters so that they do not offend people outside
1	he did this without consulting the lou brothers , entrusting the business to iron−armed chang , who pawned the gown for five hundred coins which chuan put beside his pillow
1	fourth brother feng , you are an able man !
1	he offered baoyu a seat so that they could talk , and the boy kowtowed his thanks
1	can i look people in the face again ?
1	instead , he called his steward and cursed him under his breath
1	what has our east mansion done to be reduced to this ?
1	baochai had to accept this
1	i shall be back again at half past six the next morning
1	she was choking back her sobs when fenger brought in the clothes sent by xifeng
1	you may as well entrust this to her
1	if it does , i will do what i can for you
1	music sounds better on the water
1	aren ’ t they sure signs ?
1	though he and daiyu had grown up side by side and were kindred spirits who longed to live and die together , this was simply tacitly understood by both but had never been put into words
1	there he discovered ouguan , her face stained with tears , crouching over the ashes of some paper money , a light still in her hand
1	the doctor came and prescribed some medicine for her , but she would not take it because it tasted so bitter , and i had to boil ginseng and give it her little by little
1	instead he carried the medicine to her and raised her on the pillow to drink it
1	he was just seven at that time , but after all these years he must have grown up
1	jia lian also told lin zhixiao to deduct the two hundred taels from their housekeeping funds , under cover of various items in their daily expenditure
1	when breeze ruffles fragrant osmanthus and frost gathers on chrysanthemum
1	however hard they pleaded , she was adamant as she felt the maid had disgraced her
1	mrs liu now gave her daughter some soup and half a bowl of porridge , then explained to her about the pachyma flour
1	baoyu , withdrawing , hurried to call on his mother and then to report to his grandmother , very soon leaving her again to rush to bamboo lodge
1	it was an anthology of yue-fu , containing lyrics such as autumn sorrow in a girl - chamber and the pain of parting
1	but all this time i ’ ve been unwell i ’ ve had to depend on them for everything
1	he hopes the old mistress and second aunt will see to that matter right away , so that he can make the final decision when he comes tomorrow
1	would madam xue let her daughter-in-law die and do nothing about it ?
1	how lucky for whoever picked it up !
1	that 's a lively spot all right !
1	have not you even got a hat ?
1	just then baochai and the other girls were dismounting from their carriages , escorted by a multitude of matrons and stewards ' wives
1	you must be lying
1	as she was speaking , in came a maid sent by li wan
1	i haven ’ t anything special to do that i know of
1	now these were removed , an ebony pair inlaid with silver taking their place
1	it was early summer and fresh , newly−opened lotus were floating on the water
1	it 's you we are thinking of , miss
1	turning back to smile at him , she pointed towards the inner rooms
1	that ’ s a fine drinking-game , and this is just the time for it , approved the old lady
1	he wandered aimlessly on until one of xue pan ’ s pages appeared and asked him to go back
1	i have not seen you for some days , third brother , remarked tu
1	that day saw the end , too , of disorder , negligence and pilfering
1	my home is above the sphere of parting sorrow in the sea of brimming grief , she answered with a smile
1	women from rich and noble families were strolling to and fro here , in small groups , dressed in silk and brocade
1	we are pressed for time because we must have the book ready for the merchants to take to shantung and honan to sell
1	you see today how right i was
1	if you ’ ve made no progress by the end of that time you can stop studying , and i shall disown you !
1	they pulled him aboard , sopping wet , but fortunately it was a mild day
1	let me ask you a question , retorted baochai with a smile
1	there ’ s nothing amusing outside , it ’ s quiet and deserted
1	in relief zijuan answered , you seemed unwell just now , miss , when you left the old lady ’ s place , and we didn ’ t know what to do — we cried for fright
1	jingui interposed , of course other people 's wine tastes better than ours at home !
1	if only i ’ d known how things would end i ’ d have acted differently ; but i was fool enough to think we ’ d always be together
1	we ca not set our own house in order , so how can we handle other people 's affairs ?
1	autumn orchids coated with frost
1	for suitable tasks are selected for different talents , and the wrong choice of person would do the flowers injustice
1	quite right too , agreed the old lady
1	this man is not a bandit , he told them
1	this shows that plants change in accordance with human beings
1	even if i still had to see doctors and buy medicine , i needn ’ t spend the family ’ s money on it
1	how could you possibly have met her ?
1	although daiyu had spoken so sharply , this talk had distressed her
1	while her father was still alive he made her study , and she turned out ten times better than her brother
1	daiyu was not in her room but mrs zhou found her in baoyu ’ s , trying to unravel the nine-ring puzzle with him
1	they can ’ t do without me over there
1	where are those girls now ?
1	while yet in swaddling clothes an orphan lone ;
1	understanding her anxiety the latter said , you go back now
1	dear cousin , put in baoyu hastily
1	do not worry , child , said lady wang tearfully , your grandmother gave me a good ticking-off because i spoke up for you ; so i ca not see myself talking her round
1	then he went to bed , feeling less frustrated , and slept
1	after the meal sixth master said : i must be going now
1	seven or eight , i should say
1	however much money he made , he always threw it away
1	when they approached the inner gate , some old eunuchs sitting there rose to their feet
1	i was frightened to death , your honour !
1	he also produced a hundred cash and asked the inn−keeper to buy three measures of wine , two catties of meat and some vegetables
1	baochai opened it and read :
1	even if the old lady would let her go , i wouldn ’ t
1	what is this man 's name ?
1	it was the fifth of the ninth month , and the weather was dry and clear
1	i was rather bored , he told her with a laugh
1	her nose was stopped up and her voice was hoarse
1	let ’ s go and see how she is
1	the choice of words and images is superb
1	so even in the yamen there is no beef
1	our zhen family never let such creatures cross our threshold
1	do keep quiet for goodness ’ sake
1	they have not sent it back yet
1	if you will be good enough to write the certificate and count out the silver , i will send in a report to close his case and see that he clears off , so that this trouble does not crop up again
1	of all the girls in our family she 's the best , yet now she 's going so far away to get married -- there are fewer and fewer of us here every day
1	just drink as much as you want , i ’ ll answer for it
1	and the lady dowager made him sit next to her and helped him to dainties , while the others chatted and enjoyed themselves
1	a woman is called new wife when she marries , and later mistress ; but a concubine remains new wife even when her hair is white )
1	don ’ t you believe the rascal , mother , one of them cried
1	taking the hint he changed his tune and said , cousin [ in hasn ’ t felt too well these last few days
1	by now xiren and sheyue were up
1	if you bury someone in this , you will bankrupt your family
1	soon he turned to a tragic air , expressing grief and longing , and as old yu heard the most moving passages the tears ran down his cheeks
1	the other day i seem to have heard someone complaining that she was one string short
1	xue pan nodded his agreement
1	i have an old friend who 's the prefect of wuwei , and the other day i received a letter from him inviting me there , and i mean to call on him
1	what 's got into you today ?
1	since this is my home province , i hurried here to look for you
1	he flared up then and threatened to kill me
1	now they are interrogating him to find out the whereabouts of that gang of thieves
1	i got up early one day and had not yet left the house when i heard a noise from the woodpile
1	then , having put his takings under his father 's bed , he sat by the old man 's side and , to cheer him up , described the scenery of the west lake and the different sweetmeats sold there
1	the threshold of a noble house is deeper than the sea
1	then he seized the rascal 's club , and prepared to whack him over the head
1	you look less flushed
1	and how did you find qiaojie yesterday ?
1	she added , let ’ s choose the three characters red plum flower ’ as rhymes
1	together they entered the court
1	why should a man fall over at the sight of that red thing ?
1	zij nan suddenly thought back fondly to daiyu , telling hersell what a pity miss lin is dead !
1	there ’ s still a rhyme :
1	the sergeant is here , said wang when she had finished
1	the two women tuned their instruments and played until the lady dowager asked the time
1	xiangyun roused herself from a brown study to urge xiren 's party and the maids at the foot of the slope to eat their fill
1	the other old woman simply smiled and did not answer
1	i have been looking for you everywhere !
1	but one of the maids attending the young ladies may have dropped a cup , they suggested
1	you ’ re talking nonsense again , said his grandmother , laughing
1	hurry up and get dressed now
1	we tried to take it down , but it was glued on too firmly ; so we copied it out , then soaked the paper to get it off
1	nonsense , said li wan
1	i have heard something of the sort too , said tu
1	if you spread the news and the thief smashes the jade , i can ’ t see you living it down !
1	after standing there for a few minutes she turned and went out , signalling to fangguan to join her , then quietly told her what ruiguan had said and handed over the powder
1	xue pan 's eyes bulged , he was so frantic
1	but all-seeing buddha meted out retribution
1	are there no men outside your family ?
1	the inn−keeper assented with alacrity
1	when enough contributions have come in , you can take charge of repairing the shrine and restoring the image , and every month i will give you money for incense
1	i don ’ t drink liuan tea , said the old lady
1	your cousin happens to be my husband , sister
1	'of course miss xichun 's doing this of her own free will , but the girls in her service are not willing to do the same , said zijuan
1	where have you been ?
1	then he asked his secretaries for the list of those who had failed in the prefectural examination , and carefully checked their names and cell numbers
1	these really were gifts to her brother from zhen , madam you confirmed
1	as she stepped over the threshold in the dim lamplight , she saw the shadowy figure of a woman who appeared to be about to hang herself with the scarf in her hand
1	by now they had reached his study where they found zhan guang , cheng rixing , hu silai and shan pinren as well as the singing-boy
1	seal its roots with mud and water it with spring water
1	i will watch you write your plea
1	i happened to be the one who went that day , and the old lady was as pleased as pleased could be
1	maybe these girls of ours ca not compare with those young ladies , but they should not go to the other extreme either
1	at this point jia zhen came in
1	take it , sir , said chou chi−fu
1	in that case , how do you know ?
1	so you get an extra ten taels for your son , which means getting as much as they do , and on top of that you ’ ve been given land in the garden farm and are paid rent , apart from the largest share in the annual bonuses
1	wait till we see what can be done
1	and he asked his clerks : is there another yu yu−chung in this county who is a senior licentiate ?
1	xue ke was a simple , honest young fellow
1	knowing that the two girls were good friends he ignored her too and raising the door curtain went into his bedroom
1	he 's the cousin of the ninth mr hsu of the duke 's palace
1	but to yuling ’ s eternal spring my soul has fled
1	having finished her toilet she went off with the other girls to pay her respects to the lady dowager
1	that year his concubine you died , although i was not in the capital i heard you spent pots of money ; yet now that your mother 's dead he 's skimping things like this
1	he could not resist accosting them with a bow
1	he did not awake till the morning , when he turned and saw xiren lying fully dressed on the cover at his side
1	on his return he did as chu chin−yu had foreseen and procured an outsize balance
1	an impostor masquerades as an official wu shu was about to return teng chih−fu 's call when an invitation card was brought in
1	i am not one to blab -- if i were , they would be involved in plenty of murder cases !
1	then baochai did not insist , and they tried for a while to guess the answers , but with no success
1	the attendants were afraid to go near her
1	qingwen and the others had done as he said , however , and now they ran back smiling
1	what does it matter to you ?
1	already deranged , after the mysterious apparitions and vanishings of-this evening he knew even less what to think
1	this said , he left
1	and thus the wizard spake with omens bright :
1	these two were not the only ones to be talking this business over
1	when they reached the arch erected for the imperial consort ’ s visit home , granny liu exclaimed :
1	that would be pointless
1	here ’ s fresh trouble out of the blue !
1	don ’ t you know the way she is , sister ?
1	although my status is higher , i ’ m just a stump of rotten wood swathed in silks and satins , just a ces s-pool or gutter filled with choice wines and meats
1	xifeng told the stewardesses to make a note of this name , and the things were entrusted to zhou rui ’ s wife for temporary custody till a check had been made the next day
1	when they see us come down in the world they strike out on their own ; and some of them , so i have heard , help other people to squeeze us
1	cousin daiyu feels the cold , said baoyu
1	i am sure master bao will come back
1	i ’ m just giving her part of some that was given to me , she explained
1	lady wang was speechless , in tears
1	this talk reached the ears of ni er 's wife and daughter , who waited in vain that night for him to come home
1	who would have known it ’ s her turn next to die ?
1	four maids who were waiting knelt down upon both knees
1	how do you come to be here , uncle ?
1	think over what you said
1	afraid his pig-headedness would lead to trouble , the others hastily put in , you understand everything else so well , why ask about the term natural ’ ?
1	his mother saw from the dazed look on his face that he had something on his mind
1	they could not escape hsiao 's catapult , however
1	everyone speaks of miss baochai ’ s good manners and generosity , she gushed , and sure enough here ’ s an example today
1	we must not hold them up ; so i will say goodbye
1	so she and zhou rui 's wife set out with granny lin for the lady dowager 's quarters
1	it upsets you to see how fond i am of your cousin , but i love you even more if you only knew it
1	the heartless meet with certain retribution
1	my dear cousin , you are being touchy instead if you talk like that , said xiangyun
1	selected essays have a short vogue only , said the shopkeeper
1	can you really be so vulgar as not even to tell the difference ?
1	go and get them to make some tea while i wake him up
1	the wine in his left hand , he took aim with the sword in his right above the old man 's crown
1	jia lian grabbed his arm protesting , there are ladies inside ; how can you charge in so wildly ?
1	and mr mei said , amy own name seems to be an auspicious one , so i will give it to him and hope that he will turn out like me
1	why does their love come to nothing ?
1	but no more of this
1	i ’ ll take care of him
1	what do you want of me ?
1	dark tradesigns flutter above the wineshops , and red charcoal glows in the tea−house stoves , while men and women stream by , on pleasure bent , to throng the countless taverns and music halls
1	inevitably , this over-indulgence had made her like the brigand dao zhi of old : she had as high an opinion of herself as if she were a goddess , and treated others like dirt
1	now that things had come to such a pass , xueyan could not but grieve for daiyu , though she dared not show her feelings to the old lady and xifeng
1	fan was taken ill in front of my temple just after he passed the examination , but i was out that day and could not do anything for him
1	this xiangyun resolutely declined , however , and at her insistence they let her move in with baochai instead
1	this impressed them all
1	yet the things you say !
1	i really can ’ t bring myself to do such a thing
1	your first and second young ladies ’ families are on close terms with ours
1	pray allow me to reflect carefully before submitting a memorial
1	at last cuilu held out her hand
1	when people like that ask for me , just say i am not at home
1	the girl lifted the portiere and came in , having been sent by lady wang to find jia lian
1	they got up early and went secretly to try to win pinger over to their side , taking her presents , complimenting her on her competence and good judgement , and telling her all kinds of tales about mrs liu
1	the butcher went on cursing at full blast , till fan chin 's head spun
1	this was a huge lake , almost as large as the west lake in hangchow
1	he bowed his way to his chair , then left
1	she caught hold of the girl ’ s sleeve to drag her off
1	yun , the son of fifth sister-in-law who lives in west lane , has come several times begging me to find him a job , and i promised him i would if he would wait
1	as the old woman rose to leave
1	i hope you will consider doing good as its own reward , and not take offence at my lack of courtesy
1	you ’ d feel the same if you heard someone in my place complaining about me
1	transmigration has always been considered a mystery , declared magistrate hsiang
1	not only for my sake either
1	zijuan laughingly fetched the tea leaves and told one of the younger maids to make tea
1	that ’ s why , in front of the master , i said it was xiangling
1	the old lady , lady xing and lady wang immediately asked what had happened
1	what business have you here ?
1	i am lu hsin−hou of hukuang
1	he used to be my disciple , and now that he has become a great official he has sent these men to invite me to become the abbot of pao kuo monastery in the capital
1	i heard just now , sir , said pao , that charges are being brought against magistrate hsiang of antung county
1	who are you , you lawless brigand ?
1	jia zheng entrusted all three to the care of
1	to know what followed , turn to the next chapter
1	some mr wang was the go-between—he ’ s related to the east mansion ; so without making further inquiries they accepted out of hand
1	i fail to understand your attitude , sir
1	i am fortunate to have met you who can certainly edify me
1	the chicken and pork simmering in one pan set his mouth watering ; and he saw a pan of good rice , too , and a bottle of wine
1	who am i to be cross ?
1	from spring till summer ?
1	tell the mistress that , he cut in halfway
1	the master sends you his respects , sir , he said to kuang
1	jia zheng found the whole privy council as well as the princes assembled in the palace
1	as he was speaking , he fastened up his hair and asked the apothecary for a basin of water to wash his face , while one of the neighbours found his shoe and helped him put it on
1	they ’ re doing it in their own good time
1	his mother could surely have seen her daughter by herself
1	if you fix this up , i ’ ll make it worth your while how ’ s that ?
1	to know the reason for this summons , read the next chapter
1	chinese feudalism , the development of which had long been retarded , was in a state of decline
1	so it was just one of your tricks
1	and in he walked , in a large hat of plaited bamboo leaves and a coir cape
1	i gave you a lot of trouble yesterday , declared baoyu
1	do you know mr tu too , nephew ?
1	the old lady ordered sheyue to send to fetch him
1	when they entered the courtyard they heard her talking with a man
1	thank goodness it was miss baochai and not miss lin -- she would have made a fearful scene , weeping and sobbing
1	i am so glad you have come !
1	she dressed rather conspicuously too
1	where have you been all this time ?
1	then xifeng , having washed her face , went back to wait on the lady dowager
1	i do not ask anything else — just let him show me the marriage certificate signed by my father , and i will say no more !
1	really i should drink a few cups with you , but i have some very urgent business today to report to my father
1	by now jia lian was calling pinger from the door of the hall , and before she could go to meet him he stepped through her doorway
1	thinking daiyu had been scolding him again , xueyan had to go back to bamboo lodge where she gave zijuan the ginseng , as their mistress was still asleep
1	she quietly told baochai , 'the talking-to you gave him did the trick after all , madam
1	it ’ s all that jia yun ’ s fault !
1	he dropped her hand then and told her , she said to me , 'if i would known i was going to get a bad name , i would have committed myself
1	jia lian agreed and withdrew to order a carriage for hupo and the maids
1	some outstanding examples are the juniper tree before confucius ’ temple and the yarrow before his tomb , as well as the cypress before zhuge liang ’ s temple and the pine before yue fei ’ s tomb
1	i only beg your highnesses to be lenient to my uncle who knew nothing about this
1	she presented some brushes and stationery to baochai , yingchun , baoyu and others
1	none but admires her talents and her skill ;
1	who could have imagined such a stroke of luck ?
1	and what i like about you is that you are the most lustful man ever to have lived in this world since time immemorial
1	i dared not , sir
1	tang san called one day when yoo had nothing to do
1	if i ’ d known , i should never have struck her not even if some devil were forcing my hand
1	when the results were published , chou chin had passed with distinction , and all the merchants were delighted
1	and mrs you , to be easy in her mind , had to bring her two unmarried daughters with her
1	and when the lips are gone the teeth will feel the cold
1	let 's have the dice
1	but we have brought that stupid object back with us
1	magistrate fang of our county has treated you very well
1	he seized this chance to add : as the proverb says
1	baoyu were to come back how happy we all should be !
1	this set xiangyun worrying
1	aunt huang immediately flew into a passion
1	he was dazzled by the glittering gold and emerald and the elegance of all the furnishings , but could see no sign of baoyu
1	no , it 's usually kept shut , they answered
1	but to bring out its splendour once it is displayed we must write poems about it ; so six is writing about the chrysanthemum
1	the author 's condemnation of his negative characters can not be considered as personal attacks
1	she called me silly , said i was talking nonsense , and i dared not argue with her
1	not until feng ziying came out did he let them go
1	i needn ’ t name any names
1	qiaojie turned to look at him , then started crying again
1	as for his sister ’ s wedding , pan says your decision was a good one , and rushing it through will save a good deal of money
1	he started sobbing too
1	master bao , not being used to this heat , might be over-powered by the stench
1	how do you know he will suffer in the next world ?
1	at sight of these nine spirits , he raised his magic staff and threatened to beat them
1	the older you grow the more outspoken you get
1	they came in now to greet the scholars , and chih heng−shan gave the boys the vermilion flutes and pheasant feathers for their dance
1	yen told the nurse to bring in his son , and threw a coarse linen cloth over the child 's shoulders as a sign of mourning , the coffin had been ready for some time
1	i was just old enough then to remember things
1	gold is like iron to them
1	often lost in thought , he did not know what to do
1	daiyu could only pretend not to have heard
1	as it was nearing sunset , she had to find yuanyang and tell her which of the old lady 's things she wanted
1	all eyes were fixed on mr
1	are you in low spirits , madam ?
1	is your other name yu−huei , by any chance ? , he asked
1	there ’ s no need to discuss it , expostulated baoyu
1	otherwise , in less than a year you will have spent all your family 's money and made those above and below resent you too
1	then with a smile to aunt xue the old lady said , let 's go
1	the more he thought about it , the worse his hand hurt , and he asked the apothecary to give him some ointment for it
1	and there ’ s something even more amazing
1	if he is a successful candidate , it will help to atone for our faults
1	when yu yu−ta reached wuwei , the district magistrate , truly mindful of old friendship , entertained him for several days
1	li wan agreed , yes , since ancient times many men have given up rank and wealth to achieve buddhahood and become immortals
1	shouted niu , beside himself with anger
1	all right , we wo not have them pulled out
1	i hope you ’ ll guess them
1	he then paced up and down outside alone
1	he prepared a farewell feast , and produced over a dozen taels of silver , then hired a sedan−chair and saw wang off to huichow
1	and now that i ’ m tipsy , unless i ’ m very careful , i may smash this porcelain cup
1	i love meddling in other people ’ s affairs , said the lady dowager
1	no matter how thick a sheet of ice , a piwan can shatter it with one roar
1	lady wang pointed out the place
1	collect my books and bring round my horse
1	did you write this ?
1	why should you , who are usually so good to me , be so hard on me today just because of pinger ?
1	the others were wondering what she meant when xiren picked up the slip for all to see
1	since wu comprised the modern provinces of kiangsu and chekiang , it was fitting that a native of chekiang should act as master of sacrifice
1	accordingly baochai ordered a serving-woman , go and ask my brother to get us several crates of big crabs like those we had the other day
1	sheer went straight to find xiangling
1	they could not agree on their diagnosis
1	when she and her mother got back , jia huan and jia cong had just called to see baoyu
1	how would that be ?
1	she ordered the stewards to conduct the eunuchs to where refreshments were waiting
1	i am not making this up you heard her for yourself in front of alpinia park
1	both stories seemed likely and xiren was convinced
1	asked chi tien−yi , very pleased
1	no wonder it tastes so good , cooked with a dozen chickens
1	in that case , do invite them over , urged the dowager princess
1	we shall thank you again when that man of mine comes out
1	xiuyan , after bowing and praying on her instructions , got up to help hold the planchette
1	by the afternoon when there was no sign of them , she , li wan and baochai sent servants out to make inquiries , but they did not come back , having no news
1	the men ignored her for a while , but finally one of them said , wait over there by that corner
1	it would simply pour oil on the flames
1	when shall i be able to go ?
1	the top compartment was full of brushes and sticks of ink , fans , incense slabs , multi-coloured pouches , sashes and the like
1	baoyu paid his respects to aunt xue and greeted baoqin but looked in vain for baochai and xiuyan
1	it ’ s only the tenth month , and this is the first fall of snow this winter , rejoined the old lady
1	after the steward 's return the news spread like wildfire that concubine zhao had been tortured to death by the king of hell because she had plotted murder
1	how come then that when i was away for a few days and you were laid up , practically at death ’ s door , you mended that cape for him with no thought of your health ?
1	when you go in , auntie , do filch a few apricots for me
1	xifeng told fenger : bring that set of ten cups carved out of bamboo root on the bookshelf in the inner room
1	out with the truth !
1	if i ’ m not in earnest may i drop dead !
1	if you would spoken before , it could have been fixed up some time ago
1	at once she recoiled a few steps
1	i shall probably be here for some years , so i have taken another wife
1	so do stop drinking cold wine
1	if she weren ’ t quite incapable of any exertion , i know she ’ d have made an effort to be here today , observed xifeng
1	what ’ s been keeping you all this time ?
1	have you come from miss xing ’ s place ?
1	he was marveling , too , that the voice carried so clearly right into the house
1	i was on my way to ask cousin daiyu when luckily i met you
1	the other beast flew into a rage , and thrust out one paw to knock off the tiger 's head , felling it to the ground
1	they ’ re lucky to be here at all , able to watch and eat free of charge , but i won ’ t let them choose any items
1	approved li wan too
1	then chin tung−ya , followed by lu hua−shih , entered the hall
1	leave that to me , said feng
1	ting−hsi asked a diviner to find a suitable site for the grave and to choose a day for the burial ; but there was no one to write an inscription for the pall
1	my innocence is proof against abuse
1	riding on , xue pan observed that the houses now were few and far between
1	as long as baoyu lives , i shall always be his whipping-boy
1	we will get somebody to keep you company , to pour you tea during the night
1	the next year rebels rampaged east of the mountains ,
1	and she was so dazzled by everything in the room that her head began to swim
1	we were trying to amuse the old lady , why should i be cross ?
1	then , wailing loudly , she tried to climb on the wooden roof of the bed , and began to sing snatches of opera
1	as she entered this temporary palace , she saw torches in the courtyard flaring to the sky , powdered incense strewing the ground , flaming trees , jasper flowers , gilded windows and jade balustrades , to say nothing of screens as fine as the shrimp ’ s antennae , carpets of otter-skin , musk burning in tripods , and fans made from pheasant plumage
1	he left his uncle 's house in a temper and was trudging home with lowered head , fuming over such shabby treatment , when he bumped into a drunkard
1	the old lady chortled , as the proverb says : even a clever wife can ’ t make congee without rice
1	mind you blow gently though
1	do you appreciate them better now ?
1	then he passed the palace examination and was appointed a magistrate , after which he married one of the zhen family ’ s maids — his present wife is his second
1	go back and tell your master that
1	when the proofs are out and when the book is published i will invite you again , he said
1	one book on ceremony , one on etymology , and one on country etiquette
1	so what could i do ?
1	every day they either fight or squabble , and there ’ ve even been several cases of gambling and theft
1	these may not be divulged in advance to you with your human eyes and mortal frame
1	strictly speaking , it ’ s not my job to announce visitors
1	it will be livelier having it together
1	i wanted my fortune told
1	such was the depth to which the people of wuho had sunk
1	mind you don ’ t hurt your hand , madam , urged pinger
1	but who will bury mc when dead i lie ?
1	exclaimed granny liu in surprise
1	to prevent gossip she ’ s ordered you to ignore me , but here you come seeking me out
1	he had a lean , sallow face and sparse moustache and , because he was a short−sighted fellow and absorbed in his reading , he did not see kuang chao−jen come in ; but when the latter came over and greeted him , he stood up and returned the greeting
1	those who know us say : boys will be boys
1	wouldn ’ t that be the same ?
1	he burst out weeping
1	but when second master carried on like that outside you ought to have told me about it earlier
1	i ’ ve thrown the wrong one !
1	whatever happens , don ’ t just slip away
1	why put up with such bad treatment from her husband ?
1	luckily she was challenged by no one on her way to happy red court
1	where are you going ?
1	he then cautioned xue pan , mind you don ’ t tell the family
1	this is the best !
1	formerly a small alley had separated the two houses , but since this was private property and not a public thoroughfare the grounds of both could now be thrown into one
1	you must go home at once to see to qiaojie
1	aunt xue declared , i ’ m too old to mix in your crowd , and i feel very boxed up here too , i ’ d rather lie down in comfort in the council hall
1	more cheerful now , the old lady told yuanyang to get out a hundred taels and order the servants to prepare two days ' feasts , starting from the next day
1	especially as the family of your betrothed isn ’ t as well off as before
1	jingui makes a scene and baochai
1	when you heard i was here , why didn ’ t you come out ?
1	they ’ d never heard of it and said instead i was cheating , so we started squabbling and i ’ ve spolit my new skirt
1	rather sheepishly , she hastily sat up , straightened her clothes and went back with the others to red fragrance farm
1	even so , proposed pinger , we must call those two trouble-makers caiyun and yuchuan over , and get them to agree to this arrangement
1	leave it to me
1	but if she goes home to rest i ’ ll have nobody here , as xiren ’ s away just now
1	then baoyu , instead of going out , ordered the doctor to be sent for at once
1	i wo not deceive you
1	take this to show your uncle bao , then give it back to your mother
1	but pinger slipped from his grasp and ran out of the room , leaving him doubled up in frustration
1	but you mustn ’ t wear yourself out
1	let ’ s get on with burying the flowers
1	from now on i shall have to address you as master , not as sister ’ any more
1	all men must die
1	but though he knew the real reason for her distress he refrained from speaking of it , for fear of making her feel worse
1	so you are the famous chekiang editor , said feng
1	it is not fair i would not have begrudged xiren ten times as much either -- she deserves it
1	i can ’ t eat anything or drink much either , so i ’ ll leave my place to them and that will suit everybody
1	jia zhen was not in good health himself at this time and , being weighed down with grief , he limped in with a cane
1	the body is a bodhi tree , the mind a mirror clear ;
1	there was nobody about , nothing but a few trees , and the smoke from some distant cottages where supper was being cooked rose up , a vivid blue , straight to the clouds
1	why should i trouble my head over such matters ?
1	don ’ t go to sleep just yet , you two , she said
1	even if he does not pay us back , we merchants always fritter away a few taels one way or another , and this is in a good cause
1	but there 's not a moment to lose : you will have to get busy at once , sir
1	although our aim is to economize and make a profit , we mustn ’ t be too stingy either
1	she ’ s better , answered xifeng , who had an aversion to both him and concubine zhao
1	your remark the other day about good fortune and bad has been on my mind ever since , he said
1	kuang was too worried that night to sleep
1	let them bring me three thousand taels and i ’ ll see to this for them
1	because your daughter was always making trouble , she asked xiangling to keep her company and they slept in the same room
1	you must have a simple meal with us ; and mr wu is writing a poem for you
1	but master bao wanted to send something today to miss shi in the house of the young marquis
1	the gate was closed but not yet locked
1	i ’ ve searched even the young lady ’ s person
1	kuang chao−jen was annoyed
1	the garrison commander of the capital reported : xue pan , a native of jinling , while travelling through taiping county put up in li family hostel
1	this would mean fewer men without wives , and would help to strengthen general morality
1	how can one take everything so seriously ?
1	finally she voiced her own fear of punishment , all but going down on her knees , she was so frantic
1	the other one is xiren
1	one day after drinking a few cups alone jingui , lying on the kang , decided to work off her spleen on baochan
1	by law you should be punished , but in view of your brotherly concern i shall pardon you
1	do not you know that one ancient sage taught that we 'should not lose the heart of a child ?
1	in a trance with a goddess he leaves the world of men
1	now that it 's settled , they will be sending you rich presents , madam ; and once your grand-daughter 's married to a prince , the elder master will get a high post for sure
1	a temple to tai po
1	in panic aunt xue and the others searched everywhere for good doctors , but not one was able to diagnose his illness until a certain bi zhan , a poor physician who lived in a ruined temple outside town , ascribed it to both internal and external factors : sudden transports of joy and grief depriving him of his senses and appetite and pent-up indignation resulting in congestion
1	why go to such trouble ?
1	a filial son is seen off by his friends to search for his father in szechuan dr yu received his guests , and after an exchange of courtesies they sat down
1	but now it looks , doesn ’ t it , as if we were celebrating our own ?
1	some people say he ’ s returned
1	does he have to go to the palace to have a good meal ?
1	but as soon as the meal was over he called for tea to rinse his mouth , suspecting that his grandmother might be worried by his absence , and worried himself about daiyu
1	i ’ m sure you ’ ll inherit our noble ranks in future
1	chih and tu stood one on the right and one on the left of the incense table
1	better take siqi to her with the evidence , and after seeing it they ’ ll at most give her a beating and assign a different maid here
1	what ’ s come over you , miss ?
1	sit down while i brew some tea for you , and tell me all you have been doing
1	she said , 'your aunt 's delicate yet look at all she has on her hands
1	i kept telling you , ma , but you never believed me , said chunyan
1	today , hearing that the old lady might be wanting fruit from the garden , we opened it in readiness
1	tranquil you sleep in your secluded vault ;
1	presently niu pu came in wearing a new tile−shaped cap , new blue cloth gown , new shoes and new socks
1	you ’ ve come just in time
1	since i came here as a girl , your ladyships have been so good to me !
1	why , when she ’ s carried out wearing this , people won ’ t be able to take their eyes off her
1	all the cups on the tables were changed then for fresh ones from the basin , and when more wine had been poured they resumed their seats
1	so mr wei and mr sui are here
1	but when she picked up the chopsticks she still found them unwieldy
1	there ko lai−kuan in a lined gauze , jade−coloured gown , with a fan of wild goose feathers in his slender tapering fingers , was leaning over the balcony enjoying the breeze
1	as they were talking lady wang was announced
1	he says it 's all right to keep up the connection now that our second master has inherited the title
1	after a simple meal we can have a good talk , said kao
1	i must have taken the wrong road before
1	daiyu , standing in the shade of the blossom , went on staring into the distance towards happy red court
1	they hired a small boat and set out that same afternoon without attendants , and had soon covered several dozen miles
1	why didn ’ t you go to the front ?
1	if it comes out after they have left , we will have missed our chance
1	after a hasty tour of this monastery , he went back to sit in the same tea−house again—its name , the southern screen , was written in letters of gold — and here he drank a bowl of tea
1	i ’ m so tired , my bones are aching , protested xifeng
1	my old woman burns a stick of incense every day under the eaves , to pray that you gentlemen will become ministers too
1	at the mention of daiyu , though he still raves his mind seems clearer
1	when jia zheng commented on jia lan ’ s absence , a nurse went inside to ask li wan the reason
1	then ni er 's wife and daughter told him their story
1	now , seeing that xiren ’ s wrapper was of black and white silk gauze , lined with pink silk , and in it she had only two worn silk-padded jackets and one fur jacket , xifeng told pinger to bring her own jade-coloured velvet wrapper with a silk lining , as well as a cape for the snow
1	i ’ m not afraid of you !
1	zijuan , who had just brought in tea , was puzzled to find the two of them like this
1	don ’ t stand on ceremony , sir , said yucun , rising
1	the little wretch just smiled and did not stir
1	thirteen years have passed in a twinkling since we left you at the foot of blue ridge peak , he said with a sigh
1	she asked baochai , did cousin baoyu take his jade with him ?
1	yes , it ’ s the same
1	i am a rustic fellow who scribbles at random , replied niu pu
1	dear cousin , you ’ ve got me wrong , he said
1	this is strictly forbidden : it would have been a fiasco !
1	tomorrow ’ s still a holiday , and we ought to get up early
1	pasted on each boy 's desk is the warning : do not imitate tu shao−ching of tienchang !
1	drink up now like a good girl
1	we must have some dress materials ready for them
1	as baoyu happened to come in just then , she asked him whether he had had his lunch
1	mrs lin asked pinger if she agreed , and the answer was :
1	he ’ s not afraid of you , mother , and won ’ t listen to other people ’ s advice either
1	for fear of vexing her he made no mention of going to see her brother
1	all agreed that it was time to disperse , so when xiren and baoyu tried to keep them li wan and baochai demurred :
1	some lamented her fate , some blamed mao yanshou the painter , and others reproached the han emperor for making him paint portraits of palace beauties instead of good ministers
1	the master of ceremonies invited the bride to alight from the chair , and baoyu saw a maid with a red sash help her out — her face was veiled
1	from the moon cave roll silver waves
1	the more serious charge is of abducting the wife of an honest citizen , who was forced to kill herself rather than submit
1	i have not been out for a long time , and have therefore failed to profit from your instruction , said tu
1	each one is a household word
1	but by now wang was beginning to feel quite sick at heart , so he declined to join them
1	by no daiyu was wide-awake
1	but we won ’ t teach you for nothing
1	but luckily here you are
1	what good friend is this ?
1	just then , however , at the bottom of the hamper , she discovered a bowl of ham-and-fresh-bamboo-shoot soup
1	as she spoke she began to grow angry again
1	they are all good friends of mine
1	i hear from your mother that your wife is too unwell to go
1	now xue pan was a living example of the saying to cover the land of shu after getting the region of long
1	as for the reward , you can raise it by selling my jewels
1	his grandfather fell ill of rage , and since he was an old man of seventy with a lowered resistance and had no cordials to help him , in less than ten days he died
1	baoyu had to accompany her to lady wang ’ s place , only to find that his father had left already
1	if they were here , we could arrange baoqin ’ s wedding and then yours
1	and at this point jia lan and jia huan slipped away
1	one of them even picked up the gold chaplet that the new wife had let fall , and concealed it in her clothes
1	mind you don ’ t tell anybody !
1	he must have gone to find the hibiscus spirit , or in search of some other goddess !
1	seizing hold of aunt xue she demanded , just how did you murder my daughter anyway ?
1	but because the imperial consort never sent for them , they gradually became lax in their devotions ; and as they grew older they began to take an interest in men
1	one boat was for the bride and bridegroom , the other for the senior licentiate
1	he distinguished himself in the fighting against the huns , but was never made a noble
1	jia lian promptly called for his horse and rode off , accompanied by longer , leaving xinger behind to attend to other things
1	then zijuan told some younger maids to take the kite to the women on duty at the gate , who should give it to anyone who came asking for it
1	let ’ s go before baoyu sees him , urged another
1	we shall have to send to the capital for more
1	jia she and the other men waited outside in the west street entrance , the lady dowager and the women outside the main gate , the ends of the street and the alleys leading to it all having been screened off
1	the messenger need not say a word , once you saw the rings you would know that they were for the young ladies
1	here is his letter , sir , and here are five hundred taels of silver for the wedding gifts
1	since your name is niu , said niu yu−fu , our family must have been the same five hundred years ago
1	after raising his chopsticks to invite his guests to fall to , he took merely a few bamboo shoots and cherries himself
1	he thought , this seems a bit lacking in respect
1	xifeng promptly assented and took her leave of aunt xue
1	how quickly the place has run wild !
1	drive all those humbugs out , i say
1	although the woman did not like the idea , as xifeng had done her the honour of proposing it in person she had to agree out of hand
1	tomorrow we can travel together
1	if i ever run amuck again , swore xue pan , may i be killed and disembowelled !
1	to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
1	and he would not come back anyway
1	having made out a prescription including ginseng , angelica , astragalus and the like , he took his leave
1	it was this jade that made him fall ill , this jade that cured him , this jade that he was born with she broke off here in a fresh fit of weeping
1	jingui asked her , did anyone see you fetch those things ?
1	this is actually only a makeshift , madam
1	all laughed at that , and then daiyu suggested one piece
1	why did i say you couldn ’ t take her as your mother ?
1	pinger had already called out xueyan , who had been holding aloof these last few days as the others had been taunting her as a careless child ; and in any case she would never dream of ignoring a summons from the lady dowager and madam lian
1	if i don ’ t do my best , you can cut off my head
1	he had several concubines but fate had not granted him another son , and he could not remedy this
1	this night ’ s royal tour gives rise to poetry ,
1	any delay , and the master will suffer for it
1	at once he had her laid on the bed and sent for a doctor
1	if madam you heard , she would drive us away from our nunnery with curses !
1	you don ’ t have to worry about that , xiangiian assured him
1	then why not engage him to baiyu ?
1	it was baoyu ’ s turn to laugh
1	when lady wang and xifeng had agreed to this , she went on to see baoyu and asked what he wanted her for
1	he has studied hard for scores of years , but never even passed the prefectural examination
1	whether it 's true or not , i must go to town to have a look
1	we will presently be eating crabs , said xifeng
1	if she ’ s rude to you , she ’ s rude to me as well
1	i ’ ve been waiting for a chance to go to court
1	he noticed in the middle of the wall a scroll painting of the moon goddess change and another goddess , each with an attendant , the second one carrying what looked like a long clothing bag
1	the others rejoined in surprise , we often see her but never heard tell of this
1	do you mean to say , retorted ting , that these poems by chao hsueh−chai and ching lan−chiang are really by other people ?
1	fate has brought us together to this feast today , he said
1	what poems can the old monk have that he wo not show me ?
1	don ’ t stay here talking nonsense
1	another couplet on the two sides read :
1	and even if she were not , she could not be passed over
1	what luck for you to meet me as soon as you get here !
1	while they were speaking the table was spread , and they sat down : mr wei in the seat of honour , chang chun−min opposite him , tu shao−ching in the place of host , and pao ting−hsi in the lowest seat
1	xifeng , who was passing outside , overheard this exchange and called back through the window :
1	a most plausible explanation , said the others
1	then , seated in front of the lady dowager 's couch , she found some more gossip to tell her
1	they had now reached the convent gate
1	if we led our forces there , we would start dying off in a few days of thirst
1	but i ’ ve noticed that at least half our sisters attending in the different apartments make these purchases with their own money
1	so you still remember that ?
1	what is she doing here ?
1	she ordered siqi to pack up her things and leave
1	lengthened my pendents , where bright jewels blazed
1	then the sight of the old lady , terror-stricken and gasping for breath , made him even more frantic
1	nothing of coil sequence , replied jia zheng with a smile
1	we can copy it out tomorrow
1	by midday there was still no sign of him
1	third sister , he said , i heard that you were there when cousin lin died and that , far off in the distance , there was the sound of music
1	this is extremely urgent
1	i didn ’ t know about that business of burning paper
1	when he saw that it was chou chi−fu , he put down the urn and they greeted each other
1	put out by his stare she asked :
1	his hereditary rank is hereby abolished
1	for how otherwise could i have seen such a sight ?
1	rather hard on baochai , though
1	at noon baoyu drank a few cups of wine with xue ke , and baochai took baoqin to pay her respects to him too
1	yu yu−ta kept wang to a meal , and refused to accept his card inscribed as from a pupil to a teacher
1	now i ’ ve a broiled pheasant in my room , piping hot
1	that year the records of officials in the capital were examined , and the ministry of works ranked jia zheng as first class
1	if you tell her she will want to come , but she may not be able , and if she ca not she will be terribly disappointed
1	one day dusk fell while he was far from any village ; but as he pressed forward he met a man
1	i will bring it you , sir , for your opinion
1	whichever of us you choose , madam , they replied
1	ripples radiated out to shatter the moon ’ s reflection , which then rounded out again
1	do take me home at once
1	what are you talking about ?
1	after a stay of four or five days , they announced that they must leave ; and during the farewell feast the question of chu hsien−fu 's marriage came up again
1	she sat down to sip tea while mrs wang and the others set about searching
1	though their poems and paintings were not as good as his , kai kuan prized talent so much that when such visitors called he would feast them , and there would be talk and laughter
1	one evening in the runner 's house , huan−cheng and shuanghung were discussing how they might pawn the old casket for a few dozen coins to buy food
1	this ceremony at an end , yuanchun asked why aunt xue , baochai and daiyu were missing
1	i would like to keep out of the way
1	please tell them to open the gate , they begged , we just want to have a look
1	the weather was growing warm and chuan wu−yung 's thick white gown was becoming too hot , so he decided to pawn it in order to buy some blue cloth to make a gown for the party
1	today , after calling on their ladyships , we want to see miss xichun too
1	they weren ’ t officials , were they ?
1	i told him that , but he wanted me to tell you , miss , so that you can give him an answer
1	in view of what xifeng had said , mrs wang had to let this pass and they went on to tanchun ’ s place
1	one of these rooms was occupied by an old monk , and niu pu−yi now put up in the other
1	and when maids took word of this to aunt xue , she turned pale with alarm
1	i know a young man who is neither an actor nor a scholar , but a taoist priest
1	they say magistrate wang was their gobetween , and the wedding has been fixed for the third of next month
1	xifeng also instructed lai wang , get him to implicate you , then you can confront him in court i ’ ll tell you just what to say and i guarantee everything will be all right
1	now though the loss of his jade had deranged baoyu , the news that he was to marry daiyu seemed to him the most wonderful thing that had ever happened , and at once his health had improved , though he seemed less quick in the uptake than before
1	can you , roaming through boundless space ,
1	today she just happened to fly into a temper
1	now he ’ s been upgraded and is leaving
1	i can ’ t raise enough as a scrivener
1	how can someone your age give way to such foolish fancies just because of a little illness ?
1	we still have some of those preserves from the south , don ’ t we ?
1	that 's how i knew you
1	but in cases like this , the established procedure has always been to consider the local verdict as castiron evidence
1	he took two turnings and climbed some more steps which brought him to a wide flat road
1	but qingwen ordered someone to fetch nanny song and when she arrived informed her , master bao has told me to tell you that zhuier ’ s too lazy
1	if there ’ s no way of finding out the date , you can easily ascribe this tale to some time in the han or tang dynasty
1	it was not a passer-by either , granny liu chortled
1	you must not fall asleep again , she said
1	he spluttered , trembling from head to foot
1	flowers drift away on the stream
1	every day i spend with my cousins is all to the good , he answered
1	he turned to the woman with big feet
1	most likely only the two or three of us will remain together till our dying day
1	he bade his family prepare a feast , and invited tu shao−ching
1	it was cancelled years ago
1	with a cry she threw up all the medicine she had just taken , and was racked by such dry coughing that her stomach burned and it seemed her lungs would burst
1	it 's not like you to be so suspicious and unkind
1	you can get your maids to prepare some every day
1	her eyes sparkled with tears , her breath was soft and faint
1	the prefect is not a friend of yours
1	the next moment she heard a soft thud
1	just then the monks , hearing footsteps , winked to the abbot to stop talking
1	i ’ ve some very tender pheasant ready
1	it 's time to change the subject
1	daiyu too had been worried on baoyu 's behalf when she heard that he had not come back all day after being sent for by his father
1	numskull turned pale with fright
1	i ’ m impatient but they ’ re slow coaches !
1	my sister-in-law says she gave you some silver the other day to keep for her , madam , said jia lian
1	lady xing made no further objection then
1	my father is still feasting , he said
1	she could not help shedding tears
1	contented and very dutiful to my mother too , ten times better than her real daughter-in-law ever was
1	when i was a youngster , he admitted
1	at soochow feng paid the fare , and they changed for a junk to hangchow which was half as large again as the nanking boat
1	at new year you should burn more incense before buddha !
1	since this made sense , baoyu put down the wine and asked to have it warmed
1	one of them , spotting her , ran over and xiren saw it was chuyao
1	when they arrived , after the usual polite conversation they sat down to a feast in the room overlooking the river
1	it was baochai who begged jingui to be reasonable
1	the next day daiyu rose early , and instead of calling her maids sat there alone lost in thought
1	then if i get given face you can bully people outside , calling yourselves relatives of the ha family ; if i lose face and land in trouble , you turtles can shrink back into your shells and leave me to my fate
1	as baoyu and jia lan were talking , yinger brought them tea and jia lan stood up to take it
1	jia zhen and jia lian flushed red , not venturing to answer more than yes , sir
1	baoyu makes extravagant answers
1	she 's not here for anything special
1	the next morning , after paying the bill , hsiao saw kuo six or seven miles to a cross−road , and there with tears they parted
1	one day he declined an invitation to a feast from
1	presently the feast was served and they took their seats at the table
1	sleepless at night when wind and rain lash gauze windows ,
1	the porter , who had eaten too , put the manuscripts in his empty basket and shouldered this load back to town
1	besides , as he ’ s so busy , why have a party ?
1	we heard that he knocked down one of the thieves too
1	you can ’ t fool around here the way you did outside
1	pu , point it out to her
1	although we ’ ve lost our parents we ’ re living in luxury , yet we have a lot to upset us
1	when he reached tu 's house , his arrival was announced by the gate−keeper
1	may the new year bring you great happiness and good fortune , wealth , nobility and peace
1	suppose he agreed to what you proposed and got money from us after the case was settled , of course that would be that for the time being
1	in any case , we have too many maids
1	just now i was afraid you might say something tactless and set our mistress weeping again : that 's why i hustled you out
1	then , sick as he was , pao wen−ching went out to buy a house and two sets of theatrical costumes which he hired out to two companies
1	when he had inspected these and supervised the arrangement of the sacrificial vessels , he changed into his slippers , draped a big raccoon cloak over his shoulders , and made the servants spread a large wolfskin rug at the top of the steps by the pillars so that he could sit in the sun watching his junior clansmen collect their gifts
1	and lady wang , who liked peace and quiet , returned too after her mother-in-law ’ s departure
1	the others approved this as more original
1	marvelling at her presence there , he was again about to question the monk when the latter pulled him through the archway
1	you must try again some other day when you have time
1	i ’ m starting to beat the drum , ’ she warned
1	over this he wore a turquoise fringed coat of japanese satin with a raised pattern of flowers in eight bunches
1	no , i ’ m not partial , the old lady declared
1	now baoyu , the only one of the three young men to have stayed with his grandmother , described how the prince had entertained him and displayed the jade given him
1	siqi ’ s mother sobbed bitterly then with remorse
1	she ’ s got herself some plum-blossom as well
1	'what 's yours is mine , and all that 's mine is yours
1	dear nanny , he coaxed , just two more cups -- - that ’ s all
1	how did you happen to hear ?
1	it 's that fellow who asks for me each single time
1	he decided that the cedar-boards he had seen would not do for the coffin and was searching for something better when xue pan called to offer condolences
1	so lady wang left first with lady xing , while xifeng retired to a small three-roomed annex to reflect as follows :
1	separate lists were made of all the furnishings and the mansions conferred on the duke of rongguo
1	he swears i ’ ll never escape him , not even if i marry someone outside , no , not even if i go to the ends of the earth he ’ ll have his revenge in the end
1	who ’ s not doing it for fun ?
1	then general tortoise at yuandi 's feet stood up to say , 'you fellows are useless , but i have a plan
1	then why do you want to leave them now ?
1	having given these orders , he hoisted one foot on to the bench , and started massaging the small of his back with his fists , saying , i envy you farmers these days
1	his father nodded with a faint smile amid another chorus of approval
1	since zhen yingjia was so struck by baoyu , he did not ask about bao yong but kept exclaiming truly extraordinary !
1	what is this place ?
1	i have heard say that the cow was not his father at all
1	his thoughts wandering in this foolish way , he went back to his room and got hold of xiren to explain the situation
1	finally , the altar having been cleared , they offered up thanks to the heavenly generals
1	next she rummaged in her waistband for a while and fished out twelve paper figures -- two of human beings and ten of devil~ with white hair and blue faces -- which she gave to the concubine
1	so let ’ s take this chance to find fault with some of the older and more obstreperous ones , and send them home to get married
1	so merely taking you on wouldn ’ t count as too many
1	you ’ d better go right away , miss
1	i know the old abbot too , whom you saved just now
1	you do not know how i feel , miss , said xiren
1	i ’ d marry another who might be just as bad
1	just wait for them here
1	with that he gave a long sigh and breathed his last
1	liu xianglian ran riot after a bout of drinking , but now that he ’ s sobered up he ’ s filled with remorse
1	after this he collected all the other essays and took them away with him
1	chou chin made a mental note of this before sealing up their doors
1	she stuffed the pouch into her sleeve to conceal it from them , wondering where it could have come from , then hiding her consternation went on to see yingchun
1	you take such things too seriously , said aunt xue
1	instead of the feast and bath they had expected , the yu brothers spent a long time as mediators , then took their leave of their host
1	xiaohong burst out laughing
1	be sure to go in good time tomorrow
1	lady xing feeling wronged puts xifeng
1	the ladies ' trinkets were looted by the officers and runners and they were shut up in an empty room !
1	my mistress had the same idea , but she could hardly suggest it with all you young ladies living in the garden
1	there 's no need to go in , said pao when they reached their gate
1	you , who were once a patron , are reduced to making a living by your pen
1	my patron asked me to look out for hsun mei in wenshang county ; but i have done nothing about it !
1	so ascends ’ is derived from dawdles up , ’ she said
1	the only people there were members of jia zheng 's household , and she could not hold back her grief at the thought that both her husband and son had been arrested , her daughter-in-law was at death 's door , and her daughter was ill-treated by her husband , so that she had nowhere to turn
1	master is not at home and he wo not be back for some days
1	that would take three years
1	the next day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month , the festival of grain in ear
1	he turned to her be a good girl and tell him , will you , that the second master from the back lane has called
1	the old lady chuckled
1	when i was away you swindled us , forcing my daughter to flee , and now that they are bringing her back you bar the way !
1	as if i had time to bother about such things !
1	do you think it can be done ?
1	this is why the novel makes such a powerful attack on the paku essay and satirizes the scholars who try so desperately to become officials
1	at these words , pinger came out wiping her eyes
1	if a snake bites her , serve her right
1	my father-in-law and mother-in-law treat me as their own daughter
1	but i promise not to make trouble
1	just take a little tea from her and she starts ordering you about
1	this is that uncle of yours who came last year and said he would be back , said his wife , who had been watching from behind the screen
1	she asked in surprise
1	but how can we prevent such a calamity ?
1	spring is already here , shao−ching , he said , as they were sitting under the plum tree
1	later , when he blew out the light and lay down to sleep , she went back , very disappointed , to tell jingui and see what she would do
1	she looks completely natural
1	besides , this jade may be treasured here but to outsiders not in the know it ’ s quite useless , so why should anyone steal it ?
1	amid suppressed laughter , second sister was pushed forward and subjected to a carefully scrutiny
1	i dodged out of sight , and then yuanyang came along too
1	second sister looked so pathetic when she called that they sympathized with her , and when they were talking alone she would shed tears , but she never breathed a word against xifeng who had shown her nothing of her vicious side
1	now as this was just after the mid-autumn sacrifices , nuns from various nunneries had come to present sacrificial offerings , and lady wang had kept abbess zhitong of water moon convent and abbess yuanxin of ksitigarbha nunnery to stay for a couple of days
1	picking up his shoulder pole he led the two messengers into the house , while the headman advised the other man to make off
1	if she found out and relieved me of the job so as not to embarrass me , then i ’ d really lose face
1	daiyu got up slowly then and with a smile invited him to sit down
1	she decided not to tell qiaojie this but to make certain inquiries , which she did by discreetly questioning the maids and serving-women under her , who told her everything they had heard outside
1	no outsiders knew what went on in his house , so how could his mother be so well informed ?
1	just then , a maid announced xiren 's sister-in-law , from whom lady wang elicited that some relatives had proposed a match for xiren with a
1	mrs zhou hurried out to see who it was while granny liu hastened forward crying , sister zhou !
1	first she went to the lady dowager ’ s reception room to pay her respects as a grand-daughter of the house ; but before she could do so her grandmother and the others knelt to prevent her
1	some whiteness from the pear-blossom is stolen ,
1	we hurried off to investigate ; but it 's not true
1	and would you believe it , this so moved the goddess of mercy that she appeared to her one night in a dream
1	when both refused to go she grew quite frantic
1	we ’ ll keep it for the time being , jia zheng conceded
1	my young lady 's dying !
1	a young maid by the door of the inner room at sight of her announced , here ’ s madam zhu !
1	after the midday meal he felt drowsy
1	before she could start a new couplet , daiyu put in :
1	i have my own people outside
1	we know your way of talking , madam , they said
1	who could think it a bad match in any respect ?
1	finding him out , she looked through the books on his desk and discovered the passage in zhuang zi which he had been reading the previous evening
1	what ’ s to be done then ?
1	he 's not at home just now
1	just tell me the symptoms of this malady
1	that 's why she drowned herself in a fit of passion
1	what a thing to say !
1	if you will allow me to accompany your carriage there , we can talk in the inn
1	____________________ chu yuan−chang , the first emperor of the ming dynasty , is alsosometimes called emperor hung wu
1	so i told her
1	as the proverb says : we learn from experience
1	i did ask him just now
1	they agreed to keep this to themselves and feign ignorance of miaoyu 's kidnapping , not taking any action till the return of the masters and mistresses
1	when i changed just now in such a hurry , i took it off and put it on the small table on the kang instead of wearing it
1	luckily for him , dr yu was examiner that day , with another official to help him invigilate
1	or : the fourth mr peng has written me a letter from peking
1	this fellow ling must be asking us to a meal too , said yu yu−ta
1	now that you have become a gentleman , went on butcher hu , you must do things in proper style
1	why is not he back yet ?
1	you have no right to stop me from going in !
1	who will pity me pining away for the yellow flowers ?
1	besides , unknown to her , the old lady long ago decided on one of the girls in our garden
1	after some time he found some dry shoes and socks to change into ; but when the priest came to ask whether he had eaten , he did not like to admit that he had not ; so he said he had , and went hungry the better half of a day
1	i don ’ t see how you can condemn them so sweepingly
1	i ’ ll see to the incense myself
1	there are forty rolls of serpent-patterned brocade , a hundred and twenty rolls of coloured silk and satin and a hundred and twenty garments for all four seasons
1	she repeated at last
1	when the tea was drunk , the general took his leave , and the other two escorted him to his chair
1	the passersby commented appreciatively that no other family but the jias could afford to put on such a lively entertainment
1	zijuan is one of our household ; so -naturally she needn ’ t bring her
1	after breakfasting they began to stroll outside
1	get her to make sure your second aunt agress before we make any decision
1	i mean to call on him tomorrow , said dr yu
1	if you make another rum-pus , i will wash my hands of you
1	thirty or forty miles from chengtu , the abbot left his inn early one morning to go out and enjoy the scenery , and walked into a tea−house for some tea
1	luckily the partition stopped her from slipping to the ground
1	it ’ s because he ’ s lost it that he ’ s out of his mind
1	if so , you are crazy
1	he was panic−stricken , and thought , both complaints are true , and if i have to appear in court i shall lose face
1	jingui was too amorous to live without a man and had long been hankering after xue ke , but hers was a case of beggars ca not be choosers
1	she called two old nurses and ordered them to take baoyu there and see that he was not frightened
1	she hurriedly took off her finery and sent a steward to mysterious truth temple to have all the taoist priests there locked up until her husband came back to question them
1	even the sage confucius learned from the musician xiang , and as soon as he played a piece he realized that this was king wen ’ s music
1	the old lady 's just feeling a bit easier in her mind , yet here you are starting fresh trouble
1	jia zhen had to drag the boy over
1	slap twenty-three this year and not yet married
1	don ’ t you call that extraordinary ?
1	when this was reported to jia zheng the others laughed and remarked , what a queer , stubborn boy
1	tonggui was smart enough to call out , madam , here ’ s the old lady to see you !
1	when at last his household arrived in four boats , which moored by the riverside house , tu took leave of the lu family and moved to his new quarters
1	it ’ s lucky you ’ ve come
1	most of the company paid no attention ; but baoyu , understanding , lowered his head while caiyun , having a guilty conscience , blushed
1	why do not you find yourself a riverside house , sir ?
1	the maids at once took it and put it in the vase , while all the others expressed their appreciation
1	you know , madam , what master bao is like and how he enjoys amusing himself with us girls
1	how could you take him to the garden today , with him just over his illness ?
1	i haven ’ t told qingwen because she ’ s as hot-tempered as crackling charcoal
1	niu pu dared not refuse , and that evening niu yu−fu bought a chicken and wine for a farewell dinner upstairs
1	while merry-makers , feasting , toast the snow
1	the servant handed the silver to tu 's boy , and went in
1	it was truly a world of crystal and precious stones !
1	she marched over to open the chest containing provisions , and sure enough found a dozen eggs in it
1	i seldom drink it
1	after several more stages , the two brothers disembarked and continued by road to chenyuan prefecture , where they sent whiskers yiu on ahead to announce their arrival , and followed him to their father 's yamen
1	you live so far away , she said , in hot or cold weather you may find the journey too much
1	so another batch of amorous sinners are bent on making trouble by reincarnation , commented the taoist
1	a rich house , all its members at peace ,
1	in joy , yu treated them to a meal , then sent them off with a tip
1	baochai looked up and rose swiftly to her feet , saying , ever so much better , thank you for your kind concern
1	let 's go first to the different quarters to have a look
1	which mr chi was that ?
1	that ’ s even truer of us
1	he kept the courier to a meal , presented him with several taels for the road and the messenger with another two taels , then dismissed them
1	conscious of his gaffe , baoyu tried to cover it up
1	i am ready to go with them !
1	as she alighted she saw before her a clear waterway winding like a dragon
1	i don ’ t want that tiara
1	can they count on remaining rich all their lives ?
1	that ’ s how someone with education and good manners ought to behave
1	she was advising you for your own good , yet you keep taunting her
1	when their plans were made and she was ready to leave , madam you returned yuanyang ’ s two taels with the explanation :
1	and don ’ t let anyone spread foolish talk about this being a miracle
1	just then her young maid zhener appeared
1	if there ’ s anything i overlook , come and let me know before the old lady asks and i ’ m stumped for an answer
1	take it easy till the old lady ’ s in a good mood , then you can tell her about it and ask to have qingwen back
1	he 's been up a long time
1	fastening his clothes again he sat down by the lamp to think hard , then picked up a sweetmeat and scrutinized it intently
1	so he said , i have long known of your talents
1	siqi said , a woman can only marry once
1	lady xing had always considered xifeng extravagant and jia lian unreliable and would therefore not let any money out of her hands
1	what a fright you gave me !
1	as the day of the funeral approached , a thousand and one affairs kept xifeng so busy that she had no time to eat and was hardly able to have a moment ’ s rest
1	hsiao yun−hsien enjoys the snow on kwangwu mountain
1	the ning mansion ’ s main gate was thrown open , as were the ceremonial gate , the doors of the great hall , the lobby and the inner hall , the three inner gates , the inner central gate and the inner secondary gate-all the gates leading to the main hall
1	good sister , don ’ t worry , he cried
1	you must make good , child ! she exhorted him
1	when jia lian came home and observed xifeng ’ s irreproachable behaviour to second sister , he did not give the matter a second thought
1	we ’ re to hire instructors , buy girl actresses and musical instruments and costumes there
1	as a matter of fact , i ’ ve thought of a chance for you
1	for if this came to the ears of the old lady and lady wang , how angry they ’ d be !
1	we are going to look at the poems now , announced li wan
1	she announced , before drinking , the loser must quote one line from a classical essay , one from an old poem , one domino ’ s name , one name of a melody , and one line from the almanac
1	why should we eat here with these dolts ?
1	do not be cross , granny , she begged with a smile
1	was not there talk some years ago of an affair between her and their master bao ?
1	she struggled out of bed and opened her case , from which she took a piece of gold of a fair size
1	chu saw that prefect wang appeared to hesitate
1	with that she hurried home with her two maids
1	by cutting down like this in all our apartments we ’ d save a good deal of money and grain every year
1	but even so , they should have let me see her and clear myself -then she would not have died with such a sense of grievance !
1	baoyu clasped his friend ’ s hands and asked through tears , what last message have you for me ?
1	to him a murder charge was just a trifle which could easily be settled with some filthy lucre
1	but jingui , delighted to have her mother-in-law take her side , behaved still more arrogantly in her gratification at this and out-manoeuvred him by simply ignoring him
1	she caught hold of her , begging :
1	those on which the standard rates are charged are to be returned to you , together with your title-deeds
1	none the less , he sent servants to make ready one of his own houses for when he decided to move
1	you are crying for nothing
1	whoever these spirits may be , thought ma chun−shang , i doubt if they determine official careers
1	the rogue craned his neck , daring our master to hit him
1	he hurried off to the main hall , returning presently with a talisman on a tray covered with a red silk sutra wrapper with a dragon design
1	aunt xue nearly choked , trembling with anger
1	but he simply glared at the officer and refused to kneel
1	do not you realize , brother , said wang jen , it 's because last year he passed candidates who wrote essays in an out−moded style ?
1	how can you turn him out ?
1	i want to make it up to you all by giving you another day of fun
1	it ’ s too bad she has no chance to show her kindness
1	since they are doing this of their own free will i will accept whatever they bring , but it wo not make any difference to my decision
1	he flew into such a frenzy , he nearly turned the whole household upside down !
1	she read it through , found it satisfactory , and gave orders that the presents should be distributed
1	lingguan must have taken a fancy to something and he 's out trying to procure it for her
1	she had them brought to her and on closer inspection found them even sweeter
1	when he had gone , ting−hsi consulted with his wife
1	how is baoyu today ?
1	where is xinger now ?
1	i am attached to master bao 's apartments
1	jia zheng was astounded
1	soup was carried in from the kitchen with a big dish of dumplings and a plate of fried cakes
1	then attendants served tea which they drank
1	but let it be as your majesty pleases
1	i just want you to understand
1	the day that spring takes wing and beauty fades
1	but if you adopt him and have the trouble of bringing him up , i sha not take any money from you
1	then you ’ d better go to bed early
1	but to know who it was , you must read the next chapter
1	do your parents mind what friends you make ?
1	meanwhile xifeng had summoned two old nannies from baoyu ’ s quarters
1	a young man in his teens who passed was considered senior to an unsuccessful candidate , even if the latter were eighty years old
1	when relatives ask her out , she should wear it to look different from the common herd
1	keep what i ’ ve told you in mind !
1	but do not be so upset
1	a few days after his return , ting−hsi took the letter to number one scholar 's square for chi tien−yi
1	is it su jo−lan ?
1	all right , i under-stand
1	are they paid in full every month ?
1	next , she heard what sounded like a man 's footsteps and a window being opened
1	these few are all we ’ ve got left for making sauce with
1	next one , said yuanyang
1	but i am afraid , though they wo not say so , they will secretly resent the fact that now i have she broke off at this point blushing
1	he bought pork each day with the proceeds from his fortune−telling , and when he had eaten his fill he would sit at his table by literary virtue bridge reading poetry
1	daiyu after reading these lines was plunged in grief
1	meanwhile , hiding her resentment , she went on tormenting xiangling
1	who 's going to abuse you ?
1	the following day the youth came in again , and when he had done so for four or five days the monk could restrain his curiosity no longer
1	then we ’ ll choose a day for the wedding , not engaging musicians but following the example of-the palace , fetching the bride over in a sedan-chair with eight bearers and twelve pairs of lanterns
1	i never thought she ’ d come here at this time or that , having come , the old lady would take such a fancy to her
1	to write a poem
1	you and i are of the same rank
1	there were also associate examiners who helped to look through the essays , and some of the chief local officials served as invigilators
1	since , according to the portent , tigers appear at dusk , she must have been taken ill in the evening
1	what do you say ?
1	when he did not answer , she repeated the question
1	after father and sons had left , she was thinking of going over to see the old lady when the foster-mothers of fangguan , ouguan and ruiguan were announced
1	after my death , i beg you to watch over your nephew as he grows up
1	then he asked what had become of pieh chuang−yen , the miao chieftain , and feng chun−jui
1	she said , 'she 's come all that way with a load of things ; let her spend the night here and go back tomorrow
1	what an odd thing to say !
1	though xifeng forced hersejf to crack a joke or two , she was less witty and amusing than before ; but the old lady egged her on , in the hope of diverting baochai
1	so that ’ s the reason
1	a few strings of cash may not be much , but it was a rare honour
1	you ’ d have done better to show me in the first place
1	but pin−niang was born unlucky—her old trouble has started again
1	upon entering the hall , he wanted to pay his respects before the shrine of his former tutor ; but the two brothers declined again and again
1	when kuang chao−jen heard this , he sighed to himself as he thought : so rich men are unfilial sons ; but a poor man like myself who wants to be a good son ca not
1	just across the river is ko lai−kuan 's house
1	as yingchun lives on purple caltrop isle , let her be mistress of caltrop isle , suggested baochai
1	they strolled round the garden of concentrated fragrance and were served first with tea then wine ; but it was simply an informal gathering of the womenfolk of both houses for a family feast , with nothing of special interest to record
1	baoyu , not yet fully recovered , was the only one not to go
1	it was nothing worth mentioning
1	all is ready for you to look over , sir , he announced
1	i should hope not , indeed !
1	all you need do is tell mr chin to give you the five hundred taels to deposit in a pawnshop , just paying me thirty taels first for minor expenses
1	then the two men went away
1	children wo not give me a moment 's peace !
1	if not for this hill , observed jia zheng , one would see the whole garden as soon as one entered , and how tame that would be
1	but remarry as soon as he ’ s dead
1	yes , we ’ d forgotten them , chuckled the lady dowager
1	if you had not asked me today , i could not very well have told you
1	this was too much for lovely , and they started bickering from their respective places
1	but that only made mrs xia and her son set up a still greater clamour
1	as for our master bao , sir , that ’ s a strange story
1	xiren frantically clapped her hand over his mouth
1	and i ’ ll bring it up again in a couple of days
1	why not come with me to enjoy the strange sights here instead of puzzling your head over these silly riddles ?
1	he has no sense of what ’ s fitting either
1	so suppose we sit up together to enjoy these sweetmeats and wine that i ’ ve brought with me ?
1	they veiled my virtue , by their envy urged
1	during the first interval , from his seat at the head of the hall he watched this candidate in the linen gown come up to hand in his paper
1	he 's an official in the provincial governor 's yamen at soochow , with a salary of a thousand taels of silver a year
1	at the close of this song shiyin stepped forward
1	some squeezed inside while the others packed
1	in my own case , if i had any luck i should die now with all of you around me ; still better if your tears for me were to become a great stream and float my corpse away to some quiet spot deserted even by crows or any other birds , to vanish with the wind , never again to be born as a human being
1	arrange two matches for them
1	he saw jasper lutes , rare bronze tripods , ancient paintings , new volumes of verse nothing was lacking
1	bring her some snuff , baoyu told sheyue
1	how much more so in our case ?
1	on his return he said to the old man : we have treated you very shabbily , uncle , giving you such a poor meal
1	then baoyu reined to a halt and turned to ask :
1	the most famous physicians and the most fabulous drugs were of no use at all
1	we not only do not need a middleman , there 's no need for a written agreement
1	let ’ s see how he proceeds now to the fourth mistress
1	just send a boy tomorrow to ask doctor wang for some medicine , and that will set me right
1	it is certainly very strange , replied feng
1	that would have cost more , he said
1	as long as this is kept from her , we ’ re all right
1	still nothing proved of any use
1	now you ’ ve forgotten and say we ’ ve kept it
1	well , you are not a scholar anyway
1	li wen named the melody two scholars go to peach-blossom stream , and li wan who was next to her quoted :
1	just listen to him !
1	this had nothing to do with me
1	as for the maids , some doubled up in hysterics , others sneaked outside to squat down in a fit of giggles , yet others controlled themselves sufficiently to fetch clean clothes for their young mistresses
1	why carry on like this ?
1	she has no sense of dignity and is too gullible
1	then , unable to bring himself to it , he could only rage for a while
1	i made qiuwen go for her meal , and just now pinger called sheyue out to have a word with her
1	well , i sha not question you now
1	when i came round , i remember seeing a shaft of golden light in the hall which shone on to my bed
1	give it to me , or i ’ ll break your arm
1	as they entered they heard crying inside the house , but soon this stopped and a meal was served
1	why do not you teach that spiteful brat of yours to behave himself ?
1	sixth master also invariably referred to his cousins as first master and second master
1	he grasped at once what was wanted and hurried into town to get the chief secretary to write a letter in jia lian ’ s name , and set off with it that same night for changan county
1	but you must find it dull sitting here
1	xianglian stepped forward to have a look at him and , knowing the oaf to be unused to beatings , gave him only a few light punches in the face which instantly turned all the colours of a fruit stall
1	wang , he said , our young master is very ill , and the young mistress asked me to invite you over
1	if you were to go on like this till you had no achievements to your credit and your reputation was damaged , you could accuse me of disloyalty for not putting the facts before you
1	the sound in the courtyard made them wake with a start and prick up their ears , but nothing more could they hear
1	emboldened by this , qiutong went to second sister ’ s window to scream abuse at her , making her feel even more wretched
1	dismounting , they led their horses behind the screens , then stood to attention , their faces turned towards the west
1	this is your brother ’ s share
1	not knowing what had happened , fan chin 's mother had hidden herself in the house for fear
1	i believe your name is wei , sir , he said
1	'he felt he had to thank me ; but if i would acknowledged helping him , he would have had no face left
1	one day he went out of the city to check on the acreage of arable land , and passing through the county of esoteric understanding he reached the ford in the stream of rapid reversal
1	if it 's green crickets you want , our village is swarming with them , but you never go there
1	laughing and talking all the way , chin and feng soon reached nanking and went to their homes
1	i did not want to tie up xiangling , aunt xue told him
1	he found the bawd just inside the gate , threading cassia into balls with a flower−seller
1	with that she settled down for a nap , and the rest of the party dispersed
1	this silver is your fee as scribe
1	it ’ s quite simple really
1	when fenger explained xifeng 's inability to entertain the guests , lady xing suspected her of shamming and shirking , but did not like to say this in the presence of so many relatives
1	i remember now , xiren said she was going to the pool at noon to wash some clothes
1	there 's a very good diviner here from the south , a man called mao banxian
1	she ’ s going to question madam lian as well
1	li wan said , that sounds easy
1	not finding much of interest here , ma chun−shang got up and walked nearly a mile further
1	tsang chi kowtowed as well
1	what the devil 's your hurry ?
1	they all laughed heartily
1	with no answer but a smile he left with qin zhong
1	if you refuse it , i shall think you ’ re offended
1	this is what we mean by not letting the words interfere with the sense
1	baoyu had to rack his brains and then declaimed :
1	so that 's who it is
1	her four chief maids get one tael of silver a month , the others only a few hundred cash apiece
1	in a frenzy , jia lian asked who it was that had fetched that fellow hu and had the man beaten within an inch of his life
1	they throw their money away on other people
1	the next day chu wrapped up two taels of silver and took these with some ham and other delicacies to literary ocean bookshop to say goodbye , taking home two volumes of the newly published examination papers
1	she hastily put down her chopsticks and stooped to retrieve it
1	we still have to return him to his original place and record his experiences in the world , so that he wo not have descended there for nothing
1	after these reflections she turned to xiren with a smile
1	yes , sir , replied chih
1	is the old lady well ?
1	his wife was causing a fine commotion , moving furniture
1	i returned home at the end of winter the year before last and was sent to inspect some works , after which i served as grain commissioner of jiangxi until i was impeached and came back to the capital to my old post in the ministry of works
1	does not huan have his fair share of clothes , shoes and socks , not to mention a whole roomful of maids and servants ?
1	i ’ ve no new jokes , but i ’ ll just have to brazen it out
1	it 's not my place to speak ill of our mistress , but after one of her daughters was made an imperial consort she became too overbearing !
1	mist from the hills links the forests ’ greenery ;
1	the fact is , the manager here has engaged me for several months to select essays , and i have a few taels of silver as salary ; but i have to keep part of this for my own expenses
1	he is now in gaol pending a decision on his case from the provincial governor
1	of course he is
1	yes , an old family friend
1	it gives a lucid account of musical theory and clear instructions for playing
1	except xue pan , who shook his head
1	magistrate hsiang wanted to raise him up and to bow in return
1	his salary would be twelve taels of silver a year , and it was arranged that he should eat with the monk , whom he would pay two cents a day
1	li wan told them gaily , before we ’ ve got our club going , someone ’ s trying to wriggle out
1	and when it came to jia she ’ s turn , the manager caught sight of baoyu
1	it ’ s like fragrant osmanthus , observed daiyu
1	may i venture to ask your honourable district ?
1	we were looking just now in that small pavilion at the foot of the hill , and luckily the night-watchers were awake
1	as soon as they were alone , the old women started talking as they ambled along
1	we must have this out after i ’ ve won back my money
1	it would be another matter if our family couldn ’ t afford ginseng ; but your father and mother-in-law can easily give you two catties of ginseng a day , not to mention two drains
1	when we have finished our meal and the wind has shifted , i will give you ten taels
1	well then , go to their homes and fetch them , urged the maid
1	don ’ t be angry , your lordship !
1	though she was so weak that she felt the bed beneath her painfully hard , she stuck it out
1	otherwise it will look as if you ’ re still angry with xifeng
1	what an elder sister-in-law you are !
1	don ’ t tease him when he ’ s feeling low , she scolded
1	the bodhi tree is no tree , the mirror no mirror clear ;
1	baoyu , huan and lan , who had left the room first , stood respectfully outside the door until jia zheng had gone before returning to ask the guest to sit down
1	her husband walked up to her bed
1	he 's at the gate and has left his chair
1	i ’ ve come to see mr zhou who came with lady wang when she was married , she told them with a smile
1	chi wei−hsiao went inside , closed the door , wrote for some time , sealed up his paper carefully and inscribed a taoist magic formula on it
1	tsang 's second name is liao−chai , said tu
1	baoyu ’ s face lit up
1	dispassionately appraising xiuyan ’ s character and behaviour , she found her unlike both lady xing and her parents , being extremely gentle and lovable
1	too bad , though , that it 's rather late in the day so close to the examination !
1	there are such men in the world , true ; but since we have raised this problem we ca not admit the possibility , for then there ceases to be any problem
1	you are wrong there , mr chih , protested kao
1	baoyu promptly passed on this request to xifeng , who ordered a serving-woman to take some venison to the garden
1	day after day she urged ha huan to go and ask for her , but he was too shy to speak and not too attracted by caixia in any case
1	this upset lady wang even more
1	it was now dawn
1	kuang chao−jen was about to choose an auspicious day for his return to yuehching when ching lan−chiang called to see him and invited him out to a tavern
1	if you were a man , you could go out and right wrongs , teased daiyu
1	there ’ s nothing wrong with plagiarism provided it ’ s well done , countered the others
1	if you want to know who came out , read the next chapter
1	as she was bustling frantically about , a messenger suddenly arrived to announce : you ’ re to leave after serving the morning meal
1	tell me , third brother , he said , what made you so set on this salaried scholar 's rank ?
1	xiren hasn ’ t time to look after so many girls
1	so i brought your nephew here to ask for your help
1	to shield baoyu from his father ’ s displeasure lady wang said , it was the old lady ’ s idea
1	i couldn ’ t leave her before , especially not with my daughter-in-law so senseless
1	of course i do , but you took me by surprise
1	very well , they said
1	sending a hand-stove over from my quarters as if my hosts didn ’ t possess such a thing !
1	in the ning mansion
1	yucun summoned the plaintiff for questioning
1	striking the palms of both hands together she sneered :
1	one is already betrothed ; the other would be just right for your honourable son
1	did you hear that ?
1	opposing sides obey the self-same rule
1	the story-tellers rose to apologize
1	mr pao is twenty−three , and has no parents , no brothers , no children
1	baoyu clapped a hand over her mouth
1	i find poetry very easy , but with this i ’ m getting nowhere , he reflected as he sat there , his mind in a whirl
1	but there 's no one at home to see to things unless we rope in qiang and yun
1	there 's no need for tables either ; each of us can have a teapoy with a couple of dishes we fancy , as well as a ten-compartment box of titbits and a winepot apiece
1	well , now i ’ ve forgotten how to
1	that 's what i think , answered baochai
1	then they took their leave of xichun and went on to yingchun ’ s place
1	as the others thought of and called out the names of a dozen games , she put them down on separate slips of paper , which were roiled into spills and put in a vase
1	because he would been helped by both mansions , for fear of being accused of shielding them he gave them a vicious kick -that 's why they were raided
1	you helped a great many people in the past , but none of them come here now
1	only the other day , said yen
1	niu pu saw them out and had barely time to wish the old monk a safe journey before the horses galloped off with pounding hooves
1	not a workman but a waiter , li er replied
1	three or four days after this , his elder brother jumped into the river and was drowned ; but how can he blame me for that ?
1	of baoyu and xifeng
1	that little bitch isn ’ t cut out for such great fortune , nor are we for such good luck
1	not until prompted by xiren did he say yes
1	i thought he had already completed his studies and would soon pass the metropolitan examinations , she concluded
1	i heard say some scandal ’ s come to light and she wants to ask baoyu about it
1	not a single paper had been read to the end !
1	if you call that a poem , scoffed daiyu , i can write you a hundred
1	the twelve new songs called a dream of red mansions ’ , ordered disenchantment
1	if your girls are lucky enough to hit it off with these two young gentlemen , their fortunes are made
1	the best store of grain and dried fruits is to be found in the temple at the foot of this hill
1	you should not have come , protested the old lady
1	i ’ ve never seen anyone so clumsy !
1	i think it ’ s an excellent choice
1	then they all surged after mrs fang 's shrine into the temple
1	after that , without further delay , he went to the examination at the capital , and in this examination he won the third place
1	just now she sent me to happy red court to deliver something
1	a whole lot of robbers have come , all in boots and official caps they'er opening cases , overturning crates , ransacking the whole place '
1	it started that day when i quarrelled with you and called her in to wait on me
1	quite right , quite right , he cried
1	but i think if you sponsor it , madam , it should come off
1	if our mistress were to give away the whole house , i ’ d get no face from it
1	besides , to be logical , the second part should refer to what precedes it
1	that ’ s why the last generations never engaged a teacher from outside but just picked some elderly , fairly scholarly kinsman to run the family school
1	if it weren ’ t for that , she ’ d like some too
1	the runner withdrew to sit in the gate−house
1	his household isn ’ t too well regulated
1	ask the gentlemen in charge
1	goblets fly here and there as men carouse
1	the brothers gazed at each other in silent dismay , then ordered the pig 's head to be taken to the kitchen for the servants to eat
1	disturbed by these noises , she told zijuan to let down her bed-curtains
1	she gives others the best and you the cast-offs , yet you feel you have big face
1	'leave the withered lotus to hear the patter of rain
1	two serving-women had the portiere raised and two others ushered him in , while baoyu came out to greet him
1	lucky she who enjoys rank and riches in old age ;
1	i believe my grandmother and aunt had just come back from bowing to the ancestral portraits , and the old lady 's new red woollen cape was lying there
1	please sit down while i study this carefully , he said
1	but to know who he was , you must read the following chapter
1	'this is a bad sign !
1	after checking quickly through the list and asking lai sheng number wife a couple of questions , she went home in her carriage
1	what with one trouble after another here , we have forgotten about her marriage
1	granny liu assented readily and followed xiren out to the young maids ’ room where she was told to sit down
1	i alone , it seems , know your worth
1	i won ’ t mind his being offended if i say he ’ s still a baby
1	we can discuss it together
1	and now she ’ s got us into trouble too
1	this seems very strange
1	the rules of prosody are secondary , the main thing is to have original ideas
1	but i do not know how to say it , uncle
1	if anyone sneaks off without asking leave and isn ’ t on hand when called , holding up our business , you ’ re to beat him for me and drive him out forthwith !
1	for you she would do it for love , but not for me
1	the pennons shook like serpents in the wind
1	why make an exception in this case ?
1	but we are too poor to entertain you to a proper feast : we can only offer you a cup of watery wine
1	this had been going on for some time when one day , as luck would have it , jia dairu went home early on business , giving the boys a seven-character line to be matched with another and promising them a new lesson in the classics the next day
1	as he said this , he offered yu tea
1	carefully explain the passage and the gloss
1	then he called in all his subordinates to examine them about possible spoils , not allowing them to conceal anything , so that all squeeze should come to him ; and he checked on them every few days
1	only three fairy isles on the giant turtle ’ s back have left a name
1	chang has come time and again to get money : he is a confounded nuisance , he thought
1	her voice faltered here from distress and she burst out sobbing
1	it will take mr pao some time to notify everyone ; so we must allow a couple of weeks for that
1	they did not need any help
1	but poets will never tire of singing it ,
1	though i don ’ t understand music , it does sound too sad , baoyu agreed
1	lady xing being now reduced to tearful silence , lady wang swore at jia huan , concubine zhao was a bitch , and she left behind her a misbegotten scoundrel !
1	very well , i ’ ll give you until tomorrow
1	though miss tanchun ’ s an unmarried young lady , you ’ ve all misjudged her
1	i did not blame you
1	in addition to describing scholars who are eager to become officials , wu ching−tzu depicts many pseudo−scholars who are cheats and charlatans
1	when kuang chao−jen heard ching speak of all these scholars , he asked : i suppose you also know mr ma chunshang who compiles essays for literary expanse bookshop ?
1	before yuanyang could explain someone inside called out , the old lady ’ s woken !
1	then the troops concealed in the gully rose up together , their shouts reaching the skies
1	if there ’ s anything you want , tell zijuan to let me know
1	then , smiling , she said in a low voice , these two tunics and this skirt , four headscarfs and packet of embroidery silks are from me , granny
1	after a little reflection she went on :
1	he was beginning to be intensely irritated when the salt commissioners arrived , and after them the local salt gabelle officials , the prefect of yangchow and the magistrate of chiangtu county
1	the old lady thought back and chuckled
1	for fear it might not have stood up to the heavy rain this summer , i rode over on my own to have a look and , sure enough , found it slightly damaged
1	one came to make love , one to spy ;
1	one afternoon his grandfather , old mr niu , was sitting in the shop with no customers to serve when old pu who owned the rice shop next door dropped in for a chat
1	but even if he were here , he could not raise such a sum at a moment 's notice
1	in surprise he remarked , she ’ s so aloof and unconventional that she looks down on everybody
1	pity silly lads and plaintive maids hard put to
1	sagacious prince , risest thou not from sleep ?
1	that evening he opened the old monk 's room and slipped in
1	too bemused still to know who was speaking , he seized her hands
1	if you should find yourself short of funds on the ' way , sir , since you will be passing lai shangrong 's place you can enlist his help
1	i know all the paths in the wild miao settlements , he said
1	watch out for the fireworks outside , or you may get burnt by some of the sparks raining down
1	now that his turn had come to pay a forfeit , he also took paper and brush and wrote a four-lined verse which he handed to jia zheng
1	very soon the stranger returned
1	what are you still kneeling there for , you treacherous dog ?
1	you are making your way up , are not you ?
1	the circle , however , was only half complete , the other half being conspicuously vacant
1	she ’ s not very well
1	cried the lady dowager
1	from the marble balustrades on either bank lanterns of crystal and glass of every description shed a silvery light , clear as snow
1	they had not the stately splendour of the other mansion , yet nothing was lacking in the way of trees , plants or artificial rockeries
1	i have just come from auntie , she told him
1	wouldid not you hear him talk of the zhen family ?
1	most of his previous posts had been in the capital , and he thought all official tasks the same , for even when appointed as examiner outside he had had no dealings with the local administration
1	it was then already the first watch , so they all went back to their own rooms to rest
1	what were you doing in there just now ?
1	and since chih heng−shan and wu shu were close neighbours , he sent them notes inviting them over to meet his cousin
1	although already tipsy uncle xing did so , and the others went on carousing until they were all rather drunk
1	baochai , trying to console her , felt such a stab of anguish that she could not help sobbing too , while xiren was so prostrated with grief that qiuwen had to support her
1	when he had taken off his official robes and sat down in the same room as before , he asked pao wen−ching and his son to come in
1	when that old woman took his bowl to pour some for you , he said at once , i ’ ve dirtied that bowl ; you must wash it first
1	you are afraid your cousin lin may hear and be cross with me for singing baochai 's praises -- right ?
1	from what she overheard she realized that the match proposed had not been agreed to
1	are not you old mr zhen , sir ?
1	because master lian thought him an honest fellow he had him and his wife transferred here
1	his diagnosis was that her menstruation was irregular and some tonic would set her right
1	he can say i ’ ve been kept by the prince and will soon be back anyway
1	how did she seem ?
1	do take it back for her
1	and if he had time in the middle of the day , he went out to play chess with the neighbours
1	this thrashing on an empty stomach and kneeling in the wind to read essays completed the wretched youth ’ s misery after his freezing night
1	back in her own quarters , the old lady made lady wang sit down to supervise the rooms ’ arrangement
1	besides , think of all the trouble we had before things turned out well
1	xiangyun guessed that he was referring to her find
1	to try their luck
1	ting−hsi shed tears as he took the money , and a few days later moved into a room wang yu−chiu had cleared for him behind his shop
1	ignoring his sulkiness , baochai told sheyue and the other maids to keep an eye on him while she went to bed
1	and the curtains were let down too , so how can it have been a young gentleman ?
1	it ’ s not all that important , he said
1	it must be just like heaven !
1	stream and lonely hills glow with sunset at this hour
1	let 's hurry up and cook this venison
1	while they sipped the tea she had ordered , jia cong came in to greet baoyu
1	as a matter of fact , mr tu created a dangerous precedent , said chen
1	but as it is hard to describe all their secret thoughts , we shall have to content ourselves with recording their actions
1	her ladyship has been raking up ancient history , and i had to answer her questions one by one
1	if one of the maids there had found it and your girl cousins saw it , that would have been terrible !
1	now that the whole household knew that xiuyan was to marry aunt xue ’ s nephew , lady xing wanted to move her out of the garden
1	he asked with a grin
1	they ’ ve been debating it for half a year : one day it was to be the zhangs , next the lis , then the wangs
1	we ’ ll make it the seventh
1	lady wang had been scolding him , but at baochai 's entrance she stopped
1	why take a joke so seriously ?
1	then your father would not be so angry , and all my trouble would not have been in vain
1	she should be coming soon to say goodbye
1	i had no choice
1	once he has the means of doing so , he naturally becomes an opportunist
1	if you find the school cold , mind you put more on , because we shan ’ t be there to look after you
1	you got the same as miss xue , while miss lin and the three other young ladies were given fans and beads , nothing else
1	being a disrespectful lot , behind her back we all call her the sick beauty
1	what scent has the caltrop , pray ?
1	aunt xue then explained to xiangyun and daiyu what a pawn ticket was
1	after xifeng and baoyu reached home and had paid their greetings , baoyu told the lady dowager of qin zhong ’ s eagerness to attend their clan school , and the incentive it would be for him to have a friend and companion in his studies
1	if we were at my home i ’ d take a boat out
1	of course , i ’ m not all that fussy about my clothes , but what kindness has that woman ever done us ?
1	the peasant revolts and risings against the manchus of the early years of the ching dynasty had been suppressed
1	i don ’ t know what busybody went and reported this as if it was something of consequence , just to prove her loyalty
1	i was wearing it till you grew angry
1	let each family pay its share , and you will get the thing going
1	he was rather taken aback to find them performing operas like master ding finds his father , huang boyang deploys ghosts in a battle , monkey plays havoc in heaven and the patriarch jiang kills generals and deifies them
1	jia zheng read the next riddle :
1	not venturing to follow her , he stood there woodenly in a daze and sighed , what have i done wrong to make them all cut me like this ?
1	so i took it from her double-quick and gave her a piece of my mind , not knowing you ’ d hear
1	you can give more if you want
1	i ’ ll drink with you some other time
1	are these your lodgings ?
1	bring the silver in at once
1	the next day fan chin had to call on relatives and friends
1	unable to refuse , jia lian had to take his leave of jia zheng and set off
1	if we take his word for it and there ’ s worse trouble of this kind in future , how are we to control these servants ?
1	well , i have a fox-fur , but i don ’ t care for the way the fringe hangs and was meaning to have it altered , said xifeng
1	once your marriage is fixed , that ’ number be double happiness for you !
1	if we were writing a composition to speak for confucius , we should take exactly the line we are taking now the scholars ' ranks were filled with such brazen hypocrites
1	no , i shall just have to slave away myself
1	can you spare me a few odd pieces ?
1	what a pity i came too late to take part in that magnificent ceremony !
1	soon several dozen guests had gathered , but the last to arrive were three men in square caps accompanied by a taoist priest , whom nobody knew
1	panic-stricken lady wang could not tell whether it was genuine or not
1	if this is how the board 's handled it , master xue has got off lightly !
1	it has to be kept burning day and night
1	but i can ’ t do any more
1	yet you talk like this , making us feel quite embarrassed
1	what remained of the money was spent on household needs
1	then you ’ ll have two homes , uncle
1	please put in a good word for us , mr pao
1	keep him on , i say , madam , and give him a good beating to teach him a lesson
1	observed the physician after feeling his pulse
1	why do you ask ?
1	she grabbed all our family property and brought it over with her at the time of her marriage
1	within and without the city stand monasteries and temples with green tiles and crimson roofs
1	that 's right , approved the rest
1	as we happened to start with poems on begonia , why not call it begonia club ?
1	wang wanted to look at these
1	he used to live in a tutelary temple where he took a few pupils , and every year he prepared for the examinations
1	raising its head it saw in the moonlight a man perched on the tree ; then it hurled itself furiously at kuo
1	he went back dejectedly to his own quarters to brood in gloomy silence
1	he cast them a sidelong glance
1	why not just discuss it with cousin ke ?
1	i just wanted to be clear on that before leaving , sir
1	you are too modest , sir
1	though this pavilion is open on all sides , one does not feel the least bit chilly here
1	even if you ’ re bursting with anger , put up with it for a few days
1	but you mustn ’ t leave this place
1	so that ’ s who it is
1	he was on the point of going in when he heard yuanyang say with a sigh :
1	meanwhile li wan wrote :
1	jia qiang being too absorbed in lingguan to notice , it was left to the other girls to see him out
1	so it 's you , shao−ching !
1	the next morning he washed with soap , changed into new clothes and scented himself lavishly ; then , with chi weihsiao 's paper in his sleeve , went by sedan−chair to divine pleasure temple
1	he called repeatedly but could not find him and , reaching the gate , saw li gui barring the way , refusing the monk admission
1	suddenly a wind sprang up and the red paper was blown to the ground , revealing the words underneath on the placard
1	as he was speaking , a servant came in
1	baochai asked them merrily
1	that evening on niu pu 's return , the old man demanded an explanation ; but niu pu was unable to clear himself and simply mumbled some literary jargon with a great deal of other nonsense
1	they ’ re all more likely than me to have such things
1	the next morning they parted , lu setting off for nanking to await chuang 's return
1	tell her i ’ m back and her ladyship is here too
1	his mother , not believing him , sent the page to question the gateman
1	he had come to beg permission to take her home
1	the chief steward did not beat about the bush
1	she asked , laughing herself before embarking on it
1	i ’ ve another good subject for him , put in xiangyun quickly
1	if you find one or two of the buildings not too tame , please condescend to re-name them yourself , that would make us extremely happy
1	do go to bed , little ancestor !
1	although i longed to trace you , i feared that as a mundane , vulgar official i would never see your saintly countenance again
1	taking their leave of xichun , they left smartweed breeze cot and followed a winding path which took them near bamboo lodge
1	the ushers led dr yu back by the west to his place as master of sacrifice , then returned to their own positions
1	on his way home the wind was against him and he felt rather unwell ; and by evening he had a headache and high fever so that he had to go to bed
1	seems to me things can ’ t go on the way they are now
1	unless , of course , he has some miraculous means of shortening the distance
1	through seemingly casual incidents , the novel gives a most penetrating exposure of the government at that time
1	this said , he left
1	it took them a whole day to settle matters to their satisfaction
1	how am i to write it ?
1	i have not seen you for a long time , li number four , said pan
1	daiyu just shook her head
1	do not bring too many crabs , xifeng told the maids
1	she had another table set and more hot crabs brought for xiren , zijuan , siqi , shishu , ruhua , yinger and cuimo
1	may a thunderbolt strike me if i don ’ t !
1	every day she takes eight silver cents ' worth of medicine ; and she wo not eat meat , but insists on duck one day , fish the next , and soup made of water−cress and fresh bamboo shoots on the third ; while in between she must have orange comfits , dragons ' eyes and lotus seeds to nibble at
1	will you took after it for me ?
1	and when she grows up and has her own family , if anything untoward happens , her bad luck will turn into good all because of this happy coincidence ’ in her name
1	the old man sighed
1	i will take my leave of you tomorrow
1	i heard it was because master bao kept an actor from some prince 's mansion , and they came to ask his lordship to send him back
1	one day when he could not buy even bread , a man in a square cap and black gown came in and greeted him
1	please calm down , madam
1	people ’ s temperaments differ , and just at the start she ’ s bound to feel a bit awkward
1	in the ninth month at the beginning of the frost they will sacrifice to the flag — the emperor as commander−in−chief and my uncle as his second in command
1	number oz dioseorea from the huai region ( cooked )
1	then the other two took their leave and went off with their maids
1	i ’ ll slap their faces for them , and in a few days we ’ ll deal with them properly
1	but we must not waste time talking
1	baochai is quite right , he agreed
1	these two new arrivals were both remarkably handsome
1	this is a government court
1	after kowtowing they stood there at attention
1	thus reminded , lady wang remarked to xifeng , last time we went for a stroll with the old lady in the garden , i noticed a girl with a willowy waist , sloping shoulders and eyes and eyebrows rather like daiyu ’ s
1	now i must go to see your mother-in-law before hurrying back to tell the old lady how you are
1	the waiter brought them rice , a bowl of fried wheat gluten and a bowl of beancurd , and the three of them started to eat
1	my name is pao , admitted ting−hsi , much surprised
1	the bill came to six coppers—which meant that he could not leave the tea−shop !
1	in addition , twenty-four lengths of satin and a hundred strings of newly minted cash were allotted to the women-servants and maids in attendance on the lady dowager , lady wang and the girls
1	i sent those rings to you by the page you would dispatched
1	they greeted each other and sat down
1	at sight of the priest they cried , you ’ ve come just at the right time , father !
1	just now we were talking face to face but you wouldn ’ t stay , he pointed out
1	xifeng had their orders read out and pointed at two of the four items
1	the lantern-sign above it bore the words , smartweed bank and flowery harbour
1	he probably began writing the scholars during the first years of chien lung 's reign , when he was nearing forty , and completed it before he was fifty
1	how could last year ’ s rain-water be as light and pure as this ?
1	i see very little difference between prince ning 's rebellion and that of emperor yung lo , put in lou chan
1	i know one of the magistrates in the sian prefecture , a mr yiu , who used to be a colleague of dr yu of the imperial
1	tomorrow ’ s the first of the eleventh month , isn ’ t it ?
1	he sighs or mumbles to the moon and stars , and has so little spirit he even puts up with the tantrums of those pert girls
1	he was born in the country of great trees in the western paradise
1	you must not take offence , responded xifeng quickly
1	that evening they spread a feast to welcome him , and lodged him in the library
1	as a matter of fact , i do not know
1	that 's why i invited you all here today to celebrate my granddaughter-in-law 's birthday
1	after madam you had gone over to see tanchun off that day , as it was already dark and she did not want to take a carriage , she decided to walk through the side-gate which had been made in the garden to give access to the ning mansion
1	yes , said old chin
1	speak for yourself , said daiyu
1	pinger ’ s not like that , he assured her
1	is your brother 's name hu chen ?
1	what happened next is related in the following chapter
1	and when a coffin was brought and her body laid in it , he clasped it and lamented bitterly before finally leaving them
1	wang jen and wang teh clapped their hands and roared with laughter , drinking until after midnight when they were carried home
1	could she be the girl who was killed ?
1	we must have a good meal ready for my brother when he comes back , he said
1	the officers there , assurning that they were going out on official business , did not even challenge them
1	she turned to xiangyun
1	theirs is not as good as ours
1	daiyu helps her true love
1	are you upset because you ’ ll all feel lonely while i ’ m at school ?
1	you ’ re right to tick him off for blurting out whatever comes into his head
1	after a while , the fat man said , mr
1	i feel the greatest respect for you
1	how can i celebrate it now ?
1	we have not seen you doing any business in the market
1	looking round carefully , he observed that everything in the temple was undisturbed with no sign of anything amiss
1	amazed , they invited wang tai to a feast
1	in sleep the vision recedes with the flight of swans ,
1	the outer wall has crumbled and will have to be rebuilt and a new stairway will have to be made as well
1	continuing up the road , he reached a large and magnificent temple built to the guardian deity , and into this he marched to have a look round
1	so though the stories referred to in these two riddles are fictitious , they ’ re mentioned in ballads and operas , even in temple oracles
1	he went on watching as the girl went on writing , but she merely repeated the same character
1	although shantung is a northern province , its chief city was rich and populous , packed with buildings
1	after the three months of the spring , all flowers will fade and each will have to find his own way out
1	in that case , she suggested , let xueyan go instead
1	after this , on the pretext of illness he stopped calling on his mother , being actually afraid to face her , sending his wife and son instead to pay their respects every day
1	in raptures he was wafted as if by magic into the mirror , where he indulged with his beloved in the sport of cloud and rain , after which she saw him out
1	especially as she was the invalid , not aunty
1	she went into the inner room then to lie down , turning the problem over in her mind
1	i ’ m going to ask all you girls , as well as the maids you brought with you , to take off your clothes to be searched
1	and after that she beamed at daiyu — after his wedding they ’ ll fix up a match for you , miss
1	she looked at the dragon and serpent designs on the sheath which was studded with bright pearls and jewels , then drew out the two swords , identical in size , one engraved with the word duck , the other drake
1	in the corridor outside the portiere the male members of the clan also sat in due order
1	what spiritual understanding has it got ?
1	i know you ’ re straight
1	so the foolish youth lost himself in rapturous day-dreams
1	then tang chose the best singers among the women captives , made them comb up their hair , put on their embroidered clothes , and sing and dance barefoot in the main tent , while all the soldiers , horses and officers hid themselves in the gully
1	it may not fit that scale
1	qingwen ’ s on the mend , and going home like this she ’ ll be able to rest quietly for a few days
1	wang took his teacup from him , and stood up to ask : have you heard recently from your uncle ?
1	ma bowed in return
1	for the sake of our friendship these years , please do this for me !
1	xue pan himself would ride a large black mule from the family stable , in addition to which a horse was provided for him too
1	look at that ignoramus , ting !
1	only two mouthfuls of the soup the old lady sent
1	then some old serving-women fetched in from the pages at the inner gate the presents the young masters had received
1	the second of the eighth month that year would be the old lady ’ s eightieth birthday , and all their relatives and friends were bound to come to offer congratulations
1	just now our mistress insisted that if i were to bring back the clothes the way fenger did , she ’ d be really angry with me
1	our treasury is empty
1	they untied xiangling too and made her lie down in bed
1	cousin zhen ’ s wife isn ’ t too old either , and she often brings along peifeng and others ; so this could equally well belong to them
1	jia yucun concludes the dream
1	it was granny liu who started it
1	besides , my brother will soon be getting married
1	in that case , not only would i be wasting my breath but taking an outrageous liberty
1	lady wang pushed baoyu to her bedside and the old lady reaching out one hand from the quilt took his hand
1	baochai went with them to peony bower , a small three-frame hail in red fragrance farm , where all the ladies of the house including even madam you had assembled
1	so you ’ re up to monkey tricks again , little wretch !
1	when the page had assented and left , nanny li and xiren were summoned and instructed to tell baoyu this to reassure him
1	where is your uncle bao ?
1	kidnappers of this type make a point of stealing small girls
1	this is no time for you to cry , he said , seeing niu pu weeping too bitterly to speak
1	daiyu did not fall asleep till nearly dawn
1	i will give you a hundred taels to start training a company
1	actually , sir , if i were you i ’ d have nothing to do with this
1	when my term of office is up and i come home , we will do some serious drinking together
1	having reached this decision , she sent the eunuch xia shouzhong to the rong mansion with the order : baochai and the other young ladies are to live in the garden , which is not to be closed
1	he went into the shop and sat down , picked up a copy of his book and looked at it , then asked the price and how the work was selling
1	they savour the last watches of the night
1	why try to blackmail people before finding out the facts and seeing the corpse ?
1	at the foot of the stage stood twelve pages , still too young to let their hair grow
1	as this was a special occasion , the lady dowager was determined that xifeng should have a whole day of unalloyed pleasure
1	you should put on a gown
1	these last few days she 's been unwell or else lamenting her fate
1	sixth master and wang yi−an walked out
1	he 's only been thrown off his balance because sudden joy made him choke on his phlegm
1	they wo not stay longer than they have to , and i shall give you some incense money
1	we ’ re so stupid , they chuckled , there ’ s something else we ’ d like you to explain
1	but still there was no improvement
1	as the proverb says : there are golden mansions in study ; there are bushels of rice and beautiful women
1	jia lian , coming home in high spirits after drinking , had allowed himself to be caught off his guard so that when his wife burst in he was quite at a loss
1	ting−hsi accepted the silver , and offered his brother wine
1	the clack of the portiere alerted xiren , who came out from the inner room
1	it ’ s something very wicked
1	no ordinary pills bring any relief , but he gave us an exotic prescription from across the seas , together with a packet of aromatic powder he ’ d procured as adjuvant goodness knows where
1	just think , madam , how could a younger sister-in-law know that her elder brother-in-law was going to get a concubine ?
1	qingwen picked up a hand-mirror and stuck the patches on her temples herself
1	but all this study does not seem to be getting you anywhere , and a bad job is better than none
1	this was built in the time of the duke—my father
1	that 's not fair , cried xiangyun
1	i didn ’ t dare tell grandmother , but it kept me from sleeping all night
1	aunt xue dismissed the page and went straight to the jia mansion to tell lady wang of this and appeal to her husband
1	my worthless son does not deserve such high praise , rejoined jia zheng hurriedly with a courteous smile
1	white-haired , she still washed clothes beside the stream
1	why , in that case we old women ought to live in stables !
1	you stay with your uncle or aunt
1	accordingly she urged her to make a start
1	he then bowed to aunt xue and filled her cup as well
1	when have i ever done such a thing ?
1	it ’ s not a pregnancy , just congestion of the blood
1	before they could finish some nurses came along
1	do i have honey on my hands that you squabble even over a cup of tea ?
1	the man who walked in wore a tile−shaped cap , a raw silk gown and a silk girdle , had a grey beard and looked over fifty
1	about twelve miles beyond yenchow he stopped at a village called hsin family station for tea
1	having said this she laughed
1	the doctor summoned by jia zhen to attend her diagnosed a chill which had upset her digestion , making her delirious and subject to delusions
1	she unbuttoned her red jacket and drew out a bright gold necklace studded with glittering pearls and jewels
1	by now he was dressed and she urged him to pay his respects to his grandmother and parents
1	besides , you both come from such well−to−do families that even if your husband does not become an official you will lack for nothing as long as you live
1	you ’ ve capped my attempt , admitted daiyu
1	let them sing whatever they think best
1	the master and miss lin are escorting his coffin to suzhou and should be home about the end of the year
1	in the rong mansion , lai da posted extra night-watchmen and locked the two main gates so that the only way in or out was through the small west side gate ; and at sunset he had the ceremonial gate closed , allowing no entrance or exit
1	she ’ s made up her mind to kill you
1	asked where the old lady was , they returned evasive answers
1	he came to another big temple , with tables before it at which tea was served ; and since his legs were tired , he sat down again
1	he should have drowned himself in his own piss and died in place of his father , for what ’ s his life worth ?
1	well now , let me see what this is
1	you ’ ll have plenty of time to grouse about me later
1	listening to shao−ching 's conversation is like drinking elixir , said chih heng−shan
1	here you are at last
1	they lit benzoin incense to calm him and made him lie down
1	how can you change with someone else ?
1	since jia zheng never took much interest in such matters , he made no objection
1	she thought it was another slip of the tongue , but he sobbed :
1	if mr fang is there , why do not you join him ?
1	she ’ s taking a nap now
1	but when you close the book and think , the scene rises before your eyes , and you realize it would be impossible to choose any better words
1	then he went down on one knee in salute , saying , bao yong pays his respects , sir
1	the only one paying any attention was daiyu , who was nodding at him with a look of speculation in her eyes
1	this is mr feng cho−an , answered niu pu−yi
1	why don ’ t you pinch her lips ?
1	why pin the blame on this person or that ?
1	he added , tomorrow when i have time , i mean to write on all twelve themes
1	you live here but do not know the first thing about it !
1	butcher hu dived into his daughter 's room and dared not come out , while the neighbours scattered in all directions
1	by beating her you make me feel bad too
1	tomorrow i shall ask the old lady to take you back
1	at home , he found his father ill , unable to leave his bed
1	wrecked by red cliff , choking the stream ,
1	the lady dowager and others went in and took seats , after which daiyu with her own hands brought her grandmother a covered bowl of tea on a small tray
1	bring him to court again when he is a captain
1	do not worry about that , brother
1	jia zhen has a son called rong just turned sixteen
1	the wind is soughing , the days drawing in ,
1	what 's this crispy stuff ?
1	he carried their luggage into the cabin , and the two women sat down with chiung−chih
1	soon after his arrival , he set out in a high carriage drawn by four horses on a tour of inspection of the various stations
1	all questions connected with the funeral can be decided by these gentlemen
1	my name is also niu
1	when you reach home you must work even harder ; and if you come to see me before you go to the prefecture for the next examination , i shall help you with your travelling expenses
1	i do not think any peach blossom stream is needed
1	you ruin your health by worrying so much
1	but what you did was even worse than the others laughing and making comparisons
1	cutting him short , jia she instructed him , go and tell your aunt about this , but do not let the old lady know
1	asked how it had happened , she told the old lady
1	and while some maids were serving tea , hupo came in with a whispered message for the old lady , who turned to tell xifeng :
1	who dreamed of such loveliness in the world of men ?
1	what with the pain in her side and her vexation , xiren ate nothing that evening
1	i ’ ve only two requests to make
1	in all these , especially the two last , gods , ghosts , monsters and ogres took the stage among waving pennants , temple processions , invocations to buddha and offerings of incense , while the din of gonging , drumming and shouting carried to the street outside
1	but the coat ’ s on the drab side
1	as soon as she had gone , qingwen felt tempted to give her a scare for fun
1	wouldesperation drives men to rebel and a dog to jump over a wall
1	but perhaps we shall meet again some other day
1	let me congratulate you
1	xinger announced with a grin , tell the second mistress that madam lian is here
1	he did not even ask his son what he meant by playing about outside and exchanging gifts with actors , or by neglecting his studies at home and attempting to rape his mother 's maid
1	she sent for xifeng , told her the master 's decision , and asked her to see to things
1	mr chou was the teacher in mr ku 's house
1	kuiguan , who had played warriors , kept her hair shaved over her temples and forehead as that had made it easier to paint a warrior ’ s face , and she was nimble too
1	it is nothing but a literary diversion to entertain readers
1	after you left , your third uncle took a fancy to our house
1	qingwen noticed baoyu ’ s distraught look , the hectic flush on his cheeks and the sweat on his forehead
1	next the finance commissioner 's secretary kneels to invite the god of literature to preside over the hall , and his bodyguard — the star of successful candidates — to come to the hall to shed light
1	and now xiren arrived
1	it sounds neither like an account nor a list of presents
1	the envoy greeted him , and old chin invited him into his cottage to take a seat
1	it was bitterly cold , and he was trudging in the teeth of a north−west wind along a mountain path as hard and slippery as wax
1	but when concubine zhao heard of this , she flew into a rage and fumed that i was getting too many perks
1	i just ca not get over that monk !
1	i must count it here in your presence
1	then in due course she ’ ll be cured
1	though i turn my pockets inside out , the very most i can raise is ninety−two taels
1	she fell ill herself , and had to be carried home and put to bed
1	not daring to conceal the truth , the magistrate told him , it was painted by a peasant in one of the villages in my county
1	chu hsien−fu gave a start
1	going on in this way , little master , will only make him worse
1	he sent for jia lian
1	yang is very hard up : how can he entertain our young gentlemen ?
1	baoyu waved his hand saying , there 's no need for that
1	is not he sitting pretty as a magistrate ?
1	did she think the girl would have a bad time with me ?
1	if all of them move to our monastery , even if we built two extra wings we could not hold them all
1	lady wang concurred and urged yuanyang and others to open the chests at once and get out the old lady ’ s ceremonial costume
1	after suppressing her anger for just a month , she fall ill and lost her appetite
1	he asked the local runner
1	one of them , qian hua , who had not seen baoyu for some time , stepped forward and fell on one knee
1	baochai was so interested in the stomacher that she sat down without thinking in xiren 's place , unable to resist picking up the needle and going on embroidering the charming design
1	please go on with your game , he urged them
1	yet kai had no choice but to sell
1	having taken the silver , jia lian came out with some others and ordered men to buy wood for the coffin
1	after the harvest she sent them two piculs of rice apiece , two piculs of pickled vegetables and four hams , to say nothing of chickens , ducks and other delicacies
1	he entertained kuang to supper
1	one precious jade ’ and one gold locker ’ — how could you forget that , madam ?
1	the next day wang went to the college to thank mr yu
1	at home nowadays he just fools around with the children
1	i only wanted to offer some advice
1	struggling up to take off her robe , she told zijuan to tuck in her quilt and lay down again , but toss and turn as she might she could not sleep
1	these two men were sons of minister lou , a native of huchow who had served at court for more than twenty years and had sacrifices and posthumous titles decreed for him after his death
1	in those days he used to teach in the city and was employed as a tutor in the family of various yamen officials ; it was only later that he came to our village
1	that ’ s enough , said li wan
1	i am not fit to be sitting here with you anyway
1	in the evening the death−rattle sounded in his throat , and with a last gasp for breath he gave up the ghost
1	but since there was no money to buy a coffin and he was a good man , he hurried to his lodgings to fetch ten taels of silver for the funeral expenses
1	sweet spring water in golden basins her maids bring
1	he called for li gui then and told him , tomorrow morning beiming is to accompany baoyu to the family school , after first getting ready the books he needs and bringing them to show me
1	soon after this , a man came to the gate wearing a felt cap , blue cotton clothes and slippers with cloth soles and leather uppers
1	what have the two of you been up to now ?
1	tomorrow ’ s the sixteenth our club ought to hold another meeting
1	i wouldn ’ t be so demanding if i were you
1	as the saying goes : better a virtuous scholar than an unprincipled official
1	then the ginseng−seller rapped on the spirit screen
1	pinger had more or less guessed from their behaviour that they were looking over a prospective bride ; but in jia lian 's absence , with lady xing in charge , she could not find out which family they came from
1	you would better take it easy and wait for news
1	giggles broke out again
1	inquired chi , when he had ushered his visitor inside
1	this business is really too much for me
1	as to what to live on ourselves , we can worry about that later
1	our uncle sent a letter home from kaoyao saying how he missed crabs , but he could not get a single one there
1	sister zhou , see that they have all they want , said xifeng
1	go to the front , he ordered
1	kneeling before her ruhua sobbed , i dare not lie to you , madam
1	the shih was the ancient , classical verse form
1	one day as the stone was brooding over its fate , it saw approaching from the distance a buddhist monk and taoist priest , both of striking demeanour and distinguished appearance
1	never mind about that , old ancestress , xifeng chuckled
1	wo not you stay for the night ?
1	how can every girl be like your eldest sister , chosen as an imperial consort ?
1	so she stood for a while leaning against the doorway in a brown study , before stepping out to look at the bamboo shoots sprouting below the steps
1	it is quite a length
1	the lai family requested jia qiang and jia yun to beg lady wang to be kind enough to release him ; but jia qiang knew that this was out of the question and told them a day later that she had refused
1	this is not like a young lady 's chamber , she remarked
1	entering a tea−house , they ordered tea and a plate of yicheng dumplings
1	now they won ’ t be able to sail away , he laughed
1	please go right away , mrs lin , to tell madam lian what the fortune-teller says , and report it to her ladyship too so that she can stop worrying
1	he had to step forward to greet the newcomers
1	magistrate hsiang then called the doctor
1	then , hearing that it could be found in a pawnshop , without waiting for him to finish i rushed over to several pawnshops and gave them a description of the jade , and one shop said they ’ d got it
1	yet we ’ ve put his couch in front of this big mirror
1	moreover , the sentiments expressed here sometimes contradict the ideas of the book as a whole
1	you were begging for mercy a minute ago , but now you ’ re worse than ever
1	such a lovely girl !
1	pay no attention to him , said daiyu
1	now that he had stayed out all night his grandfather was furious and suspected him of drinking , gambling or whoring , little guessing the truth of the matter
1	can ’ t you get someone else to go ?
1	baoyu followed her there and said with a smile , although i ’ ve read the western chamber and annoyed you by quoting some lines from it in fun , a line has occurred to me which i can ’ t understand
1	i ’ ve come at the right time
1	perception of the transience of flowers
1	jia zheng rose in dismay and distress to greet his mother , who entered on a maid 's arm , gasping for breath
1	instead of going in , baoyu accosted two matrons in charge of the garden who were sitting on the threshold gossiping
1	what a stroke of luck my coming here again today !
1	afraid this maudlin talk would make a bad impression on their guests
1	that ’ s how she became a lay sister
1	well then , since that ’ s how you feel , why not take these girls away as your acolytes ?
1	instead she embroiders slippers for baoyu
1	the cockatoo before the eaves still remembers her sweet name ; the begonia withering outside the balustrade foretold her death
1	when i asked what it was , she started questioning me !
1	mrs lin agreed readily to this and left
1	then , towering his head , he noticed that the ground was strewn with balsam and pomegranate petals
1	tomorrow we will have not one guest more and not one less , he said
1	when she reached home , the old lady and lady wang asked what the oracle had said
1	how can you refuse to call on him ?
1	taste this of ours and see how you like it
1	baoyu was about to leave too when xiren came along carrying a small carved , double-circle foreign lacquer tray on which were two cups of newly brewed tea
1	the priest then remarked to jia zhen , of course , sir , your generation were born too late to see the duke
1	you can come whenever you like and i won ’ t pester you
1	she got up and started out
1	and after some further bustle the others gradually dispersed , leaving xiren able at last to wait on him hand and foot
1	how can i bear it , saintly teacher , he said , if you draw a veil over your past ?
1	we could not manage it even if we wanted to
1	they ’ re trying to take advantage , because madam zhu ’ s a real bodhisattva and you ’ re such a gentle young lady
1	this said she took her leave
1	this is far too much !
1	the stewards spread word of the old lady 's death and , though ihe jia family had declined , when their relatives and friends saw the favour shown them by the emperor they all came to offer their condolences
1	she opened the door and looked out
1	generations to come will make solemn sacrifice for deeds whose fame resounds to heaven
1	li wen took over and added :
1	no one paid any attention , of course , to such crazy talk
1	we girls don ’ t have to write essays , daiyu answered
1	just tell me what you want , she said , pulling her up
1	even if you had , it wouldn ’ t matter , she usually asks us all , which can ’ t be much fun for you
1	baoyu , left alone with daiyu , clasped her sleeve and smiled but could not get a word out
1	to end , despite herself , defiled on the dusty road
1	i can ’ t be bothered with offering him advice either
1	they were always declaring that since yung lo had usurped his nephew 's throne , the ming dynasty had gone to the dogs ; and whenever they had anything to drink , they would hold forth to this effect
1	she broke off abruptly , regretting her indiscretion , and hung her head with a blush
1	i ’ ll come every day
1	but if you wish , madam , i shall be more attentive in future
1	he just mentioned that he had escaped without bringing away any money
1	even if mrs liu had nine lives she ’ d never dare offend you
1	tomorrow send ke to tell pan that while we have the wedding here we ’ ll find some way to settle his lawsuit for him
1	when evening came the party broke up and , after the two brothers had seen their guest off , they all turned in for the night
1	i hope your honour will graciously permit another trial
1	and then there ’ s old mrs tian who comes from a farming family
1	____________________ the six dynasties lasted from the third to the end of the sixth century
1	you have no call to talk like that
1	just do not work off your temper on them
1	xifeng spat in her face
1	it certainly sounds it , replied the other rats
1	when an official calls , said niu pu , according to proper etiquette you should serve tea three times
1	is there such an allusion ?
1	if i tell you , it will be too good for you !
1	the main string is too high !
1	re mischievously nestled close to her
1	xiuyan blushed when she realized that it was one of the xues ’ shops
1	the young man ’ s face clouded
1	but he is wearing a gauze cap and official dress of the seventh rank , and claims that this year in peking he was appointed a secretary of the imperial patent office
1	if you get leave to go home , that ’ s our good fortune !
1	with a murmured apology , daiyu obeyed
1	well , worrying wo not help
1	when his mother knows what i want , i am sure she will be glad to give him to me
1	a poor scholar like you ca not afford to feed so many daughters !
1	and her eternal , peerless gallantry
1	niu pu put down his luggage , stepped outside and saw a junk moored by the bank
1	~'how did sister xiren fall so ill ?
1	go and have lunch , said baoyu , and come back as soon as you can
1	take it for your parents
1	when the results of the metropolitan examination came out , fan chin had indeed passed
1	to part ; so granny liu , having given her some instructions , said goodbye to pinger and went with all speed out of town
1	in fright the girls dropped to their knees , swearing that none of them dared say a word out of turn : whenever questioned about anything they denied all knowledge of it , so how could they have let this secret out ?
1	how close they had been , yet today they were parted by death !
1	just because of the marriage of our master bao to miss baochai
1	now that she was taking in a second wife for her husband , she was naturally pleased
1	if you hog all the space , where are we to sleep ?
1	an old poem has the line the jade hairpin is broken , the red candle cold
1	two bowls of tea sobered her up enough to ask :
1	with what does the book on ceremony deal ?
1	the few taels you have offered are not even enough to buy charcoal for this urn
1	i give you one year
1	when it came to the third , they saw fairy pages and maids with flags and pennons lead in a girl dressed as a goddess , with black gauze on her head , who sang an aria and then left the stage
1	and on top of that , xifeng ’ s unwell
1	though baoyu was already a married man , as lady zhen was advanced in years and an old relative too , she showed a great interest in him when she saw his close resemblance to her son
1	why fool me into coming out here and then beat me up ?
1	since you asked me today , i couldn ’ t hide it from you
1	what have we to boast about ?
1	i don ’ t want to see you eating your heart out , she said
1	that ’ s not the point
1	his admiration is even more clearly apparent in the first chapter , when he depicts wang mien 's life in the country , and in his description of the four eccentrics in the last chapter
1	i suspected she must have had an unusual mother
1	when she saw the two others had left , she came out of the cabin and smiled at him
1	daiyu gave a little snort
1	that would make a very handsome gift
1	so i came , sir
1	after a while she sighed , i came from yuanmu to the capital hoping to make a name ; but then number was invited here and could not go anywhere else
1	hence they arrived looking listless and apathetic
1	tell him from the mistress that if he does not bring in the rest of that interest tomorrow , she does not want it -- he can keep it for himself
1	this induced many other amorous spirits who had not atoned for their sins to accompany them and take part in this drama
1	xiren urged her to stay for some tea , but for fear that the garden gate would be closed she went off
1	daiyu and xiangyun heaped praise on this ending
1	that was my fault too , i suppose ?
1	but the best thing would be to find a teacher from the county−seat
1	in fact , parents only engage them for their strictness
1	li wan and the others talked it over again , then summoned the servants in charge of the garden and made them lock the gates
1	what did he want ?
1	xiangyun was too excited to give careful thought to her poems or to polish them
1	baoyu took the locket eagerly and found two inscriptions , one on either side , in the form of eight minute characters
1	yes , of course , replied the old lady
1	this sign indicates the loss of animal spirits attended by deaths , sicknesses and alarms
1	as it was now the fifth month , the roses were in full bloom
1	know where the second mistress has gone ?
1	what business has kept you so long today , madam ?
1	the finance commissioner was the head of the civil service in each province and treasurer of the provincial exchequer , in charge of the revenue and the census
1	we shall now leave ha zheng travelling to his new post and return to baoyu
1	what future is there for me if i stay on here alone ?
1	there are nearly a thousand people in this household
1	when the dead man 's parents heard this , their tears fell like rain
1	but if this tiresome wretch keeps yelling about it and the master bears , there may be trouble
1	a two−storeyed building on the left was the library built by the number one scholar , overlooking a large courtyard with one bed of moutan peonies and another of tree peonies
1	though you are not one of those rich merchants , you would still better be careful
1	for my father knows that after serving for several years in the capital you can not be wealthy ; and he does not want to put you to any inconvenience
1	after playing for a while with the birds in the gallery , he strolled beside the river of seeping fragrance to have a look at the goldfish
1	that 's ridiculous talk , third uncle , protested jia yun
1	cousin zhen has seen to all the important outside arrangements , it ’ s just a question of keeping an eye on the domestic side
1	all the others had melon-green covered bowls with golden designs of new imperial kiln porcelain
1	you haven ’ t just used an allusion for padding
1	but miss lin 's narrow-minded and likes to make cutting remarks
1	why did you come to nanking ?
1	when the runner had consented and left with wang , pan took hao back with him to his house
1	she would , indeed , have joined in if not for baochai 's retort regarding the fan
1	if you want anything just let her know
1	wang teh and wang jen became palace scholars in turn , and drank a dozen cups apiece
1	i also heard that a vacancy for a vice-minister has come up in the ministry of works , and people outside and in the ministry are all saying that you are to be appointed , sir
1	what time is it ?
1	no two scenes were the same
1	imagine the daughter of a respectable family raising such a row !
1	i will tell you frankly , sir , replied ma
1	and since it is his son , you should consult his wishes
1	eight scenes from eight gallants at the lantern festival were being performed , and the climax had just been reached when baoyu rose to go out
1	xiren and zijuan were still keeping hold of him
1	being old and infirm ha jing had retired to live quietly in mysterious truth temple outside the city , where he had now died of illness
1	after breakfast , baoyu and the others paid their respects again to the lady dowager , after which they returned to the garden
1	so he was a good monk after all !
1	after greeting them he invited them to be seated , then asked their names and where they came from
1	xifeng left the hail and mounted her carriage , in front of which were two brilliant horn lanterns inscribed with the large characters : the rong mansion
1	li wan , the only one to appreciate xifeng 's dilemma , dared not speak up for her
1	this morning master huan told lady xing it 's the rule of the prince 's house to fetch the girl there within three days of receiving her horoscope
1	just then tea was served
1	if it is , i doubt if it can be cured and i don ’ t care !
1	one on the head , replied zhang er hastily
1	i shall go myself with your wife to ask aunt xue s consent
1	then the teacher went to his desk while wang hui said to his servants , since it is dark and the rain has not stopped , bring the hampers here and tell the monk to cook a peck of rice
1	her family had served the jias for generations , and her father was now in charge of various farms and properties outside
1	tell the new bride the master is not at home today , and let her go to her room
1	as yinger had gone to make tea , the two of them went straight to find her
1	and xiren despite the presence of lady wang sobbed , i want to be a nun with miss xichun too
1	having paid her respects to the lady dowager and xifeng , she sat down and had some tea
1	your aunt , poor thing , has no more to say for herself than a block of wood and ca not show herself to advantage to her elders
1	verily , glass vessels overflowed with nectar and amber cups brimmed with ambrosia
1	that family alone entertained the emperor four times
1	daiyu flushed and spat in disgust
1	if you want to know the upshot , read the next chapter
1	xifeng knows all the usual run of smart talk , said baochai
1	then get some chicken breast , fresh mushrooms , bamboo shoots , dried mushrooms , spiced dried beancurd and various kinds of preserved fruit
1	how is she now ? asked the old lady
1	no , no , these are not ours , she protested with a smile
1	after drinking tea , ma and chu expressed their regret at parting , then took their leave
1	next they decided to buy some meat dumplings for a snack , and went into a shop where they found thirty dumplings
1	and this said , she ignored her
1	talks so wildly , i decided not to call out
1	their descriptions of how our first emperor toured the country like the sage king shun of old are better than anything in history , but alas !
1	after a month ’ s grief shiyin fell ill , and then his wife
1	for the jias , after all , were a scholarly family all of whose friends and protégés were men of parts
1	so now all the lines had come true !
1	nanny song knew at once that this was because of the bracelet
1	yoo opened the letter and read it through
1	a memento of a dead maid leads baoyu
1	i ’ ve no anawer to that
1	having reached this decision , he left
1	but no one paid any attention
1	in future , when you come to our family , i dare say you ’ ll find a whole chest of such trash still there
1	some dreams do come true , though , said chou chin
1	send her packing and we ’ ll all have some peace and quiet
1	yet with getting sons won ’ t have done
1	there ’ s nothing wrong with me
1	thank you for bringing it
1	gritting her teeth and smiling , second sister you scolded softly , you glib-tongued monkey !
1	that 's the way to talk to her !
1	since they mean well , coming to see us , we shouldn ’ t slight them
1	there 's money in this
1	are you engaged yet ?
1	they are already at nine twists mount !
1	i want it for new year , so don ’ t be lazy !
1	alone i drove on to my dreary doom
1	you will find things very different from what they were under your old master , who left everything to his concubine and let you get away with anything
1	his father was my colleague , said tang , but i sha not recognize this young man when i see him
1	life and death are determined by fate , rank and riches decreed by heaven , quoted daiyu with a sigh
1	it would reflect badly on xiren and the rest of you as well
1	you have nothing to do anyway , dear sister , so do make them for me
1	he ’ ll become the mainstay of the house some day in place of his father
1	all he could do was send some stewards in secret to raise a few thousand taels by selling certain country estates to defray the prison expenses
1	he noticed that in her white mourning , her face bare of rouge and powder , she looked even lovelier than before her marriage
1	told of her qualms and the ghosts she had seen , granny liu assured her that the buddhist deities in her village temple could work miracles
1	when he loses something , why suspect me ?
1	they reminded her of a line in an old poem :
1	i do not fancy it
1	resenting his harsh treatment at xifeng 's hands , he decided now that jia lian was away to vent his spite on qiaojie , using jia yun as his cat 's paw
1	at once they asked what had happened
1	but xiangyun on hearing the clue had started staring around too
1	what are you doing here so early in the morning ?
1	that evening the things were brought over , the mother of the old lady ’ s girl numskull came to deliver the laundry and stayed chatting for a while in the servants ’ quarters
1	then as quick as lightning the brush wrote : ' emperor chien wen
1	beneath was the poet 's name : hung kan−hsien
1	indeed , she treated him like one of her own grandsons , giving him clothes , shoes and other necessities when she saw that his family was hard up
1	let 's drink a few cups , then have rice , proposed the lady dowager , then noticed that the place beside her was empty
1	and are you a native of this city ?
1	and presently , thinking it time for the lady dowager ’ s meal , xiangyun and baochai went back to pack their things while madam you took her leave of li wan and went straight to the old lady ’ s place
1	ascends to the great void
1	xifeng agreed to this and took her leave
1	the feasting went on for two whole days
1	baochai may look stupid but she had good sense you know what she 's like , madam
1	early the next morning he went back to urge his grandmother to send for xiangyun , and did not relax until she finally arrived in the afternoon
1	aunt huang had come there to complain about qin zhong ’ s treatment of her nephew , but after hearing of keqing ’ s illness she hadn ’ t the courage to mention this , much less to complain
1	why , these prongs are heavier than our iron shovels , the old woman complained
1	hearing that chih heng−shan would be there , wu reluctantly consented to go
1	that 's why the sight of the provincial examination school today upset him
1	the next morning he got up early to go on with his editing , and by working all day and late into the night he was able to finish seventy or eighty essays a day
1	with that she turned to go back
1	just look after your end of things inside the house
1	i met this fellow pao from nanking on the road , said mr wei
1	the gate of this court was ajar , but not liking to intrude he decided to ask permission from the monk
1	tu ordered his chair−bearers to wait , and took a winding path through the temple grounds
1	even if she really wanted to leave , you should wait until she 's cooled down and then mention it to the mistress casually
1	xue ke and xiuyan had met once previously on their way to the capital , and in all probability they were pleased enough with the match ; but naturally this made xiuyan more reserved and tongue-tied in the presence of baochai and the rest of the girls
1	in a few days you ’ ll do better
1	she took out pinger ’ s share then , saying , here , pinger , take this back
1	but his wife—the daughter of butcher hu of the south end of this village—with her dingy hair and red−rimmed eyes was a regular slattern
1	green willows covered the slopes ;
1	slender the willow slips , their dew half dry
1	take them to read
1	she scolded them several times , but they paid no attention
1	devoted friends join the clan school
1	you must think of something fresh
1	jia huan hung his head
1	i am in disgrace now because of this robbery
1	weeping she tried to raise him to his feet , but baoyu refused to getup
1	and baoqin is engaged to be married too
1	bao yong said nothing to this , while xichun was on tenterhooks for fear lest he mention miaoyu
1	give me your pouch
1	if he is such a remarkable man , said lou feng , much impressed , why do not we go to pay our respects to him ?
1	she ordered him to be fetched back
1	has he forgotten who brought him up ?
1	you are really like precious jade
1	besides , li wan added , these poems are about places she ’ s visited
1	an incompetent physician prescribes
1	a stupid bully is beaten up
1	we wo not make a ruling that we three are not to write when the subject and rhyme are easy we may have a go but you four definitely must write
1	this was the temple of wu tzu−hsu , councillor of the kingdom of wu
1	the three of them went in together , and they told him of the trouble they had just had at the city gate
1	it shows heaven is kind
1	some of its spirit winter-plum allots
1	the lady dowager parried
1	home again , she told the lady dowager , rong ’ s wife sends her respects and kowtows to you
1	but by the time he had reached here a couple of years ago his money had run out and he had gone to live in the temple where he made a precarious living by working as a scrivener
1	this aunt of mine was ill-starred
1	yucun turned to look
1	the bawd came in to wish him good morning , and they had just breakfasted when chin hsiu−yi arrived and insisted jokingly that chen should invite him to a wedding feast
1	lady wang ’ s heart ached at this news , aggravating her pains
1	it ’ s only natural for men to hanker for more
1	although she repeated her questions several times , baoyu just went on sobbing , his head bent over the table , unable to speak
1	but to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
1	if i don ’ t go , i ’ ll be unworthy of all her goodness ; if i do , i shall have to abandon my own people
1	well , i should have minded my own business instead of coming here to let myself in for this old wives ' gabble
1	you should buy a few collections of paku essays to study too , advised mr chi
1	who can guess the outcome of a game of chess ?
1	do not blame this young rascal , he said
1	i would like to get xue ke married
1	like lady yang 's shade , fresh from the bath , ice-pure ,
1	on xifeng ’ s instructions caiming read out the number of strings of beads and tassels needed for two palanquins and four sedan-chairs as well as four carriages
1	when it ’ s time to speak you say nothing
1	although that brute has gone , he thought , it 's bound to come back to eat me
1	he kept yu yu−chung to a meal , and showed him the manuscripts of his three books
1	now , thanks to this money you have given us , we can turn over a new leaf
1	go on , so as not — what ?
1	he had only a skull cap and jacket now himself
1	attracted by this suggestion , he laughed at his wife ’ s objection and proposed :
1	i know you don ’ t believe in such things , so i ’ ve asked you here to consult you
1	then they went with the monk to the rooms behind , where chou chin had taught
1	show her in , said tu
1	so the two mothers confronted each other 's sons
1	mind you don ’ t chock
1	is old lou still here ?
1	but i am no beauty
1	unable to change her mind , he had to go back and report this to jia she
1	they were interrupted by the arrival of lin zhixiao ’ s wife
1	if he passes and becomes an official , a few taels of silver will mean nothing to him — he can easily repay us
1	aunt xue , too exploded in such mirth that she sprayed tea all over tanchun 's skirt , making her upset her bowl over yingchun , while xichun left her seat and begged her nurse to rub her stomach for her
1	tell your mistress this from me , pinger , when you go back
1	as he reached the gate , he saw a man with baggage enter the city , and was delighted to recognize hsiao chin−hsuan of anching
1	and for this pao insisted on offering thanks
1	i have my hands full here , said mrs liu
1	he kept hsiao pochuan for two days while he drew up a contract , then ordered his elder son to hire a fast boat and accompany hsiao to yangchow to call on mr yu in the riverside house of a salt merchant named wu
1	the old lady asked him
1	so she came by sedan-chair to enlist xifeng ’ s help
1	the men bearing wine , jade and silk stood on the left , while those bearing grain and viands stood on the right
1	again the other made no reply
1	jia zheng asked this pair which monastery they were from
1	go and have a drink yourself
1	she doesn ’ t even care for appearances
1	it was an account of the stone ’ s rejection for repairing heaven , its transformation and conveyance to the world of men by the buddhist of infinite space and the taoist of boundless time , and the joys and sorrows , partings and encounters , warm and cold treatment from others it had experienced there
1	baochai ’ s so intelligent , we don ’ t have to worry
1	yes , she said more cheerfully , i suppose your maids felt too lazy to stir and that made them answer rudely
1	after some time she told the other to go
1	that ’ s my worthless grandson ’ s name , chuckled the lady dowager
1	come and drink some tea with me
1	my father was on a most friendly footing with the lou gentlemen
1	how much stuff could her brother bring back ?
1	after the lantern festival , he felt stabs of pain in his heart
1	a laughing-stock for you gentlemen , that 's what i have become !
1	but no sooner had ho opened the gate when seven or eight men rushed in
1	eagerness to clear themselves and receive a reward made everyone search frantically high and low — they even scoured the privies
1	baoyu agreed and turned to tell cuimo to fetch it , where upon she went off cheerfully on this errand
1	he is the same age as i — eighty−two this year
1	the fourth , xichun , is the younger sister of jia zhen of the ning mansion
1	when your master ’ s lenient you run him down ; if he were strict you ’ d complain , said third sister with a smile
1	you can issue the allowance but do not assign me another maid
1	tomorrow , replied tang yu
1	aren ’ t you afraid of third sister ?
1	jia zhen protested , he was just writing nonsense
1	the sky was overcast , though , as if it were going to rain ; so instead of sitting there longer he went out through the temple gate
1	by stressing this she calmed them down a little
1	the next day there was even more to do , but we need not go into the details
1	she went back to find everyone ministering to baoyu
1	that made them go back in remorse to live together , and then the tree blossomed again
1	i came back very late
1	but instead of stopping at the lobby this time , they turned west after the main hall and alighted outside the lady dowager ’ s reception room
1	now he ’ s in a bad way but luckily we have money and , with the jia family helping , there ’ s still some hope
1	on account of there being so many people here some birthdays coincide with two or three of them falling on the same day
1	baoqin smiled and blushingly lowered her head in silence
1	jia lian went in then to see their ladyships
1	and meeting him spiced rice i did present
1	arrived at tengwei hill , wang went to look for his friend
1	tu shao−ching ordered chia chueh to go and find out
1	at this memory his heart went out to qingwen
1	in most of the romances baoyu had recently acquired , a young scholar and beautiful girl came together and fell in love thanks to lovebirds , phoenixes , jade rings , gold pendants , silk handkerchiefs , embroidered girdles or other baubles of the sort
1	i would always known the younger jia men and their servants here were a bad lot but thought the older generation all right , so i was surprised to hear they would landed in trouble
1	everyone calls it provincial graduate pao 's family
1	who 's having a wedding ?
1	why didn ’ t you take your nurse to task for carrying on in that way ?
1	how is it that of all those in our family only these few are left ?
1	i ca not see what you two have to quarrel about
1	the wang brothers deliberate how to make a concubine of the mistress of the house
1	then baoyu and his party passed through the side gate , where some grooms and the boys under the six stewards had some dozen horses ready
1	the three of them finished so soon that granny liu commented with a smile :
1	he urged her to shave off her fringe completely , exposing her bluish scalp , and to part her hair in the middle
1	who told you he ’ s no good ?
1	but where is the money to come from ?
1	cicadas chirp , crows roost , in a flash they are gone ;
1	the other day , she accused ouguan of burning sacrificial paper ; but luckily baoyu said he ’ d asked her to do it , and that silenced the old creature
1	the nurses said he wasn ’ t to sleep in this room for fear of infection
1	old pu had prepared a mirror , candlesticks , tea−pot , basin , chamber−pot and two pillows which were now carried over by his elder son , pu cheng , who bowed to mr niu as soon as he had put them down
1	i don ’ t need him , declared xifeng laughingly
1	don ’ t imitate earlier writers
1	i was worried too that there might be , but i ’ ve checked carefully and there ’ s nothing missing
1	why have you been hiding this accomplishment from me ?
1	a whip points at the bridge , the poet must go
1	aunt xue did not go home that day , staying with her heart-broken daughter to cornfort her
1	cousin lin has become an immortal
1	you are quite right , agreed yu yu−ta
1	but now there 's nothing you can do
1	he went on kowtowing as if he would never stop
1	wouldn ’ t that save trouble ?
1	the mistresses and the young ladies can hardly side with those singsong girls against you
1	well , anyway , i ’ ll get it clear gradually
1	with that xiren left the room
1	i am busy now but come to my study tomorrow
1	what is there for an old woman like me to live for ?
1	the brothers looked on with delight
1	in desperation he summoned li shier
1	i don ’ t covet such luck
1	the general commandant of the capital
1	it 's a fact that mr chu is not at home
1	why , madam , the truth is they were just spending the emperor ’ s money on the emperor
1	the next day , as soon as he got up he went to three officials hall to see the runners
1	beside this temple lived a gentleman named zhen fei , whose courtesy name was shiyin
1	the servant came back about ten days later with prefect chu 's letter , and reported : when prefect chu heard this , he was very pleased
1	when kuo gave him two pears he had bought on the road , the abbot accepted them with thanks
1	sooner or later i ’ ll settle scores with you both
1	some of the other scholars left by sedan−chair , others oh foot
1	and steep their hearts in envious jealousy
1	you must be tired ; you would better turn in first
1	we can consider it again tomorrow
1	when the others had gone , he and his wife talked of the happenings since their separation
1	the caretakers of the storeroom for antiques have mentioned it several times , as they want to record where it is
1	these women ; summoned and told the plan in outline by li wan , agreed to it readily
1	do you mind spending a night outside , away from your family ?
1	no , let 's use that lake pavilion by lotus fragrance anchorage , proposed the lady dowager
1	he had never given his mind to studying whole essays
1	is she asleep in the annex ?
1	as soon as the chair had passed , the official spoke to one of his black−coated runners who rushed over to pao wen−ching
1	choking on rice like jade and wine like gold ,
1	a big household like this can only be run by someone with your forethought , madam
1	don ’ t take on like that , urged li gui
1	of course you left all your own things at home
1	however , he heard one of them chant :
1	his stock was an assortment of sesame sweets , dried beancurd , clay figurines , children 's flutes and cymbals , and women 's hairpins
1	but to know what followed , you must read the next chapter
1	i agree with you , rejoined chin
1	this is mr lou feng 's boat , loaded with rice , as everybody knows
1	after the usual exchange of civilities , daiyu said to baochai :
1	i want to bid farewell to you and my husband 's parents , and follow my husband to the grave
1	your house is full of heralds
1	she ordered him to be admitted at once
1	after yu 's return to his post , this servant−boy walked a mile to the market every morning to buy the fuel , rice , oil , flour or vegetables needed , then returned to help his mistress
1	caiyun , unable to stop her no matter how hard she tried , made herself scarce while jia huan slipped out of the ceremonial gate and went off to amuse himself elsewhere
1	why should anyone tell such a lie ?
1	they have a roomful of goods worth one thousand six hundred taels
1	i fancy the tu cousins from tienchang are even more open−handed than your uncles !
1	his mother summoned a doctor , thinking he was deranged again , at the same time sending maids to report to jia zheng that their son had recovered from his heart attack and now that he could talk there was no need to prepare for the last rites
1	it 's obviously no use my thinking of you every minute of the day -- you have no place for me in your heart
1	it was such a horrible sight that i ran away as fast as ever i could
1	why are you coming back ?
1	today he had come to comfort her ; but again , without meaning to , had spoken too hastily so that he had to break off , desperately afraid that daiyu would be angry
1	so you are really a scholar !
1	you think nothing of us wangs , not even of me , much less our servants
1	yu yin turned red
1	oh , no , protested pao
1	besides , hearing that aunty was here , i wanted to pay my respects to her as well
1	they ’ re not as badly off as they make out
1	look at ma chun−shang , for example
1	he bade a scullion carry two vats into the courtyard , put a pear in each , pour several buckets of water over them , and mash the pears with a pole
1	it is even more ridiculous when these charlatans claim that the site for the first ming emperor 's sepulchre was chosen by liu chi of our dynasty
1	at green maple city , said hsiao , we saw plenty of snow , but i never found it depressing
1	jia zheng , pleased by the results of baoyu ’ s test , brought the subject up when he went out to chat with his secretaries
1	soon i shall have to leave you , and there is no knowing when i can come back again
1	a confounded monk ends a confounded case
1	do you really mean it ?
1	just work it out , though , and it ’ s really sickening
1	have you any objection ?
1	and should our late master be buried among the ancestors or should another site be chosen ?
1	i took out two rolls , thinking they would make good coverlets
1	let us return to daiyu , who had risen late after a sleepless night
1	do not grieve , mother , he begged
1	chih is entirely right , remarked wu shu
1	this is my uncle tu from tienchang , replied hua−shih
1	but i was afraid that , ill as she is , this false accusation might make her so desperate she would try to kill herself -- then we would have another death on our hands
1	lady wang urged her not to worry about family affairs , but just to take medicine and recuperate
1	today , at the order of the goddess of disenchantment , i am going to the illusory land of the great void to register all the amorous spirits in this case
1	cried the lady dowager turning to xifeng
1	now if thy heart doth cherish grace within ,
1	they took kuang chao−jen with them to a tavern , chose seats and sat down
1	as her family owned so many osmanthus trees , she had been given
1	what ’ s this you ’ re making ?
1	suppressing a smile she answered , she has to wait for the appointed hour
1	but the words were still on her lips when daiyu staggered and fell , vomiting blood
1	while saying this she rose to take her leave
1	at a feast with his secretaries , he was so worried that he infected them with his own uneasiness
1	i just told xueyan to get the kitchen to prepare you a bowl of cabbage soup with ham and dried shrimps , as well as some bamboo shoots and layer in it
1	as for the contract , in our capacity as mediators we will draw up a statement for huang meng−tung to the effect that the old contract is null and void
1	then they sat down at a table with ting−hsi
1	baoyu repeated what daiyu had said to him
1	the lady dowager and her party went at dawn to the hostel , where they had some refreshments before proceeding to court
1	we ’ ll give twelve taels each
1	this done , he chose an auspicious date and wrote a memorial , and the very same day that it was presented the son of heaven acceded to his request
1	this time , though , something lucky turned up in my bad luck
1	that means you ’ re bound to be good friends
1	xifeng was still not well enough to stay there all the time ; but when buddhist masses were held and sutras read , or when visitors came to offer sacrifices , she made the effort to come over to help madam you cope
1	if trouble had come of it , it would have been awkward for both families
1	passing through two more rooms , they came to winding steps with balustrades , and climbed up to another building
1	after the meal pan made the young man take a bath and change into a completely new outfit which he had prepared for him : a new square cap , new shoes and a new sapphire−blue silk gown
1	to the lady dowager ’ s apartments , and daiyu returned to her own rooms to rest
1	that ’ s why i couldn ’ t come out to speak to you
1	that last line ’ s good but rather hard to match
1	don ’ t bring up his name , he sighed
1	as soon as the results are published , irrespective of whether you have passed or not , i want you both to come to my headquarters father wants us to go to his yamen , said tang yu to his brother
1	let me off this time , good sister !
1	people are easy , said daiyu
1	yes , you were right to find out
1	there will be lots of people sending him presents of money
1	i strove but for his sacred majesty
1	on the south side was a dainty three-roomed annex facing north ; on the north a big screen wall painted white , behind which was a small door leading to an apartment
1	do not keep me waiting too long !
1	wo not the son 's officialdom be enough for the father ?
1	you ’ d better lie down , miss
1	the old lady left masses of gold and silver , but they wo not touch it it 's all tucked away in her room waiting to be shared out after the funeral
1	mr lou 's illness was taking a turn for the worse , and tu shao−ching , who had invited a second physician to attend him , stayed at home in low spirits
1	their words carry weight
1	i ’ m glad cousin xifeng is so considerate
1	and chirping flew the birds of jasper green
1	she could not do any of the work your sister−in−law does , but she did not like to sit idle while her mother−in−law and sisterin−law waited on her
1	this confounded stork had helped her !
1	her heart aching , her grandmother said , don ’ t be afraid , dear child
1	and the friend who travelled part of the way here with me has gone to the capital for the examination ; so there is no one closer to me than you
1	opening his door to invite him in , wang hui saw that his visitor was handsome , distinguished and well−bred
1	but why come such a long way just to tell me this ?
1	before the raid on the rong and ning mansions , on the day when baochai and daiyu separated , that jade had already left the world of men to escape from calamity and effect a reunion
1	but as i ’ ve come all this way to ask your help , i ’ d better speak up
1	we can do without him then , she said
1	but it 's really hard for us to please everyone with each of the mistresses giving different orders
1	as xifeng had been her favourite she told yuanyang , give some of my things to xifeng , and take pinger some money so that she can look after her well
1	a mountain wolf , a savage ruthless beast ,
1	to return to xifeng at home
1	as luck would have it , however , there was a dead branch a foot or more long lower down the trunk ; and in its furious leap the beast had impaled itself on this branch
1	if she ’ s not well , she needn ’ t come , said the old lady
1	from both i am loath to part ,
1	the young ladies ditched me , said granny liu hastily
1	this set lady wang and the others weeping again
1	what ’ s that cute thing made of ?
1	then the lou brothers had to pluck up courage to open the bag , only to find in it not a human head but a pig 's head weighing six or seven catties !
1	may better news follow in rapid succession !
1	its purity rewards the god of autumn ,
1	he was troubled with phlegm , and fits of coughing often kept him awake half the night
1	i ’ ll pay your share
1	now the fish had been bought and the fire was ready , but when they asked the youngwife to start cooking she refused to budge
1	kuei went back to his mother−in−law
1	now that the garden gates are closed it ’ s time to start
1	if she misunderstands you then why rue ?
1	then one day , from jingui ’ s pillow-case there fell out a paper effigy inscribed with the date of her birth and her horoscope
1	insignia of honour in the hall blaze like iridescent clouds
1	whiskers wang returned several days later having sold the land for one thousand and several hundred taels , which he brought home in a small bag
1	yet instead of keeping yourself in check , behaving yourself and living peacefully , you act like an oaf and bully her in your cups
1	the funk that i was in made me muddle things up
1	and there we leave them
1	i daren ’ t contradict you
1	' a cock crows at the moon by the rustic inn , was his quotation
1	the next day the weather cleared
1	these men were appointed by the emperor after a test
1	smiling at each other both girls took a sip of wine
1	there was someone lying on a couch inside , with a few girls by him sewing or amusing themselves
1	baoyu had just started combing it with a fine comb when qingwen hurried in to fetch some money
1	looking at daiyu closely , he found her different from other girls
1	just then he saw a boat pass with two girls in it who looked very like the two maids in the lu family
1	all the attendants covered their faces and wept , and daiyu herself could not keep back her tears
1	though he himself waits day and night upon his imperial parents , he considers this too little to express all his filial devotion ; and he realizes that the secondary consorts and ladies-in-waiting in the palace who have been away from their parents for many years must naturally be longing to see them again , for it ’ s only right for children to miss their parents
1	you ’ re making fun of me , cousin , and i ’ ve guessed the answer , he told her with a smile
1	that ’ s all very well , said qingwen
1	on one condition though
1	why hurry me when i ’ m in high spirits ?
1	when that time comes who will worry about anyone else ?
1	tanchun , taking them , found that two concubines who had been family servants had received twenty taels apiece , and two from outside forty
1	cuimo said , our young lady and miss xiangyun are in miss xichun ’ s place discussing that painting she ’ s made of the garden
1	the dockers helped the boatmen to stop him
1	the concubine felt that ma was yielding
1	past telling are the marvels in this place
1	how do you know him , sir ?
1	'~so you take that line too ?
1	chuang walked forward and prostrated himself
1	we officials owe allegiance only to the emperor , not to friends of the same faith
1	however , for fear that his grief might bring back his old illness , she called xiren into the inner room to ask her just what had happened in the garden
1	there ’ s two piculs of good rice short , she observed
1	brew some good tea , quick !
1	no wonder everyone says it ’ s no good being too familiar with you
1	if you keep on weeping , you will upset my wife even more
1	if you tell us , even if we suffer for it , we shall have something to go on
1	there were several nursemaids there carrying their master 's children and joking with the gateman
1	what do you think ?
1	oh , is it you ?
1	they might saychinese buddhists believe that not till seven , twice seven or as many asseven times seven days after death does a spirit transmigrate to another body
1	she saw baoyu out of the gate , watched him get into the chair and lowered its curtains
1	why have i had no notice of it ?
1	if so , xifeng would count as lenient , not as exacting
1	you must of course know
1	that saying is perfectly true
1	xichun , however , countered , how could a grown man like him get lost ?
1	we haven ’ t been in for some time and don ’ t know what she ’ s up to
1	i ’ ve always wanted to play that
1	just then nanny song came back to report on her errand
1	hurry up and invite them
1	but while saying this she was thinking , drat it all !
1	qingwen told xiren then what had just happened , whereupon xiren dashed off to bamboo lodge
1	but it 's such a hot day , with so many young ladies here too , that i do not like to presume without your permission
1	only the fourth mr chen was left at welcome pavilion
1	no , that would be a sin , a wicked sin
1	in future i really must make a study of music
1	miss xiangyun won ’ t let me go
1	i do not know what you are talking about
1	what 's done is done , sobbed pinger
1	i ’ ve only studied for a couple of years and learned a few characters
1	i know what 's the trouble with her
1	how can you expect to find them looking through clothes again today ?
1	i didn ’ t know she had such a champion
1	but xue pan leapt to his feet
1	when you have time , do come and see me
1	he answered — affirming that he would be true to her
1	i won ’ t have it hushed up , declared baoyu
1	some went to ask , returning with the answer , yes , we have
1	baoyu asked after yun 's mother and inquired his business
1	if i economize too much , outsiders may jeer and their ladyships will feel the pinch , while the rest of the household complain of my stinginess
1	last night i was thinking of asking my sister for the use of the garden for one day , to invite you to a simple meal so as to enjoy the snow
1	there ’ s nothing wrong with this place , but reed snow cottage would be even better , remarked li wan
1	after a careful investigation he discovered that one of his subordinates had told the moslems of mr chang 's part in the business
1	a clear stream welling up where the trees were thickest wound its way through clefts in the rocks
1	is there anybody staying in bamboo lodge ?
1	he received the wine kneeling , drained it at one gulp , then felt better and kowtowed again in thanks
1	kuang chao−jen then returned to his lodgings
1	i will come back when i have seen him
1	after third sister ’ s suicide , it goes without saying , old mrs you , second sister and jia lian were overcome with grief , as were jia zhen , his wife and jia rong as soon as they learned of it
1	the other day on her birthday i checked our inventory of curios and found this listed there , but i don ’ t know where it ’ s got to now
1	merciful buddha , save me !
1	after leaving tu , wu shu had gone no further than lucky crossing bridge when he met a man in a square cap , old cotton gown , silk girdle and straw sandals
1	this decision taken , she changed boats at yicheng and travelled straight to nanking
1	nothing much , replied zixing
1	that oaf of a master of yours falls for every girl he sees , she swore
1	xueyan agreeing to this , zijuan went off
1	when you were twenty our masters were kind enough to help you purchase an official post , although plenty of real gentlefolk go hungry
1	while speaking she laid the table
1	they joined families because they have the same surname and their grandfather was an official in the same place as our old master
1	these look better-kept than other places
1	exultantly , kuang chao−jen thanked the examiner , and when he had seen him off he went back to hangchow to discuss with pan how to return to yuehching county to put up a wooden placard and erect a flagpole in his ancestral temple to honour the family
1	i ’ m in here , pinger called
1	i no longer dare keep you
1	as they were chatting , a serving-woman brought in the drugs
1	after this , the two friends were constantly together
1	then the dice-pot went to li wan who made her toss
1	heaven would not entrust such an onerous task to anyone but a benevolent sage
1	xifeng had already sent round a flowered lavender curtain , satin quilts and embroidered mattresses
1	when the servants returned and found their master gone , the boatman told them that he had gone ashore in pursuit of two monks and a taoist priest
1	after the second watch , the maid informed them
1	kinsmen and friends came to offer congratulations , but disturbed as he was by his domestic problems jia zheng was in no mood to-entertain them
1	that would only cause a worse scandal
1	and a fortune−teller is sensitive to these almost imperceptible signs
1	why should not one of them at least stay here ?
1	that would be a worthy deed
1	the lady dowager , lady xing , lady wang , madam you and her daughter-in-law nee xu grandparents as well as grand-children of the jia family had to go to court every morning when sacrifice was offered , not returning until two in the afternoon
1	i wonder what 's become of its owners
1	he wondered what rare plant this could be that it was so specially treasured , observing that the faintest breeze set it swaying incessantly , and that though it was so small and had no blossoms its delicate grace was utterly enchanting
1	in her indignation she turned and left abruptly
1	pink petals fall in hundred flowers islet
1	the lady dowager ’ s gift was a purse containing a small golden effigy of the god of learning symbolizing literary talent and harmony
1	who can we complain to about this injustice ?
1	jia zhen asked his wife , have we fetched the imperial bounty yet for the spring sacrifice ?
1	you don ’ t know the half of it , my dear granny
1	this maid hurried to relieve them of their load
1	wait till my zijuan dies , it won ’ t be too late for me to use that phrase then
1	i think you ’ re right , agreed xifeng
1	when is it to be ?
1	losing patience , shiyin clasped his daughter more tightly and was turning to reenter the house when the monk pointed at him and let out a roar of laughter
1	he was in a quandary when a man in black rushed in
1	if heaven takes pity on me , i may recover
1	when she learned of his accident she hurried over to find him in front of the mirror , his left cheek daubed with ointment
1	you are wide of the mark again
1	i don ’ t know what that girl is like
1	caiyun , told by lady wang to see who she was , recognized her as one of the serving-women who had accompanied yingchun to the sun family
1	coming out , he went at once to find jia zheng , expressed his sympathy over his impeachment , then congratulated him on his return and asked about his journey
1	wang ren ( 忘仁 -- forgetting humanity )
1	after some days on the road they were approaching the capital when word came of the promotion of his uncle wang ziteng to the post of commander-in-chief of nine provinces with orders to inspect the borders
1	now her maid xueyan brought in her little hand-stove
1	this chance is too good to miss
1	for this mirror had western-style hinges enabling it to open or shut , and she had accidentally pressed the spring which made it swing back , revealing a doorway
1	lady wang explained , the last couple of years , what with floods and drought , our farms haven ’ t been able to produce their quota , especially of the rice of the finer kind
1	this is why jia huan and the others were not afraid of him , only yielding to him to some extent for fear of the lady dowager
1	he took the lad with him whenever he went out to tea−shops and taverns or on business trips ; and he let him earn commissions so that he could buy new clothes , caps , shoes and socks
1	just then the old lady arrived with lady wang , li wan and xifeng
1	just yesterday you were saying you needed a couple of hundred taels
1	i ’ ve thought of a very good plan , said the attendant
1	what 's to be done then ?
1	just now in the old lady ’ s place , baoyu came out to pay his respects , remarked aunt xue
1	how cruel these people are !
1	how dare he refuse to help me ?
1	but now that we are one family i am sure you will not laugh at me
1	men and women story-tellers who frequented the house came to offer congratulations
1	ask her what she just said about you
1	but what caused my mother 's illness ?
1	later on such a crowd will be going there on business , we ’ ll hardly get a look in
1	if they learned that the second master married you while still in mourning , they ’ d have him beaten to death !
1	the others chuckled , a dream does not count !
1	xifeng turned to lai da ’ s wife
1	that is what delayed me
1	although xiren knew what had happened , she dared not mention it and tried to distract him with some more cheerful subject
1	the flowers would still be spoiled
1	baoyu first watched daiyu fishing , then went over to make a few remarks to baochai , after which he joined xiren and the rest and sipped some wine with them while xiren prepared a shellful of meat for him
1	master bao was most emphatic , insisted qingwen
1	i am afraid you will laugh at me
1	these last few days you ’ ve just begun to recover your appetite and have a little more energy ; but you ’ re not completely well yet
1	besides , these aren ’ t worth much
1	now you dare make fun of me !
1	this gauze is pretty when new , she remarked to lady wang , but it soon loses its vivid emerald colour
1	asked pao with a laugh
1	miss baochai has gone , she informed him
1	we humbly invoke all divinities to show their divine compassion and display their spiritual majesty afar in these forty-nine days of grand sacrifice , that the departed may be delivered from sins and absolved from retribution there was more in the same vein
1	the boatmen rowed back
1	jia zheng ’ s wife , lady wang , bore him a son called jia zhu who passed the district examination at fourteen , married before be was twenty and had a son , but then fell ill and died
1	just get on with your work , little ancestor , urged xiren
1	whenever you come back from outside , if so much as a handkerchief or pouch is missing they have to look into it , not to mention that jade !
1	xiren nearby heard him calling out in his sleep and shook him to wake him up
1	the fairy maid retorted
1	the wrong medicine was prescribed and one dose killed him
1	tell her i ’ m sleeping
1	lady wang knew that this was a bad business and warned lady xing against it ; but the latter , taken in by her brother and wang ren , suspected lady wang 's motives
1	no wonder she ’ s a vamp
1	xue pan , who had long been dubbed the stupid lordling , naturally found xing a man after his own heart
1	just leave it to me
1	lady wang also told xifeng , go ahead and eat with the old lady and aunt xue
1	when tea has been served , i will invite you to have a rest in the library
1	come back here tomorrow morning
1	lovely too on the water were the lotus flowers , duckweed and water-fowl made out of shells and feathers
1	he had often wanted to meet him , but his father kept him under such strict control that hitherto he had never had a chance
1	some trees and flowers are to be planted in the garden , and i was looking for someone to put in charge
1	naturally we keep quiet about it
1	she ’ s only nine , remarked xifeng
1	your proposal is undoubtedly correct , general , replied the prefect
1	if i ate it myself , of course i would pay
1	i do appreciate her thoughtfulness
1	in dismay baoyu hurried to her side to soothe her , but she kept her eyes shut and paid no attention to him
1	how can she be so heartless ?
1	the dance at an end , the herald announced : let all kneel below the steps as the prayer is read
1	this silenced baoyu for some minutes
1	high and low alike were splendidly dressed
1	before she could finish baoyu cried excitedly , you see ?
1	how can you talk like that !
1	good , said jia zheng
1	never having studied them hard , he had since forgotten them and if tested on them now would be floored
1	both angry and amused lady wang exclaimed , what a fool this old woman is !
1	in the midst of this commotion jia lian came back and his cousin described what had happened
1	daiyu was already weeping
1	he proceeded then to the hall and was watching the pages shift screens , clean tables and polish the gold and silver sacrificial vessels , when a boy brought him a card and list
1	the jade had vanished , and they dared not report it
1	but there 's nobody here tonight , and there 's nothing i can do now you have come along
1	my maids are indolent from long indulgence ;
1	i have heard that whoever hits the stars in heaven will be carried away by the king of hell , given a hundred strokes with an iron rod , and shut up in the eighteenth hell , never to become a human being again
1	if all i cared about was my own reputation while other people made trouble drinking or gambling , how could i face my aunt ?
1	she would first fume at them then appeal to their better nature ; and in this way she managed to send off batch after batch of guests after entertaining them all anyhow
1	the old lady smiled
1	whoever ’ s quickest can go on from there
1	since this garden took a year to build , painting it will naturally require two , what with grinding the ink , spreading out the paper , dipping the brushes in the colours and then
1	it ’ s only my nephew
1	you know which of the older girls have most sense
1	he moored the boat by the bank , and walked up to yang 's door to knock
1	we boat people are a respectable lot , said the girl
1	at the same time that scholars were being bribed or deliberately kept ignorant , the rulers carried out a policy of cruel suppression
1	you jump to obey her instructions faster than if they were an imperial edict
1	one of the brothers−in−law was called wang teh and the other wang jen
1	then he blew out his lamp and went to sleep
1	now when i land in trouble he leaves me in the lurch
1	when your grandfather was alive , seeing how rich and influential our family was , he went to great trouble to get connected with us
1	why should i put my head in a tiger ’ s mouth ?
1	only four or five days later , after kuang chao−jen had seen the examiner off , did he come back in his scholar 's cap and gown to pay his respects to his parents
1	two maids protect baoyu 's jade lest
1	after that they cleared the table , some young maids brought in a basin , and as soon as he had rinsed his mouth and washed it was time for xiren and the others to have their meal
1	you are always at home , my friend , said chuang to chih
1	after i have made my report to the authorities , i will wait for you in the capital
1	then you tried to excuse yourself at my expense , calling me petty-minded and quick to take offence
1	i have a smattering of knowledge concerning the hexagrams , astrology , fortune−telling , medicine , surgery , yoga and chemistry , besides knowing how to consult the oracles , said chen ho−fu
1	may i ask what business takes you to chengtu ?
1	while dabbing at her own eyes she turned and took a silk handkerchief from her pillow , tossed him this in silence and covered her face again
1	that day aunt xue asked the others over to a new-year feast
1	little did he expect to beget such degenerates , a houseful of rutting dogs and bitches in heat , day in and day out scratching in the ashes and carrying on with younger brothers-in-law
1	if you are set on starting a poetry club , said daiyu , we must all be poets
1	every day they sent for doctors
1	my name is shen , answered big foot
1	when lovely yu and miss hsiao had given their names , he questioned ma chun−shang and chu hsien−fu
1	the people outside the window , hearing this , went off to attend to their tasks
1	i want you to introduce some ideas of your own
1	one morning , he had just washed and dressed and was thinking to ask his grandmother ’ s permission to pay another visit to his friend , when mingyan peeped round the spirit screen by the inner gate
1	xifeng spat in her face
1	as you were such good friends and he lived all alone here , with no parents or brothers , you ought to make a thorough search for him
1	he said that you were teaching in mr ku 's family
1	didn ’ t we become friends as soon as you arrived here ?
1	he san went out with him
1	after having seen to all this , he went to pay his respects to his grandmother and mother and to have his meal
1	the brothers stepped forward
1	niu yu−fu was most annoyed
1	jia lian asked second sister , but she could not think who it could be
1	i don ’ t care if i never get married
1	i ca not abide him , and that 's that , she declared
1	what happened after that i don ’ t know
1	you must write an inscription for me some time too
1	this is a bushel of my brother 's rice allowance , said yu yu−chung
1	what do you take me for ?
1	is there no way to prevent it ?
1	why should you tell such tales ?
1	she must have gone up to heaven , i suppose , and because i am too vulgar to have any communication with the divine i have not once dreamed of her
1	he then accompanied his mother out and across to the other courtyard
1	at the beginning of the term his father asked the new village scholar , mei chiu , to choose a name for him
1	are you all right now ?
1	no wonder it ’ s growing so chilly
1	my , what are these hard things ?
1	he hurried straight over to him and saluted
1	the knowing maid quickly tucked it in her sleeve and went into jia lian ’ s room , where she showed him the hair with a smile
1	naturally they had no patience with such talk
1	this was because he could approach officials directly
1	let me fetch the scales so that you can weigh it
1	if her ladyship asks you why and how so much was spent , people may think we ’ ve been squeezing you !
1	but what was that about your gold phoenix tiara ?
1	that 's the way to do it !
1	she ’ s wasting her love on you
1	that ’ s how a girl should behave if she wants me to love her
1	just now you asked who would stay with miss xichun , she said
1	when the old lady had thanked him the doctor went out with jia lian to write his prescription , then left
1	one tapping the door ’ number to make the scene stand out
1	she found him lying fully dressed on the kang , raptly watching baochai as she combed her hair
1	who am i to be greeted as an equal !
1	in that case , said xiren , let ’ s each have one final cup
1	she began to treat aunt xue as her own mother and baochai and baoqin as her sisters , feeling closer to them than to all the other girls , to the lady dowager ’ s great satisfaction
1	we have not seen each other for half a year , uncle , said shao−ching
1	there ’ s another reason too
1	the blades had the cold gleam of two autumn streams
1	jia qin , a young supervisor ,
1	but they don ’ t have such a strange fragrance , do they ?
1	the news of baoyu ’ s impending wedding to baochai , a prospect which daiyu had dreaded for years , had so enraged her that she had lost her senses
1	meanwhile serving-women had prepared the bier and spread bedding over it
1	do not be such a fool , jeered xifeng
1	after the second watch , when the guests living at a distance had left , they prepared to farewell the dead and the women behind the mourning curtain began to wail
1	and how can i repeat this to madam lian ?
1	that same instant they heard a great clattering on the roo { and watchmen came running to their compound to catch the thieves
1	overjoyed by this news , jia zhen had the timber fetched without delay
1	they know you are a kindhearted , liberal master , who wo not ill−treat them like some other people
1	do you mean those walnut wafers you left by the tiller ?
1	our performance can ’ t possibly measure up to the standard to which these ladies are accustomed
1	baoyu bowed again in his delight and exclaimed , so it ’ s your birthday too , sister !
1	this was , in fact , the tradition in chenyuan prefecture
1	if the parents are snug , of course their sons will prosper
1	they walked along both corridors , and looked at the two libraries and at the building where the meat offerings were inspected
1	he must be hiding somewhere
1	hurrying over , bailiff chai called , little chin !
1	once you know him , you will be able to meet mr hsu
1	' i never spoke to you , said dr yu
1	i shouldn ’ t be surprised if she surpasses even baochai and all the rest of us here
1	you are much more perspicacious than i am
1	baoyu wiped his tears and smiled
1	and since the others had left he asked with a smile , who was that girl in red this afternoon ?
1	this was none other than chao ta , the brigand chief , who looked as fierce as ever with his dishevelled hair and wild eyes
1	besides , he was quite right
1	have you ever heard of such a thing before ?
1	jia lian reflected and said , i remember that year when cousin bao fell ill , we got a man who was not a professional to cure him
1	you did right to admit this
1	pao wen−ching came in , in a black gown and small cap , and knelt to pay his respects
1	thinking her dead , lady xing started sobbing too
1	suspecting from this that sheyue knew what had happened , wuer numbermiled sheepishly and made no reply
1	at this point yuanyang arrived , sent by the old lady to say that she had heard of baoyu 's relapse and xiren must comfort him and talk him round
1	but i ’ ve no paper or brush
1	and after all they ’ re your aunts , for all they ’ re young
1	when you go back , tell your husband from me : this match with the zhang family is out of the question
1	why should they do that ?
1	though there won ’ t be feasts and operas , we ’ ll all have to go with her to spend the day amusing their ladyships , and that won ’ t leave us any spare time
1	in the forty−fifth chapter , when the yu brothers examine the soil and talk of geomancy , their gestures are so well described that we can almost see these fools trying to mystify and impress their hearers
1	don ’ t worry , she told him
1	just buy another half catty then , said bu
1	maybe she has other things on her mind and won ’ t send us away until she ’ s dealt with them
1	after you helped me , lieutenant , i taught for a couple of years and saved up enough money to come home
1	don ’ t fuss , she retorted
1	fifty with me , i will tell you
1	besides , it ’ s not as if we ourselves had read the western chamber and the peony pavilion , which are licentious works
1	the best thing would be for me to take a holiday too , and go back with you
1	what if these two stories are fictitious ?
1	she was sound asleep and covered with peony petals , which had floated over from all sides to scatter , red and fragrant , over her face and clothes
1	what medicine had the doctors prescribed ?
1	i was convinced they ’ d make an ideal couple
1	the lady dowager said , this shows xifeng has good manners
1	lady xing looked round and saw some girls about
1	on the right side of the desk he had piled two sets of old books and one slim volume of essays
1	but who will bury me when dead i lie ?
1	so how could you slip up so as to deserve punishment ?
1	girls enjoy rustic fare at
1	baoyu sips tea in
1	if this is all , i tired of hearing it when my young lady was alive
1	i also had some of his ointment , and was very grateful for it too
1	get rid of him , quick , and fetch some doctor we know
1	they went to change their clothes before going to the reception hall
1	but they said since old mrs fang is being enshrined , they must join in her procession !
1	baoyu , wearing mourning , also went every day to the ning mansion , not returning to the garden till the evening after the guests had left
1	this has nothing to do with us
1	you must come and have breakfast with me tomorrow , and we will call on her together
1	his wife 's arrival roused jia zheng to still greater fury and he belaboured his son yet more mercilessly
1	how stupid of me !
1	i don ’ t want that , chuckled the latter
1	as the shrill music rang out , a little lad who had come to stand beside him clapped his hands and sang one of the songs of li pai
1	and drinking brings out all the worst in him
1	traces of frost stain the clustering flowers ;
1	the courier congratulated him , and the messenger presented a despatch , which had already been opened
1	if we get the loot , there 's no point in staying here we would better go to sea to have a good time , eh ?
1	to the primal void
1	but it was here in our house , objected lady wang
1	once we have the jade , it ’ ll be easy to question the thief
1	no , i ’ ve had enough , said madam you with a smile
1	some of the visitors had met them before
1	sixth master sat there awkwardly , drinking
1	he had no supper yesterday evening and passed a sleepless night , xiren explained
1	in the glare of a hundred torches the prime minister arrived , wu men , the main gate , was opened , and the officials entered through side gates
1	cousin daiyu is different
1	what i really want is a mouthful of hot spirits
1	he asked ssu tou
1	caiyun frantically assured him that she was not on friendly terms with baoyu , nor had she told anyone
1	lady wang was naturally so upset by this account that xifeng had to comfort her
1	none the less he objected , suppose , though , the old lady won ’ t let you go ?
1	i have not called on you to pay my respects , but your ladyship looks in better health than ever
1	the two girls sat down
1	he is a native of chuchow
1	please do not trouble , said mr tung
1	pin−niang knew this woman , of course
1	yoo wants you to teach his son , and would like you to take up your duties soon
1	of course i do !
1	one dish was brought in after another
1	show him in , ordered jia zheng
1	please overlook my negligence , elder sister
1	at once qingwen and others ordered the gate to be locked , and coming back qingwen said :
1	a beautiful invalid has her fortune told in a bawdy house
1	then , pointing at a lute on the wall , he asked , is this yours ?
1	the boy 's name will be changed to pao ting−hsi
1	besides , he told me repeatedly he would not let me give you this unless you offered him some reward
1	baochai , having sized up the situation , told them , let go of him
1	on the third i prepared a small dinner for you , said shen
1	not i , said the abbot
1	you go and rest now
1	it ’ s not that i think them dirty , said daiyu
1	why take the official examination then leave ?
1	xue pan took the pot , baoyu held the cup , and they poured two large cupfuls which feng ziying stood up and drained in a single breath
1	he wrenched himself free and made off
1	you know how much i dislike those vulgar conventions
1	you should not have done this , said mr lu
1	i am sorry i passed the district examination , since it means i have to address the local magistrate as my patron !
1	now you turn up with more yourself
1	surely you can taste the difference ?
1	i really can ’ t stand your household any longer !
1	do not you mind hurting her feelings ?
1	they feasted all day
1	madam lian says you and the young ladies must not laugh at her greediness , madam , she reported
1	i wouldn ’ t mind you finding another wife for your brother in-law , she sobbed
1	the lady dowager smiled sarcastically
1	he was laid up for three days with a cold , and when i went to see him he told me what had happened
1	she offered them tea in the outer room and after sitting quietly for a while they left , having asked her to let baoyu know that they had called
1	baoyu waited , mystified , until jia qiang arrived with a bird-cage containing a bird and a miniature stage
1	still green the smoke from tea brewed in a rare tripod ;
1	i can take him a message for you
1	don ’ t believe what those children say , miss , they begged siqi
1	so i ’ ve brought it back
1	we just looked on this as an outing , but they have sent offerings under the impression that we are making a serious sacrifice of it
1	you don ’ t understand , said zixing
1	she came when summoned in great fear and trembling
1	fluting cast a subtle enchantment over men ’ s senses ,
1	after drinking several cups of wine , tears rolled down mr
1	only , having been unwell recently and in view of all the troubles in the household , he had not yet referred the matter higher up
1	was about to explain that she wanted no special consideration from baoyu but he had recently shown too little ' to his maids , when someone outside the courtyard gate shouted , that monk is back again
1	has baoyu been up to anything improper ?
1	the next morning chi wei−hsiao called with tsung chi , who had served in the prince 's palace
1	sixth master called for more wine to drink , while they listened to her singing
1	this is even greater nonsense !
1	you two have grown tired of making fun of me every day , so now you ’ re picking on her
1	kai called his son out to mind the shop , then walked off with the old man through the south gate
1	not lingering by breezy spring 's peach and plum blossom
1	that ’ s enough , she cried
1	she added , may i make so bold , now that i am here , to suggest something , madam
1	when they had begged chin to do all he could , he left
1	the brothers had no sooner sat down than they ordered whiskers yiu to buy them two new square caps , as well as baskets , bronze receptacles , awnings , door−curtains , stoves , candlesticks , candle−scissors , and bags for their papers — two of each
1	where do you want to go ?
1	they drank tea and talked about the salt trade , after which a feast was spread with two tables each laid for two
1	let us go there together now
1	but this time our mistresses are too pernickety !
1	they had barely sat down , however , when the gate−keeper came in
1	and as he doesn ’ t mind how he behaves himself , you can ’ t blame his cousins and nephews for not being afraid of him
1	here in the boat
1	how can you compare yourself with me ?
1	it was the old lady and mistress who told us to call him baoyu , so as to make him live longer and keep him out of danger , they said
1	fortunate that her mother
1	to learn what followed , turn to the next chapter
1	it 's bacon , said chu−ko after a couple of mouthfuls
1	presently , wringing her hands , she shrieked with pain , her eyes nearly starting from her head , blood trickling from her mouth , her hair dishevelled
1	the pillar of the earth i stayed beside ;
1	after some conversation they dined and went to bed
1	surprised that he had been so indiscreet as to acknowledge his preference for her openly
1	now , honourable readers , though certain things are predestined and can not be helped , it is wrong for sons of concubines or ministers of vanquished states as well as for men of principle and chaste women to keep using this phrase as a handy excuse
1	in the middle , 'three and six ' make nine
1	otherwise other people will follow your example and make fun of her too
1	they searched all day in vain
1	if he were there and saw these books , his praise would make all the printers rush to have them
1	last time i had a bad fright till we heard it was just a rumour
1	by winter next year , when her cousins will have gone , it will be still quieter
1	pinger sent me to report this to you , madam
1	since your young mistress is in luck , of course you as her maid will be lucky too , which is more than your sister xiren can count on
1	this is no place for you to bicker and wrangle
1	take that as your subject , he said
1	i am faint with hunger
1	rubbish , said his father
1	when baoyu had assented he went on , i have told your brother ruan and your nephew lan to do some revision too
1	down south there they have so many ancient firs , they just extract the essence of the fungus on the roots and mix it with some kind of medicine to make this handsome snowy white pachyma cocos powder
1	it was only a slight chill
1	what sort of creature will he grow up to be ?
1	and , finally , kang hsi set up the bureau for the compilation of the ming dynasty history , which was joined even by scholars who had hitherto refused to work for the manchus , for they feared lest otherwise ming dynasty history might be distorted
1	a big varnished table with a felt cover will be needed too
1	that ’ s the way to do it
1	but good looks and a sweet dispostition are hard to find
1	people not knowing the truth may think her cross-grained , when in fact it ’ s all due to this illness which has upset her liver and weakened her heart
1	they ’ ve written year after year inviting us to visit the capital
1	i don ’ t like incense perfumes
1	my family was poor , and we lived for ten years in a house rented from the nunnery ; so i often went in to see her when i was free , and she ’ s the one who taught me all the characters i know
1	time enough to worry then
1	to plant them by the fence before my court ;
1	bring the gentlemen 's luggage aboard here , and send their boat back
1	as soon as they arrived , baochai sat down and announced teasingly , you must kneel down
1	jia qiang asked with a smile
1	jia she and jia zheng led the way , followed by two old nurses with horn-lanterns
1	at once jia rong ’ s wife qin keqing said with a smile : we have a room ready here for uncle baoyu
1	if you both sleep on that clothes-warmer , i ’ ll be all alone out here
1	but no more of this
1	if a match between the gold and the jade was predestined , how could baoyu lose the jade ?
1	she soon noticed , however , that madam you was not her usual amiable self , simply sitting there lost in thought
1	his rule is strengthened by great bells of bronze ,
1	the lady dowager , hearing this , called over her shoulder to xifeng , your third cousin 's place is pleasant
1	in all the garden , not just these apartments , which servant have you ever seen reprimand her children in the master ’ s rooms ?
1	we can see this is no ordinary beauty
1	he ’ s lost over ten taels already , but he never pays up
1	just wait with an easy mind , cousin , he urged him
1	it ’ s been reported to me that liu er ’ s wife and her younger sister ran gambling parties together , but mrs liu was really the one behind it
1	when this garden was built there was a detailed architect ’ s drawing , and though it was done by craftsmen the lay-out and directions are accurate
1	where have you come from ?
1	on her orders the maid hurriedly fetched one of the pages and , standing outside the window , he paid his respects
1	naturally we shall not press you , said lou chan , hastily calling for tea
1	as they thanked him for going to such trouble , they left the garden and made their way to the lady dowager ’ s quarters
1	some of them showed good sense , some were quite subtle
1	if that ’ s how you feel , you ’ d better hire a special company to play my favourite pieces instead of expecting me to cash in on someone else ’ s birthday
1	i did wonder , though , how that could be , as she had been in good health
1	as we travelled here together , i know her character and what she ’ s like
1	ruiguan was delighted with it
1	his scholarship and moral character are excellent , and he ’ s a southerner too
1	this is not yet the time for you to entertain guests
1	skirting the hedge , shereached a moon-gate and stepped through it
1	that temple you just visited is on fire !
1	when magistrate hsiang opened the commissioner 's letter he was amazed and hastily ordered his men to open the gate of his house and invite mr pao in , going out himself to welcome him
1	so how could they make a check ?
1	blessed by imperial favour , we would fain
1	once i have closed my eyes and breathed my last , they can quarrel and storm as much as they like
1	it ’ s all right as long as we don ’ t get really drunk
1	i see the point of this place , declared jia zheng
1	heaven is yang and the earth yin , for instance
1	as the young man had not risen to the bait , jingui feared baochan might despise her for this fiasco and therefore tried to cover up , changing her tune
1	you wouldn ’ t care for this stuff
1	who cares about your gold and jade anyway ?
1	if i could live and die with such a man , i would not be grieving and pining away like this !
1	they sat up apprehensively till dawn , when daiyu seemed a little better
1	the next day be went back to school as if nothing had happened
1	a child was born , and tiger marked the day
1	some matrons announced that another opera was starting
1	at long last she sobbed :
1	baoyu produced and lit his eaglewood , bowed to it with tears in his eyes , then turned and ordered mingyan to return the incense-burner
1	i never guessed that he was no more
1	a monk came out to greet them , but when he knew their errand he refused them admittance
1	daiyu continued , the last two lines of your verse are all very well
1	how can i live on ?
1	they lay on their beds burning with fever and babbling deliriously
1	i know you are an able organizer , madam ; that 's why i asked you here to decide
1	not yet , said the child
1	since feng chun−jui is a chinese scholar , the prestige of the court is at stake , replied tang
1	but we can hardly go and dig up graves , can we ?
1	the young ladies plus their maids come to forty or fifty people , yet each day we get only a couple of hens , a couple of ducks , some dozen catties of meat and one string of cash worth of vegetables
1	he is a great blessing to the county
1	soon huang chiu arrived with wang number six
1	don ’ t talk about silver treated like dirt , every precious thing you could name was heaped up like hills , no one bothering to check the wicked waste
1	just now i asked madam lian where you were , and she said you ’ d gone to the garden
1	tanchun said with a smile , there are plenty of silly people ; don ’ t take it so seriously
1	this reminded him of the passage in zhuangzi :
1	the following day yu yu−chung came on foot , with a porter carrying a bushel of rice
1	the first time was when they came to explain the miraculous nature of the jade ; the second time , when baoyu was so ill and the monk took the jade in his hand and intoned some incantation to cure him ; the third time , when he brought back the jade and i saw him sitting in the front hall , then all of a sudden he vanished
1	she ’ s treating you well because she ’ s so exceptionally kind and generous
1	to hog it all myself might bring me bad luck ; and after thinking it over i decided you were the only one fit to share it
1	in the middle , a 'four and a one '
1	she picked up the pouch meaning to cut it to pieces as well
1	when i ’ ve serious business , i consult her ; when there ’ s none , she amuses me
1	they looked at the hall and south corridor , at tripitaka 's burial place and the great frying pan , then went back to the entrance to buy a packet of sweetmeats , and sat down in a tea−house behind the pagoda to drink a pot of tea
1	he 's making my mouth water
1	her clothes and trinkets , which were worth some three or four hundred taels , they kept for future use
1	since there was accommodation for both the dead and the living , the mourners escorting coffins had somewhere to stay
1	have you only just woken up to them ?
1	a toad hankering for a taste of swan , scoffed pinger
1	but as you assigned zijuan to my service , madam , i am emboldened to ask you to agree so that she can realize her aspirations
1	when chih and tu had taken these three to inspect the preparation of the meat , they came back to ask chin tung−ya to act as herald , wu shu to signal with the banner , tsang liao−chai to recite the prayers , chi wei−hsiao , hsin tung−chih and yu ho−sheng to present wine , chu hsien−fu , lu hsin−hou and yu kan−chi to present jade , chu−ko tien−shen , ching lan−chiang and kuo tieh−pi to present silk , hsiao chin−hsuan , chu hsin and yin chao to present grain , and chi tien−yi , chin yu−liu and tsung chi to present sacrificial viands
1	if something had given him a turn and brought on another fit , what should we have done ?
1	i spoke frankly , sir , out of concern for you , not wanting to keep anything back , li answered
1	yinger answered with a giggle , those two lines seem to match the words on your locket , miss
1	we should both mind our own business
1	then the window paper rustled
1	in the beginning creation had no abode ;
1	they helped him out to rest
1	we all ought to take steps
1	the day will come when you ’ re raided too
1	invite him in here , replied dr yu
1	if this is some other business , that ’ s not my affair ; but if it ’ s about those little novices , you must handle it my way
1	i am not dying yet a while
1	baoyu knew that she was teasing , and baochai blushed scarlet
1	he walked forward with a smile
1	asked the old lady
1	he was born in the forty−first year of kang hsi , when the manchus had completed their conquest of china proper and were suppressing the minority peoples in the frontier regions
1	it ’ s not quite dry yet
1	like water did its lovely fragrance flow :
1	yes , said lady wang
1	for further details , read the next chapter
1	then the runner quietly picked up a brick , charged forward like an avenging fury and hit the other man 's head with the brick so that the blood gushed out
1	just what i think , agreed qingwen
1	you are absolutely right !
1	in exile rather would i meet my end ,
1	inviting her in she said :
1	on his way home from nanking after taking the provincial examination , dr yu caught cold and fell ill
1	then he conducted them into the library , in front of which was a small garden furnished with a lyre , goblets , a stove and some stands
1	when they came to the west , hsiao chin−hsuan bearing grain and chi tien−yi bearing viands led the master of sacrifice down the west side , passing in front of the incense table and turning east
1	lan said nothing , only smiled
1	yet another girl announced , breakfast is ready
1	after this harangue tanchun resumed her seat in silence
1	when they heard this and noticed huan ’ s absence — though earlier on he had been running all over the place — they suspected him but were unwilling to say so
1	cried kuo , falling to the ground
1	she ’ s gone up in my estimation
1	tomorrow i ’ ll ask her ladyship ’ s leave to go home
1	there are twelve big screens and four small ones for kang
1	when niu pu came back inside , he was met by an angry , red−faced pu hsin
1	well , set your heart at rest
1	as for the chestnuts , she had pretended to hanker after them to make him forget the junket , for fear of a repetition of that incident involving maple-dew tea which had landed qianxue in trouble
1	sure that they must share the same views , he felt he had found a friend after his own heart ; but since this was their first meeting he had to hold himself in check , the more so as jia huan and jia lan were present
1	this priest also frequented the ning and rong mansions , where he had come to be known as one-plaster wang ; for he claimed that his plasters were so efficacious that each could cure all manner of different ailments
1	yang was old and asthmatic and needed someone to attend to him during the night ; so he sent for his second son
1	if instead of that we just report it , lady xing may make excuses in order to shift the responsibility
1	i do not believe it
1	now we have received an imperial decree forbidding the slaughter of cows , and our superiors have ordered us to see that this rule is strictly enforced
1	as soon as the meal was finished , a woman from the ning mansion arrived with an indent for incense and lamps
1	he whispered the answer to baoyu , who took the hint and secretly told his grandmother
1	away ! '' she cried `` set craven doubt aside ,
1	please don ’ t stand in their way , madam
1	xiangyun hastily struck the stove again
1	you don ’ t understand , replied lady wang with a laugh
1	xin told them then how the two actors cold-shouldered losers and made up to winners
1	i expect he ’ s on his way now , travelling day and night , and will be here in little more than a fortnight
1	on days when the old lady ’ s in a good humour she lets him drink all he wants , but on other days she won ’ t let him touch a drop
1	then a feast was spread and they sat down to eat
1	the money came from
1	though siqi ’ s parents belong to the elder master ’ s household , her uncle works here
1	just sing a couple of scenes to amuse these ladies with our amateur style
1	and when zijuan inside heard what baoyu meant to do , even more frantic than the rest she completely forgot her resolve to remain aloof and ran out to help restrain him
1	is that a good omen or a bad one ?
1	i have two or three hundred taels of silver to spend on compiling a collection of essays
1	i thought it was something different , but it 's only the same again
1	in the third , the old women won ’ t be working hard all year for nothing , but will have a few perks
1	numbercr mind in a turmoil of anguish , she burst out weeping again until soon she was perspiring
1	she ’ s deliberately needling me !
1	last time you said it could not be true , today you say it is
1	instead of rising to offer her a seat , he simply stared at her with a foolish grin
1	what are you up to now ?
1	little did i think the magistrate today would record my official robes and rank on that despatch
1	huan ’ s marriage shouldn ’ t cost more than three thousand , which we can raise easily by cutting down on other expenses
1	when you ’ ve time , drop in again as relatives should
1	just then qiaojie came in with granny liu and pinger , followed by lady wang who lald the whole blame on jia yun and wang ren
1	yen 's illness went from bad to worse
1	it ’ s silly to stay standing here
1	just as i am admiring your courage , i find you are mr hsiao 's son !
1	you need have no anxiety on that score , replied chen with a smile
1	the magistrate is a friend of my brother 's !
1	the party broke up long ago and the old lady ’ s left the garden
1	how is it i didn ’ t know ?
1	i did not go to tell her
1	once they were alone the lady dowager sneered , i hear you ’ ve been doing some matchmaking for you husband
1	she told her maids , take this case to the garden , so that it ’ ll be easier to distribute these presents to the different apartments there
1	why trouble yourself over this ?
1	he will be all right , said pinger
1	pinger came in and said , madam xue sent xiangling over to ask me something
1	i beg your honour to make further investigations
1	baoyu , close behind her , sighed
1	he simply coughed by way of comment , after which both of them retired for the night
1	dynasties rise and fall , mornings change to evenings ; winds from the river bring down old trees from a former reign ; and fame , riches , rank may vanish without a trace
1	ginseng ’ s expensive , rejoined baochai with a smile
1	from the beam of an empty room your nest will fall
1	now jia zheng suddenly remembered his presence
1	why are you so hot and bothered ?
1	and tanchun , told by the old lady to join them , after first declining the honour sat down opposite baoqin , shishu then brought out a bowl and chopsticks
1	alpinia fills the courtyard free from dust ,
1	feeling easier in his mind he called for water to wash in and decided to stay quietly at home for a couple of days , partly to rest , partly to avoid outside contacts
1	i ’ ve a bad enough reputation as it is
1	then i went to her ladyship 's place just as she was looking through some cases with madam lian and the concubines zhao and zhou , sorting out the bright clothes she would worn in her young days to give away
1	next day , at the crack of dawn , baoyu scrambled into his clothes
1	just then , however , the prince 's steward announced , the guards at the gate say that his majesty has sent the prince of beijing to proclaim another decree and they ask the commissioner to receive him
1	noticing that the alcohol sprayed on pinger ’ s clothes was now almost dry , he pressed the clothes with the iron and folded them neatly
1	it ’ s good of you to think of such things , but you mustn ’ t overwork , he answered
1	if it were a pregnancy , the liver humour should be strong
1	this said , he went off with xinger
1	go to your grandfather 's grave , he said , and tell him that i am growing old and the weather is too cold for me to come myself to wish him a happy new year
1	with that she served tea
1	when it came to saying goodbye to the girls , she was prostrated by grief
1	a bridge across this pool led you to three secluded chambers where tu shao−ching used to retire to study
1	there 's only one decent room in it
1	they ate until sunset , by which time butcher hu was tipsy
1	she simply replied , ~'all right , let her take a rest
1	you will be questioned in chiangtu county
1	i ’ ll help you find it
1	ching lan−chiang looked up
1	next she asked for the box of rhyme cards , pulled out the thirteenth drawer and told the maid to pick four cards at random
1	fang kuo−chen occupied chekiang , chang shih−cheng occupied soochow , and chen yiuliang occupied hukuang
1	one of them had already picked up a brush and written a short preface based on ha zheng ’ s account simply changing a few words
1	so much the better
1	i shall come with my son to pay our respects in less than a fortnight , he said
1	please give my regards to mr kao and mr chin when you go back
1	inside , verandahs on both sides led to a three-roomed entrance hall in the middle of which stood a screen of marble in a red sandalwood frame
1	may i make so bold as to ask to have a glimpse of the lady ’ s face , so that i can see how she looks before venturing to make out a prescription
1	do not make a fuss about it
1	thank you for coming !
1	our prefect issued a circular saying he is a dangerous criminal , so summonses have been sent to the different provinces
1	he deserves to die , xifeng snorted
1	they greeted the assembled company , and sat down
1	three ancient kings there were so pure and true
1	and our young lady ’ s the one who dotes on him most
1	do not let this rumpus he kicked up upset you
1	seeing how put out he looked and knowing what a sentimentalist he was , she decided to use his infatuation to cure him
1	one gateman went in and reported this , handing jia zheng the letter which he opened and read :
1	only jia lan stayed with his mother and studied hard , writing compositions which he took to school for jia dairu to correct ; but as recently the tutor had been confined to his bed the boy had at present to study on his own
1	soon all her hair had come down
1	i ’ ve a patient taking medicine in my place too now
1	i shall have a good talk with her too
1	the magistrate signed a warrant and sent runners to yen 's house to arrest him , but he had flown
1	so far the old lady knows nothing about this business
1	their distant relatives did not come , however , and neither did jia she
1	she 's very good-looking , answered jia qiang , and nearly fourteen already
1	chin , you must give mr kao the wherewithal to take with him
1	my apartments are the largest , let 's meet there
1	now , with this other one here , i should be able to crack down on them hard !
1	today baochai came to visit her and turned the conversation to her illness
1	complained fangguan , just ladling some soup on the rice and eating a bowlful with two pieces of goose
1	luckily her remark had been heard only by baoyu and baochai
1	later you can explain to madam lian yourself , miss
1	you needn ’ t worry , she urged
1	sit down next to me and i will tell you
1	two days later the lists were published — neither of them had passed
1	that is why this temple was built and offerings are made to his image
1	a man may be awe-inspiring and exalted ,
1	thus we see how the actor pao wen−ching helps old ni and the kindness of the monk in sweet dew temple to niu pu−yi
1	it 's because you are so good at it that you got kicked right under your heart yesterday
1	in that case i must see her today
1	jia lian attended the funeral ceremonies at pear fragrance court for seven days and seven nights , during which monks and priests chanted sutras
1	xifeng teased , when an old ancestress wants to celebrate some grandchild ’ s birthday , no matter how grandly , who are we to protest ?
1	i have been working all this time in your house , sir , said the tailor
1	but after the mid−autumn festival the doctors stopped prescribing medicine , and all the stewards and servants were summoned back from the estates
1	when i asked at the board of punishments , i did not hear the result of the two princes ' report but was told that this morning censor li brought another charge against the prefect of pingan , accusing him of pandering to an official in the capital and oppressing the people to please his superior there were several serious charges
1	he taught girls horsemanship and archery ,
1	then young xue , who will never give an inch to anyone , ordered his men to beat feng yuan into a pulp
1	and even as they rose to their feet she came in
1	after giving furthef instrutions to other members of the family , jia zheng bade farewell to tbe ancestral shrine , had sutras chanted for a few days at the temple outside the city , then
1	all the rest of his family are as fierce as dragons and tigers ; he 's the only good man of the lot
1	the title-deeds of houses and land and the bonds of the family slaves were also sealed up
1	he made the young eunuch fetch it and gave it to baoyu , who received it with both hands , thanked him and then withdrew
1	last time one of our teachers tested the students of eight counties together , and i was first of the eight
1	since i caused the trouble it ’ s up to me to fix it
1	it ’ s worse for you than for us who are here on our own
1	and instead of seeing to the presents my parents ’ family sent , he sat there swearing and wouldn ’ t bring them in
1	he turned then to welcome xiren who had only just come in
1	who asked your opinion ?
1	naturally those petty-minded people dislike me
1	he called on his maternal uncle bu shiren , number who kept a perfumery from which he had just returned
1	that would be much better
1	it was too bad of you to spoil their fun
1	by climbing fig its fragrance reinforced ;
1	presently it was new year 's eve and old pu 's sons celebrated with wine , a good meal and a charcoal brazier
1	i was not lying about my money , was i ?
1	that is hardly fair
1	zijuan sat down too then beside him
1	hurry up and wake up !
1	after being provoked and further upset by baoyu , zijuan wept the whole night long
