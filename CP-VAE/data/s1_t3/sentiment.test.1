when the goddess nu wa melted down rocks to repair the sky , at baseless cliff in the great waste mountain she made thirty-six thousand five hundred and one blocks of stone , each a hundred and twenty feet high and two hundred and forty feet square .
she used only thirty-six thousand five hundred of these and threw the remaining block down at the foot of blue ridge peak . strange to relate , this block of stone after tempering had acquired spiritual understanding . because all its fellow blocks had been chosen to mend the sky and it alone rejected , it lamented day and night in distress and shame .
one day as the stone was brooding over its fate , it saw approaching from the distance a buddhist monk and taoist priest , both of striking demeanour and distinguished appearance .
they came up to the stone and sat down to chat .
when they saw the pure translucent stone which had shrunk to the size of a fan-pendant , the monk took it up on the palm of his hand and said to it with a smile :
you look like a precious object , but you still lack real value . i must engrave some characters on you so that people can see at a glance that you ’ re something special . then we can take you to some civilized and prosperous realm , to a cultured family of official status , a place where flowers and willows flourish , the home of pleasure and luxury where you can settle down in comfort .
the stone was overjoyed .
and where do you mean to take me ? don ’ t ask . the monk smiled .
you ’ ll find out all in good time .
with that he tucked the stone into his sleeve and hurried off with the taoist . but where they went no one knows .
after no one knows how many generations or aeons , a taoist known as reverend void , searching for the way and immortality , came to great waste mountain , baseless cliff and the foot of blue ridge peak . his eye fell on the inscription on a large stone which was still discernible and he read it through . it was an account of the stone ’ s rejection for repairing heaven , its transformation and conveyance to the world of men by the buddhist of infinite space and the taoist of boundless time , and the joys and sorrows , partings and encounters , warm and cold treatment from others it had experienced there .
unfit to mend the azure sky , i passed some years on earth to no avail ; my life in both worlds is recorded here ;
there followed the name of the region where the stone fell , the place of its incarnation , and the story of its adventures including trivial family affairs and light verses written to amuse idle hours . the dynasty , year and country ’ s name were , however , obliterated . the reverend void said to the stone : brother stone , you seem to think that your tale recorded here is interesting enough to merit publication .
in my view , in the first place , there is no way of finding out the dynasty and the year ; in the second , there is nothing here about worthy and loyal ministers and how they regulated the government and public morality . there are merely some girls remarkable only for their passion or folly , or else for their small gifts and trifling virtues which can not even compare with those of such talented ladies as ban zhao or cai yan.4 even if i were to transcribe it , it would hardly arouse much interest .
protested the stone with a smile . if there ’ s no way of finding out the date , you can easily ascribe this tale to some time in the han or tang dynasty . but since all novels do that , i think my way of dispensing with this convention and just dealing with my own adventures and feelings is more original .
why insist on a certain dynasty or definite date ? besides , most common people of the market-place much prefer light literature to improving books .
even worse are those writers of the breeze-and-moonlight school , who corrupt the young with pornography and filth . as for books of the beauty-and-talented-scholar type , a thousand are written to a single pattern and none escapes bordering on indecency . they are filled with allusions to handsome , talented young men and beautiful , refined girls in history ; but in order to insert a couple of his own love poems , the author invents stereotyped heroes and heroines with the inevitable low character to make trouble between them like a clown in a play , and makes even the slave girls talk pedantic nonsense .
much better are the girls i have known myself during my young days . i wouldn ’ t presume to rank them as superior to all the characters of earlier works , yet their stories may serve to dispel boredom and care while the few doggerels i have inserted may raise a laugh and add zest to wine . as for the scenes of sad partings and happy meetings , prosperity and decline , these are all true to fact and not altered in the slightest to cause a sensation or depart from the truth .
all their leisure is taken up with amorous adventures , material acquisition or trouble-making . what time do they have to read political and moral treatises ? i neither want people to marvel at this story of mine , nor do i insist that they should read it for pleasure ; i only hope they may find distraction here when they are sated with food and wine or searching for some escape from worldly cares .
so the taoist changed his name to the passionate monk and changed the title of the book from the tale of the stone to the record of the passionate monk .
later cao xueqin in his mourning-the-red studio pored over the book for ten years and rewrote it five times . he divided it into chapters , furnished headings for each , and renamed it the twelve beauties of jinling .
kong meixi of eastern lu suggested the title precious mirror of love .
penned with bitter tears ;
all men call the author mad ,
none his message hears .
now that the origin of the story is clear , let us see what was recorded on the stone .
long ago the earth dipped downwards in the southeast , and in that southeast part was a city named gusu ; and the quarter around changmen gate of gusu was one of the most fashionable centres of wealth and nobility in the world of men . outside this changmen gate was a certain ten-li street , off which ran the lane of humanity and purity ; and in this lane stood an old temple , which being built in such a narrow space was known from its shape as gourd temple .
beside this temple lived a gentleman named zhen fei , whose courtesy name was shiyin . his wife , née feng , was a worthy virtuous woman with a strong sense of propriety and right .
although neither very rich nor noble , their family was highly regarded in that locality . zhen shiyin had a quiet disposition . instead of hankering after wealth or rank , he was quite happy tending flowers , growing bamboos , sipping wine or writing poems spending his time very much like an immortal .
one thing alone was lacking : he was now over fifty but had no son , only a three-year-old daughter named yinglian .
one long hot summer day as shiyin was sitting idly in his study , the book slipped from his hand and , leaning his head on the desk , he fell asleep .
in dream he travelled to an unknown place , where he suddenly noticed a monk and a taoist approaching , talking together . he heard the taoist ask : where do you mean to take that stupid object ?
don ’ t worry , replied the monk .
so another batch of amorous sinners are bent on making trouble by reincarnation , commented the taoist . where will this drama take place ? it ’ s an amusing story .
in the west , on the bank of the sacred river , beside the stone of three incarnations there grew a vermilion pearl plant which was watered every day with sweet dew by the attendant shen ying in the palace of red jade . as the months and years went by and the vermilion pearl plant imbibed the essences of heaven and earth and the nourishment of rain and dew , it cast off its plant nature and took human form , albeit only that of a girl . all day long she roamed beyond the sphere of parting sorrow , staying her hunger with the fruit secret love and quenching her thirst at the sea of brimming grief .
he gave me sweet dew , said vermilion pearl , but i ’ ve no water to repay his kindness . if he ’ s going down to the world of men , i would like to go too so that if i repay him with as many tears as i can shed in a lifetime i may be able to clear this debt .
just then , as it happened , shen ying was seized with a longing to assume human form and visit the world of men , taking advantage of the present enlightened and peaceful reign . he made his request to the goddess of disenchantment , who saw that this was a chance for vermilion pearl to repay her debt of gratitude .
that certainly is odd , remarked the taoist . i ’ ve never heard of repayment with tears before .
that would be a worthy deed . exactly what i was thinking . but first we must take this stupid object to the palace of the goddess of disenchantment and clear all the formalities .
give her to me !
give her to me !
losing patience , shiyin clasped his daughter more tightly and was turning to reenter the house when the monk pointed at him and let out a roar of laughter . he then declaimed : fool , to care for this tender child :
beware what will follow the lantern feast , the vanishing like smoke when the fire burns out . shiyin , hearing this clearly , wondered what it meant . before he could ask , the taoist told the monk :
this is where our paths divide . each must go about his own business . three aeons from now i shall wait for you at mount beimang , and together we can go to the land of illusion to have this affair expunged from the register .
shiyin realized then that these were no ordinary men and regretted not having questioned them . his rueful reflections were cut short by the arrival of a poor scholar who lived next door in gourd temple . his name was jia hua , his courtesy name shifei , and his pen-name yucun .
a native of huzhou , he was the last of a line of scholars and officials . his parents had exhausted the family property and died leaving him alone in the world . since nothing was to be gained by staying at home , he had set out for the capital in the hope of securing a position and restoring the family fortunes .
nothing , was the reply . my little girl was crying , so i brought her out to play . you couldn ’ t have arrived at a better moment , as i was feeling thoroughly bored .
he told a servant to take his daughter inside , and led yucun into his study , where a boy served tea .
they had not exchanged many remarks when a servant hurried in to announce the arrival of a certain mr. yan .
then shiyin excused himself , saying , forgive my rudeness . do you mind waiting here for a few minutes ? don ’ t stand on ceremony , sir , said yucun , rising .
so after shiyin went to the front room yucun passed the time by leafing through some books , until he heard a young woman coughing outside . he slipped over to the window and looked out . it was a maid picking flowers .
she had uncommon features , bright eyes and graceful eyebrows , and although no great beauty she possessed considerable charm . yucun stared at her , spell-bound . just as she was leaving with her flowers , the girl abruptly looked up and caught sight of him .
his clothes were shabby yet he was powerfully built with an open face , firm lips , eyebrows like scimitars , eyes like stars , a straight nose and rounded cheeks . she turned away thinking to herself , he ’ s a fine-looking man for all his tattered clothes .
this must be the jia yucun my master keeps talking about , whom he ’ d gladly help if only he had the chance . yes , i ’ m sure it ’ s him , our family has no other friends who are poor . no wonder my master also says he ’ s a man who won ’ t remain long in this plight .
she could not resist looking back a couple of times .
presently the boy came back and let yucun know that the guest was staying to a meal . since this made it out of the question to wait any longer , yucun went through a passage to the side gate and left . and after the departure of mr. yan , shiyin did not trouble to invite him back .
in time the mid-autumn festival came round . after the family meal , shiyin had another table laid in his study and strolled over in the moonlight to the temple to invite yucun over .
ever since the zhens ’ maid had looked back that day , yucun flattered himself that she was well-disposed to him and thought of her constantly . as he gazed at the full moon , his thoughts turned to her again and he declaimed this verse : not yet divined the fate in store for me ,
my shadow in the wind is all i see , will she by moonlight keep me company ? if sensibility were in its power
he chanted the couplet : the jade in the box hopes to fetch a good price , the pin in the casket longs to soar on high .
i see you have high ambitions , brother yucun ! not in the least , replied yucun , somewhat embarrassed . i was merely reciting some lines by a former poet .
i don ’ t aspire so high . to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit ? tonight is mid-autumn , commonly known as the festival of reunion .
soon they had finished their tea and sat down to a collation of choice wine and delicacies . at first they sipped slowly , but their spirits rose as they talked and they began to drink more recklessly . the sound of flutes and strings could be heard from all the houses in the neighbourhood ; everywhere was singing ; and overhead the bright moon shone in full splendour .
the two men became very merry and drained cup after cup .
why didn ’ t you say so before ?
i ’ ve often wondered about this , but since you never mentioned it i didn ’ t like to broach the subject . if that ’ s how things are , dull as i am at least i know what ’ s due to a friend .
luckily the metropolitan examinations are coming up next year .
you must go as fast as you can to the capital and prove your learning in the spring test . i shall count it a privilege to take care of the travelling expenses and other business for you .
he sent his boy in to fetch fifty taels of silver and two suits of winter clothes . the nineteenth is a good day for travelling , he continued . you can hire a boat then and start your journey westward .
how good it will be to meet again next winter after you have soared up to dizzy heights .
yucun accepted the silver and clothes with no more than perfunctory thanks , then said no more of the matter but went on feasting and talking . they did not part until the third watch , when shiyin saw his friend off and returned to his room to sleep until the sun was high in the sky . then , remembering the previous night ’ s business , he decided to write yucun two letters of introduction to certain officials in the capital who might put him up .
but the servant sent to ask his friend over bought back word , the monk says that mr. jia left for the capital at the fifth watch this morning .
he asked the monk to tell you that scholars are not superstitious about lucky or unlucky days but like to act according to reason ; so he had no time to say goodbye in person . this shiyin had to accept .
in a flash the merry festival of lanterns came round and shiyin told his servant huo qi to take yinglian out to see the fireworks and ornamental lanterns .
when he came back she had gone . he made a frantic search for her all night .
she was the middle-aged couple ’ s only child , and her loss nearly drove them distracted . they wept day and night and were tempted to take their own lives . after a month ’ s grief shiyin fell ill , and then his wife .
then , on the fifteenth day of the third month , a fire broke out in gourd temple the monk preparing the sacrifice carelessly let a pan of oil catch fire and soon the window paper was alight .
since most of the nearby buildings had bamboo walls and were probably doomed to destruction , the flames spread from house to house until the whole street was ablaze like a flaming mountain . soldiers and civilians tried to put out the fire , but it was beyond control . the conflagration raged for a whole night and destroyed none knew how many houses before it burned itself out .
he and his wife decided then to go and live on their farm . but the last few year ’ s harvests had been ruined by flood and drought and the countryside was overrun by bandits who seized fields and land , giving the people no peace . the punitive expeditions by government troops only made matters worse .
you should know that all good things in this world must end , and to make an end is good , for there is nothing good which does not end .
one day the elder of the two maids was buying some thread at the gate when she heard men shouting to clear the street , and people said the new prefect had arrived to take up office .
she hid in the doorway to watch . first soldiers and runners marched past two by two .
then came a large sedan-chair in which was seated an official in a black gauze cap and red robe . the maid stared in surprise and thought : his face looks familiar . have i seen him somewhere before ?
but once back in the house she thought no more of the matter . that evening , just as they were going to bed , there came a loud knocking on the gate and a clamour of voices . messengers from the yamen ordered feng su to appear for questioning by the prefect .
to find out , read the next chapter . lady jia dies in the city of yangzhou leng zixing describes the rong mansion
my son-in-law ’ s name is zhen , but he left home a year or two ago to become a priest .
is he the man you want ? how would we know ?
we ’ re here on the prefect ’ s orders . if you ’ re his father-in-law , you must come and clear this up with his honour to save us another trip . giving feng su no chance to protest they dragged him off , while his whole household trembled , not knowing what this portended .
towards the end of the second watch he returned in the highest of spirits . asked what had happened , he told them : this new prefect , jia hua , is a native of huzhou and an old friend of my son-in-law .
when he passed our gate and saw our jiaoxing buying thread , he supposed that shiyin had moved his household here .
he seemed very upset when i explained all that had happened .
he asked after my granddaughter too and i told him she was lost on the feast of lanterns . never mind , said his honour . i ’ ll have a search made and i ’ m certain we shall find her .
at the end of our conversation , as i was leaving , he gave me two taels of silver .
and so the night passed .
early the next morning a messenger arrived from jia yucun with two packets of silver and four lengths of brocade for mrs. zhen as a token of gratitude .
there was also a confidential letter for feng su asking him to persuade mrs. zhen to let the prefect have jiaoxing as his secondary wife .
eager to please the prefect , he prevailed on his daughter to agree and that very same night put jiaoxing in a small sedan-chair and escorted her to the yamen . we need not dwell on yucun ’ s satisfaction . he gave feng su a hundred pieces of silver and sent mrs. zhen many gifts , urging her to take good care of her health while he ascertained her daughter ’ s whereabouts .
feng su went home and there we can leave him . now jiaoxing was the maid who had looked back at yucun that year in gusu , little dreaming that one casual glance could have such an extraordinary outcome . and so doubly kind was fate that within a year of marriage she bore a son ; while after another half year yucun ’ s wife contracted a disease and died , and then he made jiaoxing his wife , further improving her position .
a single chance hiatus
yucun , after receiving shiyin ’ s gift of silver that year , had left on the sixteenth for the capital . he did so well in the examinations that he became a palace graduate and was given a provincial appointment . he had now been promoted to this prefectship .
but although a capable administrator yucun was grasping and ruthless , while his arrogance and insolence to his superiors made them view him with disfavour . in less than two years they found a chance to impeach him . he was accused of ingrained duplicity , tampering with the rites and , under a show of probity , conspiring with his ferocious underlings to foment trouble in his district and make life intolerable for the local people .
the emperor , much incensed , sanctioned his dismissal . the arrival of this edict rejoiced the hearts of all officials in the prefecture .
after handing over his affairs he gathered together the capital accumulated during his years in office and moved his household back to his native place . having settled them there he set off , the wind on his back , moonlight in his sleeves , to see the famous sights of the empire . one day his travels again took him to yangzhou , where he learned that the salt commissioner that year was lin hai his courtesy name was lin ruhai - who had come third in a previous imperial examination and recently been promoted to the censorate .
he had been little more than a month in this present post . one of lin ruhai ’ s ancestors five generations earlier had been ennobled as a marquis . the rank had been conferred for three generations ; then , as the benevolence of the present gracious emperor far exceeded that of his noble predecessors , he had as a special favour extended it for one more generation , so that lin ruhai ’ s father had inherited the title as well .
now he was in his forties and his only son had died at the age of three the previous year .
he had several concubines but fate had not granted him another son , and he could not remedy this . by his wife , nee ’ jia , he had a daughter daiyu just five years old . both parents loved her dearly .
and because she was as intelligent as she was pretty , they decided to give her a good education to make up for their lack of a son and help them forget their loss . it so happened that yucun had caught a chill which laid him up in his inn for a month and more .
exhausted by his illness , and short of funds , he was searching for somewhere to recuperate . fortunately he had two old friends here who knew that the sale commissioner was looking for a tutor . upon their recommendation yucun was given the post , which provided the security he needed .
he was lucky , too , to have as pupil only one small girl accompanied by two maids . since the child was so delicate , her lessons were irregular and this meant that his duties were light . in a twinkling another year went by and then his pupil ’ s mother unexpectedly fell ill and died .
he had scarcely set foot inside the door when one of the men who was drinking there rose to his feet and accosted him with a laugh .
fancy meeting you here !
it was leng zixing , a curio-dealer whom he had met in the capital .
i ’ d no idea you were in these parts .
what a coincidence , meeting you here .
i went home at the end of last year and stopped here on my way back to the capital to look up an old friend . he was good enough to ask me to stay , and since i ’ ve no urgent business i ’ m breaking my journey for a couple of days . i shall go on about the middle of the month .
my friend ’ s busy today , so i came out for a stroll and stopped here to rest .
i ’ d no idea i ’ d run into you like this .
he made yucun sit down at his table and ordered more food and wine .
is there any news from the capital ? nothing much , replied zixing . but something rather curious has happened in the house of one of your noble kinsmen .
you have the same surname even if you don ’ t belong to the same clan . yucun asked to whom he alluded . the jia family of the rong mansion .
since the time of jia fu of the eastern han dynasty its branches have multiplied until now you find jias in every province .
impossible to keep track of them all . the rong branch and mine are , however , on the same clan register , but they ’ re so grand that we ’ ve never claimed relationship and are gradually drifting further and further apart .
both the ning and rong branches have declined . they ’ re not what they used to be .
it ’ s a long story .
last year when i was in jinling,1 said yucun , on my way to visit the six dynasty ruins i went to the stone city and passed the gates of their old mansions .
practically the whole north side of the street is taken up by their houses , the ning mansion on the east and the rong mansion adjoining it on the west .
true , there wasn ’ t much coming and going outside their gates , but over the wall i caught glimpses of most imposing halls and pavilions , while the trees and rockeries of the gardens behind had a flourishing , opulent look . there was nothing to suggest a house in decline . for a palace graduate you ’ re not very smart .
a centipede dies but never falls down , as the old saying goes . although they ’ re not as prosperous as before , they ’ re still a cut above ordinary official families . their households are increasing and their commitments are growing all the time , while masters and servants alike are so used to lording it in luxury that not one of them thinks ahead .
who would ’ ve thought that each new generation of this noble and scholarly clan is inferior to the last ? surely , countered yucun in surprise , a family so cultured and versed in etiquette knows the importance of a good upbringing ? i can ’ t vouch for our other branches , but i ’ ve always heard that these two houses take great pains over the education of their sons .
the duke of ningguo and the duke of rongguo were brothers by the same mother .
the elder of his two sons , jia fu , died at the age of eight or nine leaving the younger , jia jing , to inherit the title .
their elder son jia she inherited the title .
when jia daishan died , however , he left a valedictory memorial , and the emperor out of regard for his former minister not only conferred the title on his elder son but asked what other sons there were , granted jia zheng an audience , and as an additional favour gave him the rank of assistant secretary with instructions to familiarize himself with affairs in one of the ministries .
he has now risen to the rank of under-secretary . jia zheng ’ s wife , lady wang , bore him a son called jia zhu who passed the district examination at fourteen , married before be was twenty and had a son , but then fell ill and died . his second child was a daughter , born strangely enough on the first day of the year .
and for that reason his grandmother dotes on him .
his father was furious and swore he ’ d grow up to be a dissolute rake . because of this he ’ s not too fond of the boy , but the child ’ s still his grandmother ’ s darling . he ’ s seven or eight now and remarkably mischievous , yet so clever you won ’ t find his equal in a hundred .
you don ’ t know how he ’ s come into the world . i suspect his father is making a mistake as well if he thinks the boy depraved . to understand him you ’ d need to be widely read and experienced , able to recognize the nature of things , grasp the way and comprehend the mystery .
so in order to find some outlet these essences permeate human beings , who come into the world embodying both . such people fall short of sages or perfect men , but neither are they out-and-out villains . the pure intelligence with which they are endowed sets them above their myriad fellow creatures , but their perversity and unnatural behaviour sink them lower than other men too .
people of this type in the past were xu you , tao qian , yuan ji , ji kang and liu ling , the two families of wang and xie , gu kaizhi , chen shubao , the tang emperor minghuang , the song emperor huizong , liu tingzhi , wen tingyun , mi fu , shi yannian , liu yong and qin guan . more recent examples are ni zan , tang yin and zhu yunming . then there are others like li guinian , huang fanchuo , jing xinmo , zhuo wenjun , hongfo , xue tao , cui yingying and zhaoyun .
who doesn ’ t know him ?
the zhen and jia families are interrelated and on a very friendly footing , i ’ ve done business with the zhens a number of times . last year when i was in jinling , said yucun , someone recommended me to the zhens as a resident tutor . i was surprised to find their household so grand , yet it combined wealth with propriety .
but although my pupil was a beginner , he was harder to teach then a candidate for the provincial examination .
here ’ s an example of the absurd things he ’ d say : i must have two girls as company while i study , or i can ’ t learn character my brain gets muddled . he told his pages , the word girl is so honourable and pure , not even the supreme buddhist and taoist titles can compare with it .
you with your filthy mouths and stinking tongues must never violate it . before you utter this word , mind you rinse your mouths with clear water or fragrant tea .
if you don ’ t , your teeth will grow crooked and rip through your cheeks . he had a fearful temper and could be incredibly stubborn and obstreperous ; but as soon as classes were over and he joined the girls he became a different person -- - amiable , sensible and gentle . more than once , because of this , his father thrashed him within an inch of his life , but still that didn ’ t change him .
when the pain became too much for him , he would start yelling , sister !
once the girls in the inner chambers teased him saying , why do you call us when you ’ re being beaten ? do you want us to beg you off ?
you should have heard his answer .
he said , the first time i called i didn ’ t know it would ease the pain . but then i discovered that it worked like magic . so when the pain ’ s worst , i keep on calling sister .
his grandmother indulged him so unwisely that she was often rude to his tutor or blamed her son .
a boy like that is bound to lose the property he inherits and won ’ t benefit by the advice of teachers and friends .
the pity is , all the girls in his family are admirable . the three girls in the jia family aren ’ t bad either , rejoined zixing , jia zheng ’ s elder daughter yuanchun was chosen to be a lady-clerk in the palace of the heir apparent because of her goodness , filial piety and talents .
the second , yingchun , is jia she ’ s daughter by a concubine . the third , tanchun , is jia zheng ’ s daughter by a concubine .
the fourth , xichun , is the younger sister of jia zhen of the ning mansion .
the lady dowager is so attached to these grand-daughters that she makes them study in the rong mansion near her , and i hear good reports of them all . i prefer the zhen family ’ s way of giving their daughters the same sort of names as boys instead of choosing flowery names meaning spring , red , fragrant , or jade , remarked yucun . how could the jia family sink to such vulgarity ?
they named the eldest girl yuanchuns because she was born on new year ’ s day , and so the others have chun in their names too . but all the girls of the last generation had names like those of boys .
for proof , look at the wife of your respected employer mr. lin , the sister of jia she and jia zheng in the rong mansion .
her name , before she married , was jia min .
if you don ’ t believe me , check up when you go back .
yucun pounded the table with a laugh .
no wonder my pupil always pronounces mm as mi and writes it with one or two strokes missing . that puzzled me , but now you ’ ve explained the reason .
and no wonder she talks and behaves so differently from the general run of young ladies nowadays . i suspected she must have had an unusual mother .
if she ’ s a grand-daughter of the rong family that explains it . what a pity that her mother died last month .
she was the youngest of four sisters , but now she ’ s gone too .
it will be interesting to see what husbands they find for the younger generation .
just now you spoke of jia zheng ’ s son born with jade in his mouth , and mentioned a young grandson left by his elder son .
has he no sons ? after the birth of this son with the jade jia zheng had another by his concubine , but i know nothing about him .
so he has two sons and a grandson .
jia lian , the elder , is over twenty now .
two years ago he married a relative , the niece of jia zheng ’ s wife lady wang .
this jia lian , who has bought the rank of a sub-prefect , takes no interest in books but is a smooth man of the world , so he lives with his uncle jia zheng and helps him to manage his domestic affairs . since his marriage he ’ s been thrown into the shade by his wife , who is praised by everybody high and low . i hear she ’ s extremely good-looking and a clever talker .
these people we ’ ve been discussing are probably all pervaded by mixed essences of both good and evil . they are people of similar ways . never mind about good and evil , protested zixing .
we ’ ve been doing nothing but reckoning accounts for others . you must drink another cup . i ’ ve been talking so hard , i ’ m already slightly tipsy .
gossip goes well with wine . why not drink some more ?
yucun looked out of the window .
it ’ s growing late .
let ’ s stroll back and continue our conversation in town .
with that they paid the bill . they were on the point of leaving when a voice from behind called out : congratulations , brother yucun !
yucun turned to look .
but to know who it was , you must read the chapter which follows .
lin ruhai recommends a tutor to his
brother-in-law
the lady dowager sends for her motherless
yucun turned and saw that it was zhang rugui , a native of this place and his former colleague who had also been dismissed from his post for the same reason as himself , and had returned home to yangzhou . now there was word from the capital that a request for the reinstatement of former officials had been sanctioned , and he was busily pulling strings to find some opening .
re congratulated yucun the instant he saw him and lost no time , once greetings had been exchanged , in telling him the good news . yucun was naturally overjoyed , but after some hurried remarks each went his own way .
leng zixing , who had heard everything , at once proposed asking lin ruhai to enlist the support of jia zheng in the capital .
accepting his advice , yucun went back alone to verify the report from the court gazette . the next day he laid his case before lin ruhai .
what a lucky coincidence ! since my wife ’ s death my mother-in-law in the capital has been worried because my daughter has no one to bring her up . she has sent two boats with male and female attendants to fetch the child , but i delayed her departure while she was unwell .
i was wondering how to repay you for your goodness in teaching her : now this gives me a chance to show my appreciation .
set your mind at rest . i foresaw this possibility and have written a letter to my brother-in-law urging him to do all he can for you as a small return for what i owe you . you mustn ’ t worry either about any expenses that may be incurred -- - i ’ ve made that point clear to my brother-in-law .
yucun bowed with profuse thanks and asked : may i know your respected brother-in-law ’ s position ? i fear i am too uncouth to intrude on him . my humble kinsmen belong to your honourable clan .
they ’ re the grandsons of the duke of rongguo . my elder brother-in-law jia she , whose courtesy name is enhou , is a hereditary general of the first rank . my second , jia zheng , whose courtesy name is cunzhou , is an under-secretary in the board of works .
he is an unassuming , generous man who takes after his grandfather .
i ’ ve chosen the second day of next month for my daughter ’ s departure for the capital , continued ruhai .
it would suit both parties , surely , if you were to travel together ?
yucun promptly agreed with the greatest satisfaction , and took the gifts and travelling expenses which ruhai had prepared . his pupil daiyu , who had just got over her illness , could hardly bear to leave her father , but she had to comply with the wishes of her grandmother .
i am nearly fifty and don ’ t intend to marry again , ruhai told her , you ’ re young and delicate , with no mother to take care of you , no sister or brothers to look after you .
if you go to stay with your grandmother and uncles ’ girls , that will take a great load off my mind . how can you refuse ? so parting from him in a flood of tears , she embarked with her nurse and some elderly maid-servants from the rong mansion , followed by yucun and two pages in another junk .
in due course they reached the capital and entered the city . yucun spruced himself up and went with his pages to the gate of the rong mansion , where he handed in his visiting-card on which he had styled himself jia zheng ’ s nephew . jia zheng , who had received his brother-in-law ’ s letter , lost no time in asking him in .
yucun cut an impressive figure and was by no means vulgar in his conversation . since jia zheng was well-disposed to scholars and , like his grandfather before him , delighted in honouring worthy men of letters and helping those in distress , and since moreover his brother-in-law had recommended yucun , he treated him uncommonly well and did all in his power to help him .
the same day that he presented a petition to the throne yucun was rehabilitated and ordered to await an appointment . in less than two months he was sent to jinling to fill the vacated post of prefect of yingtian . taking leave of jia zheng he chose a day to proceed to his new post .
he isn ’ t up to it for the time being .
back in the rong mansion , daiyu alighted again .
the nurses led her eastwards , round a corner , through an entrance hall into a hall facing south , then passed through a ceremonial gate into a large courtyard .
the nurses led her eastwards , round a corner , through an entrance hall into a hall facing south , then passed through a ceremonial gate into a large courtyard .
daiyu realized that this was the main inner suite , for a broad raised avenue led straight to its gate . once inside the hall she looked up and her eye was caught by a great blue tablet with nine gold dragons on it , on which was written in characters large as peck measures : hall of glorious felicity .
on the left-hand table were a tripod , spoons , chopsticks and an incense container ; on the right one , a slender-waisted porcelain vase from the ruzhou kiln containing flowers then in season , as well as tea-bowls and a spittoon . below the kang facing the west wall were four armchairs , their covers of bright red dotted with pink flowers , and with four footstools beneath them .
the large kang by the window was covered with a scarlet foreign rug . in the middle were red back-rests and turquoise bolsters , both with dragon-design medallions , and a long greenish yellow mattress also with at each side stood a low table of foreign lacquer in the shape of plum-blossom .
the maids in attendance served tea , and as she sipped it she studied them , observing that their make-up , clothes and deportment were quite different from those in other families . before she had finished her tea in came a maid wearing a red silk coat and a blue satin sleeveless jacket with silk borders .
your uncle ’ s observing a fast today , said lady wang . you ’ ll see him some other time . but there ’ s one thing i want to tell you .
his red archer ’ s jacket , embroidered with golden butterflies and flowers , was tied with a coloured tasselled palace sash .
his red archer ’ s jacket , embroidered with golden butterflies and flowers , was tied with a coloured tasselled palace sash .
his red archer ’ s jacket , embroidered with golden butterflies and flowers , was tied with a coloured tasselled palace sash .
over this he wore a turquoise fringed coat of japanese satin with a raised pattern of flowers in eight bunches .
his court boots were of black satin with white soles .
his face was as radiant as the mid-autumn moon , his complexion fresh as spring flowers at down .
the hair above his temples was as sharply outlined as if cut with a knife .
his eyebrows were as black as if painted with ink , his cheeks as red as peach-blossom , his eyes bright as autumn ripples . even when angry he seemed to smile , and there was warmth in his glance even when he frowned .
round his neck he had a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon , and a silk cord of five colours , on which hung a beautiful piece of jade .
his appearance took daiyu by surprise .
how very strange !
it ’ s as if i ’ d seen him somewhere before . he looks so familiar .
baoyu paid his respects to the lady dowager and upon her instructions went to see his mother . he returned before long , having changed his clothes .
his short hair in small plaits tied with red silk was drawn up on the crown of his head and braided into one thick queue as black and glossy as lacquer , sporting four large pearls attached to golden pendants in the form of the eight precious things .
his coat of a flower pattern on a bright red ground was not new , and he still wore the torque , the precious jade , a lock-shaped amulet containing his buddhistic name , and a lucky charm .
below could be glimpsed light green flowered satin trousers , black-dotted stockings with brocade borders , and thick-soled scarlet shoes .
his face looked as fair as if powdered , his lips red as rouge . his glance was full of affection , his speech interspersed with smiles .
but his natural charm appeared most in his brows , for his eyes sparkled with a world of feeling .
someone subsequently gave an admirable picture of baoyu in these two verses written to the melody of the moon over the west river : absurdly he courts care and melancholy and raves like any madman in his folly ;
for though endowed with handsome looks is he ,
his heart is lawless and refractory . too dense by far to understand his duty , too stubborn to apply himself to study ,
unfit to bear the stings of poverty ,
first in this world for uselessness is he ,
with a smile at baoyu , the lady dowager scolded , fancy changing your clothes before greeting our visitor .
hurry up now and pay your respects to your cousin .
of course , baoyu had seen this new cousin earlier on and guessed that she was the daughter of his aunt lin . he made haste to bow and , having greeted her , took a seat . looking at daiyu closely , he found her different from other girls .
her dusky arched eyebrows were knitted and yet not frowning , her speaking eyes held both merriment and sorrow ; her very frailty had charm .
her eyes sparkled with tears , her breath was soft and faint . in repose she was like a lovely flower mirrored in the water ; in motion , a pliant willow swaying in the wind .
she looked more sensitive than bi gan , more delicate than xi shi . i ’ ve met this cousin before , he declared at the end of his scrutiny .
well , even if i haven ’ t , her face looks familiar . i feel we ’ re old friends meeting again after a long separation .
baoyu went over to sit beside daiyu and once more gazed fixedly at her .
no , said daiyu .
what ’ s your name ?
and your courtesy name ?
i ’ ll give you one then , he proposed with a chuckle .
the compendium of men and objects old and new says that in the west is a stone called dai which can be used instead of graphite for painting eyebrows .
most works , apart from the four books , are made up ; am i the only one who makes things up ?
then , to the mystification of them all , he asked daiyu if she had any jade . imagining that he had his own jade in mind , she answered , no , i haven ’ t .
i suppose it ’ s too rare for everybody to have . this instantly threw baoyu into one of his frenzies .
it can ’ t even tell good people from bad .
i don ’ t want this nuisance either . in consternation all the maids rushed forward to pick up the jade while the lady dowager in desperation took baoyu in her arms .
you wicked monster ! storm at people if you ’ re in a passion . but why should you throw away that precious thing your life depends on ?
what ’ s the fun of that ? even this newly arrived cousin who ’ s lovely as a fairy hasn ’ t got one either . that shows it ’ s no good .
and baoyu , convinced by her tale , let the matter drop . just then a nurse came in to ask about daiyu ’ s quarters . move baoyu into the inner apartment of my suite , said his grandmother .
daiyu had brought with her only nanny wang , her old wet-nurse , and ten-year-old xueyan , who had also attended her since she was a child .
since the lady dowager considered xueyan too young and childish and nanny wang too old to be of much service , she gave daiyu one of her own personal attendants , a maid of the second grade called yingge .
like yingchun and the other young ladies , in addition to her own wet-nurse daiyu was given four other nurses as chaperones , two personal maids to attend to her toilet and five or six girls to sweep the rooms and run errands .
nanny wang and yingge accompanied daiyu now to green gauze lodge , while baoyu ’ s wet-nurse , nanny li , and his chief maid xiren made ready the big bed for him in its outer room . xiren , whose original name was zhenzhu , had been one of the lady dowager ’ s maids .
baoyu knew that her surname was hua and remembered a line of poetry which ran , the fragrance of flowers assails men . so he asked his grandmother ’ s permission to change her name to xiren .
that night after baoyu and nanny li were asleep , xiren noticed that daiyu and yingge were still up in the inner room . she tiptoed in there in her night clothes and asked : why aren ’ t you sleeping yet , miss ?
please sit down , sister , invited daiyu with a smile . xiren sat on the edge of the bed . miss lin has been in tears all this time , she ’ s so upset , said yingge .
don ’ t take it to heart , said xiren . i ’ m afraid you ’ ll see him carrying on even more absurdly later . if you let yourself be upset by his behaviour you ’ ll never have a moment ’ s peace .
lady wang ’ s brother wang ziteng , having been informed of this , had sent these messengers to the rong mansion to urge them to invite the xue family to the capital .
but more of this in the next chapter .
an ill-fated girl meets an ill-fated man
daiyu and the other girls found lady wang discussing family affairs with messengers sent by her brother , and heard that her sister ’ s son was involved in a murder case .
since she was so occupied , the girls called on li wan .
li wan was the widow of jia zhu who had died young , but luckily she had a son , jia lan , just five and already in school . her father , li shouzhong , a notable of jinling , had served as a libationer in the imperial college . all the sons and daughters of his clan had been devoted to the study of the classics .
when he became head of the family , however , in the belief that an unaccomplished woman is a virtuous woman , instead of making his daughter study hard he simply had her taught enough to read a few books such as the four books for girls , biographies of martyred women , and lives of exemplary ladies so that she might remember the deeds of worthy women of earlier dynasties while devoting her main attention to weaving and household tasks . that was why he gave her the name li wan and the courtesy name gongcai . so this young widow living in the lap of luxury was no better off than withered wood or cold ashes , taking no interest in the outside world .
apart from waiting on her elders and looking after her son , all she did was to accompany the girls at their embroidery or reading . though daiyu was only a guest here , with cousins like these to keep her company she felt completely at home , except for worrying sometimes about her father .
no sooner had he taken up his post as prefect of yingtian than a charge of murder was brought to his court . it was a case of two parties claiming to have purchased the same slave girl , neither willing to give way , and in consequence one of them had been beaten to death .
yucun summoned the plaintiff for questioning .
the murdered man was my master , the plaintiff testified .
he bought a slave girl not knowing that she ’ d been kidnapped and paid for her in silver . our master said he ’ d take her home three days later because that would be a lucky day . then the kidnapper sold her on the sly to the xue family .
but the xues lord it in jinling with their money and powerful backing . a pack of their thugs beat my master to death , after which the murderers , master and men , disappeared without a trace , leaving here only a few people who weren ’ t involved .
i beg your honour to arrest the criminals , punish the evil-doers and help the widow and orphan . then both the living and the dead will be everlastingly grateful !
he was about to order his runners to arrest the criminals ’ relatives for interrogation , in order to find out the murderers ’ whereabouts and issue warrants for their arrest , when an attendant standing by his table shot him a warning glance . then yucun refrained and left the court in some bewilderment . back in his private office he dismissed everyone but the attendant , who went down on one knee in salute , then said with a smile :
your honour has risen steadily in the official world . after eight or nine years , do you still remember me ? your face looks very familiar , but i can ’ t place you .
the attendant smiled . high officials have short memories , he said . so you ’ ve forgotten the spot you started from , your honour , and what happened in gourd temple ?
at this disconcerting remark , the past came back to yucun like the crash of a thunder-bolt . now this attendant had been a novice in gourd temple . when the fire left him stranded he decided that work in a yamen would be easier and , having had enough of monastic austerity , instead of going to another temple he had taken advantage of his youth to grow his hair again and get this post .
no wonder yucun had failed to recognize him .
now , taking his hand , the prefect observed with a smile : so we are old acquaintances . he invited him to take a seat , but the attendant declined the honour .
besides , this is my private office . as we are going to have a good talk , how can you remain standing all the time ? then , deferentially , the attendant perched sideways on the edge of a chair .
and yucun asked why he had stopped him from issuing the warrants . now that your honour ’ s come to this post , said the attendant , surely you ’ ve copied out the officials ’ protective charm for this province ?
all local officials nowadays keep a secret list of the most powerful , wealthy and high-ranking families in their province . each province has such a list . because if unknowingly you offend one of these families , you may lose not only your post but your life as well .
in that case you won ’ t keep your job long .
there ’ s nothing difficult about this case , but out of deference to them it was never settled by your predecessor . with that he took a hand-written copy of the officials ’ protective charm from his pocket and handed it to yucun . it was a doggerel catalogue of the most notable families in that district with notes on their ancestry , ranks and family branches .
stables of gold . twenty branches descended from the duke of ningguo and the duke of rongguo .
not only can he count on the support of those three other families , he has plenty of influential friends and relatives both in the capital and in the provinces .
so whom is your honour going to arrest ?
if that ’ s so , how are we to settle the case ? i take it you know the murderer ’ s hiding-place ?
the attendant grinned . i know not only where the murderer has gone . i know the kidnapper who sold the girl , and i knew the poor devil who bought her .
let me put all the facts before you . the man who was killed , feng yuan , was the son of one of the minor local gentry . both his parents died when he was young and he had no brothers ; he lived as best he could on his small property .
up to the age of eighteen or nineteen he was a confirmed queer and took no interest in women . but then , no doubt as retribution for entanglements in a former life , he ran into this kidnapper and no sooner set eyes on this girl than he fell for her and made up his mind to buy her for his concubine . he swore to have no more to do with men and to take no other wife .
that was why he insisted on her coming to him three days later . who was to know that the kidnapper would sell her on the sly to the xues , meaning to abscond with the payment from both parties ? before he could get away with this , they nabbed him and beat him within an inch of his life .
both refused to take back their money -- - both wanted the girl .
then young xue , who will never give an inch to anyone , ordered his men to beat feng yuan into a pulp .
three days after being carried home he died .
young xue had already fixed on a day to set off for the capital . but happening to see this girl two days before leaving he decided to buy her and take her along , not knowing the trouble that would come of it . then , having killed a man and carried off a girl , he set off with his household as if nothing had happened , leaving his clansmen and servants here to settle the business .
a trifling matter like taking a man ’ s life wouldn ’ t frighten him away .
so much for him . but do you know who the girl is ?
she ’ s yinglian , the daughter of mr. zhen who lived next to gourd temple . exclaimed yucun in astonishment . so that ’ s who she is !
i heard that she was kidnapped when she was five .
we used to play with yinglian every day . although seven or eight years have passed and she ’ s now a good-looking girl of twelve or thirteen , her features haven ’ t changed and anyone who knew her can easily recognize her .
besides , she had a red birthmark the size of a grain of rice between her eyebrows , which makes me quite sure it ’ s her . as the kidnapper happened to rent rooms from me , one day when he was away i asked her outright . she ’ d been beaten so much she was afraid to talk ; she just insisted that he was her father , selling her to clear his debts .
so there ’ s no doubt .
it ’ s her , all right .
the day that young feng met her and paid down his silver , the kidnapper got drunk .
then yinglian sighed , at last my trials are over ! she started worrying again , though , when she heard feng wouldn ’ t be fetching her for three days . i was so sorry for her that as soon as the kidnapper went out i sent my wife to cheer her up .
my wife told her : mr. feng ’ s insistence on waiting for a lucky days is proof that he won ’ t be treating you like a servant .
besides , he ’ s a very fine gentleman , quite well-to-do , who never could abide women in the past , yet now he ’ s paid a fancy price for you . that all goes to show you ’ re quite safe .
just be patient for two or three days .
but this world is full of disappointments : the very next day she was sold to the xues . any other family wouldn ’ t have been so bad ; but this young xue , otherwise known as the stupid tyrant , is the most vicious ruffian alive , who throws money about like dirt . he started a big fight and then dragged her off by force more dead than alive .
as for her , after being knocked about all those years by the kidnapper she at last saw a way out with a man who loved her , and if she ’ d married him all would have been well ; but then this had to happen ! of course , xue ’ s family is richer than feng ’ s , but a profligate like xue pan is sure to have troops of maids and concubines and to be thoroughly debauched — he could never be as true to one girl as feng yuan . so this romance was an empty dream , a chance encounter between an ill-fated young couple .
well , enough of that . what ’ s the best way to settle this case ? your honour used to be shrewd enough in the past , said the attendant with a smile .
i heard that your appointment was due to the good offices of the jias and wangs , and this xue is related to the jias by marriage .
so why not sail with the stream and do them a good turn , settling this case in such a way that you can face them in future ? there ’ s much in what you say . but a man ’ s life is involved .
moreover , i ’ ve been re-instated by the emperor ’ s favour and am in fact beginning a new life . i should be doing my utmost to show my gratitude . how can i flout the law for private considerations ?
the attendant sneered : your honour is right , of course . but that won ’ t get you anywhere in the world today . remember the old sayings : a gentleman adapts himself to circumstances ’ and the superior man is one who pursues good fortune and avoids disaster .
i really can ’ t bring myself to do such a thing .
better think it over carefully . yucun lowered his head . after a long silence he asked : what do you suggest ?
it ’ s this . when your honour tries the case tomorrow , make a great show of sending out writs and issuing warrants . of course the murderer won ’ t be forthcoming and the plaintiff will press his case ; then you can arrest some of xue ’ s clansmen and servants for interrogation .
behind the scenes i ’ ll fix things so that they report xue pan ’ s death by sudden illness , and we ’ ll get his clan and the local authorities to testify to this . then your honour can claim to be able to consult spirits through the planchette .
have one set up in the court and invite both military and civilians to come and watch . you can say : the spirit declares that xue pan and feng yuan were enemies in a former existence who were fated to clash in order to settle scores ; that , hounded by feng yuan ’ s ghost , xue pan has perished of some mysterious disease ; that since this trouble was caused by the man who kidnapped the girl with such-and-such a name , he must be dealt with according to the law , but no one else is involved… and so on and so forth . i ’ ll see to it that the kidnapper makes a full confession , and when the spirit ’ s message confirms this , people will be convinced .
the xues are rolling in money . you can make them pay a thousand or five hundred taels for feng yuan ’ s funeral expenses . his relatives are insignificant people , and all they ’ re out for is money .
what does your honour think of this scheme of mine ? impossible , yucun laughed .
the next day a number of suspects were summoned to court and yucun cross-examined them carefully . he found that the feng family was indeed a small one and just out for more money for the funeral , but the case had been confused and left unsettled because of the stubborn xues ’ powerful connections . so yucun twisted the law to suit his own purpose and passed arbitrary judgement .
the fengs received a large sum for funeral expenses and made no further objections . once the case was settled yucun lost no time in writing to jia zheng and wang ziteng . commander-in-chief of the metropolitan garrison , to inform them that the charge against their worthy nephew was dropped and they need not worry about it any longer .
let us return now to young xue , who had bought yinglian and had feng yuan beaten to death .
he came of a scholarly jinling family , but having lost his father while still a child he was thoroughly spoiled by his mother as the only son and heir , with the result that he grew up good for nothing . for they were millionaires , in receipt of an income from the state treasury as purveyors for the imperial household .
young xue ’ s name was pan , his courtesy name wenqi , and since the age of five or six he had shown himself extravagant in his habits and insolent in his speech . at school he merely learned a few characters , spending all his time on cockfights , riding or pleasure trips . although a court purveyor , he knew nothing of business or worldly affairs but prevailed on his grandfather ’ s old connections to find him a well-paid sine-cure in the board of revenue and left all business to his agents and old family servants .
his widowed mother , née wang , was the younger sister of wang ziteng , commander-in-chief of the metropolitan garrison , and the sister of lady wang , wife of jia zheng of the rong mansion .
she was about forty years of age and xue pan was her only son . but she also had a daughter two years younger whose infant name was baochai , a beautiful , dainty girl of great natural refinement .
while her father was still alive he made her study , and she turned out ten times better than her brother . however , after her father ’ s death it was so clear that xue pan would prove no comfort to their mother that baochai gave up her studies and devoted herself to needlework and the household management , so as to share her mother ’ s burden and cares .
recently , to honour culture , encourage propriety and search out talent , in addition to selecting consorts and ladies-in-waiting the emperor in his infinite goodness had made the board compile a list of the daughters of ministers and noted families from whom to choose virtuous and gifted companions for the princesses in their studies . moreover , since the death of xue pan ’ s father , all the managers and assistants in the purveyor ’ s offices of different provinces had taken advantage of his youth and inexperience to start swindling , and even the business in the various family shops in the capital was gradually falling off . thus xue pan , who had long heard of the splendours of the capital , now had three pretexts for a visit to it : first , to escort his sister there for the selection ; secondly , to see his relatives ; and thirdly , to clear his accounts and decide on further outlay .
his real reason , of course , was to see the sights of the great metropolis .
he had long since packed his luggage and valuables and prepared local specialities of every kind as gifts for relatives and friends . an auspicious day for departure had just been chosen when he met the kidnapper who was selling yinglian and , struck by her good looks , promptly purchased her . when feng yuan demanded her back .
then entrusting the family affairs to some clansmen and old servants , he left with his mother and sister . to him a murder charge was just a trifle which could easily be settled with some filthy lucre . after some days on the road they were approaching the capital when word came of the promotion of his uncle wang ziteng to the post of commander-in-chief of nine provinces with orders to inspect the borders .
now he ’ s been upgraded and is leaving . it shows heaven is kind . he suggested to his mother , although we have some houses in the capital , none of us has lived there for ten years or more and the caretakers may have rented them out .
why go to such trouble ?
we can stay with your uncle or aunt . both of them have plenty of space . wouldn ’ t it be simpler to put up there first and take our time over opening up other houses ?
but uncle ’ s just been promoted and is going to the provinces , so his place is bound to be upside down . if we descend on him like a swarm of bees , it will look most inconsiderate . your uncle may be leaving for his new post , but there ’ s still your aunt ’ s house .
now that we ’ re here and your uncle ’ s getting ready to leave , your aunt jia is sure to press us to stay there .
i know what you ’ re after .
you ’ re afraid of being under restraint if you stay with your uncle or aunt . you ’ d prefer to be on your own , free to do as you please .
in that case , go and find yourself some lodgings . i ’ ve been parted all these years from your aunt and we old sisters want to spend a little time together . i shall take your sister there with me .
have you any objection to that ? realizing that he could not talk his mother round , xue pan had perforce to order his servants to make straight for the rong mansion . meanwhile lady wang , who had learned with relief of the dismissal , thanks to yucun , of the charge against xue pan , had been dismayed again by her brother ’ s promotion to a frontier post , for this confronted her with the lonely prospect of having none of her own family to visit .
but a few days later a servant suddenly announced that her sister had brought her son and daughter and whole household to the capital , and they were just alighting outside the gate .
we need not dwell on the mingled delight and sorrow of these two sisters meeting again in the evening of life or all their tears , laughter and reminiscences . lady wang took them in to pay their respects to the lady dowager , and they distributed the gifts they had brought . when the entire family had been introduced , a feast of welcome was spread for the travellers .
and after xue pan had paid his respects to jia zheng , jia lian took him over to call on jia she and jia zhen .
then jia zheng sent a message to his wife saying .
my sister-in-law has seen many springs and autumns , and my nephew is young and inexperienced . he may get into some scrapes if they live outside . the ten rooms and more in pear fragrance court in the northeast corner of our grounds are empty .
let us have them swept clean and ask your sister and her children to stay there . before lady wang could extend this invitation , the lady dowager also sent to urge , do invite your sister to stay here , so that we can all be close together .
aunt xue was only too glad to comply so as to have some check on her son , who was likely to get up to fresh mischief if they lived outside . she promptly accepted with thanks and in private intimated to lady wang that , if she was to make a long stay , she must be allowed to defray all her household ’ s daily expenses .
so aunt xue and her children moved into pear fragrance court . this court where the duke of rongguo had spent his declining years was small but charming , its dozen or so rooms including a reception hail in front and the usual sleeping quarters and offices behind .
it had its own entrance to the street which the xue household used , while a passage from a southwest gate led to the east courtyard of lady wang ’ s main apartment .
every day after lunch or in the evening , aunt xue would walk over to chat with the lady dowager or to talk over the old days with her sister . baochai spent her time with daiyu , yingchun and the other girls , very happy to read , play chess or sew with them .
only xue pan at first disliked this arrangement , for fear that his uncle would control him so strictly that he would not be his own master . he had to comply for the time being , however , because his mother had made up her mind to it and the jia family pressed them so hard to stay . none the less , he sent servants to make ready one of his own houses for when he decided to move .
to his relief , after less than a month he found himself on familiar terms with half the jia sons and nephews , and all the rich young men of fashion among them enjoyed his company . one day they would meet to drink , the next to look at flowers , and soon they included him in gambling parties or visits to the courtesans ’ quarters , with the result that xue pan rapidly became even ten times worse than before .
moreover the head of the clan was jia zhen , who as the eldest grandson of the duke of ningguo had inherited the title and was responsible for all clan affairs .
besides , jia zheng , occupied as he was by public and private business , was too easy-going to take mundane matters seriously , preferring to give all his leisure to reading and chess .
since pear fragrance court was two courtyards away from his quarters and had its own entrance to the street through which people could pass as they pleased , the young men caroused and enjoyed themselves just as they chose .
for these reasons , before very long xue pan gave up all thought of moving .
to know what followed , turn to the next chapter .
the fairy ’ s riddles the goddess of disenchantment in her kindness
as the plum blossom was now in full bloom in the ning mansion ’ s garden , jia zhen ’ s wife madam you invited the lady dowager , lady xing , lady wang and the others to a party to enjoy the flowers .
she brought jia rong and his wife with her to deliver the invitations in person , and so the lady dowager and the rest went over after breakfast . they strolled round the garden of concentrated fragrance and were served first with tea then wine ; but it was simply an informal gathering of the womenfolk of both houses for a family feast , with nothing of special interest to record .
at once jia rong ’ s wife qin keqing said with a smile : we have a room ready here for uncle baoyu . the old ancestress can set her mind at rest and leave him safely to me . she told his nurses and maids to follow her with their young master .
the lady dowager had every confidence in this lovely slender young woman who with her gentle , amiable behaviour was her favourite of all the great-grandsons ’ wives of the rong and ning branches . she was therefore sure baoyu would be in good hands . keqing led the party to an inner room , where baoyu noticed a fine painting of the scholar working by torchlight.1 without even seeing who the artist was , he took a dislike to the picture .
a grasp of mundane affairs is genuine knowledge , understanding of worldly wisdom is true learning .
if this isn ’ t good enough , where can we take you ? asked his hostess with a laugh .
baoyu nodded and smiled but one of his nurses protested :
it ’ s not proper for an uncle to sleep in his nephew ’ s room .
didn ’ t you see my brother who came last month ? he ’ s the same age as uncle baoyu , but if they stood side by side i ’ m sure he ’ d be the taller . why haven ’ t i met him ?
do bring him in and let me have a look at him .
he ’ s miles away , how can we bring him ? you ’ ll meet him some other time .
now , having reached the young matron ’ s room , they were meet at the threshold by a subtle perfume which misted over baoyu ’ s eyes and melted his bones . how good it smells here !
entering , he saw on the wall a picture by tang yin of a lady sleeping under the blossom of a crab-apple tree in spring . on the two scrolls flanking it , qin guan the song scholar had written :
coolness wraps her dream , for spring is chill ; a fragrance assails men , the aroma of wine .
on the dressing-table was a rare mirror from wu zetian ’ s hall of mirrors . in the gold tray by it , on which zhao feiyan once danced , was the quince thrown in fun by an lushan at lady yang,7 which had wounded her breast . at one end of the room stood the couch on which princess shouyang had slept in the hanzhang palace , and over it hung the curtains strung from pearls by princess tongchang .
with her own hands she spread a gauze coverlet washed by xi shi ’ 0 and arranged the bridal pillow carried by hongniang . then the nurses and attendants made baoyu lie down and slipped out leaving only four maids xiren , meiren , qingwen and sheyue to keep him company .
keqing told them to wait on the verandah and watch the kittens and puppies playing there .
baoyu fell asleep as soon as he closed his eyes and dreamed that keqing was before him .
absent-mindedly he followed her a long way to some crimson balustrades and white marble steps among green trees and clear streams , in a place seldom trodden by the foot of man , unreached by swirling dust .
if only i could spend my whole life here !
his fancy was running away ith him when he heard someone singing a song on the other side of a hill :
gone with the clouds spring ’ s dream .
baoyu realized that the voice was a girl ’ s and before the song had ended he saw the singer come round the hill and approach him . with her graceful gait and air she was truly no mortal being .
here is as proof her description : leaving the willow bank , she comes just now through the flowers . her approach startles birds in the trees in the court , and soon her shadow falls across the verandah .
her fairy sleeves , fluttering , give off a heady fragrance of musk and orchid .
with each rustle of her lotus garments , her jade pendants tinkle . her dimpled smile is peach-blossom in spring , her blue-black hair a cluster of clouds .
her lips are cherries and sweet the breath from her pomegranate teeth .
the curve of her slender waist is snow whirled by the wind . dazzling her pearls and emeralds and gosling-gold the painted design on her forehead .
sweet her face , compact of fragrance , carved in jade ; and she bears herself like a phoenix or dragon in flight .
spring plum-blossom glimpsed through snow .
autumn orchids coated with frost .
a pine in a lonely valley . sunset mirrored in a limpid pool . a dragon breasting a winding stream .
where was this wonder born , whence does she come ? verily she has no peer in fairyland , no equal in the purple courts of heaven . who can she be , this beauty ?
overjoyed by the apparition of this fairy , baoyu made haste to greet her with a bow . sister fairy , he begged with a smile , do tell me where you are from and whither you are going . i have lost my way .
my home is above the sphere of parting sorrow in the sea of brimming grief , she answered with a smile . i am the goddess of disenchantment from the grotto of emanating fragrance on the mountain of expanding spring in the illusory land of great void . i preside over romances and unrequited love on earth , the grief of women and the passion of men in the mundane world .
it is no accident that we have met .
my realm is not far from here . all i can offer you is a cup of fairy tea plucked by my own hands , a pitcher of fine wine of my own brewing , some accomplished singers and dancers , and twelve new fairy songs called a dream of red mansions .
forgetting keqing in his delight , baoyu followed the goddess to a stone archway inscribed : illusory land of great void . on either pillar was this couplet :
beyond this archway was a palace gateway with the inscription in large characters : sea of grief and heaven of love . the bold couplet flanking this read :
firm as earth and lofty as heaven , passion from time immemorial knows no end ; pity silly lads and plaintive maids hard put to
well , we , thought baoyu , i wonder what ’ s meant by passion from time immemorial ’ and debts of breeze and moonlight . from now on i ’ d like to have a taste of these things . little did he know that by thinking in this way he had summoned an evil spirit into his inmost heart .
he followed the goddess through the second gate past two matching halls on both sides , each with its tablet and couplet . he had no time to read them all but noticed the names : board of infatuation , board of jealousy , board of morning tears , board of night sighs , board of spring longing and board of autumn sorrows . may i trouble you , goddess , to show me over these different boards ?
they brought on themselves spring grief and
that ’ s why it ’ s called the first register . i ’ ve always heard that jinling ’ s a very large place , replied baoyu . why are there only twelve girls ?
in our family alone just now , if you count the servants , we must have several hundreds . true , there are many girls in your honourable province . only those of the first grade are registered here .
baoyu looked at the next two cabinets and saw written on them : second register of twelve beauties of jinhing and third register of twelve beauties of jinling . he opened the door of this last , took out the register and turned to the first page . this was covered by a painting in ink , not of any figures of landscape but of black clouds and heavy mist .
a clear moon is rarely met with , bright clouds are easily scattered ; her heart is loftier than the sky ,
her charm and wit give rise to jealousy , her early death is caused by calumny , in vain her loving master ’ s grief must be .
on the next page baoyu saw painted a bunch of flowers and a tattered mat , with the legend : nothing avail her gentleness and compliance , osmanthus and orchid with her fragrance vie ;
still baffled , baoyu put this volume aside and took out the first register .
this opened at a picture of fragrant osmanthus above withered lotus in a dried-up pond . by this was written : sweet is she as the lotus in flower ,
after the growth of a lonely tree in two soils her sweet soul will be dispatched to its final rest .
the first page had a painting of two withered trees on which hung a jade belt , while at the foot of a snowdrift lay a broken golden hairpin .
buried in snow the broken golden hairpin and hanging in the wood the belt of jade .
he knew the goddess would not enlighten him , yet he could not bring himself to put the book down . so he turned to a painting of a bow from which was suspended a citron .
for twenty years she arbitrates where pomegranates blaze by palace gates . how can the late spring equal the spring ’ s start ?
when hare and tiger meet , from this great dream of life she must depart . on the next page was a picture of two people flying a kite , while in a large boat out at sea sat a girl , weeping , covering her face with her hands .
with this were the lines : so talented and high-minded , she is born too late for luck to come her way .
through tears she watches the stream on the clear and bright day ; a thousand lithe east wind blows ,
nought avail her rank and riches ,
while yet in swaddling clothes an orphan lone ; in a flash she mourns the setting sun ,
the river xiang runs dry , the clouds over chu have flown . next was depicted a fine piece of jade dropped in the mud , with the verse :
she sinks at last in the mire . there followed a sketch of a savage wolf pursuing a lovely girl to devour her .
next was depicted a seated girl reading a sutra alone in an old temple . this had the legend :
she sees through the transience of spring , dark buddhist robes replace her garments fine ; pity this child of a wealthy noble house
who now sleeps alone by the dimly lit old shrine . next came a female phoenix perched on an iceberg , with the verdict : this bird appears when the world falls on evil times ;
after this was a lonely village with a pretty girl spinning in a humble cottage . the inscription read : when fortune frowns , nobility means nothing ;
as if in a daze he left the registers and followed her past pearl portières and embroidered curtains , painted pillars and carved beams .
words fail to describe those brilliant vermilion rooms , floors paved with gold , windows bright as snow and palaces of jade , to say nothing of the delectable fairy flowers , rare plants and fragrant herbs . as baoyu was feasting his eyes on these marvellous sights disenchantment called with a laugh : come out quickly and welcome our honoured guest . at once out came several fairies , lotus sleeves swaying , feathery garments fluttering , lovely as spring blossom , entrancing as the autumn moon .
but after a hundred years our good fortune is at an end , gone beyond recall . although we have many descendants , the only one fit to continue our work is our great-grandson baoyu .
but what delighted him most was the rouge by the window and the spilt powder left from a lady ’ s toilet . on the wall hung this couplet : spiritual , secluded retreat ,
they were introduced by their different appellations as fairy of amorous dreams , great mistress of passion , golden maid bringing grief , and saint of transmitted sorrow .
but no outsider can appreciate their subtle qualities , and i doubt whether you will really understand their meaning . unless you first read the text , they will seem to you as tasteless as chewed wax .
so in this world of sweet longing on a day of distress , in an hour of loneliness , fain would i impart my senseless grief
i alone recall the pledge between plant and stone . vainly facing the hermit in sparkling snow-clad hills i forget not the fairy in lone woods beyond the world .
holding cheap the charms of a noble family ’ s daughter , trampling on the precious child of a ducal mansion . alas , in less than a year her sweet soul fades away .
and what i like about you is that you are the most lustful man ever to have lived in this world since time immemorial .
besides , i ’ m still young and hardly know what that word means . don ’ t worry , said disenchantment .
hand in hand they walked out for a stroll . suddenly they found themselves in a thorny thicker infested with wolves and tigers . in front a black torrent barred their way and there was no bridge across .
if you had fallen in , then all my well-meant advice to you would have been wasted . even as she spoke there came a crash like thunder from the ford of infatuation as hordes of monsters and river devils rushed towards baoyu to drag him in . cold sweat poured off him like rain .
attendants promptly brought him a longan decoction and after sipping a couple of mouthfuls he got up to adjust his clothes . as xiren reached out to fasten his trousers for him , she touched his thigh and found it cold and sticky . she drew back in alarm and asked what was the matter .
your trouble is that your father gave you such a soft time of it when you were young that you ’ re a bad manager . when you have money you never look ahead ; when you ’ ve none you fly into a temper . that ’ s no way for a grown man to behave .
his wife was afraid to talk back , but granny liu was not going to stand for this . you mustn ’ t mind me butting in , son-in-law , she said .
do you want me to go out and steal ?
work out a plan , trust to buddha , and something may come of it for all you know . as a matter of fact , i ’ ve thought of a chance for you . in the old days you joined families with the wangs of jinling , and twenty years back they treated you not badly .
she ’ s now the wife of the second lord jia of the rong mansion .
why not go and try your luck ?
attracted by this suggestion , he laughed at his wife ’ s objection and proposed : since this is your idea , mother , and you ’ ve called on the lady before , why not go there tomorrow and see how the wind blows ?
that ’ s no problem . i ’ ll tell you what to do .
i know him too . but how will they receive me after all this time ?
i ’ m old enough not to mind risking a snub . if i have any luck we ’ ll all share it . and even if i don ’ t bring back any silver the trip won ’ t be wasted — i ’ ll have seen a little high life .
granny liu edged forward and said , greetings , gentlemen . the men surveyed her from head to foot before condescending to ask where she had come from . i ’ ve come to see mr. zhou who came with lady wang when she was married , she told them with a smile .
one of his family may come out by and by . an older man interposed , why make a fool of her and waste her time ?
what ’ s her job ? she ’ s the wife of zhou rui who came with lady wang .
then he called , auntie zhou ! here ’ s a granny asking for you . mrs. zhou hurried out to see who it was while granny liu hastened forward crying , sister zhou !
i came specially to see you , sister , and also to inquire after her ladyship ’ s health .
but since you ’ re related to her ladyship and have come to me for help as if i were someone , i ’ ll make an exception and take in a message for you . i must tell you , though , that things have changed here in the last five years .
in that case i must see her today . nowadays her ladyship can ’ t be troubled with much business , so whenever possible she leaves it to the young mistress to entertain visitors . even if you don ’ t see her ladyship you must see her , or your visit will have been wasted .
the second mistress is with lady wang . at once mrs. zhou urged granny liu to hurry .
after some last-minute instructions to her grandson , granny liu followed mrs. zhou by winding ways to jia lian ’ s quarters , then waited in a covered passageway while mrs. zhou went past the spirit screen into the court and , before xifeng ’ s return , explained who granny liu was to her trusted maid pinger , who had come here as part of xifeng ’ s dowry and then become jia lian ’ s concubine .
i don ’ t think she ’ ll blame me for taking too much on myself .
pinger decided to invite them in to sit down and accordingly mrs. zhou went out to fetch them . as they mounted the steps to the main reception room , a young maid raised a red wool portière and a waft of perfume greeted them as they entered . granny liu did not know what it was but felt she was walking on air .
granny liu and baner were given seats on the kang , while pinger and mrs. zhou sat face to face on the edge . maids brought tea and as she sipped it the old woman heard a steady tock-tock-tock like the sound made by a flour-bolting machine .
next mrs. zhou came to beckon them with a smile . granny liu at once lifted her grandson off the kang and led him into the hall .
after some whispered advice from mrs. zhou she followed her slowly into xifeng ’ s room . a soft scarlet flowered portière hung from brass hooks over the door , and the kang below the south window was spread with a scarlet rug .
against the wooden partition on the east were a back-rest and bolster of brocade with chain designs next to a glossy satin mattress with a golden centre . beside them stood a silver spittoon . xifeng had on the dark sable hood with a pearl-studded band which she wore at home .
she finally asked . then , raising her head to take the tea , she saw mrs. zhou with her two charges before her . she made a motion as if to rise and greeted them with a radiant smile , scolding mrs. zhou for not speaking up before .
this is the old lady i was just telling you about , said mrs. zhou . by now granny liu had seated herself on the edge of the kang , and baner took refuge behind her .
she asked mrs. zhou if she had notified lady wang . i was waiting for madam ’ s instructions , was the reply .
go and see how busy she is . if she has visitors , never mind . but if she ’ s free , let her know and see what she says .
as xifeng nodded , mrs. zhou came back .
after mrs. zhou left on this errand , xifeng told the maids to give baner some sweetmeats . she was asking granny liu questions when pinger announced the arrival of a number of servants to report on affairs in their charge . i have a guest .
if they have any business they should tell you , madam . i ’ ve no special business , put in granny liu . i just came to call on her ladyship and madam lian , seeing as how we ’ re related .
but as i ’ ve come all this way to ask your help , i ’ d better speak up .
haven ’ t you plenty of stuff of your own over there ? nothing half as good . please , aunt , be kind !
she ordered pinger to fetch the keys to the upstairs rooms and find trustworthy people to deliver the screen . i ’ ve brought men to carry it . jia rong ’ s face lit up , his eyes twinkled .
well , what did your dad tell you ? what did he send us here for ? was it just to eat sweets ?
at once xifeng ordered a meal for the visitors . mrs. zhou passed on the order and a table was set for them in the east room . sister zhou , see that they have all they want , said xifeng .
i can ’ t keep them company . when mrs. zhou had taken them to the east room , xifeng called her back to hear what lady wang had said . her ladyship says they don ’ t really belong to our family , mrs. zhou told her .
since they mean well , coming to see us , we shouldn ’ t slight them . if they need help , madam should use her own discretion . i was thinking , if we were really relatives it was funny i didn ’ t know the first thing about them .
exclaimed mrs. zhou . what possessed you when you saw her to keep on about your nephew ’ ? at the risk of offending you i must say this : even if he were a real nephew you should have glossed it over .
do you ask the name of the one he meets ? it is qin whose home is south of the yangtze river . after seeing off granny liu , mrs. zhou went to report to lady wang .
if you ’ ll tell me , miss , we ’ ll keep it in mind and recommend it to others with the same trouble . that would be a good deed . well , better not ask .
well , we were lucky enough to collect all the ingredients and have them carefully made up within two years of the monk ’ s telling us . we brought the pills up from the south . they ’ re buried under one of the pear trees now.~~
wait a minute , she said with a smile . i ’ ve something for you to take back .
she ’ s a handsome girl . reminds me of master rong ’ s wife in our east mansion .
so that ’ s it . as soon as the abbess arrived , yu xin ’ s wife hurried over and whispered with her for a while .
pinger took out four sprays and went off with them , returning presently with two which she ordered caiming to take to master rong ’ s wife in the ning mansion .
who can we get to help us out ? i thought as much , said her mother . a fuss about nothing .
in fact she settled the matter that same evening by applying to xifeng . when the lamps were lit and xifeng had disrobed , she went to see lady wang .
don ’ t talk like a fool ! fetch him in at once or i ’ ll give you a good slap .
he bowed shyly to xifeng and inquired almost inaudibly after her health . xifeng nudged baoyu delightedly and cried , now you must take a back seat . she leaned forward to take the young stranger ’ s hand and made him sit down beside her , then began questioning him about his age and the books he was studying .
then tea and refreshments were served . we two shan ’ t be drinking any wine , said baoyu .
if he says anything he shouldn ’ t , please overlook it for my sake . he ’ s a stubborn boy for all his shyness and likes to have his own way .
presently xifeng and madam you sent to remind baoyu , if he wanted anything to eat from their room , just to ask for it .
madam you sighed . not even the master can control him , let alone your cousin zhen .
because of these services , he was treated with special consideration in our great-grandfather ’ s time and nobody likes to interfere with him now . but since growing old he has no regard for appearances . he does nothing but drink and when he ’ s drunk he abuses everyone .
what ’ s come over you ? you not only listen to drunken raving but have to ask questions too . just wait until we get back and i tell your mother — you ’ ll pay for this with a thrashing .
his nurses and maids were waiting to take off his ceremonial clothes , but he went out again without changing . they followed him through the second gate under the impression that he was going back to the other mansion , instead of which he turned northeast round the back of the hall . there , however , he ran into two of his father ’ s proteges , zhan guang and shan pinren , who hurried forward smiling .
they hurried forward at sight of baoyu and stood at respectful attention . one of them , qian hua , who had not seen baoyu for some time , stepped forward and fell on one knee . smiling slightly , baoyu quickly helped him up , while one of the other men said cheerfully :
people admire them so much they asked us to get them some . they ’ re not worth having , protested baoyu , laughing . but you can ask my pages for some if you want .
but get up here quickly on the warm kang . she ordered hot tea to be served .
it ’ s warmer there . go and keep her company and i ’ ll join you as soon as i ’ m through here . baoyu promptly slipped off the kang and went to his cousin ’ s door , before which hung a somewhat worn red silk portière .
lifting this he stepped inside . baochai was sewing on the kang . her glossy black hair was knotted on top of her head .
i let you see mine , dear cousin , he countered coaxingly . cornered like this , baochai answered , as it happens , there is a lucky inscription on it . otherwise i wouldn ’ t wear such a clumsy thing all the time .
won ’ t you give me one to try ? don ’ t be silly ! you don ’ t take medicine for the fun of it .
your aunt ’ s prepared refreshments in the other room . i ’ ll send a maid for your cape and tell your pages not to wait .
wasn ’ t i right ? as soon as i come , he must go . when did i say a word about going ?
and i ’ m always the one that gets into trouble . don ’ t worry , poor old thing , said aunt xue , laughing . go and have a drink yourself .
think i was freezing to death here ? zijuan was afraid you might be cold , miss , so she asked me to bring it over . nursing the stove in her arms daiyu retorted , so you do whatever she asks , but let whatever i say go in one ear and out the other .
one doesn ’ t know whether to be cross or laugh . don ’ t be afraid , my child , said aunt xue . i ’ ve nothing good to offer you , but i ’ ll feel bad if you get a fright which gives you indigestion .
as they took their leave their wraps were brought , and baoyu bent his head for a maid to help him on with his hood . she shook out the crimson hood and started slipping it over his head .
did you get them all right ? don ’ t ask !
i ’ ll take them for my grandson . she got somebody to send them home for her .
just because she suckled me for a few days when i was small , she carries on as if she were more important than our own ancestors . i don ’ t need a wet-nurse any more , why should i keep an ancestress like this ? send her packing and we ’ ll all have some peace and quiet .
you live so far away , she said , in hot or cold weather you may find the journey too much . you are welcome to stay here and must make yourself at home . stay with your uncle baoyu , and don ’ t get into mischief with those lazy young rascals .
because qin was remotely connected with the jia family , they arranged a match and she became jia rong ’ s wife . qin zhong was born when his father was over fifty .
what an idea ! there ’ s nothing like study , if you don ’ t want to be a failure in life and get nowhere . just remember to keep your mind on your books in class , and out of class to think of the people at home .
at least that ’ s my idea . do think it over .
don ’ t get into mischief with the other boys . it would be no joke if you were caught by the master . i know they say you should give your whole heart to study , but don ’ t overdo it or you ’ ll bite off more than you can chew and your health will suffer .
don ’ t worry , baoyu assured her . i know how to take care of myself outside .
a few years at school and your worthy son is sure to show his mettle and make a name . he ’ s not a child any more .
recognizing li gui , the son of baoyu ’ s old wet-nurse , jia zheng demanded , what has he learned all the time you ’ ve attended him at his lessons ?
he hurried away as soon as he saw them emerging from the house . li gui and the others , dusting off their clothes , asked , did you hear that ? he ’ s going to flay us alive .
from this day onward the two of them became inseparable , going to school and leaving it together . and thanks to the lady dowager ’ s partiality , qin zhong often stayed for a few days with the jia family .
he left his eldest grandson jia rui in charge . qin zhong took advantage of the fact that nowadays xue pan had virtually stopped coming even to roll-call to make eyes at sweetie and secretly signal to him . having asked to be excused , they went out to the back courtyard for a quiet chat .
can ’ t we talk if we want to ? if you can talk , why can ’ t i cough ?
it would look very inconsiderate to disturb the principal over such a little thing when he ’ s busy . trouble should be settled on the spot , i say . there ’ s no need to go and disturb the old gentleman .
mrs. jia huang is his aunt on the father ’ s side .
i shall go and see her about this . he ordered mingyan to come in and wrap up his books . the page did so , saying exultantly , why go yourself , sir ?
and jia rui , afraid of being incriminated if this went any further , had to pocket his grievance and ask qin zhong and baoyu to forget it . after holding out for some time baoyu said , all right , i won ’ t tell if un rong apologizes . at first jin rong refused .
that flunkey qin zhong is only ha rong ’ s brother-in-law , not a son or grandson of the jia family , he fumed .
dr. zhang diagnoses keqing ’ s illness with heavy pressure on him and orders from jia rui to apologize , un rong had to appease baoyu by kowtowing to qin zhong . then school was dismissed and he went home , where the more he brooded the angrier he grew .
the next day be went back to school as if nothing had happened . now jin rong ’ s paternal aunt had married jia huang of that generation of the family which used the jade ( yu ) radical in personal names . needless to say , not all members of the clan were as wealthy as those in the ning and rong mansions .
how can some people suck up like that to the rich ?
yes , sir , said jia rong .
do sit down !
asked lady xing .
it ’ s your turn to pick a couple of good ones for us .
xifeng rose to signify obedience . taking the list she read through it and marked the resurrection and the rhapsody handing it back she observed , when they ’ ve finished this double promotion there ’ ll be just time enough for these two .
yes , said lady wang .
especially as this is a worrying time for them . you come over so seldom , protested madam you , i do hope you ’ ll stay a bit longer .
it ’ s early yet .
they ’ ve gone to drink in the pavilion of lingering dawn , replied one of the matrons .
i wonder what they ’ re up to behind our backs ?
so they laughed and chatted till the plays came to an end , when the wine was taken away and rice brought in .
after the meal they returned to the drawing-room for tea , then ordered their carriages and took their leave of old mrs. you .
they were seen to their carriages by madam you , attended by all the concubines and maids , and there they found the young men waiting with jia zhen . the latter urged lady xing and lady wang to come back again the next day , but lady wang declined .
we ’ ve spent the whole day here and we ’ re tired .
after jia zhen and the others had gone indoors , li gui led round baoyu ’ s horse and the boy mounted it and followed his mother home .
when jia zhen and all the young men had dined , the party broke up ; and there is no need to describe the entertainment they offered all their kinsmen the next day .
and ha rui , calling several times on xifeng , invariably found she had gone to the ning mansion .
the thirtieth day of the eleventh month would be the winter solstice .
as it approached , the lady dowager , lady wang and xifeng sent daily to inquire after keqing and were told each time that she was neither better nor worse .
it ’ s a hopeful sign , lady wang told the lady dowager , if an illness grows no worse at a season like this .
yes , of course , replied the old lady .
if anything were to happen to the dear child , i ’ m sure it would break my heart .
in her distress she sent for xifeng and said , you and she have always been good friends .
tomorrow ’ s the first of the twelfth month , but the day after that i want you to call on her and see just how she is .
if she ’ s any better , come and tell me .
xifeng promised to do this and after breakfast on the second she went to the ning mansion to see keqing .
although the invalid appeared no worse , she had grown very thin and wasted . xifeng sat and chatted with her for some time , assuring her that she had no cause for alarm .
whether i ’ ll ever recover or not we ’ ll know when spring comes , said keqing . maybe i shall , for the winter solstice has passed and i ’ m no worse . please tell the old lady and lady wang not to worry .
we ’ ll send you some more tomorrow , offered xifeng .
now i must go to see your mother-in-law before hurrying back to tell the old lady how you are .
she went to sit with madam you who asked , tell me frankly , how did you find her ?
xifeng lowered her head for a while .
there seems to be little hope , she said at last . if i were you i ’ d make ready the things for the funeral .
that may break the bad luck .
but i can ’ t get any good wood for you know what , so i ’ ve let that go for the time being .
after drinking some tea and chatting a little longer . xifeng said she must go back to report to the lady dowager .
don ’ t break it to her yet , said madam you . we don ’ t want to alarm the old lady .
home again , she told the lady dowager , rong ’ s wife sends her respects and kowtows to you . she says she ’ s better and you mustn ’ t worry . when she ’ s a little stronger , she ’ ll come herself to kowtow and pay her respects .
how did she seem ? for the present there ’ s nothing to fear .
she ’ s in good spirits .
the lady dowager thought this over , then said , go and change your clothes now and rest . xifeng withdrew and reported to lady wang before going back to her room . pinger helped her into the informal clothes she had warming by the fire .
then xifeng , taking a seat , asked what had happened during her absence .
lai wang ’ s wife came with the interest on that three hundred taels , which i put away .
and master rui sent round again to ask if you were in , as he wanted to pay his respects .
let him come , said xifeng .
i know how to deal with him .
what happened to jia rui when he came is told in the next chapter . xifeng sets a vicious trap
jia rui looks into the wrong side
while xifeng was talking to pinger , jia rui was announced .
overjoyed at being received , he hastened in and greeted her effusively , beaming with smiles .
the sight of her in informal dress threw him into raptures .
why isn ’ t second brother lian home yet ? i wouldn ’ t know , xifeng replied .
gazing amorously at her he asked :
men are like that .
how many are there like you ?
not one in ten .
i keep wishing someone would drop in for a chat to cheer me . i have plenty of time . suppose i were to drop in to amuse you every day ?
now you ’ re joking , she replied archly .
you wouldn ’ t want to come and see me . i mean every word i say .
may a thunderbolt strike me if i don ’ t ! i didn ’ t dare come before because i was told you were very strict and took offence at the least little thing .
now i see how charming and how kind you are , you may be sure i ’ ll come , even if it costs me my life . you ’ re certainly much more understanding than jia rong and his brother . they look so refined one would expect them to be understanding , but they ’ re stupid fools with no insight at all into other people ’ s hearts .
inflamed by this praise , he edged closer . staring at the purse hanging from her girdle , he asked if he might look at her rings .
now , you ’ d better go .
now , you ’ d better go .
assuming that this time all would go well , jia rui went off . having got rid of him , xifeng held a council of war and baited her trap while the young man waited at home impatiently , for to his annoyance one of their relatives called and stayed to supper . by the time he left the lamps were being lit , and jia rui had to wait for his grandfather to retire before he could slip over to the rong mansion and wait in the place appointed .
he paced the room frantic as an ant on a hot griddle , but there was no sight or sound of anyone .
just then a dark figure appeared . sure that it was xifeng , he threw caution to the winds and barely had the figure stepped through the door than he flung himself on it like a ravenous tiger , or a cat pouncing on a mouse .
he carried her to the kang , where he showered kisses on her and fumbled with her clothes , pouring out incoherent endearments . not a sound came from the figure in his arms .
jia rui had just pulled down his pants and prepared to set to work when a sudden flash of light made him look up . there stood jia qiang , a taper in his hand .
the figure on the kang said with a chuckle , uncle rui was trying to bugger me . when jia rui saw that it was jia rong , he wished he could sink through the ground .
oh , no you don ’ t !
i was sent here to catch you . i found you on top of him , you can ’ t deny it . so come along with me to lady wang !
dear nephew , he pleaded , do tell her you couldn ’ t find me .
i ’ ll pay you well for it tomorrow .
i might do that . depends how much you ’ re willing to pay . i can ’ t just take your word for it , i must have it down in writing .
how can i put a thing like this down in writing ?
that ’ s no problem . just write that you borrowed so much silver from the bank to pay a gambling debt .
but i ’ ve no paper or brush . that ’ s easy . jia qiang disappeared for a moment and promptly returned with writing materials , where upon the two of them forced jia
rui to write and sign an i. o. u. for fifty taels which jia qiang pocketed . when he urged jia rong to leave , however , the latter at first absolutely refused and threatened to lay the matter before the whole clan the next morning , jia rui kowtowed to him in desperation . however , with jia qiang mediating between them , he was forced to write another i. o. u. for fifty taels of silver .
i ’ ll get the blame if you ’ re seen leaving , said jia qiang . the lady dowager ’ s gate is closed , and the second master is in the hall looking over the things which have arrived from jinling , so you can ’ t get out that way . you ’ ll have to go through the back gate .
let me see if the coast is clear .
i ’ ll find you somewhere to wait .
he blew out the light and dragged jia rui out to the foot of some steps in the yard . here ’ s a good place , he whispered .
squat down there until we come back and don ’ t make a sound .
as the two others left , jia rui squatted obediently at the foot of the steps .
he was thinking over his predicament when he heard a splash above him and a bucket of slops was emptied over his head . a cry of dismay escaped him . but he clapped one hand over his mouth and made not another sound , though covered with filth from head to foot and shivering with cold .
then jia qiang hurried over calling :
at this reprieve , jia rui bolted through the back door to his home . by now the third watch had sounded , and he had to knock at the gate . the servant who opened it wanted to know how he came to be in such a state .
i fell into a cesspool in the dark , lied jia rui . back in his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed .
afterwards , however , although he still longed for xifeng , he steered clear of the rong mansion . both jia rong and jia qiang kept dunning him for payment , so that his fear of being found out by his grandfather and the hopeless passion which consumed him were now aggravated by the burden of debts , while he had to work hard at his lessons every day . the unmarried twenty-year-old , constantly dreaming of xifeng , could not help indulging in finger-play .
all this , combined with the effect of two nights of exposure , soon made him fall ill. before a year was out he suffered from heartburn , loss of appetite , emissions in his urine and blood in his phlegm ; his legs trembled , his eyes smarted ; he was feverish at night and exhausted by day .
the doctors who were called in dosed him with dozens of catties of cinnamon , aconitum roots , turtle-shell , liriope , polygonatum and so forth -- -but all to no effect . with the coming of spring he took a turn for the worse .
and when pure ginseng was prescribed this was beyond jia dairu ’ s means : he had to ask for help from the rong mansion .
lady wang told xifeng to weigh out two ounces for him .
all our recent supply was used the other day in the old lady ’ s medicine , said xifeng . you told me to keep the remaining whole roots for general yang ’ s wife , and as it happens i sent them round yesterday . if we ’ ve none , send to your mother-in-law ’ s for some .
if you can save the young man ’ s life , that will be a good deed .
to lady wang , however , she reported that she had collected two ounces and sent them over .
one day a lame taoist priest came begging for alms and professes to have specialized in curing diseases due to retribution . jia rui heard him from his sick-bed .
at once , kowtowing on his pillow he loudly implored his servants to bring the priest in . when they complied he seized hold of the taoist and cried : save me , bodhisattva !
he cried out :
let me take the mirror with me !
these were the last words he uttered .
the attendants had simply observed him look into the mirror , let it fall and then open his eyes and pick it up again . this time , however , when the mirror fell he did not stir . they pressed round and saw that he had breathed his last .
at once they laid him out and made ready the bier , while his grandparents gave way to uncontrollable grief and cursed the taoist . this devilish mirror !
jia she and jia zheng of the rong mansion contributed twenty taels each towards the expenses , and jia zhen of the ning mansion did the same .
others gave three or five taels according to their means , while the families of jia rui ’ s schoolmates collected another twenty or thirty taels .
so jia dairu , although not well-off , was able to conduct the funeral in style . and then , at the end of winter , a letter came from lin ruhai saying that he was seriously ill and wished to have his daughter sent home . this increased the lady dowager ’ s distress , but they had to prepare with all speed for daiyu ’ s departure ; and although baoyu was most upset he could hardly come between her and her father .
the lady dowager decided that jia lian should accompany her granddaughter and bring her safely back . we need not dwell on the presents and arrangements for the journey , which naturally left nothing to be desired . a day was quickly chosen on which jia lian and daiyu took their leave of everyone and , accompanied by attendants , set sail for yangzhou .
for further details , read the next chapter .
she passed the evenings as best she could chatting with pinger before retiring listlessly to bed . one evening , tired of embroidering , she sat nursing her hand-stove by the lamp and told the maid to warm her embroidered quilt early , after which they both went to bed . when the third watch sounded they were still reckoning on their fingers the stage jia lian must have reached on his journey .
is it possible you don ’ t know the saying that the moon waxes only to wane , water brims only to overflow , and the higher the climb the harder the fall ’ ?
if one day it happens that at the height of good fortune the tree falls and the monkeys scatter ’ as the old saying has it , then what will become of our cultured old family ?
fortune follows calamity as disgrace follows honour . this has been so from time immemorial . how can men prevent it ?
the only thing one can do is to make some provision for lean years in times of plenty . all ’ s well at present except for two things . take care of them and the future will be secure .
xifeng asked what she had in mind .
although seasonal sacrifices are offered at the ancestral tombs there ’ s no fixed source of income for this , and although we have a family school there ’ s no definite fund for it . of course , while we ’ re still prosperous , we don ’ t lack the wherewithal for sacrifices , but where ’ s it to come from once we fall on hard times ?
i ’ d like to suggest that while we ’ re still rich and noble we should invest in some farms and estates near our ancestral tombs to provide for sacrifices . the family school should be moved to the same place .
let the whole family , old and young alike , draw up rules whereby each branch of the family will take it in turn to manage the land , income and sacrifices for a year .
then even if the family property were confiscated because of some crime , the estate for ancestral worship would be exempted and in those hard times the young people could go there to study and farm . they ’ d have something to fall back on , and there would be no break in the sacrifices . it would be very short-sighted not to take thought for the future in the belief that our present good fortune will last for ever .
but it will simply be a flash in the pan , a brief moment of bliss . whatever happens don ’ t forget the proverb , even the grandest feast must have an end . take thought for the future before it is too late .
but because of the love between us let me give you some parting advice , and do remember it , aunt ! with that she declaimed : after the three months of the spring , all flowers will fade and each will have to find his own way out .
before xifeng could ask more she was woken with a start by four blows on the chime-bar at the second gate . and a servant announced , madam jia rong of the east mansion has passed away .
when she had recovered from her stupefaction , she dressed quickly and hurried over to lady wang . by that time the whole household was lamenting , distressed by this shocking news . the old people recalled keqing ’ s filial behaviour , the young people her affectionate ways and the children her kindness ; while not one of the servants but wept for grief recollecting her compassion for the poor and humble and her loving goodness to old and young alike .
but let us return to baoyu , who was so desolate after daiyu ’ s departure that he had given up playing with his companions and went disconsolate to bed each night . roused from sleep by the announcement of keqing ’ s death , he sprang suddenly from his bed .
at once he felt a stab of pain in his heart , and with a cry spat out a mouthful of blood .
xiren and his other maids rushed up to help him back to bed , asking anxiously what was the matter . should they get the lady dowager to send for a doctor ? there ’ s no need , it ’ s nothing , he said .
a hot humour seized on my heart and stopped the normal flow of blood . he got up again and demanded to be dressed so that he could go to his grandmother and then to the other mansion .
besides , at night the wind is high .
you may just as well go tomorrow .
when baoyu insisted , she ordered a carriage and plenty of attendants for him .
they found the gates of the ning mansion wide open and brilliantly lit with lanterns on either side .
alighting from his carriage baoyu hurried to the room in which keqing lay and having wept there went in to see madam you , who happened to be laid up with another bout of dyspepsia .
he then paid his respects to jia zhen .
by now jia dairu had arrived with jia daixiu , jia chi , jia xiao , jia dun , jia she , jia zheng , jia cong , jia bin , jia heng , jia guang , jia chen , jia qiong , jia lin , jia qiang , jia chang , jia ling , jia yun , jia qin , jia zhen , jia ping , jia zao , jia heng , jia fen , jia fang , jia lan , jia jun and jia zhi .
bathed in tears , jia zhen was telling jia dairu and the others , everyone in the family , old and young , distant kin or close friends , knows that my daughter-in-law was infinitely superior to my son .
now that she has gone , my branch of the family is fated to die out . with that he broke down again . the men present tried to console him : since she has departed this world it is useless to weep .
he was interrupted by the arrival of qin ye , qin zhong and some relatives of madam you as well as her younger sisters .
leaving jia qiong , jia cen , jia lin and jia qiang to keep the guests company , jia zhen sent to invite someone from the department of astrology to choose auspicious days .
it was decided that the body should remain in the house for seven times seven or forty-nine days , and mourning should start the third day after her death with the issue of obituary notices .
during the forty-nine days a hundred and eight buddhist monks were to perform the litany of great compassion in the main hail to release the souls of those passed away before and after her and win remission for the sins of the deceased . at an altar erected in the heavenly fragrance pavilion , ninety-nine taoists of the perfect truth sect should pray for forty-nine days for absolution . the coffin would then be taken to the garden of concentrated fragrance , where another fifty high bonzes and fifty high taoists would sacrifice before it once every seventh day during the forty-nine days .
jia jing alone was untouched by the death of his eldest grandson ’ s wife .
so he left all the funeral arrangements to his son . his father ’ s indifference gave jia zhen a free hand to indulge his extravagance . he decided that the cedar-boards he had seen would not do for the coffin and was searching for something better when xue pan called to offer condolences .
in our timber-yard is some qiang wood from the iron-net mountain across the sea , said the young man .
a coffin made of this would last for ten thousand years . my father bought this timber for prince yi zhong , but after his disgrace the prince didn ’ t take it . it ’ s still stored with us because no one has ventured to buy it .
if you like , i ’ ll have it sent over . overjoyed by this news , jia zhen had the timber fetched without delay .
everyone gathered round and exclaimed in wonder , for the planks for the sides and the base were eight inches thick with a grain like that of the areca palm and the perfume of sandalwood or musk . when tapped they gave off a clear ringing sound like metal or jade .
jia zhen , his face radiant , inquired the price .
you couldn ’ t buy this for a thousand taels , replied xue pan with a smile . don ’ t worry about the price .
after copious thanks jia zhen lost no time in giving directions for the wood to be sawn and varnished . jia zheng objected , this seems too sumptuous for ordinary people . the best quality cedar-boards would be quite adequate .
word was brought that after keqing ’ s death one of her maids , ruizhu , had dashed out her own brains against a pillar . the whole clan praised this act of rare loyalty and jia zhen ordered that she be buried with the rites befitting a grandchild , her coffin resting in the pavilion of attained immortality in the garden of concentrated fragrance . another maid , baozhu , offered to act as keqing ’ s god-daughter and take the chief mourner ’ s part , since her mistress had no child .
this pleased jia zhen so much that he directed that henceforward baozhu should be addressed as miss , as if she were a daughter of the house . then baozhu mourned like an unmarried daughter , weeping by the coffin as if her heart would break , while all the clansmen and servants observed the etiquette traditionally prescribed for such occasions with unimpeachable propriety .
what distressed jia zhen now was the fact that his son was only a state scholar . this would not look well in the inscription on the funeral banner and it meant that the retinue would have to be small . as luck would have it , however , on the fourth day of the first week of mourning servants with sacrificial offerings arrived from the eunuch dai quan , chamberlain of the palace of great splendour , who followed in a great palanquin with an official umbrella and gonging and drumming to offer an oblation .
jia zhen ushered him eagerly in and offered him tea in the bee-teasing pavilion . he already had a scheme in mind and soon found occasion to express his wish to purchase a rank for his son .
by a fortunate coincidence there happens to be a good post going .
there are two vacancies in the corps of three hundred officers of the imperial guard .
yesterday the third brother of the marquis of xiangyang sent me 1,500 taels and asked me for one of them ; and since we are old friends , as you know , for his grandfather ’ s sake i made no difficulties but agreed out of hand . who would have expected that fatty feng , military governor of yongxing , wants to buy the other appointment for his son ; but i haven ’ t yet had time to give him an answer .
if your boy wants it , make haste and write out a statement of his antecedents .
jia zhen at once sent a servant to pass on these instructions to his secretaries . the man returned presently with a sheet of red paper . after glancing at it jia zhen handed it to dai quan , who read :
jia rong , twenty , state scholar of jiangning district , jiangning prefecture , jiangnan .
great-grandfather : jia daihua , commander-in-chief of the metropolitan garrison and a hereditary general of the first class with the appellation spiritual might .
grandfather : jia jing , metropolitan scholar of the yi mao year .
father : jia zhen , hereditary general of the third rank with the appellation mighty intrepidity .
dai quan ordered one of his attendants , take this to old zhao , chief of the board of revenue , with my compliments . ask him to draw up a warrant for an officer of the fifth rank in the imperial guard and to fill out a commission according to these particulars . tomorrow i will weigh out the silver and send it over .
dai quan then took his leave . his host , who could not detain him , saw him out . before the eunuch mounted his palanquin jia zhen asked :
just weigh out 1,200 taels and send it to my house . if you go to the board , they ’ ll fleece you . jia zhen thanked him warmly and promised , when the mourning is over i shall bring my worthless son to kowtow his thanks .
and so they parted .
then runners could be heard clearing the way for the wife of shi ding , marquis of zhongjing .
lady wang , lady xing and xifeng welcomed her into the drawing-room .
then sacrificial gifts from the marquises of jinxiang and chuanning as well as the earl of shoushan were displayed before the coffin . presently these three nobles alighted from their palanquins and jia zhen ushered them into the main hall . so relatives and friends past counting came and went .
indeed , for forty-nine days the street outside the ning mansion was a sea of mourners in white interspersed by officials in their brilliant robes . at his father ’ s order jia rong changed into court dress the next day to collect his commission , after which the funerary ware in front of the coffin as well as the insignia for the cortege were made to befit an official of the fifth rank . the obituary tablet and notice were inscribed : obsequies of lady qin , spouse of the house of ha , granted a rank by imperial decree off the celestial court .
the street gate in the garden of concentrated fragrance was opened , and on platforms erected at both sides groups of blue-clad musicians played at appropriate times .
the retinue stood in pairs in perfect symmetry , and two large vermilion boards set up outside the gate bore the bold gilt inscriptions imperial guard and defender of the palace roads in the inner court of the forbidden city .
across the road , facing each other , towered two altars for buddhist and taoist priests .
the announcement on them read : obsequies of lady qin of the jia family , consort of the eldest great-grandson of the hereditary duke of ningguo , imperial guard and defender of the palace roads in the inner court of the forbidden city .
in this land of peace and empire ruled according to the will of heaven , in the centre of the four continents , we , chief buddhist abbot wan xu , controller of the school of the void and asceticism , and chief taoist abbot ye sheng , controller of the primordial school of the trinity , having reverently purified ourselves raise our eyes to heaven and kowtow to buddha . we humbly invoke all divinities to show their divine compassion and display their spiritual majesty afar in these forty-nine days of grand sacrifice , that the departed may be delivered from sins and absolved from retribution ... . there was more in the same vein .
inquired lady xing .
you know how it is , aunt . with my daughter-in-law gone and my wife ill in bed , everything is at sixes and sevens in the inner apartments .
lady xing smiled . xifeng is part of your aunt wang ’ s establishment , so you ’ ll have to ask her permission .
you ’ d better find someone else .
i can guess your real objection , aunt , he replied . you ’ re afraid she ’ d find it too tiring . as for handling things badly , i know that wouldn ’ t be the case .
ever since she was a child at play cousin xifeng has known her own mind , and by managing the other house since her marriage she ’ s gained experience . i ’ ve been thinking this over for some days and there ’ s no one else so competent . if you won ’ t agree for my sake or my wife ’ s , aunt , do it for the one who ’ s dead .
his tears flowed again . lady wang ’ s only concern had been lest xifeng , having no experience of funerals , might lay herself open to ridicule by managing badly . the earnestness of jia zhen ’ s request softened her heart and she eyed xifeng thoughtfully .
are you sure you can cope ? whispered lady wang . i don ’ t see why not .
jia zhen ’ s request delighted her . seeing that his eagerness was overcoming lady wang ’ s initial reluctance , she said :
i can ’ t see to everything , jia zhen said to xifeng . i must beg you to help us , cousin . let me express my gratitude now , and when everything ’ s over i shall come round to your side to thank you properly .
just use this to requisition whatever , you want , there ’ s no need to consult me .
i ’ ve only two requests to make .
first , please don ’ t try to spare me expense , as i want everything done handsomely . and secondly , treat the servants here as you would your own , don ’ t be afraid they may resent it . apart from these two provisos , nothing else worries me .
xifeng did not venture to take the tally but glanced at lady wang .
do as your cousin asks , said lady wang .
but don ’ t take too much upon yourself .
if there are any decisions to make , send to ask him and your sister-in-law what should be done .
baoyu had already taken the tally from jia then and forced it on xifeng .
would you prefer to stay here or to come over every day ? jia zhen asked her .
they can ’ t do without me over there . i ’ ll come every day .
jia zhen did not insist but left them after a little further chat . as soon as the visitors had gone lady wang asked xifeng what she proposed to do now . please don ’ t wait for me , madam .
i must sort things out before i come home . so lady wang left first with lady xing , while xifeng retired to a small three-roomed annex to reflect as follows : first , this household is such a mixed one that things may get lost .
thirdly , the heavy expenditure may lead to extravagance and faked receipts . fourthly , if no distinction is made between large tasks and small ones , some will have a harder time than others . fifthly , these servants are so out of hand that those with any pretensions may defy me , and those with none won ’ t do their best .
these were indeed the ’ five distinguishing features of the ning mansion .
they agreed and one remarked with a laugh , actually we need her to get this place into shape . things are too out of hand . along came lai wang ’ s wife just then with a tally and a receipt for the amount required , to fetch sacrificial paper and paper for supplications and prayers .
on the road when the news that xifeng was to take charge reached lai sheng , chief steward of the ning mansion , he summoned all his colleagues . madam jia lian of the west mansion is coming to supervise our household , he told them .
then xifeng ordered caiming to prepare a register and sent for lai sheng ’ s wife to bring her a list of the staff .
she announced that all the men-servants ’ wives were to come to her early the next morning for instructions . after checking quickly through the list and asking lai sheng 5 wife a couple of questions , she went home in her carriage . she was back at half past six the next morning to find all the old servingwomen and stewards ’ wives assembled .
they did not venture into the antechamber when they saw that she and lai sheng ’ s wife were busy assigning tasks , but from outside the window they heard her tell the latter :
i ’ m not as easy-going as your own mistress who lets you do as you please ; so don ’ t tell me how things used to be managed here , but just do as i say . the least disobedience will be dealt with publicly , no matter how much face the offender may have .
she made caiming call the roll and the servants entered one by one for inspection . after this she ordered :
these twenty , also in two shifts of ten , will see to the family ’ s meals and tea every day . they will have no other duties either .
these forty , divided into two shifts , will have the job of burning incense , keeping the lamps filled with oil , hanging up curtains , watching by the coffin , offering sacrificial rice and tea , and mourning with the mourners . these four will be responsible for the cups , plates and tea things in the pantry , and will have to replace anything that is missing .
the rest of you will be assigned to different apartments and must stick to your posts . you will be responsible for everything there , from furniture and antiques to spittoons and dusters and each blade of grass —and will have to make good any loss or damage . lai sheng ’ s wife will make a general inspection every day and report to me instantly any slackness , gambling , drinking , fighting or quarrelling .
these eight will receive the presents of sacrificial offerings . these eight will look after the distribution of lamps , oil , candles and sacrificial paper to various places according to a list which i shall issue . these thirty will take night duty in turns , seeing that the gates are locked and keeping a look-out for fires , as well as sweeping the grounds .
if i find you being too soft , i shall make no allowances for you , even though your family has been in service here for three or four generations . now you all have your duties , and if anything goes wrong i shall deal with the group concerned . my own servants have clocks and watches , because everything large or small must be done on time .
at seven in the evening , after the burning of sacrificial paper , i shall make a tour of inspection , then issue those on night duty with their keys .
i shall be back again at half past six the next morning .
i needn ’ t remind you that we must all do our best during this period . when it ’ s over , no doubt your master will reward you .
she then ordered the distribution of supplies of tea , oil , candles , feather whisks , brooms and so forth , and had tablecloths , antimacassars , cushions , rugs , spittoons , stools and other furnishings issued .
while this was being done , the servants in charge of each place and the articles taken by each were carefully recorded . now that all the servants had their respective duties , they were no longer able to pick the easy jobs and leave the hard ones undone .
and xifeng was thoroughly gratified by the authority she now wielded . as madam you was ill and grief had made jia zhen lose his appetite , xifeng every day sent over from the other mansion some fine congee and delicacies she had prepared especially for them . and jia zhen also ordered the best food to be served for her alone in her annex every day .
xifeng was not afraid of hard work . she came over punctually every morning at half past six to call the roll and see to any business , sitting alone in her annex and not even joining the other young wives to greet lady guests .
on the thirty-third day buddhist monks performed the rites to cleave the earth asunder , break open hell and light the dead down with lanterns to pay homage to the king of hell ; to arrest evil demons ; to invoke prince ksitigarbha under the ground to raise up the golden bridge and lead the way with streamers . taoists offered prayers and invocations , worshipping the three pure ones and the jade emperor . bonzes chanting sutras burned incense , sacrificed to the hungry ghosts and intoned the water penitential while thirteen young nuns in red slippers and embroidered robes recited incantations before the coffin to lead the soul on its way .
all was bustle and noise . knowing that many guests could be expected , xifeng told pinger to wake her up at four that day . by the time she had finished her toilet , sipped some milk and sweetened rice congee and rinsed her mouth , it was half past six and lai wang ’ s wife was already waiting with the other servants .
xifeng left the hail and mounted her carriage , in front of which were two brilliant horn lanterns inscribed with the large characters : the rong mansion .
as she slowly approached the ning mansion the lanterns above its main gate and the lamps on both sides shed a light bright as day on the two rows of attendants there in white mourning .
at the main entrance her pages withdrew and maid-servants raised the curtain of the carriage .
xifeng was helped out by fenger and escorted in by two serving-women with hand-lanterns . all the stewards ’ wives of the ning mansion advanced to greet her . xifeng walked slowly through the garden of concentrated fragrance to the pavilion of attained immortality , where at the sight of the coffin her tears fell like pearls from a broken string .
pages were waiting respectfully in the court for the burning of the sacrificial paper and now she ordered this to be done and an offering of tea presented . after one beat on the gong the music started . a large arm-chair had been set in front of the shrine and seating herself she gave way to loud lamentations .
at once all the others , both men and women , high and low , joined in , until jia zhen and madam you sent to persuade her to restrain her grief .
then lai wang ’ s wife brought her tea to rinse her mouth , and xifeng rose to take her leave of her kinsmen and proceed to the annex . all the women-servants were present at the roll-call except for one usher . she came when summoned in great fear and trembling .
i ’ ve been on time every day before , said the woman .
please overlook it , madam , this once !
just then wang xing ’ s wife from the other mansion peeped in .
eager to have her business attended to first , wang xing ’ s wife came forward and presented a request for silk thread to make tassels for the carriages and sedan-chairs .
on xifeng ’ s instructions caiming read out the number of strings of beads and tassels needed for two palanquins and four sedan-chairs as well as four carriages . finding the figures correct , xifeng told caiming to register them and gave a rong mansion tally to wang xing ’ s wife , who left . before xifeng could deal with the offender in came four stewards from the rong mansion with indents for stores .
xifeng had their orders read out and pointed at two of the four items . these figures are wrong . come back when you ’ ve worked them out correctly .
then she noticed zhang cai ’ s wife and asked her business . the woman handed her an order form , saying , the covers for the carriages and sedan-chairs are finished , and i ’ ve come for the money for the tailor .
xifeng told caiming to enter this , and when wang xing ’ s wife had returned the tally and fetched the accountant ’ s receipt for the right sum zhang cai ’ s wife was sent to get the money .
another order for wallpaper to paper baoyu ’ s outer study was read out and registered .
i should have liked to let you off , but if i overlook the first offence the others will get out of hand . i shall be obliged to make an example of you . with a stern look she ordered the woman to be taken out and given twenty strokes with the bamboo .
when the others heard this and saw xifeng ’ s angry frown , they dared not show slackness in carrying out her orders . some hastily dragged out the woman ; others passed on the order to lai sheng . after the usher had been given twenty strokes she had to return to kowtow to xifeng .
she then threw down the ning mansion tally and gave orders that lai sheng should dock this usher of a month ’ s wages .
xifeng warned the servants , anyone late again tomorrow will get forty strokes , and sixty the day after that .
so those who want a beating , just come late .
the people outside the window , hearing this , went off to attend to their tasks . then a steady stream of domestics from both mansions kept coming to hand in or apply for indents , while the woman who had been beaten also left shamefacedly . after this demonstration of xifeng ’ s severity , the servants of the ning mansion worked hard and , to be on the safe side , dared not neglect their duties .
but no more of this . let us return to baoyu .
or over in the other house ?
we had a meal over there with the old lady . he and qin zhong sat down .
as soon as the meal was finished , a woman from the ning mansion arrived with an indent for incense and lamps .
i knew it was time for you to come today but thought you ’ d forgotten , observed xifeng , smiling .
if you had , you ’ d have had to pay for them yourself .
she took the tally and went off .
you use the same tallies in both your mansions , remarked qin zhong with a smile .
what if someone faked one and ran off with your money ? do you think us such a lawless lot ?
xifeng asked , laughing . how is it that no one has come from our house to ask for things ?
put in baoyu . when they came you were still fast asleep . but tell me , when are you two going to start your evening lessons ?
they need materials for the job . they can ’ t do a thing if i withhold the tally . baoyu cuddled up to her at that and coaxed , dear cousin , do give them the tally so that they can get what they need .
i ’ m so tired , my bones are aching , protested xifeng . must you jostle me like that ?
when baoyu refused to believe this she made caiming show him the record . just then someone announced that zhaoer was back from suzhou and xifeng promptly ordered him to be brought in . zhaoer fell on one knee to greet her .
why have you come back ?
the master sent me , madam .
lord lin died on the third of the ninth month , at nine in the morning . the master and miss lin are escorting his coffin to suzhou and should be home about the end of the year .
he sent me to bring the news with his greetings and to ask for the old lady ’ s instructions . i was to see , too , if you were well at home , madam , and to take back some of his fur-lined gowns .
xifeng turned to baoyu with a smile .
he knit his brows and sighed .
tempted to go home but kept by unfinished business and afraid of making herself look ridiculous , she had to restrain her impatience until the evening , when she summoned zhaoer to give her all the particulars of their journey . that same night she got pinger to help her select some fur-lined clothes and carefully thought out what else her husband might need . having packed these things together she handed them to zhaoer and cautioned him :
mind you look after your master properly outside and don ’ t make him angry .
try to keep him from drinking too much , and don ’ t pander to him by finding him loose women — if you do , i ’ ll break your legs when you get back .
by then it was well after the fourth watch and though she went to bed she had lost all desire to sleep . soon it was dawn . she made a hasty toilet and went over to the ning mansion .
now that the day for the funeral was approaching , ha zhen drove in person with a geomancer to iron threshold temple to inspect the repository for the coffin and enjoin on abbot sekong , who was in charge , the need for the finest furnishings and the help of the most noted monks for the coffin ’ s reception .
sekong hastily prepared supper , but jia zhen had no interest in food . since it was too late to return to town , however , he put up that night in the guest room , starting back first thing in the morning to arrange for the funeral procession . he sent men ahead to the temple to spend that night in redecorating the repository and in seeing to refreshments and the reception of the funeral party .
meanwhile xifeng too had made careful preparations , choosing the servants , carriages and sedan-chairs of the rong mansion that would accompany lady wang to the funeral , and a place in which to stay herself for the occasion . as the duke of shanguo ’ s wife had just died , lady xing and lady wang had to send sacrificial gifts and attend her funeral .
then a first son was born to the duke of zhenguo and congratulatory gifts had to be sent . then xifeng had to write a letter home and prepare gifts for her brother wang ren to take when he returned south with his family . then yingchun fell ill and every day they had to call in doctors , study their diagnoses , discuss the cause of the illness and decide on prescriptions ... .
as the day of the funeral approached , a thousand and one affairs kept xifeng so busy that she had no time to eat and was hardly able to have a moment ’ s rest .
when she went to the ning mansion , servants from the rong mansion followed her there ; when she returned to the rong mansion , servants from the ning mansion would come after her .
yet busy as she was , her spirits were high . she shirked not a single task , determined to give no one any grounds for complaint . indeed , she worked so hard day and night and handled everything so well that not one of the household , high or low , but was impressed .
now the time had come for the wake . the family ’ s two troupes of actors and some musicians , dancers and acrobats were to perform a long programme of items , and the place was thronged with relatives and friends . as madam you was still keeping to her bed xifeng had to look after them single-handed ; for all the other married women in the family were either tongue-tied , flighty , shy of strangers or awed by nobles and officials .
that night was all brilliance and bustle , needless to say , with the lanterns and torches of the officials and guests coming and going . when the auspicious hour arrived at dawn , sixty-four bearers in blue bore out the coffin . it was preceded by a great funeral banner bearing the inscription in large characters :
spiritual abode of lady qin of the jia family , consort of the imperial guard and defender of the palace roads of the inner court of the forbidden city , and eldest great-great-grandson of the duke of ningguo enfeoffed with the first rank by the heaven-sent , splendidly established , long-enduring dynasty . the brand-new funeral paraphernalia was a dazzling sight .
and baozhu , observing the rites for an unmarried daughter , dashed an earthen basin to pieces when the coffin was lifted to be carried away and lamented bitterly before it .
among the officials attending the funeral were : niu jizong , hereditary earl of the first rank , grandson of niu qing , duke of zhenguo ; liu fang , hereditary viscount of the first rank , grandson of liu biao , duke of liguo ; chen ruiwen , hereditary general of the third rank , grandson of chen yi , duke of qiguo ; ma shang , hereditary general of the third rank , grandson of ma kui , duke of zhiguo ; and hou xiaokang , hereditary viscount of the first rank , grandson of hou xiaoming , duke of xiuguo .
since the duke of shanguo ’ s wife had died , his grandson shi guangzhu was in mourning and unable to come . these six families , with those of ning and rong , were known as the eight ducal households .
the other mourners included : the grandson of the prince of nanan ; the grandson of the prince of xining ; shi ding , marquis of zhongjing ; hang zining , hereditary baron of the second rank , grandson of the marquis of pingyuan ; xie qiong , hereditary baron of the second rank , captain of the metropolitan garrison , grandson of the marquis of dingcheng ; qi jianhui , hereditary baron of the second rank , grandson of the marquis of xiangyang ; qiu liang , garrison commander of five cities , grandson of the marquis of jingtian .
also present were han qi , son of the earl of jinxiang ; feng ziying , son of the general of divine valour ; chen yejun , wei ruolan and countless other sons of nobles .
there were also over a dozen palanquins and thirty to forty sedan-chairs for lady guests .
these together with the carriages and sedan-chairs of the jia family numbered well over a hundred . with the elaborate equipage in front and the performances given on the way , the procession extended a good three or four li . before long they reached stands with coloured silk awnings by the roadside where music was played and sacrificial offerings had been set out by different families .
the first four belonged to the houses of the prince of dongping , the prince of nanan , the prince of xining , and the prince of beijing .
the original prince of beijing had won the highest distinction of these four princes , and therefore his descendants had inherited his title .
the present holder of the title , shui rong , was a charming and modest young man of less than twenty with remarkable good looks . when he heard that the eldest great-great-grandson of the duke of ningguo had lost his wife , the thought of their forefathers ’ friendship , shared dangers and glory as if of one family had made him lay aside all considerations of rank and go in person to express his condolences .
now he had set up a funeral booth by the roadside to offer a libation . he made some of his officers wait there while he went to court at dawn .
the audience over , he changed into mourning clothes and came here by palanquin , preceded by sounding gongs and ceremonial umbrellas . he halted his palanquin at the stand and his officers ranged themselves on either side , forbidding soldiers and civilians to pass . presently , from the north , the ning mansion ’ s magnificent funeral procession bore down on them like a great silver landslide .
the runners sent ahead to clear the way had reported the prince ’ s arrival to jia zhen , who now ordered the procession to halt while he , ha she and ha zheng went to greet the prince according to state ceremonial .
the prince bowed affably in return from his palanquin , treating them as old family friends without any affectation .
jia zhen said , we are overwhelmed by the favour done us by your highness in honouring my daughter-in-law ’ s funeral with your presence .
that is no way for good friends to talk , protested the prince . then he turned and ordered his chief steward to preside at the sacrifice for him and pour a libation .
jia she and the others , having bowed in return , stepped forward to express their gratitude . the prince of beijing was completely unassuming . he asked jia zheng , which is the young gentleman born with a piece of jade in his mouth ?
i am sure he must be here today .
jia zheng withdrew at once to fetch baoyu .
he made him change out of mourning , then took him to meet the prince .
baoyu had heard from his family and friends of the prince of beijing ’ s fine qualities , his talent , good looks , refinement and unconventionality . he had often wanted to meet him , but his father kept him under such strict control that hitherto he had never had a chance . of course he was delighted to be sent for .
walking forward , he was struck by the dignity with which the prince was sitting in his palanquin .
to know the sequel , read the chapter which follows . xifeng abuses her power at
qin zhong amuses himself in
looking up , baoyu saw that the prince of beijing had on a princely silver-winged cap with white tassels , a white robe embroidered with zigzag wave patterns and five-clawed dragons , and a red leather belt studded with green jade .
with his face fair as jade , his eyes bright as stars , he was truly a handsome figure . baoyu started forward to make his obeisance .
as the prince from his palanquin raised him up , he noticed that baoyu was wearing a sliver chaplet in the form of two dragons rising from the sea , an archer ’ s coat embroidered with white serpents , and a silver belt set with pearls . his face seemed a flower in spring , his eyes black as lacquer .
you live up to your name , remarked the prince . you are really like precious jade . but where is that gem with which you came into the world ?
baoyu hastily took the jade from inside his garments and handed it to the prince , who examined it carefully and read the inscription . does it actually have magic powers ? so they say , answered jia zheng .
but it has never yet been put to the test .
the prince was very struck by the jade and , smoothing its silken cord , with his own hands he put it round baoyu ’ s neck .
then taking the boy ’ s hand he asked him his age and what he was studying . the clarity and fluency of baoyu ’ s answers made the prince turn to observe to jia zheng , your son is truly a dragon ’ s colt or young phoenix .
my worthless son does not deserve such high praise , rejoined jia zheng hurriedly with a courteous smile .
if thanks to the grace of your highness such proves the case , that will be our good fortune . there is one thing , however , cautioned the prince . because your son is so talented his grandmother and mother must have doted on him ; but over-indulgence is very bad for young people like ourselves as it makes us neglect our studies .
if he finds it difficult to study at home , he is very welcome to come as often as he likes to my humble house . for although untalented myself , i am honoured by visits from scholars of note from all parts of the empire when they come to the capital .
jia zheng bowed and assented to this without hesitation .
the prince now took a string of beads from his wrist and gave it to baoyu saying , this first meeting of ours is so hurried that i have brought no gift to show my respect , but please accept this string of beads made of the aromatic seeds of some plant which his majesty gave me the other day .
baoyu took it and turned to present it to his father , who together with his son offered formal thanks . then jia she and jia zhen stepped forward and begged the prince to return , but he demurred : the deceased has become an immortal and left our dusty world .
although by the favour of the son of heaven i have succeeded to this title , how can i precede the carriage of an immortal ? seeing that he was adamant , jia she and the others thanked him and withdrew to stop the music , so as to let the long procession pass on . and thereupon the prince went back .
but no more of this . the whole road hummed with excitement as the great procession passed . by the city gate friends and colleagues of jia she , jia zheng and jia zhen had set up sacrificial tents and not until each had been thanked in turn did the cortege leave the city and proceed along the highway towards iron threshold temple .
now jia zhen and jia rong urged their elders to mount their chairs or horses .
all of jia she ’ s generation mounted carriages or chairs while jia zhen ’ s contemporaries rode on horseback .
xifeng was afraid that baoyu , unchecked by his father , might come to some harm through reckless riding in the open country , for he would not listen to anyone else in the household . and if there were any mishap it would be hard to account for it to the old lady .
accordingly she ordered a page to summon him to her carriage , and when perforce he came she told him with a smile :
wouldn ’ t it be better to come and share my carriage ? baoyu hurriedly dismounted to join her . they drove on laughing and chatting until two horsemen galloped up and alighted by the carriage to report , we have reached a halting place , madam .
will you stop for a rest ? having asked to know the wishes of lady xing and lady wang , xifeng was told , their ladyships are not stopping , but they want you to suit your convenience .
thereupon xifeng ordered a halt . attendants led their carriage northwards away from the cortege and at baoyu ’ s orders went to invite qin zhong , who was riding behind his father ’ s chair , to join them .
when baoyu ’ s page brought him this invitation and he saw his friend ’ s riderless horse following xifeng ’ s carriage north , qin zhong knew that baoyu must be with her .
he promptly overtook them and together they entered the gateway of a farm . the menfolk here had long since been packed off , but the farmhouse had so few rooms that the womenfolk had nowhere to go to keep out of the way . the sudden appearance in their midst of xifeng , baoyu and qin zhong with their gorgeous clothes and refined looks and manners made these village women stare with admiration .
once in the thatched house xifeng suggested to baoyu that he should amuse himself outside . taking the hint , he led qin zhong and the pages off to look around .
now i understand the words of the old poet :
who knows that each grain of rice we eat
strolling into an outhouse , he was still more intrigued by a spinning-wheel on the kang .
his pages told him this was used to weave yarn .
he had just climbed up on the kang to turn the wheel for fun when in came a peasant girl of seventeen or eighteen . she ran over crying :
you ’ ll break it ! she was shouted at by his pages , but baoyu had already let go of the wheel .
i ’ ve never seen one before , he explained with a smile .
how could you people know how ? said the girl . get out of my way and i ’ ll show you.~~
qin zhong plucked at baoyu ’ s sleeve and whispered , isn ’ t she fun ? baoyu gave him a shove . if you talk any more nonsense i ’ ll clout you .
meanwhile the girl had started spinning . baoyu was just about to speak to her when an old woman called , come here , quick , second daughter ! at that she went off , much to his disappointment .
then a messenger summoned them back to xifeng , who had washed and changed to remove the dust of the journey . she urged the two boys to change , but baoyu declined . their attendants now produced the tea-service and hamper which they had brought for the journey , and after some refreshments they smartened up and mounted their carriage again .
xifeng , however , took no notice of them , while baoyu looked eagerly for the spinning-girl . but she was not in the group . they had not gone far , though , when he saw her , her little brother in her arms , approaching laughing and chatting with some smaller girls .
baoyu longed to alight and go with her , but knowing that the others would not agree he could only follow her with his eyes as their carriage drove swiftly off . soon she was out of sight .
before very long , they overtook the procession . ahead of them were temple drums and cymbals , pennants and umbrellas , while monks from iron threshold temple lined the road . soon they entered the temple , where
again buddhist rites were performed and incense burned , after which the coffin was installed in one of the side-chambers of the inner hall and baozhu prepared to keep vigil there that night . in the outer apartments jia zhen entertained their male friends and relatives , some of whom stayed for a meal while others took their leave immediately . he tendered them thanks one by one for coming .
then the guests began to take their leave from dukes , marquises , earls , viscounts and barons downwards , and by three o ’ clock all had dispersed . the ladies were entertained in the inner apartments by xifeng . they , too , left in order of precedence , and by about two o ’ clock all had gone except a few close relatives who would remain for the three day ’ s requiems for the dead .
knowing that xifeng could not return with them , lady xing and lady wang proposed to take baoyu back with them to the city . but as this was his first visit to the country and he insisted on staying behind with xifeng , his mother had to leave him in her charge . now this iron threshold temple had been built in the days of the dukes of rongguo and ningguo and still had enough land of its own to provide for incense and lamps and repositories for the coffins of clansmen .
since there was accommodation for both the dead and the living , the mourners escorting coffins had somewhere to stay . however , now that the family had grown the views of the rich members differed from those of the poor . whereas the latter were content to stay here , those who were wealthy and fond of display maintained that the place was inconvenient and preferred to find accommodation in some nearby village or convent to retire to at the end of the ceremonies .
on this occasion of qin keqing ’ s funeral most members of the clan stayed at iron threshold temple . only xifeng , deciding that it would not suit her , had sent a servant to ask abbess jingxu of steamed-bread convent to clear a few rooms for her . steamed-bread convent was the popular name for water moon convent because of the good steamed bread made here .
as soon as the monks had completed their devotions and the evening offering of tea had been made , jia zhen sent jia rong to urge xifeng to rest .
qin zhong ’ s father , too old and frail to remain himself , had told his son to attend the requiems , and so the boy stayed with xifeng and baoyu . they were met at the convent gate by abbess jingxu and two novices , zhishan and zhineng . after an exchange of greetings xifeng retired to a rest room .
why haven ’ t you and your abbess been to see us lately ? a few days ago a son was born to mr. hu , explained the abbess . his good lady sent us ten taels of silver to get some of our sisters to chant the nativity sutra for three days , so we ’ ve been too busy to come and pay our respects .
but let us return to baoyu and qin zhong , who were fooling about in the hall when zhineng came in . look who ’ s here , said baoyu with a smile . what about it ?
protested qin zhong .
tell her to pour me some tea and i ’ ll let you off .
why should i ask for you ?
why should i ask for you ?
soon she was back again with a cup of tea .
this young novice had been in and out of the rong mansion since childhood .
she knew everyone there and had often romped with baoyu and qin zhong ; and now that she was old enough to know the meaning of love she had taken a fancy to handsome young qin zhong , who was attracted in turn by her pretty looks .
although nothing had passed between them , they already had a secret understanding .
give it to me !
urged qin zhong with a smile .
zhineng laughed mockingly . do i have honey on my hands that you squabble even over a cup of tea ? baoyu grabbed hold of the cup and started drinking , and before he could speak again zhishan came to fetch zhineng to lay the table .
presently she returned to invite them to have some refreshments , but the tea and cakes served in the convent did not tempt them . they sat a while , then escaped as soon as they could to amuse themselves elsewhere .
xifeng retired presently , too , to the rest room accompanied by the abbess .
when the older maid-servants saw there was nothing to do they went off to bed themselves , leaving only a few trusted younger maids in attendance .
the abbess seized this chance to say , there ’ s something i ’ ve been meaning to go and ask her ladyship , but i ’ d like to have your advice on it first , madam .
when i became a nun in shancai convent in the county of changan , one of our benefactors was a very wealthy man called zhang , whose daughter jinge often came to our temple to offer incense .
a young mr. li , who is brother-in-law to the prefect of changan , met her there . he fell in love at first sight and sent to ask for her hand ; but she was already engaged to the son of the former inspector of changan .
the zhangs would have liked to cancel the engagement but were afraid the inspector might object , so they explained to the lis that she was betrothed .
still young mr. li insisted on having her , making things very difficult for the zhangs .
they refused to take back the betrothal gifts and took the matter to court . the girl ’ s family are desperate . they ’ ve sent to the capital to enlist help and are quite determined to return the gifts .
well , i understand that general yun the military governor of changan is on friendly terms with your family . if lady wang would get his lordship to write to general yun , asking him to have a word with the inspector , i ’ m sure he ’ d drop the suit . and the zhangs would gladly give any-
there shouldn ’ t be any great difficulty about this , rejoined xifeng . but her ladyship doesn ’ t trouble herself with such matters.~~
i ’ m neither short of money nor do i meddle with affairs of this sort .
if you do nothing , they won ’ t realize that you can ’ t be troubled and don ’ t want the money — it would look as if you can ’ t even handle such a trifling business .
this put xifeng on her mettle .
i ’ ve never believed all that talk about hell and retribution .
let them bring me three thousand taels and i ’ ll see to this for them .
i ’ m not one of your go-betweens just out for money , said xifeng . these three thousand taels will just cover the expenses of the servants i send out and reward them for their trouble .
i myself don ’ t want a cent . i could lay my hands any moment on thirty thousand .
will you do us this favour , then , tomorrow ? can ’ t you see how busy i am , needed right and left ? but since i ’ ve told you i ’ ll do it , of course i ’ ll settle it for you speedily .
a little thing like this might throw other people into a fearful flurry , but i know you ’ d have no trouble handling bigger things than this , madam . as the proverb says , the abler a man , the busier he gets . it ’ s because you ’ re so capable that her ladyship leaves everything to you .
meanwhile qin zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that nobody was about to go in search of zhineng .
having found her alone in a back room washing up the tea things , he threw his arms around her and kissed her . what are you doing ?
if you refuse me again this evening , i ’ ll die here on the spot . what are you thinking of ? at least wait till i ’ m clear of this prison and these people ?
that ’ s easy to manage , but distant water can ’ t quench a present thirst .
with that he blew out the lamp , plunging the room into pitch darkness , and carried her to the kang .
the two of them were frightened out of their wits until a chuckle revealed that it was baoyu . qin zhong sprang up swearing , what are you playing at ?
be a good fellow !
i ’ ll do whatever you say as long as you don ’ t shout .
we ’ ll say no more about it just now .
i ’ ll settle with you after we go to bed .
soon it was time to sleep . xifeng had the inner room , the two boys the outer , while the maids slept on the floor or sat up to keep watch . for fear lest the precious jade might disappear while baoyu was asleep , xifeng had it fetched and put it under her own pillow .
as for how baoyu settled scores with qin zhong , what the eye does not see can only be surmised , and far be it from us to speculate . the next morning the lady dowager and lady wang sent to urge baoyu to dress more warmly and to go home if there was nothing to keep him . this was the last thing he wanted .
though the obsequies were over there remained certain trifles to attend to , so xifeng decided she could spare one more day . in the first place , this would satisfy jia zhen ; in the second , she could attend to the abbess ’ business ; in the third , the lady dowager would be pleased to know that baoyu was enjoying himself . my own business here is finished , she told him with these considerations in mind .
if you want to amuse yourself here a little longer , i suppose i ’ ll have to put up with it . but we must leave tomorrow at the latest .
we ’ ll leave tomorrow . so they arranged to spend another night there .
xifeng sent someone secretly to explain the abbess ’ business to lai wang . he grasped at once what was wanted and hurried into town to get the chief secretary to write a letter in jia lian ’ s name , and set off with it that same night for changan county .
since changan was only a hundred li away , within two days the matter was settled . military governor yun guang had long wanted to please the jia family and was only too glad to agree to this trifling request .
lai wang brought back a letter from him to this effect . meanwhile xifeng , after one more day in the convent , had said goodbye to the abbess , telling her to come for news in three day ’ s time . qin zhong and zhineng could hardly bear to part and bid each other a sad farewell after arranging to meet again in secret .
xifeng went to take a last look at iron threshold temple , where baozhu insisted on remaining .
jia zhen later was obliged to send maids there to keep her company . to know the sequel , read the next chapter . yuanchun is selected as imperial consort
before long baoyu ’ s outer study was ready .
he had agreed with qin zhong to start evening lessons together ; but qin zhong had a weak constitution , and a cold he had caught in the country following his secret affair with zhineng had upset him ; thus on his return to town he developed a cough and lost his appetite completely .
too weak to go out , he had to rest at home . although baoyu was very disappointed , he could do nothing but wait for his friend ’ s recovery . meanwhile xifeng had received yun guang ’ s reply , and the abbess had informed the zhangs that their problem was solved .
so the inspector had to swallow his anger and take back the betrothal gifts .
but though zhang and his wife were snobbish and mercenary , they had a principled and feeling daughter . when jinge learned that her engagement had been broken she found a rope and quietly hanged herself ; and the inspector ’ s son was so much in love that he drowned himself when he heard of her suicide , showing that he was worthy of his good fiancée .
only xifeng was the gainer by three thousand taels , quite unknown to lady wang and the rest of the household . this emboldened her from that time on to undertake countless similar transactions but we need not recount these here .
now it was jia zheng ’ s birthday and both households had gathered to congratulate him . at the height of the festivities the gateman suddenly rushed in to announce : his excellency xia , chief eunuch of the six palaces , has come with a decree from the emperor !
they at once called a halt to the theatricals and had the feast cleared away . a table was set out with incense .
then , throwing open the central gate they knelt down to receive the decree .
soon xia shouzhong the chief eunuch arrived on horseback , followed by a considerable retinue of eunuchs .
he was not carrying an imperial edict , however . having alighted in front of the main hall , he mounted the steps with a beaming smile and , facing south , announced :
by special order of the emperor , jia zheng is to present himself at once for an audience in the hall of respectful approach .
this said , without even taking a sip of tea , he remounted his horse and rode off . jia she and the others could not guess what this portended . jia zheng lost no time in putting on his court robes and going to the palace , leaving the whole family in dire suspense .
the lady dowager sent one mounted messenger after another in search of news ; but it was four hours before lai da and a few other stewards came panting through the inner gate , crying :
his lordship asks the old lady to go at once to the palace with the other ladies to thank his majesty .
the lady dowager had been waiting anxiously in the corridor outside the great hail with lady xing , lady wang , madam you , li wan , xifeng and the jia girls , as well as aunt xue .
on hearing this , they called lai da over and demanded more details .
we had to wait in the outer court , lai da told them . so we had no idea what was going on inside .
she ’ s to be chief secretary of the phoenix palace with the title of worthy and virtuous consort . and then his lordship came out and confirmed this . now he has gone to the east palace and he begs your ladyship and the other ladies to go at once to offer thanks .
they were all so relieved that their faces shone with delight as each dressed in the ceremonial robes appropriate to her rank .
and presently four large sedan-chairs , with the lady dowager ’ s at the head , followed by lady xing ’ s , lady wang ’ s and madam you ’ s , were making their way to the palace .
they were escorted by jia she and jia zhen , also in court robes , as well as jia rong and jia qiang .
now , a few days previously , zhineng had stolen away from water moon convent and come to town to look for qin zhong in his home .
the old man ’ s rage had brought on an attack of his chronic disorder , and within a few days he was dead . qin zhong had never been strong nor had he fully recovered from his illness when he received this beating . his father ’ s death filled him with such remorse that his condition was now serious .
he alone remained utterly indifferent to the trip made by the lady dowager and the rest to offer thanks for the imperial favour , the visits of congratulations paid by relatives and friends , the excitement which filled both mansions . the general delight left him completely unmoved , just as if these things had never happened .
his apathy made everyone declare that he was growing more and more eccentric . luckily a messenger arrived at this time from jia lian to announce that he and daiyu were on their way back and would be home the following day .
a little cheered , baoyu questioned the man and learned that jia yucun was also coming to the capital to pay homage . for thanks to wang ziteng ’ s recommendations he had been summoned to wait for a metropolitan appointment ; and being a distant cousin of jia lian ’ s and daiyu ’ s former tutor , he was travelling with them .
lin ruhai had been buried in the ancestral graveyard and , his obsequies completed , jia lian was able to start back for the capital . normally , the trip would have taken them till the beginning of the next month ; however , the good news about yuanchun had made jia lian decide to hurry back posthaste .
the journey had been smooth and uneventful .
baoyu was only eager to know that daiyu was all right , taking no interest in the rest of this news . he could hardly contain himself until their arrival was announced just after noon the next day . but the joy of their reunion was tempered by grief .
she had brought back a whole library of books , and lost no time in tidying her bedroom and setting out her things . she presented some brushes and stationery to baochai , yingchun , baoyu and others . but when he produced the precious scented beads given him by the prince of beijing and offered them to her .
i don ’ t want them .
she tossed the beads back and baoyu had to take them .
but let us return to jia lian .
after he had greeted the rest of the family he went to his own quarters ; and busy as xifeng was , with not a moment to herself , she set everything aside to welcome her husband back from his long journey . once they were alone she said jokingly , congratulations , your excellency , kinsman of the imperial house !
your excellency must have had a tiring journey .
your handmaid , hearing yesterday that your exalted carriage would return today , prepared some watery wine by way of welcome . will the imperial kinsman deign to accept it ? you honour me too much , jia lian replied with a chuckle .
when pinger and the other maids had paid their respects and served tea , jia lian asked his wife what had happened during his absence and thanked her for looking after things so well .
i ’ m incapable of running things , she sighed . i ’ m too ignorant , blunt and tactless , always getting hold of the wrong end of the stick . and i ’ m so soft-hearted , anyone can get round me .
besides , lack of experience makes me nervous .
when her ladyship is the least displeased i ’ m too frightened to sleep a wink . time and again i ’ ve begged to be relieved of such a responsibility , but instead of agreeing she accuses me of being lazy and unwilling to learn . she doesn ’ t realize what a cold sweat i ’ m in , terrified of saying one word out of turn or taking one false step .
and you know how difficult our old stewardesses are , laughing at the least mistake and accusing the elm while pointing at the mulberry tree ’ if one shows the least bias . talk about sitting on a hill to watch tigers fight , murdering with a borrowed sword , borrowing wind to fan the fire , watching people drown from a dry bank ’ and not troubling to right an oil bottle that ’ s been knocked over ’ — they ’ re all old hands at such tricks .
on top of that , i ’ m too young to carry much weight ; so naturally they pay no attention to me . as if that weren ’ t bad enough , when rong ’ s wife suddenly died cousin zhen repeatedly begged her ladyship on his knees to let me help them out for a few days . i declined over and over again , but as she insisted i had to have a try .
as usual i made a shocking mess of things —even worse than here .
when you see him tomorrow , do apologize for me . tell him he should never have entrusted such a task to someone so young and inexperienced .
pinger came in and said , madam xue sent xiangling over to ask me something .
i ’ ve given her an answer and sent her back .
in the course of conversation i learned she ’ s the girl they bought just before coming to the capital . her name ’ s xiangling . she belongs to that imbecile xue now , and since he made her his concubine and her face has been slicked she ’ s grown even lovelier .
she ’ s too good for that silly fool . i should have thought you ’ d have seen enough of the world now that you ’ re back from a trip to suzhou and hangzhou , but you ’ re never satisfied .
look how he plagued his mother for a whole year just to get hold of xiangling . it ’ s because aunt xue saw she ’ s not only pretty but really well-behaved , being even gentler and quieter than most young ladies , that she went to all the trouble of inviting guests to a feast to make her his concubine in proper style . yet in less than a fortnight he ’ s treating her like dirt .
at this point a page from the inner gate reported that jia zheng was waiting for jia lian in the big library . the young man hastily straightened his clothes and went out .
then xifeng asked pinger , what on earth did aunt xue send xiangling
she drew nearer and lowered her voice . she wouldn ’ t come earlier or later but had to choose this very moment , when the master ’ s just got home , to bring you the interest on that money .
if our master had asked what it was , of course you ’ d have to tell him — you wouldn ’ t want to deceive him . and being what he is , ready to snatch money from a pan of scalding oil , he ’ d start spending even more recklessly if he knew that you had private savings . so i took it from her double-quick and gave her a piece of my mind , not knowing you ’ d hear .
that ’ s why , in front of the master , i said it was xiangling . i was wondering why aunt xue should suddenly send a concubine here when she knew that your master was back . so it was just one of your tricks .
just then jia lian returned . xifeng called for wine and dishes , and husband and wife took their seats opposite each other .
she was sipping her wine to keep him company when jia lian ’ s old wet-nurse nanny zhao came in .
the young couple promptly invited her to join them on the kang .
but pinger and the others had already set a small table and stool beside the kang , and when the nurse had sat down jia lian gave her two dishes from their own table .
well , perhaps i shouldn ’ t say that . the people we consider outsiders are in ’ with him , i suppose . that raised a general laugh .
