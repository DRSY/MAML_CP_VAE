then the young ladies may judge for themselves and correct me if anything i say conflicts with what they already know of her condition ’

she heard night¬ingale calling her :
li wan and tan-chun , after an early toilet , had attended her to the gate and seen her off
never at the best of times an energetic person , she attended to only the most important matters herself and left most of the routine business to li wan
that reminds me , grannie , of something that happened the other night , as i was going to bed
i don ’ t know myself what it was i said , but i know i must have talked a lot of silly non¬sense

i must insist , though , that i am entirely lacking in real learning and am acutely embarrassed to think that this will all too soon become apparent
but what about musk and the others , don ’ t they feel hard done by ?
at this bao-yu , muttering some incoherent excuse , walked rather sheepishly from the room
our young master always likes to have his say about these matters
aunt xue gave xue pan a furious dressing-down

but he was sorely dashed to the ground
most of her quilted bedding looked on the thin side too
no , don ’ t tell me !
this view had been kept alive by antinomian eccentrics like william blake , whose the marriage of heaven and hell rehearses many nietzschean themes , and it had been channeled into the romantic sympathy for satan expressed by byron in manfred and cain
they cost a silver tael apiece , said xi-feng , as grannie liu continued to praise the diminutive hen ’ s ’ eggs

in the first place , if this is material that bao-qin gave you , it ’ s going to look rather bad if your skirt ’ s worn out before bao¬chai ’ s has even been worn
but that ’ s entirely up to you
aroma and bao-yu tried to dissuade them , but li wan and tan-chun were insistent
it ’ s so many years since i saw you last , i ’ d forgotten all about you !
fortunately it was fairly dark just now when i came back and neither grandmother nor mother noticed anything
we find a series of references to a contradiction between the money and the commodities ’ markets , in the repeated allusions to naïve gentlemen gulled by usurers into borrowing capital to set themselves up as merchants
xi-feng sent them on ahead to ask lady xing and lady wang for instructions
sometimes they push them over when they are walking
why , today his devotion was so touching , i felt really sorry for him
we shall see if he is still so eager for death tomorrow morning , when he has sobered up a bit

in an explicit attack on the claims of natural magic , mephistopheles says that devils have never helped anyone unless they promise to be ours , ( ) and he repeatedly reminds the increasingly wretched magician that thou art mine

jia yuan-chun is selected for gorious promotion
seeing that jia zheng had nothing more to say , li gui and the other servants rose to their feet again and withdrew
i don ’ t know about mother and suncloud , said li wan , but what about this young gentleman here ?
there ’ s no need to make all this fuss
at least they wouldn ’ t do so much damage

he sent a servant to inquire , who came back to report that a fight had started between bao er and an adopted son of zhou rui ’ s
but now that your ladyship has spoken like this , it puts me in mind of something that ’ s been worrying me which i should like to have asked your ladyship ’ s advice about , only i was afraid you might take it amiss , and then not only should i have spoken to no purpose , but i should leave myself without even a grave to lie in
there are multiple ironies here ; don juan is not making a promise to a man but to a statue , and he swears by the name he has earlier disavowed

but hyperius does not mean to suggest that satan has access to human souls ; on the contrary , the demons doe not perceive the thoughts of men , but they note the signes onely , and the wordes and speaches and the gestures of the bodies , wherewith the thoughts of the minde are after a sorte set forth : and by these and othere thinges concurring they judge as certainly as they can ( – )

she blushed fiercely and her heart missed a beat
whether it is or whether it isn ’ t , it ’ s of no concern to me
in aesthetics , this corruption was first manifested in modernism , and it is enhanced in postmodernism , which proclaims the total collapse of representation into reality
the prince was silent , and zhao continued :
also , this line has just that touch of charm and prettiness that the subject calls for
her entry provoked jia zheng to fresh transports of fury
bao-yu realized that he had said the wrong thing , and blushed
he also said he wanted the blocks for divine rewards to be cut as quickly as possible and ten thousand copies printed for free distribution
why , what will you give me ?
there was nothing sir she could do about that , of course , except swear all the -time at mr lian for being incompetent
the afternoon slid imperceptibly into a somber evening , blackened by lowering rain clouds and made yet more melancholy for dai-yu by the persistent drip of the rain on her bamboos
taking bao-yu by the hand and chatting to xi-feng , she conducted them both into tbe main reception room , where they all sat down and were served tea by qin-shi
xi-feng lowered her head for a moment , then replied :
bees and butterflies abound ;
if we believe him now , how are we going to deal with more serious cases later on ?

they gave her a meaningful look , and she immediately fell silent
it was because i was feeling so desperate that i- ’
he reflected on their exceptionally boorish appearance , and the face of qin zhong came suddenly into his mind

bao-yu murmured a reply and retired , rather more slowly than was necessary
turning to steward lin ’ s wife she con¬tinued : go and tell mrs lian what you have just told us
that jade of yours is a very rare object
this , in itself , was enough to make everyone laugh
i don ’ t know the names of any of these dishes , said gran¬nie lin
some aspired as vines ,
since he rejects the ethical concept of the satanic , lyotard concludes that its expression in the death of the autonomous subject and the reign of the performative sign are not , finally , tragedies , but liberations from the constraints of logocentrism : the dissipation of subjectivity
you go along i ’ said bao-yu with a smile
from drunken dreaming one day you ’ ll recover :
next morning brought a reminder from the earl of lin¬an
though bao-yu promised to obey , she still wanted to have his pages whipped ; but the others all begged for a reprieve :
she said , laying a hand on tan-chun ’ s arm and speaking to her in an undertone
she rose to her feet as she said this and moved , with her sewing , into the house
oh , the usual things
it would only be a lot of extra trouble
no , i was merely thinking what a beautiful girl she is and how nice it would be if we could have her to live with us here
she was unable to do anything about it for the time being , because she was in the middle of serving ying-chun her dinner ; but as soon as ying-chun ’ s meal was over , she hurried off to the kitchen , taking several of the junior maids with her
the devil ’ s denial of his own autonomous existence can not be believed

it was huan ’ s turn next
that will be splendid , said cousin zhen
i know what i ’ m capable of
i should like to consult them
they took leave of xi-chun then and made their way to ying-chun ’ s
when she answered it was in a gabble , to make up for the awkward pause
wang shan-bao ’ s wife knew nothing of the romantic history that lay behind this letter ; but she had already had an un¬comfortable feeling that all was not well when she saw the men ’ s socks and shoes ; and now , as she watched xi-feng reading the words on the pink notepaper and laughing at what she read , she became even more apprehensive
so there ’ s really no need to pay me back
at this she disappeared once more , to reappear , after considerable delay , carrying not only a burner but also a whole portion of incense and a set of garishly printed picture-offerings ’
what did happen to the girls in the end , and whether or not they ever reached home , our story does not relate , and it would be idle to speculate
he must have put us all to sleep !
some good might yet come of it , you never know

in respectable alchemy , the physical multiplication of metals was directed toward a spiritual end
after inspecting the yellow bag , cousin zhen had his lunch ; then , when he had washed his hands and rinsed his mouth out , he changed into formal hat and boots and , ordering jia rong to follow him with the bag , set off for the other mansion to report the arrival of the bounty-money , first to grandmother jia and lady wang and then to jia she and lady xing next door
some little time after that was devoted to praising it
i ’ m not surprised that father tells me i have a small capacity but a great self-conceit
taussig found that the introduction of wage labor into south american peasant cultures produced a demonology that recalls the obsession with the diabolical that attended the same process in early modern europe : the fabled devil contract is an indictment of an economic system which forces men to barter their souls for the destructive power of commodities
who put this footstool here ?
zhen shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totality unambitious person
having just wormed out the information that a motion put forward in the capital for the reinstatement of ex-officials had been approved , he had been dashing about ever since , pulling strings and soliciting help from potential backers , and was engaged in this activity when he unexpectedly ran into yu-cun
suddenly , as she hunted in her mind for some possible reason for her exclusion , she remembered the events of the morning and concluded that bao-yu must think she had told on him to his parents and was punishing her for her betrayal
he chatted with her for quite a bit longer before finally tearing himself away
it seems quite a time since you last came round here
but i am sorry the young
thank you for reminding me , mother , replied jia zheng rather stiffly
apart from pleasing her husband , her principal aim in life was to see how much she could squeeze out of the domestic economy and diver ?
he and the girls here have been seeing each other for years - since they were little children

she smiled at him graciously before turning to her maid :
i can match your husbands and wives , he said , taking a purple skullcap from his bunch
i didn ’ t expect to see you here
and he grabbed at the inkstone intending to send it sailing back
if we ’ re going to end up with a bad name anyway , let ’ s at least get what we can out of them while we ’ ve got the chance !
patience noticed autumn ’ s disgruntled attitude , but paid no atten¬tion
jia zheng opened the envelope and examined its contents :
xi-feng accordingly gave orders for a short halt
she called out in the direction of the kitchen
and is summoned to the palace
now that mr bao has passed , he is sure to be found soon !
push them too soon and you can ruin them
learning that he had now moved to his study outside , she managed to find excuses for passing by that way three or four times in a day , provoking jia lian to a pitch of frantic eagerness only to be compared with that of a starving rat confronted by some food
you like to have your little joke , mrs lian
dostoevsky conceives of this man-god as the antichrist , and kirillov ’ s self-destruction is carried out in expectation of his advent ; his nihilistic concept of the superman strongly prefigures that of nietzsche
it ’ s just that once in a while she gets carried away
grandmother jia and lady wang presented themselves at the palace , and entered the imperial concubine ’ s bed-chamber , to find her choked with phlegm , with saliva dribbling from her mouth , no longer capable of speech
while , by a fisherman ’ s sad flute entranced ,
the thought of her trickery provoked a surge of hatred in his soul ; yet even as he hated her , the vision of her loveliness made him long to clasp her to his breast

obliged to do so at his uncle ’ s place next day and to make such small-talk as he was capable of , he was appalled , in the course of conversation , to discover just how soon the marriage was to be : it seemed that ying-chun would be going to her husband ’ s house before the end of that year

that ’ s her real trouble : she won ’ t eat anything
she moved on her way - having seen and heard quite as much as she wanted to - returned to her apartment , un¬dressed , and went to bed cousin zhen did not get to bed until after two
just then patience arrived back in the garden
please , mama , give yourself a moment ’ s respite
the news did not reach xi-chun for a few days

look , why don ’ t you give her all of it ?

jia lian tried to restrain him , saying :
grannie liu obediently held out her chopsticks and tried to take hold of one , but the egg eluded her

a senior consultant and two orderlies from the college of physicians have been summoned to the palace , which indicates an illness in his majesty ’ s im¬mediate entourage
after that the new year ’ s eve wish-penny was distributed to servants and children—gold or silver medallions in little embroidered purses—and the new year ’ s love-feast was laid , tables on the east side of the hall for men and boys , tables on the west side for girls and women
he said , such glory can not endure
if wu refused to cooperate we were to try accusing him of being the murderer himself and of using an outsider as a scapegoat
so some of the time the side gate was closed , some of the time it was open - who could tell what was going on !
pamela g schmoll reaches a similar conclusion from her study of the hausa : soul-eating seems to have become a metaphor for the search for money
a feeling of pleasant anticipation filled him as he hurried forward with his father
though she was paralysed , her mind was still clear , and thinking that she was about to be murdered she steeled herself mentally to her fate and found herself surprisingly free of fear
she thought , after so terrible a beating and in spite of all the pain , to be still able to worry about the possibility of someone else ’ s being offended !
the menfolk who were gathered in the reception hall at the front or outer ’ part of the establishment included xue pan , cousin zhen , jia lian , jia rong and a number of the more closely related members of the jia clan outside the immediate family
how could i have intervened ?
a sickening embarrassment made her own heart beat faster and she could feel her face burning to the very tips of her ears
indeed , he joked and smiled as before , and when the business of handing over was completed , he took his wife and family and the loot he had accumulated during his years of office and having settled them all safely in his native hu-zhou , set off , free as the air , on an extended tour of some of the more celebrated places of scenic interest in our mighty empire
you will turn his head
if i get better , i shall set up a tablet with your name on it and kotow and burn incense to it every day and pray that you may have a long and happy life
you , sir , must have known this only too well , and must also have been aware of my presence in these parts
i promise never to say anything like that again
man proposes , god disposes
it might , however , be more precise to say that this is how faustus , rather than marlowe , sees helen , and that marlowe ’ s intent was to criticize such a platonic approach to erotic issues by connecting it to the demonic magic practiced by his hero
who has been talking about us ?
presently jia lian arrived with the doctor , announcing that as it was their regular practitioner there was no need for the maids to disappear
at discount , to be sure—for gold and silver coin which soon gets to the butcher ’ s , baker ’ s and the dramshop ; half the world seems obsessed with eating well , the other half with showing off new clothes
and on dry grasses gemlike crystallize
he soon thought of a way
all the same , i am a bit worried for you
in fact , i think that if anything she is even nicer to me now than she was before
an illiterate folk magician , on the other hand , would be easy prey for satan ’ s wiles , and would find themselves compelled to serve him
one can see at a glance that it is a poor commercial imitation of palace embroidery
don ’ t forget what i said just now though
if we don ’ t take this jin fellow down a peg , next time he is going to be quite insufferable
but still , it would be most unfortunate if this loathsome creature ’ s accusations ever reached sir zheng ’ s ears
when it became clear that her mistress was determined to say nothing and that there was to be no escape for her , chess fell down on her knees and reproached her tearfully
in paradise there grows a precious tree

all you have to do is keep an eye on the rest of us , and if you find anyone slacking or playing truant , decide how they ought to be punished
nine pairs of belt-buckles
the procession , needless to say , was of dazzling magnificence , and troops of mourners took part in it
even as she was saying this , casta arrived carrying a large dish of peacock-green glaze shaped like a lotuseaf , in which chrysanthemum-flowers of many different colours were being kept in moisture
the sight provoked a fresh outburst of grief from jia lian
then , after roughly checking through the numbers in the establishment ’ sheet and questioning lai sheng ’ s wife on a few points , she got into her carriage and drove back home
tears started from her eyes
it was you two who in the past were always fooling me that poems were the best
felicity came in with some tea
we see fit to show leniency to jia she , and hereby sentence him to penal service at a military post on the mongolian border , where he shall redeem himself by diligent service
patience smiled , but dared not say anything
it was also because of you that i wasn ’ t on hand when lady wang gave my little girl that piece of cake
and then again , of course , though we may look thriving enough from the out¬side , people don ’ t realize that being a big establishment like ours carries its own difficulties
come on , you must hurry back , mother , said jia lian
everyone laughed at the idea
why rather a pity ?
my mistress from the ning-guo is waiting for someone to give an order to
the point is that yesterday , be¬cause of something grandma said , i started asking them all their birthdays and ages , and it seems that on this birthday of hers on the twenty-first bao-chai is going to be fifteen
what do you want it for , ma ’ am ?
it ’ s true that he is a simple-hearted child ; but his cousin lin came here when they were both little and they have grown up together and are closer to each other than any of the other children
i do hope these men have not been creating too much havoc
she was not far from the naiad ’ s house , when she saw two junior maids stand¬ing at the gate , peeping out nervously
you ’ re an intelligent young woman , said bao-chai , having first looked to right and left of her to make sure that no one else was about , i should have thought you ’ d have sense enough to leave her a few moments in peace
my kinsman yu-cun has had a comparatively easy time of it
a great girl like her - you ’ d think she ’ d know better !
we ’ re not too badly off on this side
from the way cousin zhen spoke , jia zheng gathered that this was not his responsibility and sent someone to summon jia lian
liber rituum , book i : in canonicorum classicorumque librorum stu¬dus nomenclationum cessat prohibitio
in that case , why didn ’ t you come straight here afterwards ?
then they looked at bao-chai ’ s :
there is a motto on it which someone gave us once for luck and which we had engraved on it , she admitted
of that you shall hear more in the next chapter
besides , as brother and sister , they were obliged to maintain a certain distance
i was just thinking , said grandmother jia when they had gone , all these people enjoying themselves here tonight :
that ’ s exactly what i thought , mamma , said xue pan
in baudrillard ’ s work , however , hyper-reality loses some of the ethical stigma that his former situationist colleague guy debord attached to the spectacle

at all events , said li wan , green boy ’ s is bottom
you must sleep like a corpse !
i still feel very angry
li wan took out one of them and set it down on grandmother jia ’ s table
i don ’ t expect bao-yu will want these , she said
to stare concentratedly at the go-board , one outstretched hand feeling for the spare pieces in the box while she contemplated her next move
really , a person of your age ought to have more sense !
you ’ re right , miss bao
i have had a lot of experience of these people
dai-yu nodded and asked nightingale to settle her down again
you ’ d never credit it
grannie liu looked at the silks and satins in which patience was dressed , the gold and silver ornaments in her hair , her beauty of feature which in every respect corresponded with what she had been told of wang xi-feng , and taking the maid for the mistress , was on the point of greeting her as gou-er ’ s aunt , when thou rui ’ s wife introduced her as miss patience
ever so many there was !
i am sure you are right , said dai-yu
that is just what we should do
dai-yu was there too
the old woman needed no second asking
an icy draught from a crack in the casement soon sent her shivering back under the covers again
tan-chun now invited bao-yu to accompany her to the jobs room ’ and break his fast there with some noodles
undoubtedly this poem is the best
haven ’ t you heard the saying i come from whence i come ?
i never heard of such a thing !
the door opened and she walked in , still dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief
in the cold wind ’ s more insistent blast
when all the arrangements had been completed , they shut up the house and accompanied the hearse outside the city to see the body cremated
remember , aroma is the only dependable maid in your apartment
lian , you know about such things
he began to feel more and more uneasy , and was deep in thought when li ten came in and said :
what kind of concentration is this ?
before they had reached the water ’ s edge , however , a number of elderly women ap¬proached , each bearing one of those large summer food-boxes of the kind they make in soochow , with tops and bottoms of varicoloured lacquer-work delicately patterned in needle-en¬graving of gold , and panels of gilded bamboo basket-work in their sides
from aunt zhao ’ s livid face and bloodshot eyes it was evident to the old nannie that she was in a very nasty temper
on which to stand
master ’ s orders , said lai da between breaths : will her old ladyship please bring their ladyships to the palace to give thanks to his majesty for the great favour he has shown us !
having reached the end of this suite , the singers showed signs of embarking on another one
lady xing ’ s brother , xing de-quan , himself a keen gambler , had lately become a frequenter of this establish¬ment ; so , inevitably , had xue pan , who was never so happy as when he was throwing away his money
returning south in tears she met calamity
his eyes filled with tears
but i can ’ t put a thing like this down in writing !
i ’ ve got an idea : pull down the red door , and use my belly to block up the doorway
now we may reek and raven ; but presently you will see us with the pure spirit of poetry in our breasts and the most delicate , silken phrases on our lips !
large bolsters of the same colour and with the same design on them had been placed as arm-rests at right-angles to it ; for extra warmth a black fox-fur had been draped around the top of it , and there was a white fox-fur mg between the bolsters , for sitting on
it has been a long while since we last met , said feng
for this brief moment to descend ( – )
this mr yu-cun is certainly an able enough fellow , and knows how to pull strings
that was a judgement , if ever there was one !
in that case all girls must be good and all women must be bad , they said
there were once four brothers , you-shi began
what a great baby !
grandmother jia , mrs li , lady xing and lady wang complied
the comic subplot dwells on the same issues as the main narrative ; auerhahn torments caspar with tricks involving disappearing money , and the clown readily accedes to the devil ’ s offer to find him a job as night-watchman in exchange for his soul , because he is convinced that
jia lian had never been on good terms with his brother-in-law , and , when he heard him blustering on like this , turned a deaf ear
what a determined young thing she must have been at heart
and the boudoir romances , those dreary stereotypes with their volume after volume all pitched on the same note and their different characters undistinguishable except by name ( all those ideally beautiful young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors ) — even they seem unable to avoid descending sooner or later into indecency
jia zheng sent a maid out at once with the following orders for li gui :
i was thinking how like skybright you looked - that ’ s the only reason i told you what she said
i ’ ll tell you something , mrs lian , said the knowledgeable nannie
i haven ’ t seen them
it doesn ’ t seem to say very much
come over here and i ’ ll explain
nightingale arranged dai-yu so that one of her hands was showing through the bed-curtains and resting on the diagnostic arm-rest , and gently slid back her bracelet and sleeve so as not to obstruct the pulse
said zhou rui ’ s wife
his mother and i shall go over and put the matter personally to mrs xue
still smiling , dai-yu allowed herself to be led , and fol¬lowed nightingale towards the naiad ’ s house
the fortune-sticks provide a strange omen
better go out and stop them
that was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery , remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves with their own affairs
the news that golden ’ s disgrace had driven her to take her own life had reached bao-yu as he was returning from his interview with jia yu-cun , and he was already in a state of shock when he went in to see his mother , only to be subjected by her to a string of accusations and reproaches , to which he was unable to reply
and please , aunt xue , do not be too critical about the arrange¬ments
you sit where you are !
but the antiessentialist philosophies of the late twentieth century have discredited the intellectual concept of an inherent human essence , while the forces that drive our everyday lives have gone a long way toward extinguishing it empirically , so that many people no longer experience themselves as having a soul at all
he got up and left the room , intending to go to xi-chun ’ s place to see how she was getting on with the painting ; but as he came out of the courtyard gate , he saw ba~qin~ little maid periwinkle hurrying across the pathway ahead of him and hurried forward to catch up with her
a wiser figure offers a more subtle theory , which explains the faustian delusion of power over the devil : yea , although he is lord , yet he is content to serve her turne , and the witches confesse , they call [ the demons ] forth and send them , and they hire them to hurt [ their enemies ]
if only my parents had settled it for us while they were still alive but suppose they had ?
that ’ s your nannie quarrelling with aroma , she said
her whole world seemed to be collapsing around her
as that left no one to get the lunch ready , i put qin xian ’ s wife temporarily in charge , so that the young ladies should get their meal on time
first came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners
xue pan appeared to be engaged in a species of mental effort so frightful that his eyes seemed about to pop out of his head
and she was very beautiful :
if only she could shake it off altogether !
as the famous magician agrippa put it in occult philosophy :
rhyming red ’ by xing xiu-yan
faithful was more mystified than ever
i feel ashamed that you should have come over just to see me
san-jie certainly put her precept into practice
if you ’ re not , then what about the rest of us ?
farmer sweet-rice may not be much good at writing poetry , said bao-yu , but she is jolly good at reading it
but you , sir , you know the wounds i had at my master ’ s side !
it only goes to show that there is always something to hand if only one will take the trouble to look
she ’ s admitted taking everything they ’ ve asked her about
let ’ s say for the sake of argument that our garden is only twice as big as theirs
mr lian had a terrible job even getting to see this man
it doesn ’ t leave us much face , does it , if she ’ s dismissed ?
i was laughing because you had got the generation wrong
nightingale knew what was happening , but judged the time not ripe for her to intervene ; so he continued to stand there like an idiot , until at last dai-yu thought he must have gone back to his own room , and opened the door again
suddenly there was a loud clunk !
come over and see what she ’ s been doing , the old aunt shouted back at her
mother ma was a wise woman
you-shi and lou-shi turned towards li wan , laughing :
unable in her agitated state to remain indoors , grandmother jia had been waiting outside in the loggia , whither the others -lady xing , lady wang , you-shi , li wan , xi-feng , aunt xue and the girls - had also congregated to await news of jia zheng
instead he had his side-hair done up in a number of little plaits which were looped round over his ears and brought together by means of red silk thread into a single large queue at the back
re¬entering bao-yu ’ s room , she found him lying back quietly , plunged in thought
misfortune pursues the family at every turn !
he just spends all his time playing around with a pack of maids
she said , i have to leave at half-past two to take up the job , and bao¬-yu won ’ t be home until a quarter to three , so we shall miss seeing each other by only a quarter of an hour
bao-yu could see that he had moved her
what sort of a life would she lead , asbao-yu ’ s concubine ?
tell me who it was
crimson believed every word that bao-chai had said , and as soon as the latter was at a distance ,
if they want to go , we can send for their parents to come and fetch them and give the money to their parents
i don ’ t see how that could be wrong
let ’ s be honest : none of us can compare with aroma
usurer : an honest fellow , ile warrant him
i see no reason to doubt that our crab-apple tree too was reacting to a human situation
tell her the needlework ’ s a bit on the rough side , but i ’ m sure she ’ ll understand
her cold , unweeping eyes with tears did spot ;
after you ’ ve planted them and the flowers have come out , you ’ ll want to stand and look at them ; so the fourth title will be admiring the chrysanthemums
how can she stand up to them if you come along and lend your weight to what they are saying ?
it was only a little burn , about the size of a finger-print , but clearly visible
it ’ s only because pan ’ s away , said bao-chai , that she has to go on suffering like this
this was clearly understood by friedrich nietzsche , who attempted to reevaluate the master/slave dialectic by giving ethical primacy to the standpoint of the master
she ’ s even less likely to listen to me on my own
i should think not , indeed !
denied having any puppets , spirits , maumettes , while another admitted keeping four imps called robin , jack , william , and puppet
bao-yu gave oriole a smile
james notes that the magician effects a contract with the devil , and that the form of appearance assumed by the devil varies according to the class of magician
so it pleaseth the holy ghost in scripture somtimes to resemble the workes of light to the workes of darknes : that wee might learne to gather wisedome euen from serpents , and to leaue the poyson behinde
observing her confusion and the halting nature of her reply , lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife remembered that silver had lately reported some things missing from lady wang ’ s apartment which none of the other maids would admit to having taken and wondered if fivey might be the thief
in chrematistics , however , money becomes an end in itself , depart-ing from its natural telos , so that trade in useful objects becomes the means to the end of accumulating exchange value
grandmother jia looked at aunt xue and smiled
when yu-cun received the gift of money from zhen shi-yin he had left for the capital on the day after the festival
from that time onwards her demeanour towards er-jie was affable in the extreme
like piles of dung
it ’ s too much pampering that causes this passion for variety : eggs one day , bean-curd the next , fried pickled turnips in gluten batter it ’ s all very well saying you want something different , but i ’ m afraid it won ’ t do
lady wang could not believe this , and asked tealeaf , who was still standing on the other side of the window , to verify bao-yu ’ s story
entering the door of the apartment , they tiptoed softly into the inner room
there were curses for the women on night-duty :
would rather have died !
for example , as satan contemplates the stairway to heaven in book three of paradise lost , the reader is explicitly informed of the image ’ s symbolic purpose as a material sign of res non apparens : each stair mysteriously was meant , nor stood / there always , but drawn up to heav ’ n sometimes / viewless ( : – )
meanwhile the attendants brought with them by the lady visitors were being entertained elsewhere
there must be some places left where you haven ’ t looked , lady wang continued , addressing the assem-bled maids
they soon arrived at the priory and were met by euergesia , who had brought her two little disciples benevolentia and sapientia to welcome them
they were delighted to see him , and immediately asked :
when she saw him still standing there , she had not the heart to shut the door on him a second time , and allowed him to follow her back into the room
it would be quite out of the question to cut her pay simply because she ’ s working for bao-yu
shi-yin went to receive caltrop ’ s soul across the threshold of death and to escort her to the land of illusion , there to be handed over to the fairy disenchantment and to have her name entered on the register
she nearly asked him about it , but in the end was too shy
she was tall and rather thin with a long oval face , and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress
dammit , it ’ s too bad that the two of you should be worried all the time because of me !
another consideration which predisposed them to let her stay was the well-known fact— already mentioned by aroma—that the jia household did not ill-treat its servants and relied more on kindness than coercion in its dealings with them
it specified the number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans , four small sedans , and four carriages , and the number of pounds of silk cord that would be required for that amount of network
it was fastened by a golden clasp at the end and by four pearl clips at regular intervals between the clasp and the crown of his head
henry smith ’ s the trial of usury ( ) details the various ways in which usurers commodify time :
the magpie has forsaken my chamber : it is in vain for the maidens to hang up their needles on seventh night and pray for nimble fingers
who are you going to make fun of now ?
i am only a servant , she said in the end , and it is very kind of you to think to speak to me like this , ma ’ am
and for another thing , we senior maids are constantly having -to take messages to her old ladyship and her lady-ship about him , and when we do , we always say bao-yu , never master bao
we can see here how calvin ’ s doctrine of total depravity informs his view of usury
they are in the main reception room
anyway , i told mamma song that she was under no cir¬cumstances to let bao-yu know about this
fruition of earthly fame , which he confuses with spiritual salvation in his hope to be eternized for some wondrous cure ( )
they lay a long time together when it was over , exchanging oaths and promises , unable to break apart
praise his holy name !
her jealous fury when she was informed that er-jie ’ s illness was due to her influence and when she was urged by xi-feng to move elsewhere for a few days in er-jie ’ s interest can be imagined
well , it ’ s the same name , said zi-xing
a day or two later , he began to feel a slight improve¬ment in himself , though his mental equilibrium was still easily disturbed by the least thought of dai-yu
yes , certainly , said bao-chai , turning back to reply
lady wang smiled back at her
they say that where mercy is possible , mercy should be shown
even when relations call , i said , i can see to them myself
but what am i to do with aroma ?
or is it merely to make me angry that you say them ?
thoughts , nietzsche claims , are not controlled by the will ; they come when they wish , as if from a power outside our minds
the jealousy and resentment that lady xing felt as a conse¬quence of this had recently been exacerbated by an imagined slight : the passing over of ying-chun when the dowager princess of nan-an asked to see the jia girls and tan-chun was the only one of the three to be called
why don ’ t you squat down to take off your underthings ?
this new wife of mr pan ’ s is a total eclipse if ever there was one !
tan-chun walked over and , peeping through the window , saw ying-chun half-reclining on the day-bed reading a book , oblivious to the noisy argu¬ment that was going on only a few feet away from her
as for liu xiang-lian , the human repinings felt by that somewhat cold young man when he realized the value of what he had lost were brought to an abrupt end ( as we have shown ) by the even colder words of the taoist , which , by breaking through the barrier of confusion and opening his eyes to the vanity of human affections , caused him to renounce the world by symbolically severing his hair and following the mad holy man in his wanderings
lady wang still had not the slightest idea what she was talking about
just let him come , then !
he drank half the contents of the cup while parfumee held it to his lips , then turned his head back again to address aroma
and it isn ’ t as if it was my own sewing i ’ ve asked you about : it ’ s only ever been his things that i ’ ve asked you to help me with
what ’ s this about wanting money ?
it all went in the raid last year , said qiao-jie
i don ’ t see why you should need to come bothering me about it ,
heaven knows how they would grieve for me if i were actually to die !
but it was still no good :
the hall of exalted felicity
meanwhile , back at the party , cousin zhen and the others , suddenly noticing that the two of them were missing , sought them for a while without success
the two young women then went their separate ways
it transpired that the tin kau players in the next room were in process of settling up after finishing the game and were in fact beginning to think about their dinner , but that the group at the big table playing driving the sheep had not yet reached a suitable point at which to break off
the present holder of the title , shui rong , was a youth still in his teens -a young man of great personal beauty and a modest and unaffected disposition
your use of puer betrays an inadequate comprehension of the theme
you ought to send him away
faithful , laughing , quickly filled a winecup and held it to xi-feng lips
during this muttered exchange the girl had begun spinning
said bao-yu , pushing him
he noticed that jia qin was among them
tracts such as the anonymous the ruinate fall of the pope usurie , derived from the pope idolatrie ( ) , argue that fetishistic economics and idolatrous religion are mutually determining
for in one moment they were consumed and spent by him that borowed them , and in place of them an idoll is conceaved , which idoll doth remain constantly , not any where in nature and truth , but in name and imagination
—and then proceed in like manner , by gradual degrees , to paint it
they can take their contracts with them , and that will be the end of that
grandmother jia then ordered lady wang to be seated
tan-chun gave a humourless laugh
but it ’ s like riding a tiger : i daren ’ t relax my grip for a single moment for fear of being eaten
or , if a newly-
he was back in his room like a flash , and communicated the substance of his interview to bao-chai , who seemed rather pleased to hear it
i ’ d rather we went short ourselves than risk her making another lot of trouble
west of imperial walls the garden lies ;
when he was satis¬fied that all this work was well in hand , he hurried into the inner apartments to meet his grandmother and two young aunts
ethical evaluation of them
don ’ t go yet , sir , said one of the old women when he had finished writing it
jia lian kotowed to receive his presents
you can only think what can be expressed in words
not of myself ; —by some great maker then , in goodness and in power pre-eminent :
that ’ s most unfair , said tealeaf in a deeply aggrieved tone of voice
with such good arguments in his favour , he ’ d be a fool not to sue ! well now , i ask you !
i will do what your ladyship has asked me to the utmost of my ability ’
cousin zhen , after reflecting on it , seemed well disposed
and so you should !
i ’ m going for the vase , said skybright
the two young women wept a while in silence
like the wardrobe master and the clerk of the ink-horn in a royal procession !
it was a little later that we heard this terrific hullabaloo coming from her apartment
i came across precious jade only the other day in a poem by cen shen , said caltrop :
it ’ s as i feared , father
ladies a chance of seeing the plays , and particularly for grandmother jia ’ s benefit ( as she was more enthusiastic about the whole venture than anyone else )
there ’ s no need to overdo it
ask your aunt , replied grandmother jia
i advise you to take things more gently
i know what i ’ m doing
what have you got to he discontented or displeased about ?
if anyone asks about me , you can tell them that i ’ m one of your pages , like tealeaf
the news had meanwhile reached xi-feng on her sick¬bed
xi-feng was not well enough to go over daily , but on days when there were sutra-readings and the callers were numerous , she would drag herself over and lend you-shi a hand in entertaining the wives
look at me , have i ever tried to profit from you ?
the centre part is detachable
look at this little creature , now !
you see at the end of the letter , uncle bao , grandfather urges us to get down to some serious work
now , just because i ’ ve lost a few taels , i ’ m not good enough for you
which mrs zhu is that ?
come on , hand it over !
someone not used to taking punishment , he concluded
ask your mistress to see to it , said cousin zhen
a meanes to purchase wealth , / though my state waste , and towring honours fall ( )
bao-yu followed her in alarm
it ’ s the sign of a real talent , they said , to be able to see a deeper , allegorical meaning in a frivolous subject—though the social satire is a trifle on the harsh side !
when all this was over , jia lian returned once more to the matrimonial couch
he was divesting himself of the rain-clothes while he asked these questions
better take these off , he said ( he was crying himself as he spoke )
hardly a fit place for the likes of master bao , i ’ m thinking
do not weep for me !
faithful might cry out and others get to know about it as well , which would be even more frightful : and as faithful had always been kind to her in the past , she resolved to throw herself on her mercy
the moon must be up by now , said grandmother jia
last night i promised i would go
i don ’ t know where you get this we from
tell her that i absolutely refuse to take responsibility for any change in the rules
after chatting with her for a few minutes about nothing in particular , she left on the pretext of visiting lady wang
later , when the time came for the wake proper , and over a hundred family and servants were gathered together for the ritual , faithful was nowhere to be seen , and in the general flurry of activity no one bothered to check where she was
he must have repeated those same two words in the same tone of passionate entreaty upwards of twenty times
it might be the son you want , though of course we can not know that until it comes
it ’ s so touching , she said , turning to jia zheng , the way her grace remembers bao-yu !
let ’ s take our outer clothes off
outside , meanwhile , periwinkle , caltrop , parfumee , etamine , nenuphar and cardamome , having been all over the garden collecting flowers , sat down , with their laps full of them , in a little semicircle of lawn enclosed by high banks of flowering shrubbery and began playing match-my-flower ’
sounds the midnight hour ,
the colour flew into dai-yu ’ s face and at first she was quite speechless with embarrassment
he opened it at the first page , and found himself looking at a picture , but one that was so blurred he could hardly tell what it represented
we ’ ve often drunk wine together in the past
my dazzling spells into the spungy air , of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion
he then went to call on you-shi , whom he found ill in bed , struck down by a sudden attack of some gastric trouble from which she had occasionally suffered in the past
and pick some reliable boys to go on this gate and the two posterns to pass word through to those outside if those inside need anything do you understand ?
i ’ ve found your handkerchief !
the two senior brothers saw them out as far as the main gate , and then went in to re¬port to grandmother jia
otherwise , by the time the mourning period is over , i shall have forgotten everything
i suppose you think we shall come and plead for you to be let off
whatever ’ s on your mind , just go ahead and say it
i should like to see them
suddenly she remembered dai-yu

say it ’ s nothing very serious , and with aroma away we shall be even more short-handed if she goes back home to get better , so ¬we ’ d like to get a doctor in quietly through the back gate to have a look at her and not tell her ladyship about it
i prophesy for this child that when she ’ s a big girl and the others are all going off to get married , she may for a time find that things are not going her way ; but thanks to this name , all her misfortunes will turn into blessings , and what at first looked like bad luck will turn out to be good luck in the end
oh , is it by any chance the thing lady xing was talking about ?
grandmother jia stood firmly by her word
my rather knows nothing about it
the sacrament , in other words , was a performative sign

now this wife of duo ’ s had a physical peculiarity which was that as soon as the man ’ s body came into contact with her own she felt a delicious melting sensation invading her limbs , rendering her body soft and yielding to that of her partner , so that he had the impression of lying on a heap of down ; and in addition to this natural endowment she knew more tricks of posture and more ways of exciting a man with murmured lewdnesses and amorous cries than a professional prostitute
bao-yu cleared his throat
holds the rank of a sub-perfect by purchase
once , the sound died away and she thought she could hear someone calling in the distance
oh , you mean them , said yu-cun
author , copyist and reader were alike in the dark !
i just hope that from now on he will learn to be more adult , and give up his old antics
but to watch the pike-drill he was fain of fair maids in a row
but of this no more
derrida ’ s critique of austin follows the same logic as his deconstruction of saussure , in which the signified is relegated to the status of a mere function of the free play of signifiers
when he first emerges out of the allegorical figure of avarice , the usurer already has a preordained appearance and personality
you are altogether too careless !
he doesn ’ t usually eat much anyway , commented the old lady
the puppets represent the artificial agency that he has spent his life creating
condemned because it comes from the mouth of the serpent
now it was all books and studying
go ahead : we ’ ll keep talking , don ’ t worry !
just as he reached the foot of her bed , he heard her cough a couple of times and spit out a mouthful of something
even i , who live in a century of enlightenment and cooly judge the errors of the past , even i , ten times a day , feel the temptation to believe in these absurdities

from now on we are nothing to each other , you and i - nothing
bao-yu jumped to his feet and hurried out in alarm
if we accepted this form of the question , in its meaning and its syntax ( what is ?
in spite of their num¬bers , few of the rong-guo domestics concerned themselves much with jia lian ’ s activities , and even the few who had the time and curiosity to nose out what he had been up to were more anxious to win favours by playing up to him than to gamble on the uncertain advantages of giving away his secret
what is more , as austin proceeds to consider the various ways in which performative statements can be infelicitous , the opposition between performative and constative begins to break down
she sailed off cup in hand then to her brother ’ s , leaving fivey alone in the kitchen
as victor turner explains :
she stretched out an arm and slowly arranged it for him on the pillow
with reference to the first charge brought against jia zhen , that he forcefully took to his bed the betrothed of an innocent citizen and drove her to her death when she would not gratify his desires : upon consulting the original records at the censorate , we find that the lady in question , a certain miss you er-jie , was betrothed to a certain zhang hua when both were still in their mothers ’ wombs
jia zheng threw himself forward on his face
but i am afraid a precise diagnosis lies beyond the lim¬itations of even a more elaborate milfoil reading of the changes
the three of them now kotowed to grandmother jia , to lady xing and to lady wang ; then the old nannies , bidden once mote to escort them , stepped forward with cries of obedience and conducted them back to their room

ever since the day they first met , bao-chai had felt sorry for xiu-yan
that is the sum of my knowledge concerning bao-yu and , as you put it , his present whereabouts

it is typical of her to be so thoughtful
the pity of it is , though , that the girls in that family are all exceptionally good
trust you to drag the buddha into it !

apart from all the money you ’ ve spent , you ’ ve never stopped asking for help and thinking of ways to get him out

the young banner-bearing deacons took up their positions in the hall , one group at each of the five cardinal points , north , east , south , west and centre , and awaited their orders
as you can see , it is extremely light and transparent
your dutifully and affected son ,
she handed her the sheet of paper containing bao-yu ’ s gatha and the clinging vine ’ poem
aroma went out a few minutes ago , said skybright
the problem with usury was that it enforced this decision in legal , objective form , reversing the natural master/servant dialectic , and making man into the slave of money
well , that was one piece of luck ; but that ’ s nothing to what fol¬lowed , because her old ladyship had overheard this and asked her who this grannie liu was , and when mrs lian told her , she said , oh , i ’ ve been just longing for someone with a bit of age and experience to talk to !
tan-chun ’ s proposal was followed by general discussion
one must look on the bright side , she said to thou rui ’ s wife

the days are so long now , and there ’ s nothing to do at home except go to sleep
on top of his disgrace in the qiao-jie affair , there was now the added humiliation of having to watch both his brother and nephew pass their examinations
she bent over him to examine it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger
why be like this ?
soon the maids had him lying down between covers
one day , after drinking rather more than was good for him , xue pan went to see jin-gui about something he wanted them both to do
lady wang made a reference to the supposed resemblance between their two sons , the two jades ’ , and expressed a desire to see zhen ba~yu for hersel£ he was sent for at once , but the answer returned that he was conversing with sir zheng in the outer study , and that they seemed to have struck up an immediate rapport
they had chair-backs and seat-covers of squirrel , and large copper foot-warmers in place of footstools
the minute qiao-jie entered the room the two palace ladies began subjecting her to a penetrating scrutiny , ogling her entire person , top to toe
she also gave him a few coppers to buy fireworks with
he bowed to her and entered
in a little while the paper-covered shutters were removed and he was able to see clearly through the silken gauze of the casement into the courtyard outside
she darted after swallow again , her hand upraised to strike her
jia yun and steward lin went out to execute these instructions
i learnt it specially for the occasion
she seized xi-feng by the hand and earnestly entreated-her to think of some lie which would obviate this necessity
but after watching her very carefully , i came to the conclusion that , although better qualified than the others in so many particulars , she is not really a very dependable person
written on it in large characters
after lunch the two of them went to see grandmother jia
not caring to call for anyone , however , he managed for himself as hest he could and spent the night there alone
usurer : what a world ’ s this ?
who was it cooked the soup that mrs pan drank before she died ?
said the young man who had asked the question
after coughing through most of the day , she had recently dozed off into a fitful sleep , and it was not until bao-yu had called her name for the second time that she opened her eyes
until we find it , bao¬yu ’ s life hangs in the balance !
it ’ s mean , tight-fisted people like you interfering that stop her being generous
faithful went over to aroma ’ s place hours ago !
you ’ re a good sort , sunset , i always knew you were , said bao-yu admiringly , but there ’ s really no need for you to tell her
he said , smiling strangely
she also sent someone into the garden to collect aroma ’ s bedding and toilet things
why , so it might , said the others
xi-feng turned and looked bard at patience
xiang-lian now rose to go and succeeded in slipping out of the main gate unobserved
the family was immensely wealthy
and by the time you ’ ve been living together for a year or two , you ought to be able to ride the storm out even if your secret is blown
xi-feng promised to attend to the matter and hurried back to her own apartment to do so
men all know that salvation should be won ,
when he reached the passage where jia zheng described his encounter with bao-yu , they all wept bitterly , lady wang , bao-chai and aroma most bitterly of all
i shall never forgive myself
i believe your old ladyship has heard this story before , said the blind woman , smiling
a former head of the family had placed himself under the patronage of the ning and rong brothers , so their claim to a special relationship with the jia family was a strong one
i calculated that you would be needing some by now , said xi-feng with a smile
usury affects the psyche , and it also influences the material operations of people ’ s daily lives , although it has an uncannily similar impact in each of these areas

she started screaming for help
a little later he went in , with the intention of talking this new proposal over with lady wang and asking her to sound out lady xing about the zhang family
she went in , and saw xi-feng lying on her couch with eyes closed , her face ashen-pale ; patience stood by her side , quietly weeping
jia lian , to tell the truth , had never taken much , notice of it while it hung round bao-yu ’ s neck
- oh , i must tell you , she said ’ changing the subject , i had rather a funny dream last night
crimson noticed xi-feng standing half-way up the rockery above the little grotto , beckoning
the phrase a man is his soul simultaneously unifies and distinguishes between subject and object : hence job can declare that my soul is weary of my life ( : ) and jonah can recall how my soul fainted within me ’ ( : )

bao-yu was delighted with the suggestion , and shouted several times for aroma to fetch the gold thread
what do you want this little claw for ?
the colour rose in aunt xue ’ s cheeks when she realized how much the maid must have overheard
dream and tearfully announce to them either that dai-yu had already gone or that people had come to take her away
brightie ’ s wife poured out a cup of tea for her to rinse her mouth with , and when she had sufficiently recovered herself she rose to her feet once more took leave of various members of the clan who were present , and went off to her office in the penthouse
he does not object to wage labor in secular life , nor does he object to the financial compensation of ministers

he found her , however , to his great relief sobbing but alive and well
one expects an actress to be a vampire , but one had hoped , after you turned down the opportunity to go free and insisted on staying here , that you would make some effort to behave

for a young boy of his years to produce such a poem is proof of a highly cultured upbringing , they said
lady wang turned to the three foster-mothers :

observing what heavy weather bao-yu was making of his revision and foreseeing that if he wore himself out by staying up all night he would be in no condition for facing his ordeal in the morning , she had been casting about desperately for some means of rescuing him from it altogether
he read the report through to the end :
he had on a narrow-sleeved , full-skirted robe of white material and a silver belt inlaid with pearls
i couldn ’ t place her as any of the girls in our household , so in the course of conversation i asked aunt xue who she was
would you like the water now , miss ?
everyone agreed to his rules
bao-yu began gloomily walking off in the opposite direction
the old women pulled down the carriage blind and ordered the pages to take up the shafts , the pages drew the carriage into an open space and harnessed mules to it , and dai-yu and her aunt were driven out of the west gate , east¬wards past the main gate of the rong mansion , in again through a big blackacquered gate , and up to an inner gate , where they were set down again
catch me eating here with those clowns !
will you look after it for me , please ?

even in the case of a real daughter , not just a foster-daughter , once she ’ s left home and gone into service it ’ s for her master or mistress to punish her or the senior maids

talking of those slippers reminds me , said bao-yu
if you ’ re sensible , young man , you ’ ll be glad to hear me say this ; otherwise , though you may be too polite to say so , i expect you ’ ll think i ’ m an interfering old woman
i want you to tell me honestly , cousin , said bao-yu
jokey jin , now thoroughly cock-a-hoop , wagged his head and tutted in a most provoking manner and addressed wound¬ing remarks to no one in particular , which greatly upset darling and precious for whose ears they were intended
she turned to the servants :
con¬cerned at her critical condition , her attendant eunuchs reported again to his majesty , requesting that the neces¬sary precautions be taken
well , said mother ma , i don ’ t want to seem a trouble-maker , but if you don ’ t mind my saying so , you do all seem to have acted a hit helpless about her—not that i ’ m blaming you , mind
she had barely finished saying this when an old woman came rushing up to them in a state of great agitation
from every point of view - the special relationship between their two houses , the sun family ’ s wealth , and the personality of the young man himself - jia she regarded this as being the almost perfect match and informed grandmother jia of his choice
yes , i think i ’ ve still got some , said bao-yu
she stopped short , thinking it inadvisable to be so rude , and changing her tone somewhat , said :
once more he clung to her and wept
the doctor arrived presently , and the ladies withdrew
he ’ s in a good mood , she said to bao-yu
xue pan considered zhang ’ s behaviour insolent and raised his cup to throw the wine in his face
we all make mistakes sometimes
i am but a dull and foolish creature , a mere lump of senseless stone !
they ’ re trying to sweep the whole thing under the carpet
bao-yu smiled at the idea , but seemed rather doubtful
witgood : else , my uncle ’ s house !
i thought lian was competent to handle these things !
if faithful were to leave me now , who would you get for me to put in her place ?
and the money they spent on you , i said ’ nursing you through all the fevers and calamities of youth ( for you were a sickly , ailing child ) : it would have been enough to have made you anew out of silver then , when you were twenty , the master , out of the kindness of his heart , undertook to buy you a place in the service , so that your future would be assured
theirs were not the only secret discussions on this sub¬ject
in the meantime she installed herself by the coffin and , comporting herself in the manner prescribed for an unmarried daughter , wept and wailed until she had almost lost her voice
bijou smiled and accepted it ceremoniously :
she posted moonbeam outside to keep watch for xue ke , and went in once more to her dressing-table
the next two are even harder , said nuageuse
if you ’ d sing me a nice new song - one of your specials , i ’ d drink a whole jarful for you
dai-yu had confidently expected that this night would give her an opportunity of deploying her talents to the full and amazing everyone with her genius
but what ’ s the point ?
beyond the flickering brilliance of many lights and the glint and sheen of drapes and hangings bao-qin could make out some of the spirit tablets of the ancestors , but not very clearly
do you not find her an admirable person ?
as long as you don ’ t drink too much , twill do you good
these are dresses given to her old ladyship by various people over the years as birthday or festival presents , but as she refuses to wear any clothes made by outsiders , they ’ ve none of them ever been worn

then two or three women bearing large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which she sat and stood there waiting to be called
aroma had been present when bao-yu received tan-chun ’ s letter and had seen him rush off excitedly with ebony as soon as he had finished reading it , but without having any idea what the cause of his excitement might be
he had been thinking to himself
hire of itself is neither a thing unlawful , nor a word of evil note , signifying no more than a due recompense or reward ; as when our saviour saith , the laborer is worthy of his hire
bao-chai blushed fiercely and said to ripple with a scornful pfui ’ :
we can ’ t possibly accept them
come back as soon as possible and let us know how things stand

i shall be round first thing tomorrow to report for duty , and the first thing i shall do will he to pay down fifty taels to be spent as and when you wish on the club ’ s entertain¬ment
after a little while the music stopped and aunt xue sugges¬ted that as everyone appeared to have had about as much to drink as was good for them , perhaps it would be a good idea to break up and walk around for a bit
this used at one time to be the case with me , and i suspect is now the case with your son
ying-chun said nothing and made no attempt to prevent her

next they heard shouting coming from the men on night-duty in the outer apartments
certainly , said dai-yu
embracing hills and streams , with skill they wrought :
i ’ m sure no one here would dream of making you feel uncomfortable
well , what are you waiting for ?
i ’ ve already made a collection for tonight and given the money to mrs liu : ten pennyweights of silver each from skybright , musk , ripple and me - that ’ s two taels - and six each from parfumee , emerald , swallow and number four ( i didn ’ t collect anything from the ones who are taking the evening off ) making three taels four pennyweights altogether

jia lian turned and looked at xi-feng , standing at his grandmother ’ s side
i ’ ll ask mrs lian about it later on , she ’ ll be sure to know
only xi-feng and faithful remained straight-faced through¬out this outburst , politely urging grannie liu to begin

it was a very different style we used to live in when i was a little girl

xi-feng turned to lady wang and said :
he married a girl from a very old nanking family , the daughter of marquis shi , who bore him two sons , jia she and jia zheng
’ fraid i didn ’ t notice , said chess
how easy life was for the maids now that he was away all day !
dai-yu , it will be re¬membered , had lost consciousness while it was still light , and was holding onto life by the slenderest thread
he calls it the lamentation of doctor faustus ,
in fact , because the commodity in which he trades is properly the medium of exchange , not an object of exchange , he is often described as practicing a perverted abuse of natural trading
she took down a copy of tao yuan-ming ’ s works , hunted out the couplet she had in mind , and handed it to her to look at :
you-shi had always been in charge of ning-guo house , and apart from cousin zhen she was the only one of the family to have earned the respect of the domestic staff
jia lan handed the letter to his mother , who read it herself and said :
let ’ s see how he manages to develop this in his second stanza
you are well-covered like her , and they always say that plump people fear the heat
and the first thing i found , of course , was that the one doing all the accusing was actually the thief
chess clung to bao-yu and wept
he mistakes the devil ’ s representation of helen for the real woman , and his properly spiritual aspirations are idolatrously focused on this image
you have a cruel heart , miss !
we do our very best to serve you , and that ’ s all the thanks we get

it isn ’ t pennies for a laying-out i ’ m after
she told the old woman to follow them
now look what ’ s happened !
you ’ ve got the spring in your face , miss
but now that you are bao-yu ’ s wife , i must tell you the truth
isn ’ t there any message from master bao ?

while they were doing so , bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by his cousin zhen ’ s wife that he had eaten at the ning mansion only two days previously
and now today he ’ s started making up to someone else and i happen to have found him out
the third day is much too soon , said jia lian

there , in the light of the innumerable lanterns , all kinds of spectacles had been prepared for her entertainment
that was very thoughtful of you
motor of trancelike behavior
hearing what she wanted to hear , lady xing ’ s good humour returned and she proceeded to tell xi-feng what she had already decided to do
of passion and illusion
xi-feng , who had just learnt from one of her maids that mr zhen and mr lian were in a temper and beating the servants ’ , was on the point of sending someone to discover the details when she saw jia lian himself walk in , and was able to hear the full story from him
some people from the zhen family have just arrived there , madam , with a lot of things
as soon as her defences were relaxed he made a quick grab and snatched it from her

he sent for lai da , and told him to make whatever preparations were necessary for the funeral
then bao-yu asked qin zhong about his reading , and qin zbong replied—a full , frank reply , without the trappings of polite¬ness : and presently they were in the midst of a delightful conversation and were already like old friends
once you get a bit excited you are capable of saying anything , regardless of who else is around
just write any-thing that comes into your heads
back at green delights , aroma , seeing that the others had now gone , led oriole into bao-yu ’ s room to ask what it was that he wanted done

hearing the laughter outside , grandmother jia eagerly asked to know its cause
only , as yet , in dreams of night appears
bao yong : it is not my place to say such things but i think the master is far too good a man , far too honest in his dealings with people
when he had finished speaking , the man took a stone from within his sleeve and threw it at bao-yu ’ s chest
in refusing to make use of that stale old convention and telling my story of the stone exactly as it occurred , it seems to me that , far from depriving it of anything , i have given it a freshness these other books do not have
i shall sleep out there tonight , announced aroma , and we ’ ll see if i talk in my sleep
that might bring him back to his senses
i wish i were dead
it was all i needed
let ’ s hear what you have got to say first , then perhaps we can hear from cousin lin
maybe not so much the sturgeon and the sucking-pig

look how quick caltrop has been
grandmother jia smiled proprietorially at the distant figure
they would do better to leave books alone and take up business or agriculture
the others thought caltrop ’ s plight a great joke , but fearing that , with cardamome gone , she might vent her anger upon them , they ran off also , amidst peals of laughter
the first proposition seems quite plausible , but the second does not follow from it as naturally as is often assumed

i don ’ t suppose i get more than ten really good nights ’ sleep in a year
bao-chai acquiesced in the charade out of a sense of conjugal duty , while bao-yu in his moro¬nic state was easily manipulated
we shan ’ t ever have numbers like that again
there was a lin xiang-ru in the warring states period and a si-ma xiang-ru under the former han , said xiang-yun
yes , said bao-yu
she replied testily , and that i ’ m an interfering old busybody !
that ’ s the truth , sir
it must be that the zhens wanted to proceed with the wedding , and old mrs li had come to discuss some last-minute details
shouldn ’ t you tell mrs lian ?
a moment or two later , bao-chai was busy giving cal¬trop sme instructions when suddenly aunt xue cried out :
but though it is a year since i first brought this charge , no one has yet done anything to help me
lady xing and lady wang are sitting upstairs watching , said one of the maids

from the tone of this reply zhou rui ’ s wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman ’ s visit ; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from gou-er ’ s father in a dispute over the purchase of some land , she could not very well reject grannie iiu now , when she came to her as a suppliant

but the fates have decreed her an early death
i suppose since i don ’ t meet with your approval , it ’ s hardly surprising that you should be dissatisfied with my servants
it is the only way of making progress
said grandmother jia with some amusement
i should never have opened my mouth !
ying-chun and xi-chun might have kept dai-yu company , but since they did not as a rule get on with her very well , it would not have occurred to them to do so
but it is not with details such as these that our narrative is concerned

how is mr zhen over at ning-guo house by the way ?

i promise never to mention it again !
more puzzled than ever ( for what could she be doing here ?
but they could see he was not displeased
you will never find a better one elsewhere
bao-yu could not bring himself to obey the fairy ’ s command
she didn ’ t ask for anything before she went
observing that qin zhong ’ s good looks and gentle demeanour admirably qualified him to become bao-yu ’ s study-companion , grandmother jia was pleased , and made him stay for tea and then dinner , after which she sent him to be introduced to lady wang and the rest
you feel that she ’ s left herself nothing else to say
but she turned away and seemed bent on taking no notice of him whatsoever
li wan protested laughingly
he used to come in once in a while , but these last few years all we ’ ve seen of him has been his visiting-card at new years and birthdays

faustus is proposing to discover the aristotelian telos , the end or final cause , of every art

just what did you mean by that ?
two members of this family have , indeed , fallen victims to some kind of witchcraft , said jia zheng
when they were back again , they gave orders for the tables to be cleared and a new set of places to be laid ; but bao-yu objected

faith¬ful deposited the little package on the table , and sat down with xi-chun , while landscape poured her a cup of tea
let the younger women wait on us , said grandmother jia to lady wang
and xi-feng makes a disturbance
this evoked admiring murmurs from bao-chai and the rest
last month , replied perfecta , the household of the late excellency wang was afflicted with a possession of spirits
he turned to one of the old women in attendance
now there ’ ll be trouble , they said
what have i left to live for ?
she felt an in¬voluntary racing of the heart , her ears burned
if anyone else should ask , you will be quite free to say no

reagan angrily denied that he meant the term
the others , seeing that he was too drunk to reason with , blew the lamp out and settled themselves on either side of him as best they could

it has been described by judith butler : if the explicit claim that a promise makes is not only to represent an intention , and to represent it continuously through time ( i will do this , and i will do it despite what happens tomorrow or the next day ) , then the promise assumes that language can and does represent intention or , in this instance , will in a transparent , adequate , and sustaining way

this involves the transference of his human essence onto his own pictorial representation : was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on
cousin zhen inquired when these last two had been attended to
jia zheng saw how emaciated his face had grown , how lifeless his eyes were

liu xiang-lian ’ s conversion and subsequent disappearance , san-jie ’ s suicide , er-jie ’ s hounding to death by xi-feng , the grave deterioration in fivey ’ s health caused by the hardships of her night ’ s imprisonment - all these shocks and distresses following hard upon one another had eventually reduced him to a state of mental collapse

li wan and you-shi exchanged smiles and glances

she found you-shi standing at the top waiting for her
you will be able to come back later on nearer the time
it must be cold out¬side
cried the others , and began shouting for the older servants to go and look
bao-yu walked slowly up to the gate and , having confirmed for himself that it was open , made as if to go in ; but aroma held him back anxiously
nannie , nannie , have another look at him and tell us how serious it is , so that we know what to say to their ladyships
bao-chai wanted to look at a gawping goose , and i accidentally flicked you while i was showing her how it went

how much nicer it would be than living under the daily restraint of my parents and teachers !
but nature rebels against this violation , and faustus ’ s blood congeals , drawing from him the protest :
all you need do is make your kotow and drink a cup of tea , and then you can come back again
she made a confused movement as if to rise to her feet , welcomed the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence , and al-most in the same breath said rather crossly to zhou rui ’ s wife , why didn ’ t you tell me ?
i can ’ t at the moment , said caltrop
parent , these are thy magnifick deeds , / thy trophies !
if possible we should get her to let them live in the garden
blooming so steadfast , fallen so hard to find !
in some cases it ’ s because the writer is envious of people so much better off than himself , or disappointed because he has tried to obtain their patronage and failed , and deliberately portrays them in this unfavourable light as a means of getting his own back on them
aunt xue hugged her niece , laughing :
bao-chai ’ s voice could be heard through the door-curtain :
the maids were eager
that doesn ’ t matter , said bao-yu
if there are vajra pills , i suppose there must be buddha boluses !
if a sacrament were to give me grace just because i receive that sacrament , then surely i should obtain the grace , not by faith , but by my works
as regards face , it makes no difference to me whether lady wang gives him everything
i never thought it would all turn out like this
you ’ ve not long to live anyway so just shut up and go to sleep , instead of carrying on as if your mother was dead , bawling at this ungodly hour !
the person who put my master
a chilly radiance bright , a fair round shape ,
how is bao-yu coming along ?
i really don ’ t understand you
i suppose you don ’ t know what he wants to see me about ?
you want him to die , don ’ t you ?
i ’ m sure she ’ s most anxious to give you all the help she can ; but you could hardly expect her to say so
furthermore , because so many people participated in small-scale usury , it was difficult to associate the vice with a particular group of individuals
i wouldn ’ t expect you to know about this ring , replied grand¬mother jia
we shall have her back in no time
you really can ’ t go on mauling me about like this all the time
he observes that money naturally ceases to exist when spent , so that the coins loaned by a usurer be no where at al
this time it was the crab-trees that occu¬pied her thoughts
but then it suddenly struck him that her question might not be as straightforward as it sounded
so i thought it best for him to stay here with me
she asked in a voice of horror
tell the kitchen to take as many chickens and other in¬gredients as they ’ ll need to make ten bowlfuls with
gracious goodness , that would be the death of me !
ying-chun treated the matter as a joke and rapidly dismissed it from her mind , but jia huan was very much put out
under that peach-tree behind drenched blossoms pavi¬lion
surely it ’ s much better ail round if everyone will give and take a bit ?
one shouldn ’ t believe everything that people say about other people behind their backs
ever since your ladyship was good enough to let me take parfumee home with me , said parfumee ’ s foster-mother , she ’ s been refusing to eat and drink and behaving like a crazy girl , and now nenuphar and etamine are the same

after some discussion it was decided unanimously that the first meeting of the revived poetry club should be held the very next day , which as it happened , would be the second of the third month

said xi-feng with a laugh
my sister has already expressed her agreement , replied lady wang
at once xi-feng came bearing down on her
although i am young in years and weak in body , i am eloquent and resourceful and possess unlimited magic powers
grandmother jia sat at the head of one of the tables with jia she , cousin zhen , jia lian and jia rong on her left hand and jia zheng , bao-yu , jia huan and jia lan on her right
soon he was very drunk indeed
i ’ ve just been in to see uncle zheng , and this is what he said : we ’ d like to lay on something grand for mother ’ s funeral , but although some people will understand that it ’ s her money we ’ re using , less well-informed observers may suspect us of secretly holding on to some of our own resources
some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the malignant spirits , some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out , some offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the heavenly master and issued under the hand of the taoist pontiff ; yet in spite of prayers , incantations , divin¬ation , and all the expedients that faith and physic could pro¬vide , there was no visible improvement in the condition of the patients
i gave the last of it to qin a few days ago , said bao-chai
i ’ m afraid she is near the end
if i find out that you ’ ve been lying , i ’ ll have every tooth in your head broken
jia zheng suddenly thought :
and besides , there ’ s a nasty wind at this time of night
a household like yours wouldn ’ t have anything cheap in it , she said , so anything wooden you ’ ve got would be made from a wood that ’ s not very easy to come by
excuse me if i have clumsily tres¬passed on your fairy domain
why did fate have to bring together a sweet child like ying and this monster sun !
your trouble is , though , as i ’ m always telling your aunt , you won ’ t think ahead
what was it about the status of a
jia qiang realized that the confectionery was a present for the little actress , and taking the salver from the eunuch , made mademoiselle charmante come forward and kotow her thanks
he stood up to go
bao-yu heard about the fracas created in his apartment by aunt zhao while he was at all-spice court visiting the girls
fancy her dying , just like that !
quite right , sir , said li gui and qian sheng approvingly
xiang-yun was struggling to hold back her tears , for she dared not show her distress openly in front of her uncle ’ s people
he sat there for a while
but gibreel insists that the good and evil verses sprang from the same source : it was me both times , baba , me first and second also me ( )
the total this time was nine , which meant that musk was to draw
as soon as he reached the moon-gate , however , and had placed its large protective screen between himself and the study , he broke into a run and raced ahead towards grandmother jia ’ s apartment
she made him turn his back and look away while she crossed her arms and inserted her hands under her dress in order to undo the fastenings of the dirty skirt
she did visit him once or twice , but he seemed indifferent to her presence and she made no further efforts
and at first , he describes his attraction to helen in platonic terms , claiming that he does not desire her physical beauty , but the inner beauty which it represents : if i admire your brow and your eyes and your long hair , it is because through these external signs called physical beauty i contemplate your intellectual beauty , your immaculate soul ( )
guy debord ’ s the society of the spectacle is an antitheatrical tract apres la lettre , and the most cogent exposition of the development of the commodity form into the autonomous image
but gradually mao impressed him as a man who knew what he was talking about , and when he went on to predict misfortune for cousin zhen , jia rong began to take him rather more seriously
i forbid you to let him in , said dai-yu
i ’ m afraid just now i was too shocked by dai ’ s state to think what i was doing
'go and fetch your father
with the money they get every year for the produce , they manage to keep body and soul together
as soon as she was back , xi-feng went into the garden to tell er-jie about these latest developments
all you can do is sit there eating sweets !
so she and xiang-yun and bao-qin each cut their kite-strings and watched their kites fly away , after which all of cousins went back to their own apartments
the prince of bei-jing selected two of the more honest-looking officers and a dozen or so of the older constables to stay behind , and dismissed all the others
is this where miss lin lives ?
oh well , if i must have a drink , fetch some decent-sized cups and i ’ ll just put down a couple of quick ones !
at this level , too , the faust myth has provided an appropriate vehicle for literary treatments

she told me that he was one year older than me and that his name was bao-yu
i have just heard the good news , my boy
but unless that scripture take root in our hearts , where it is brought to reality by the heat of life , as it were , it remains a dead letter even if it be hung around our necks a thousand times
true , there was a time when i should have been scared to come , because people always told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you ; but now i know that in reality you are all gentleness and flin , there is nothing that could stop me coming
fourth sister lin was the winsome colonel ’ s name :
we can immediately appreciate how deeply foreign the concept of capital investment is to this worldview
ying-chun was asleep when they arrived and the maids had already gone to bed
it would have been a needless humiliation for bao-yu
and seizing bao-yu by the hand , he excused himself to the company and hurried round to the reception room in his own apartment
the dowager princess of nan-an and the prince of bei¬jing ’ s consort sat at the two central tables at the back of the hall ; the two rows of tables arranged at right-angles to left and right of theirs were occupied in order of precedence , the marchioness of jin-xiang and the countess of lin-an heading the row upon the left , while grandmother jia , as hostess ,
i certainly will , said the old woman
it ’ s all very well for you to talk , said bao-yu , mopping the perspiration from his brow , but at this particular moment i can ’ t think of any allusion that would do
she coloured and hung her head in silence while lady xing continued
not at all well today , replied lady wang on felicity ’ s behalf
postcolonial witch-hunters frequently fight witches by using their own magical methods against them ; the european and north american witch-hunts were , in contrast , designed to enforce the law that the devil can only be fought by invoking the aid of god
they were content that cousin zhen and san-jie should enjoy themselves in any way they chose , provided that they did not have to stay and watch
and it ’ s hard for me to give orders to their ladyships ’ maids
exchange for a symbol of that portion
aroma had not , on the day previous to this , openly criticized bao-yu for disporting himself at all hours of the day and night with his girl cousins because she knew from experience that criticism was powerless to change him
she was squatting down over here playing with something in the water
remarking that since the boats were al¬ready out they might just as well use them , grandmother jia conducted her little party in the general direction of amaryllis eyot and flowery harbour
just as the rumpus was at its height , you-shi arrived with a crowd of others
i shall say nothing of cousin huan ’ s conduct in this matter
do you know what made him ill ?
just wait while i slip over and find out what the mistress is up to , said zhou rui ’ s wife
incredulous , with one hand holding the lantern , he rubbed his eyes with the other and looked again
who ’ s that trying to give us a scare ?
of course not , grannie
your highness ’ s beneficent aura has preserved us from misfortune
it isn ’ t that , said xiang-yun
is miss lin asleep ?
he was weeping despite himself
i am going to tell great-uncle dai-ru about this
call our own troupe over and let them do something on this stage
i should become a monk , said bao-yu
considering what he ’ d been up to , even bao-yu ought not to have sided with him to that extent
and the board whose go-stones clicked the long day through
he was a confirmed queer and not interested in girls
jia zheng at once withdrew to fetch bao-yu
but if you will really keep your promise about these three things i ’ ve mentioned , i will promise never to leave you - even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry me away !
ngugi and rushdie thus both point to the postmodern degeneration of the autonomous subject
he turned to the assembled family and reproached them :
and , it is morally undesirable because it violates logic , being incompatible with the essence of money
if the worst happens , we won ’ t be able to get away for quite a while

not hang on to it and cry
if he should show the least sign of being a recalcitrant pupil , i earnestly beseech you to take him in hand , and in so doing to save him from a shallow and wasted life
bao-yu heard her with astonishment
don ’ t go rushing off in this burning heat
all i can offer you is this rosary made of the aromatic seeds of some indian plant
but tell me faustus , shall i have thy soul ?
so that is the truth of the matter
her old ladyship has been in quite a tizzy this morning , but thanks to the mistress , who ’ s been all this time humouring her , she ’ s gradually beginning to calm down a bit
however did they get them to grow so big ?
she got into her carriage then and drove back home
by this time bao-yu was already asleep , having dropped off as soon as his head touched the pillow
i only wanted to make you all jump
bao-yu had in fact written a few lines of one , but , feeling dissatisfied with what he had written , had crossed it all out and begun again , by which time the incense had almost burned itself out
aroma must have been pretty miserable on her own
you ’ re all afraid of him
patience was about to sit down when two women from the tea-kitchen rushed up to her with a rug :
the servants who were with bao-chai in the inner room heard this rumpus break out and came hurrying in to see what was happening
yu xin , said zhou rui ’ s wife
xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling , and again he went in after her
you-shi was quite put out when the maids announced her arrival
i just want the funeral to be done properly , that ’ s all
i ’ ve got her clothes and all her other things piled up over there , ready to send her
it was made with red emperor ’ rice , she told her
the sun ’ s not long set and the ground must still be very hot underfoot
when bao-yu had finished combing her hair , he asked musk to help him get to bed—very quietly , so as not to disturb aroma
the only thing is , it ’ s a bit late for a party today , but if we wait until tomorrow , the snow may have stopped by then and it won ’ t be so much fun
i was under the impression that you had been brought up in an educated household
that ’ s the old way of witchcraft : my apollo offers innocent aid with sacred song
tan-chun and xiang-yun stayed on at grandmother jia ’ s for dinner , and then re¬turned to the garden together
don ’ t you remember , the year before last when he sent me that white autumn crab-blossom , he signed himself my dutiful and affectionate son ?
she told nightingale to let down the curtains around her bed
i think she ’ s inside
now qi ’ s riddle is just a single word :
beyond the clouds there wafts a heavenly fragrance
having first decreed that they should dispense with court etiquette—which would have prevented the older ladies from sitting down at all—she took her place at the main table , while grandmother jia and the rest sat at little tables on either side , and you-shi , li wan and xi-feng moved to and fro , dispensing wine and helping with the service
bao-yu took it ; and there we must leave ’ them , for the ’ present
as patrick cheney remarks , not simply does marlowe link magic and poetry ; he also links magic and theatre
there is no need for you to send our wine over there , she told xue ke
on the contrary , i was saying it for your sake , dear
he was to observe carefully whether or not his grandfather was pleased , and having made his kotow , was to deliver the following message :
idolatry , magic , and commodification are parts of a single wider enterprise , which is the representation of human life in a symbolic , alien , and potent form
the usurer ’ s power over men ’ s bodies was a local instance of the general political and economic power wielded by finance :
the other day when i had to open the silk-store , said xi-feng , i came across a lot of rose-coloured cicada wing gauze in a long wooden chest
i ’ d like to have taken a couple of lengths of it for facing quilts with
but spottiswood argues that the story ’ s metaphorical imagery must be understood as part of its substantive meaning ,
such reluctance to give up trade secrets recalls the reticence of the magical initiate , and the producers of faust plays seem to have retained the sense that they constituted an occult craft
for a long time he sat thinking , but no inspira¬tion was forthcoming
nothing brilliant about it of course , but for a first attempt not at all bad , i must say
by rock and rivulet ,
fancy a grown man like him passing himself off as your son !
but they can ’ t bring themselves to economize or make any adjustment in their ac¬customed style of living
meanwhile bao-chai had persuaded her mother to come indoors
even though she ’ s so easily put upon , i ’ m surprised you don ’ t show her a little consideration , if only for appearance ’ s sake
why you little strumpet !
what i ’ d like to know is , if you ’ ve got something to say to each other , why can ’ t you say it out openly ?
having taken his leave of lady wang earlier , bao-yu had returned to his apartment , where he picked up his copy of the autumn floods ’ chapter from zhuan-zi and began reading it with fascination
at that very moment tealeaf walked back into the courtyard
to see you , grannie , and also i heard that aunt xue was here and wanted to pay my respects
if he felt bored , he would take a nap , and on waking would practise with sword and stave in the garden
it was originally to have been of the garden alone , said xi-chun , but afterwards grandmother said that that would make it look too much like an architect ’ s drawing and told me to put in some people
if zhou rui ’ s adopted son is involved , then everyone - from her ladyship downwards - men and women , masters and servants , is under suspicion
i was so scared that for two nights i didn ’ t sleep a wink
dime ’ s wife and daughter could see that they were wasting their time with him
cried the mad , lame taoist , clapping his hands delightedly
next it was the turn of nuageuse :
of these vngracious men i write , who hauing nothing of themselues , yet greedelye graspe all things into their owne handes
large size raft brushes
i ’ m afraid i can ’ t , said xiang-yun
i only said that because i wanted you to stay and have dinner here with me and the girls
i ’ d be embarrassed to take them
i thought that as master bao had nothing to eat last night- and as he spent most of the night tossing in bed , he ’ d feel rather empty this morning , so i sent the younger maids to order this specially from the kitchen
there is no worse species of usury than an unjust way of making bargains , where equity is disregarded on both sides
now you settle down , ma ’ am
you seem to think that you have only got to sit tight and do nothing and people will praise you for your virtue !
mrs zhu ’ s waiting for you
please don ’ t trouble yourself , she said hastily
oh , this one is ill and that one is weakly and the other is too shy to see anyone
as she came within sight of the water near drenched blossoms bridge , she saw that the lotuses were all dead and ragged-looking ; but the hibiscus-bushes along the banks were just coming into flower , the pink budding clusters making a brilliant contrast with the bright green of the leaves
under this she was wearing a short riding-skirt of pale-red satin damask lined with white fox belly-fur
you must have been misinformed
and do whatever he tells you
the things she had given away to others - pointlessly , it now appeared - had to be made good , in some cases by selling her own possessions
she ’ ll only fret about it ; and then all you ’ ll have done will be to have made her feel miserable for nothing
this is a demand that the matter , which modern linguistics calls the
so he ’ s decided to ask lady jia if he can have you for his concubine
i wonder what it is this time , said bao-chai
you get on with your searching
i ’ ll go and find out what they ’ re talking about , said bao-yu
there was a maid in attendance , and bao-yu saw to his surprise that it was snowgoose
aroma looked up , startled , hurriedly put down her sewing , and rose to her feet
by a stroke of bad luck some relations came on a visit and stayed to supper
thank you for asking
he knew how much the boy meant to her
if you want my opinion of mr bao , i think it ’ s high time we forgot about his reputation , and looked at what he really is
then suddenly you come along
the name on the slip she picked out was guess-fingers ’
in token of my appreciation of the noble way in which you have served lady jia and lady wang and me during the past year , please accept this cup of wine that i have poured out for you with my own fair hand !
what happened after that will be told in the following chapter
at first she tried to ignore the questions with which he plied her ; but he was so patient and persistent , meet¬ing her unyielding stiffness with such warmth and gentleness , that in the end her heart misgave her and a faintly pleased expression began to steal over her face
the whole idea ’ s a crazy one
that would guarantee what i call the indifference to harmony and melody
dai-yu ’ s other maid , snowgoose , was kept busy running to and fro for news of bao-yu ’ s condition
of course , he receives sixty pounds ’ worth of useless cloth instead of his money
and so , far from complaining , she covered up for mercy and the other servants and insisted that the service they gave her was satisfactory
there are many other thematic connections between the two heroes
i really don ’ t know what to think
at last there came the sound of some¬one at the gate and a messenger came in to report :
if she has , get the office to make out a good , clear list of the dates , so that we don ’ t have any duplicating this year
and it sounds as if my aunt li must have decided to bring her two daughters to the capital , said li wan
i know father does care , she was thinking to herself
she told felicity and a couple of other maids to accompany her , and sent one of them on ahead with a lantern
bao-yu was struck dumb by the fairy ’ s words and became painfully conscious of his own uncleanliness
we were sent some bottles of flavouring the other day that i could have let you have
please come in and sit down , miss
the stork upon the dam makes his habitation
so it is you !
some believed that the usurious impulse was internal in origin , some that it had been implanted in the mind of the individual by the agency of an evil spirit
her ladyship is a very thoughtful lady
lie down , lie down !
when he got to grandmother jia ’ s apartment , they had all
it ’ s waste paper she ’ s been burning for miss lin
labor-power , or as herbert marcuse put it , hegel comes close to the marxian doctrine of abstract and universal labour
it ’ s because grandmother spoils her so much that she has become the way she is , said jia lian , leering at them through bloodshot eyes
now this affair has come to light , the people involved must all be busy covering up for each other
don ’ t have it done in the kitchen
considering the idea of cooking outdoors a great lark , she entered into the spirit of the thing , and taking off her bracelets , joined the other two round the brazier and asked for three of the cut-up pieces of venison to roast
patience was disgusted by their callousness and reproached them bitterly
wine has an exceptionally fiery nature , and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be quickly digested
since the very first moment i left i have been longing every minute of the day and night to be back here with the girls , said ying-chun
subjected to such cogent philosophical and political critiques that few people would endorse it unequivocally
in the old days , when her family were so well off ; she never used to put on airs ; and since they ’ ve fallen on hard times she has been quite unshaken by it all
the pages were too frightened not to comply
as we saw in the introduction , augustine equates the mind ( mens ) with the immortal element of the soul , and the concept of the immortal soul stands or falls with the proposition that language is denotative
i ’ m only a common little wall-flower !
bao er and his wife could not do enough for them
the hebrews and the greeks concurred that to be made merchandise
and lastly , although we three officers don ’ t have to do any versifying , we should not be precluded from trying our hand at it if we want to
but bao-yu ’ s spirit had already quit its mortal frame
at this point , lai da came into the room
she snatched the paper from him and burned it over the lamp
the usher smiled again
musk handed it to him , and as he carefully wrapped the cape , she turned to give aroma a wink
the flowers ’ last fragrant resting-place to find
enough talking , said xi-feng
why don ’ t you get on your horse and go back home and tell your mother and that new wife of yours that her old ladyship is here with all the rong-guo girls
to cool his tea they plunged the tea-pot into a basin of water freshly drawn from the well
they were joined a little later by li wan , and finally by xi-feng , who stood in the bows and said she was going to punt
that night , when the young folk had finished paying their evening duty and were standing round her laughing and talking a while before retiring to their own apartments , grandmother jia asked bao-chai what sort of plays she liked hest and what her favourite dishes were
we can ’ t afford to visit
i can remember how it started
aunt xue greeted her daughter with a smile of surprise
however , owing to the present hot weather i did not like to call in person as the young ladies are outside in the garden a lot owing to the heat , and not wishing to give inconvenience
she turned again to the girl : another one
i shall be having my vegetables at home
she ’ s never cared much for that sort of thing
what are your poems to be about this time ?
who is this bodnisattva of the scattered flowers ?
but that has not meant happiness for her
just a lot of yins and yangs indeed !
i care for no other goddess but you !
again he was surprised :
to the yamen of the lciangsi grain intendant
it will be her own silly fault if she is ill tomorrow
interesting , all these coincidences , said tan-chun
jia ian , whose resolution seemed temporarily to have deserted him , let go of xiang-lian automatically : but xiang lian made no attempt to escape
if she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning , when she first started her courses , there is every reason to suppose that she would by now be completely cured
he hurled them from the pot with all his might
she would have been glad enough to go along with this had not bao-qin already been promised to the meis ; however , since grandmother jia had not asked her outright , she could do no more than hint at a prior attach¬ment
one of the thieves managed to escape altogether !
as to what followed , that must be looked for in the follow¬ing chapter
aroma could see that parfumee was extremely drunk
the garden of spices
just take everything i have—everything !
since the intervention of a benign deity was not to be looked for , the things of this world could be manipulated by propitiating or attempting to control the devil
it ’ s probably one of the servants , said you-shi
there is a line in an old poem i happened to remember
but aristotle is not trying to define the sort of person who is a slave , he is defining slavery per se
bao-yu sat up on the couch with his grandmother and massaged her legs for her
that is what her ladyship says you are to do , he said
although i shall be talking to her father , you ’ ll still have to persuade your mistress to send ’ for the mother and have a word with her , otherwise it will seem too much like coercion
and left it at that
she wanted to go to the garden to mourn , but was torn between that and her concern for bao-yu
i only hope that you ’ ll see to it that you are learning when you are meant to be and that , when you are not , you will be thinking about home and not getting into scrapes with the other boys ; because then you would be in real trouble with your father
come in , she told nightingale
i suppose it ’ s just that i couldn ’ t produce anything quite as good as river queen ’ s acrid-sweet line , or cloud maiden ’ s bare-headed by your wintry bed , or plaintain lover ’ s reeking head-cloth or few poor , tattered leaves , or lady allspice ’ s autumn guest in dreams of night appears
meanwhile jin-gui had had several more scenes with her husband
a little after that jin-gui called to her to come and massage her legs
when xi-¬feng and you-shi had eaten , a maid served them with tea to rinse their mouths with and then with a better tea to drink
i make an occasional pair of slippers just for something to do in my spare time ; and if i give a pair to someone i particularly like , that ’ s my own affair
it is the purpose of signs , declares augustine , not to be anything in themselves , but to designate a referent
the ladies all welcomed adamantina , and she went up to the bedside , enquired after the old lady ’ s health and chatted with her for a while
forgetful what from him i still receiv ’ d ,
left on their own jia huan , jia yun and lady xing began to indulge in mutual recrimination , until finally one of them said :
this is going to mean a lot of extra admin¬istrative work for the senior officials at the ministry , and they wished to inform sir zheng at once
she opened her mirror and looked herself up and down
if this point could be carried , the art of magic as a whole would be discredited , for the most eloquent advocates of magic admitted that it worked through efficacious signs
this did nothing to lessen his grief , and he often wept inconsolably
dai-yu was about to retort when they heard someone at the courtyard gate calling to be let in
you people aren ’ t very resourceful , said xi-feng crossly
thus did the connection between satan and usury , which was both conceptual and figurative , provide a fertile field of imagery , as march ,
she came hurrying out
that has the all-spice touch all right !
your job will be serving tea and meals to the family
she did not answer him , therefore , but merely raised him up with a sigh and , wiping her eyes , addressed herself once more to you-shi
xi-feng ’ s sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little game he was playing , and feigning an interest she did not feel , she answered him with a smile
the witch-finders argued that natural magic was in reality a degraded subspecies of ritual magic
in this work , the flesh asks , [ a ] re none usurers but those men and women that occupy money ?
apart from the flowers there were only a few books and some tea¬-things on the table
though bao-yu was a married man , as grannie ’ s favourite he was allowed to join in the fun
as soon as he heard this , bao-yu twined himself round xi-feng and began coaxing and wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work on his study
she handed xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written
i just want to be alone and lie down for a bit
that ’ s why i was so long
i should have made them open the gate and not gone to open it myself
so after that i had to go
you ’ ve come at last !
wasn ’ t sister adamantina from green bower hermitage abducted in similar circumstances ?

i don ’ t see why not , said dai-yu
bao-yu told him of his fever the night before , then crossed over to his desk and sat down to his work
obviously the tradition that he was buried in those places was invented by people—living long after guan yu ’ s death who loved and admired guan yu and all that he had stood for and wanted to claim him for themselves

when he and his sister had formally thanked her , the company sat down to lunch , after which you-shi , xi-feng and qin¬shi settled down to a game of cards , while bao-yu and qin zhong left the table to converse elsewhere
they were already in the doorway

he did not take kindly to being bumped into , and it would have gone badly with jia yun if he had not immediately identified himself :
clocks and watches , eighteen
i can ’ t make out what these two here are
i really can ’ t understand why sir zheng is concerned that the boy doesn ’ t study enough
the maids , when questioned , said that it had been caused by an outer casement of one of the windows falling
but we ’ ve had no contact with them for years now , so i ’ ve no notion what this miss zhang is like

still smarting with resentment , she heard the old woman say that jia yun was coming next day into the garden
bao-yu left as soon as he had drunk his tea , and made straight for the west courtyard where his grandmother jia ’ s apartment was
there are twelve artificial flowers in here , said aunt xue

on the contrary , said grandmother jia , it is you who have rejected me ’

i suppose i ought to have realized that that sharp little nose of yours would soon ferret me out again
moonbeam blushed in reply , piled the sweetmeats onto one plate and went out holding it in both hands
it seemed natural to marlowe and his audience to see catholic sacramental theology as a form of magic , as valdes suggests when he predicts that their facility with magic shall make all nations to canonize us , / as indian moores obey their spanish lords

at first adamantina was reluctant
all these people you and i have been talking about are probably examples of that mixture of good and evil humours i was describing to you
everyone in the world has to become the object of your calculations
there ’ s no need to tell miss lin though
the girl ’ s father was a tax-collector in one of the provinces , the family owned several pawnshops , and the girl herself was an absolute peach
do you think i could ask you to go in now and have a look at my daughter-inaw ?
he stretched his neck out in readiness ; but the blackcoats declined
it 's a good job lian has not slept with the girl yet
we were a big family in those days
xi-feng was by now shaking all over with anger
clerk : oh , that was it the reminders
in a short while tealeaf returned with the book , which he handed to bao-yu who presented it to his father
at last the two ladies and their two jades ’ were face to face
aroma put him to bed and it goes without saying that he spent a sleepless night
if the flowers could understand , surely they would grieve ?
as long as we let feng know , it should be sufficient
qiao-jie ’ s expectorant was now prepared and poured down her throat
it did in fact have a slightly pinkish tinge , and when he sniffed it , he found that it had a sweet , almost sickly perfume , quite unlike the clean , fresh scent of the orris
where i used to dwell
with that he went off to bed in a huff
as soon as that was over , she changed out of her court clothes and declared that she was going to rest , refusing to see any of the friends and relations who now began arriving in great numbers to offer their new year felicitations , and spending her time either quietly conversing with aunt xue and mrs li or , as an occasional diversion , playing games of cards or racing go with bao-yu and the girls
bao-yu must have gone away with that monk
you know the rule :
dai-yu was deeply moved
when uncle zheng and aunt wang come home , how am i to face them ?
de¬tails of their conversation eluded her but the main sub¬stance was clear
the appellant came hither in all haste , to discover that the above-mentioned mr zhang had indeed met his death at the hand of the defendant , but that it was a case of fatal bodily harm by mischance and not of intentional homicide by blows , as previously alleged
he was trembling all over

at the conclusion of the last chapter we mentioned the unexpected summons which he received towards the end of this period from grandmother jia
the four girls went their way , and bao-yu set off for grandmother jia ’ s apartment
it was trinket who stole it
dai-yu now remembered what had passed between them on the previous day
when the three of them arrived in grandmother jia ’ s apartment , the old lady was talking to bao-yu and the girls -such conversations , enlivened by much joking and laughter , being nowadays her principal source of amusement
sometimes in the intervals between quarrelling , if she was feeling cheerful , jin-gui would gather a few people together to play at dice or cards
simultaneously with this arrival , lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife had come to announce that the selection and purchase of twenty-four little nuns—twelve buddhist and twelve taoist—had been successfully accomplished
his rebuff came as a disappointment to crimson too ,
can you really not tell the difference ?
i ’ ll be all right , said bao-yu
when he entered the hall were the others were assembled and went up to greet his grandmother and his mother , it really was as if a phoenix had appeared
really , you should be ashamed of yourself !
having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction , she served him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup
the old lady blazed

as it turned out , some local loafers had already pulled them down

bao-yu noticed that her eyes were red from crying
so saying , he called for a servant to take the child indoors , while he himself took yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study , where his boy served them both with tea

once , during the tedium of a burning summer 's day , shi-yin was sitting idly in his study
what am i going to do then ?

the exclusion of magic , and its attribution to satan , are fundamental to christianity ’ s self-conception , and they seem to reveal a neurotic sensitivity ( and vulnerability ) to accusations of sorcery

after the twelfth day the smallpox goddess was ceremoniously ushered off the premises , the entire family joined in a service of thanks¬giving to heaven and the ancestors , and there was much burn¬ing of incense in discharge of vows made on the child ’ s behalf by various of its members , and much exchanging of congratulations and paying out of rewards
there was a general outcry , pleas for mercy , women down on their knees begging
you know , we country folk like to get a picture at the new year that we can stick up on the wall
she was very upset
bound demons seem to writhe in the tortured rock-shapes ; in the trees ’ black shadows wild things pullulate
in the absence of conclusive evidence as to her ultimate fate , it would be futile for us to speculate on that subject
er-jie advanced to meet her as she entered the courtyard and dropped her a low curtsey , adopting , in the first words

along with the rest , had been invited to stay on for a few days and happened to be at hand during this interview
don juan : i believe that two and two make four , sganarelle , and four and four make eight
the catholics denied this allegation , pointing out that they regard the ceremony as only the instrumental and not the principal cause of grace , but luther believed this defense was refuted by their practice of not administering the sign of the wine to the laity

as regards the lycoperdon snow , that was something that bao-yu had got from outside
aroma filled some extra large cups with wine and put a selection of the delicacies on the little dishes on to a large plate to give to the old women who had been all this time on duty
i never for one moment imagined that we were in such a precarious state
the spectacle is an independent image that grows out of a market in commodities and , according to claude levi-strauss , the objectification of women grows from a similar system of exchange

grandmother jia ordered some of the servants to go back to the house with him and get him comfortably settled , adding that they might return with him later when he was rested ; but qin-shi , the little wife of jia rong , smilingly proposed an alternative
you don ’ t deceive me with your goings-on
your love for me has been in vain
when they were all in the old lady ’ s pre¬sence ; but you wouldn ’ t believe me , would you ?
the farm at sweet-rice village may be only a plaything and not meant for serious cultivation , but if she were in charge of all those vegetable and paddy strips and doing the things that needed doing at the proper times , we should probably get a lot more out of it
we have seen how dai-yu , on reaching the entrance of the naiad ’ s house , and on hearing nightingale ’ s cry of relief , slumped forward , vomited blood and almost fainted
any doubts xi-feng still harboured about the favourable reading of the omen were dispelled by their unanimous acceptance of it

i heard that these trees had already been struck by the blight for almost a year how do you explain the fact that half-dead trees should start flowering now , at such an odd time of the year ?
dai-yu lowered her head in silence
i saw your mother go out of the garden just now ; that ’ s why i shut the gate
you can leave that to the menfolk
one by one the others who had heard the news began to arrive , among them tan-chun , who immediately gave orders for the garden gate to be shut and sent an old serv¬ing-woman and two maids on another comprehensive search , announcing to everyone present

the painter did not merit death who botched that lovely face
aroma and the maids could see that a confrontation was
he ’ d be too scared then not to play along
in something big like a funeral , you have to spend money if you want things done properly
is one only allowed to play with you , said bao-yu , and keep you amused ?
bao-chai argued with herself that the cause lay in the loss of his magic jade , but aroma was less philosophical , and frequently took him to task :

what is your errand , boy ?
she asked me what master bao was doing , said the nannie , so i told her that he and the young ladies were starting a poetry club or some such
he could not remember any of the other classics at all ; but fortunately his father had so far never asked him to study them , so probably it would not matter
never mind about all that !
you can ’ t make them run to and fro fetching and carrying things for you
this patience agreed to do and went on her way
grandmother jia then questioned nightingale , but she had no idea who it was that had upset dai-yu
i need to have a few eggs by me in case of emergency
but it seems that i was wrong
she asked , turning away from the offender but giving her no indication that she might go
miss patience is mrs lian ’ s number one
you said it had something to do with a pawnshop
come over and pour some in this basin , will you ?
i wouldn ’ t say this as a rule because i don ’ t want to make her conceited , and in any case the younger ones might not agree with me : but tell me now—as older married women you have all had a good deal to do with her - have you ever met anyone quite as thoughtful as feng ?

she had already left when patience looked in to see what the trouble was
we weren ’ t all that far away from you , either , and you certainly aren ’ t deaf
whereas the bible asserts that providence may override human prediction , bestowing on events an ulterior significance that demands interpretation , juan takes a purely mechanical and quantified view of time as credit , giving it the calculability of a financial debt , and scorning the subjective intentionality that guarantees a promise

it is always hard when a daughter goes out into the world and gets married
soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of aroma ’ s medicine
one by one all my sisters and cousins have been taken away from me !
i must claim the quoter ’ s privilege of giving only as much of the text as will suit my purpose , said tan-chun
i ’ ve never even heard of such terrible goings-on as these
the young mistresses ’ maids are by no means the worst , said wang shan-bao ’ s wife
bao-yu moved over from his seat and sat down beside her on the bed
grannie liu invoked the lord buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view

usury is a kind of lending of money , or corne , or oyle , or wine , or of any other thing , wherein , upon covenant and bargaine , we receive againe the whole principall which we delivered , and somewhat more , for the use and occupying of the same ; as if i lend pound , and for it covenant to receive pound , or any other summe , greater then was the summe which i did lend : this is that which we call usury : such a kind of bargaining as no good man , or godly man ever used

i thought old mother ma could help me get my own back but that was all money wasted : it didn ’ t work , nobody died
said grannie liu in some surprise
dai-yu rose and fled
i did not want to do it , says patience , you made me
of all the mean
consequently , the cruel and perverse humours , unable to circulate freely in the air and sunlight , subside , by a process of incrassation and coagulation , into the bottoms of ditches and ravines
but you seem to be saying that we may not even last another year !
if jia lian loved her and her brother-in-law was prepared to give her away , what possible objection could she have to the marriage ?
you ’ re the one who should stop and think a minute
cousin zhen and jia lian withdrew
i don ’ t know whether i ought to tell you , said aroma
musk threw nineteen with the dice , which made it caltrop ’ s turn to draw
shortly after this , when bao-chai and bao-qin had gone off to aunt xue ’ s place and xiang-yun had gone to see grand¬mother jia and dai-yu had gone back to her own room to rest , bao-yu went after dai-yu to question her
just say what comes naturally
but can you be so sure , miss ?
if you insist on making an example of him , i dare not do much to dissuade you
his new feeling of happy anticipation had caused a general improvement in his health , though his manner of speech remained rather eccentric at times
practice , and now my fingers are all overgrown with brambles , as they say !
mwaura takes a materialist view of the subject , equating the soul with the physical organ of the heart
surely they can ’ t all have gone to bed ?
after a few preliminary words of reprimand jia lian called forward lai da , the chief steward
i do not wish to sound gloomy or bring her bad luck , but i fear she has small hope of recovery , poor child
what could be better than dewy orchids ?
and do not mock the reader ’ s tearsscrivener : th ’ have bin so bit already with taking up commodities of browne paper , buttons past fashion , silkes , and sattins , babies , and childrens fiddles , with like trash tooke up at a deare rate , and sold for trifles that now scarce one will bite
luckily word of the disaster had as yet reached neither grandmother jia nor jia zheng
from the superior quality of her dress and general air of refinement er-jie could guess who she was and hurriedly rose to prevent her
although tan-chun would not be travelling with a complete trousseau , they should nevertheless provide her with all the personal effects she might need
tell him that if he wants to be a dutiful son , he ’ ll be doing more for me by leaving me my faithful , to serve me during the few years that yet remain , than if he were to come over and wait on me in person , morn¬ing , noon and night
she calculated now that there were two days left before the funeral procession was due to set off ; and since her hus¬band ’ s condition had been positively diagnosed as a consumption , and he was therefore in no immediate danger , she decided she must call once more
from her seat inside it grandmother jia could see the terrifying painted images of the temple guardians , one on each side of the inner gate , flanked by that equally ferocious pair , thousand league eye with his blue face and favourable wind ear with his green one , and farther on , the benigner forms of the city god and the little local gods
but just as this little party in the kitchen was beginning to warm up , it was interrupted by a sudden knocking at the gate
developing later than , and probably out of , the plethora of syncretic neoplatonism known to history as gnosticism , manicheanism emphasizes one gnostic idea in particular : it views matter as evil
it was now broad daylight , and the sun was shining in at the window
anyway , i don ’ t see why you need drag other people into it
she had not been with yu-cun more than a year when she gave birth to a son ; and a mere six months later yu-cun ’ s first wife died , whereupon lucky was promoted to fill her place and became her lady ship
the other eunuchs then withdrew , leaving yuan-chun ’ s ladies-in-waiting to help her from the palanquin
finally , just before dawn , he dozed off , only to awake again half an hour later
the whole affair is over and best forgotten
i can ’ t see that it makes any difference , said bao-chai
if that turns out to be true , i really have come to the end of the road !
they have measured off an area just over a quarter of a mile square which takes in a part of our grounds , including the all-scents garden , on the east side , and the north-west corner of your grounds on the west , to be turned into a separate residence for the visitation
dai-yu continued , laughing so much herself that she had to clutch her chest with both hands :
not that one should entirely neglect poetic composition
ah , dr wang and dr zhang are our regular doctors
before he could begin his story , however , she saw fit to give him notice that he must expect to be punished if he did not make her laugh
and someone go and get skybright ’ s cousin and
i do believe you must be one of the holy spirits born in a human shape !
of course , said grandmother jia
bao-chai saw this clearly , but pretended not to notice and hurried by with lowered eyes
i didn ’ t expect a thing like this to happen , she said
such an opportunity was altogether too tempting
bao-yu came running after
the master however is insistent that plays would be inappropriate on this occasion ; instead he will give a simple party at home , to which all family and friends are invited
i ’ ve already told lady wang i ’ m going , so if you others won ’ t come with me ,
he asked me for three roubles in advance , but made it clear that the whole operation would cost no less than fifteen hundred roubles
she pressed after him , casting aside her inhibitions and crying as she ran :
all members of the clan holding official posts were expected to contribute towards its expenses and mem¬bers of advanced years and known integrity were chosen to be its masters
the old woman laughed
i acted too hastily
three people is quite enough to lose in one day !
i will put them up
to refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our present prosperity is going to last for ever would be extremely short-sighted
he bowed before her and said :
she had no recollection of what they contained and could not identify the contents , but she could tell at a glance that none of them contained any ginseng
at the pavilion-gate you-shi and the other ladies hid them-selves behind the gate-screen from the eyes of the waiting menservants while grandmother jia got into her palanquin
you ’ d have to face an explosion from sir she , of course ; but you can tell him that you did it for the family , because aunt feng is unable to have a
well , said jia rui , i am always free
william burton ’ s the rowsing of the sluggard ( ) emphasizes this aspect of the vice , arguing that idleness contradicts the definitive human activity of productive interaction with the objective environment , and therefore relegates people to the status of beasts
jia lian laughed reassuringly
the two girls smiled at each other and each took a sip of wine in celebration of a successful turn
aunt zhao came hurtling in and clapped a hand over his mouth
and i ’ ve still two pots of lychees to deliver to master bao-yu from miss bao-chai
now look what you ’ ve done !
xi-feng spat in her face
it ’ s a shame that he looks like me ; now that i know what he ’ s like , i wish i could look different
we are much more conscious than our forbears of the complicity between reason and magic , and many would argue that the postmodern era—with its virtual reality , its faith in the image , its electronic money , its new age religions—is witnessing a return to the kinds of overtly magical thinking that imperialism unsuccessfully tried to stamp out in the southern hemisphere
judging from the long sigh he gave when he heard this , bao-yu appeared to be very much distressed
those two should never be allowed together , said dai-yu
jin-gui was the only person he feared , and as jin-gui had given her consent , he cared nothing about what anyone else might thinkhe had not even bothered to shut the door
when he had finished doing so , he handed it back again and kotowed
but if ye wil faine any person with such features , qualities or conditions , or if ye wil attribute to any humane quality , as reason or speech to dombe creatures or other insensible things , it is not prosopographia but prosopopeia , because it is by way of fiction , and no prettier examples can be given to you thereof , than in the romant of the rose , translated out of french by chaucer , describing the persons of avarice , envie , old age , and many others , wherein much moralitie is taught
that may be so ; but your own acrid-sweet couplet is more than a match for it
cousin zhen went out to meet them and conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall
i confesse it , yet it followeth not it should be improbable
i knew that their ladyships would be very angry if the got to hear of it and then it would be very unpleasant for aroma and the rest of you
a moment ago everyone was enjoying themselves , and now here you all are shouting at each other !
he finished it at one draught and immediately declared that he felt better and that his head seemed somewhat clearer
she ’ s waiting for her medicine to be warmed up
by the raindrop pavilion
is master bao in bed yet ?
no , your ladyship , please !
vanitas lifted his head and guffawed at this , dropped the manu¬script to the ground and went breezily on his way
and with prompt waterings dew the mossy pot !
just then bao-yu came in
soon they had finished their tea
bao-yu ’ s bride-price and miss lin ’ s dowry won ’ t involve us in any expense because
how would it be if i were to come every day to help you pass the time ?
bao yong was a straightforward sort of fellow
yun and i had better go over to grannie ’ s
this ( not because anyone understood it , but because it sounded funny ) provoked general laughter
i vaguely remember seeing moonbeam clear the soup away , and thinking to myself what a relief it was not to have to drink any
/ it is an idol , a lifeless counterfeit ( – )
we don ’ t need all these tables now
don ’ t write any more
just at that moment some other old women came hurrying up to them
with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words written for our beloved subject , jia yuan , duke of rong-guo ’ , followed by the emperor ’ s private seal , a device containing the words kingly cares ’ and royal brush ’ in archaic seal-script
in my home people knew their place
assume the dig¬nified manner of the ancients , a manner in keeping with the chosen instrument of the sages
that ’ s the countryman ’ s idea of a treat , said grannie liu
aunt xue shouted to them that they were to do no such thing
but he ’ s always carrying on in such a sneaky , underhand way with bao-yu , as though he thought the rest of us were all blind and couldn ’ t see what he was up to
i wouldn ’ t be surprised if there were more profit to be had out of them than out of anything else that this garden produces
you ’ re a real sport , diamond !
aroma was naturally alarmed to see bao-yu come back in such a state , but attributed it to the weather : it was an in-clement spring and he had gone out while overheated and exposed himself to the wind
the spirit tells him :
once inside the room , she curtseyed to dai-yu , then screwed up her eyes and peered at her curiously
like helen , the boy immediately disappears , as satan causes him to die an agonizing death from spinal meningitis , and the novel describes the child ’ s suffering in prolonged and excruciating detail
look at yourself in the mirror !
what unites these surrogate vices is the determination of their characters by their positions in the economic marketplace
have you all finished ?
she eventually hailed a rickety old cart
grandmother jia , too , left bao¬yu sound asleep and returned to her apartment for a brief rest
unlike the heroes of marlowe and spies , goethe ’ s faust famously soliloquizes about his sensual as well as his intellectual temptations : two souls , alas !
soothed by such flatteries , xi-feng forgot her weariness , and the conversation continued with animation
they ’ re only curious to know the latest news
observing the condition that bao-yu was in , she therefore had more than an inkling of what had happened
i can tell that something has upset her greatly
more obviously than even a human actor , a stage puppet is a mobile sign , the embodiment of performative representation
she found this interview with xi-feng acutely embarrassing
department op late night sobbing
and you a gentleman and member of a distinguished family !
each head , wept very bitterly herself , jia she and jia lian did their best to comfort her , and at last , when her grief had some¬what abated , she moved on , to the right of the coffin-screens , where you-shi and her daughter-in-law were waiting for her
although i say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past , of course i don ’ t mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average government official
evil spirits don ’ t behave like that at all
they said it had something wrong with it and they were taking it outside to be mended
your proposal is a very sensible one
then to his horror he saw that his cousins ’ had been transformed into strange ghoulish monsters and were pursuing him too
i ’ m sure it would be wonder¬ful experience
as soon as they were all inside again , bao-yu began ques¬tioning grannie liu about her interrupted story
surely we can do better than that !
and now this poem all of a sudden !
grandmother jia sent for xi-¬feng , told her of jia zheng ’ s decision and placed these arrangements in her hands
with that he walked off : but whither , or to whom , our narrative does not disclose ,
try again , said li wan
her boots were of deerskin
bao-yu still did not understand
no one made any further comment
you have done this , you and the others of your kind
the monk placed the jade in bao-yu ’ s hand
you are the most lustful person i have ever known in the whole world number ’
i asked her if she knew about bao-chai
as in most treatments of the legend from goethe on , the faust-figure embodies the magical elements lurking within the rational thought of the enlightenment
the parties were now required to affix their signature or mark to the docu¬ment , xue pan was detained until confirmation of his sentence was received , and wu liang and his guarantor were released
she tore the paper into tiny pieces and gave them to one of the maids :
he was in such a state when i got there that i didn ’ t like to leave im¬mediately
thought bao-yu ; but he hid his embarrassment in a stupid laugh
jia rui clung to him tenaciously
fate has brought this on us , said xi-feng , struggling for breath
i ’ ve got an old poetry-book that i look at once in a while when i can find the time , and i long ago noticed that in some of the poems the tone-contrast is very strict , while in others it ’ s not
such distinctions made no sense in sixteenth-century europe any more than they do in contemporary africa
any person or thing , according to aristotle , fulfills its essence by progressing toward its natural end , or telos
i begged her not to make me do all these things , but she insisted
which room would you prefer ?
you walked straight into the net , didn ’ t you ?
the other day when the question of engaging a tutor came up , father mentioned this school of yours as a possible alternative , said qin zhong
the historia is a direct assault on such glory
but if you wish to know the outcome of jia rui ’ s visit , you will have to read the next chapter
it ’ s true that i haven ’ t got any , said li wan , but you ought to have borrowed some from one of the young ladies to lend her
she turned to patience : go on , patience , your place is over there with them—with that whoremaster of yours and his other whore !
naturally she never expected that all this trouble would break out before she ’ d had a chance to put it back
so you ’ ve fallen for him have you , and think you can use me as a cover for your goings-on , is that it ?
in heywood ’ s play the association between usury and magic is quite explicit , as they combine to undermine the traditional social order
as expressed by me , the burden
i shall know , nevertheless , how to vanquish these silly terrors
this is his invariable response to the threat of divine retribution
d ’ you think i haven ’ t got any good lines of my own ?
bao-yu saw that he had hurt his feelings , and hastened to comfort him
everyone knows that he is a regular visitor here
remember , even if the worst comes to the worst , you ’ ll manage somehow or other
you can tell mrs liu that fivey definitely will be coming to work here
in the course of my duties i observed that each one of the distinguished gentlemen whom i met had in one way or another brought honour and glory to his family name
since you haven ’ t got any silver-shears , i should keep that piece if i were you and pick out a smaller one
doesn ’ t anyone love me ?
marlowe ’ s play closely follows spies ’ s historia in its depiction of the absurdity of this creature ’ s revolt against the creator
surely so small an extra expense as that is hardly going to bother them ?
she was just like the foreign girls you see in paint¬ings : long , yellow hair done into plaits , and her head was smothered in jewels : carnelians , cat ’ s-eyes and emeralds
you wait till you ’ ve seen it !
but then old feng arrived and it put it out of my mind ,
are you prepared to stand by and watch me and my huan being made mincemeat of by that scheming woman ?
oh , nothing much , replied aroma pointedly
about four hours later lai da , the chief steward of the rong-guo mansion , and three or four other stewards came panting into the inner gate and gasped out congratulations
i know , said jia yun
that ’ s the two words for the framed board on top , said jia zheng
they began urging bao-yu to start
some time was now spent in trying to guess answers to the riddles concealed in these poems , but all of their guesses were wrong
what ’ s it to do with you whether they want service in there or not ?
i ’ ll come again tomorrow , then
she attempted to distract attention from it by applying herself , with somewhat unnatural vigour , to the game of guess-fingers
in goethe , as in spies and marlowe , the apotheosis of the hyper-real spectacle is faust ’ s image of helen of troy
he is becoming quite a cultured young fellow
going ahead to inform xi-feng of his approach , she returned to usher him in , lifting the door-curtain and beckoning to him , while announcing in her most formal tone of voice :
just a few things for you to take back with you and show off to the neighbours
it had more character ’ she said
how fine it would be if only men would feel for virtue the devo¬tion they feel towards beauty
it ’ s only because of mrs lian ’ s unheard of generosity that you have been treated so well
the satanic perspective is the creature ’ s denial of the creator
you don ’ t understand , replied the other
on his arrival in the city he called in first at the new house in order to see er-jie , but he found the place locked and empty with only an aged caretaker in occupation
as in cain and manfred , byron ’ s sympathy for the diabolical shows that he has failed to understand its nature
suppose you were to run into someone ?
she said as they entered it
before there was always granny jia , i knew i could count on her for affection
you might even pick up one or two decent , respect¬able friends that way
lady xing thought xi-feng must be already dead and broke down again
bao-yu may behave foolishly in com¬pany , but when he is with our girls , or even the maids , he is always extremely considerate
come , we are wasting our time
all their written works or spoken words were of lyalty and filial piety , their entire lives were devoted to virtue and truth and were indeed a fitting tribute to the enlightened rule under which we live and a due token of gratitude for the kind and illuminating instruction bestowed upon them by their fathers and teachers alike
so here are the main times to remember
and bid them wait outside
when the maids saw what she was up to , they beat a hasty retreat
why , if it isn ’ t master bao ’ s maid , miss hua !
but to kill him outright that is deliberately to make me childless
indeed , it was a crime even if it had no effects at all ; the attempt to use magic was itself a criminal offence
bao-yu was for rushing off straight away
as long as you don ’ t get into a passion and start taking it out on things—that is the golden rule
li wan shook the cylinder and drew out a card
i can cap that line
this openly revealed the fact that time was the real commodity in which the usurer traded :
imperial use gauzes , in different shades lengths
that stupid caretaker is new here
beginning from tomorrow , i ’ ll write a hundred characters every morning
meanwhile the servants had begun pouring more wine so that the game could continue ; but grandmother jia intervened
if the viceroy speaks ill of a person , there ’ s not much hope of that person being able to defend himself , whatever the truth might he
don ’ t say anything about this to the others when you get home , he told xue pan
who delivers that formative judgment ?
widow jin ’ s self-iinterest gets the better of her
i never made the comparison , said bao-yu hotly , and i never laughed at you
the day is still young , he said , and i understand that bijou intends to perform a scene from the queen of the flowers ’ , their piece de resistance
but what though she is present in this place ?
bao-yu did not shed a single tear , nor did he try to offer them any solace
jia zheng turned to feng
yes , put in bao yong
the drink was beginning to make him sentimental - he called to them for some music , and flower sang for them in a clear , sweet voice , accompanied by lovey on the vertical bamboo flute
don ’ t you know how difficult things are lately ?
goethe ’ s gesamkunstwerk is certainly grotesque , arcane in imagery and baroque in scope , but its argument is eminently assimilated into western culture , deriving as it does from an unbroken popular tradition stretching back to the teufelbucher of the sixteenth century
now that the fact that today was her birthday had become public knowledge , xiu-yan was obliged to make a round of the apartments , bowing and kotowing to everybody , as bao-yu had had to do before her
we , grandmother ’ s own grandchildren , are despicable by comparison
it is something i have been uneasy about myself
i ’ m looking for him too , said ripple
it must be somewhere here
the cousins and maids all laughed when they heard this message
she ’ s grown up to be a real beauty too , has mrs lian
but in the end the treacherous night air betrayed me , and by morning i was lamentably indisposed
bao-yu was almost as startled as the bird
our story recommences in lady wang ’ s apartment next day
bao-yu dismissed the two serving-women on night-watch ; and when he was alone he sat up very quietly , said a silent prayer and then lay down again
skybright and the senior maids , though pretending concern and making half-hearted attempts to intervene , found it difficult not to laugh ; but aroma was genuinely distressed and dashed from one to another of them , dragging them away from aunt zhao
these lines do not give any details of the alleged pro-usury lobby
she ordered the maids to open all her boxes
the family servants next held a council of war among themselves :
well , if that ’ s all settled , xi-feng put in quickly , i ’ ve got two very reliable young men for you to take with you , qiang
the dowager princess of nan-an asked grandmother jia about bao-yu
ha , yes , that ’ ll do !
bao-yu felt suddenly embarrassed
just wait till we get home and i get my hands on you !
round and round it flies
large parts of marlowe ’ s play seem designed to appeal to the groundlings , the story remained firmly low-brow throughout the seventeenth century , and it was largely this volkisch aspect that appealed to goethe
patience , seeing that no one else was capable of offering an ?
it was followed by another splutter of laughter
it was very worrying
sir , he ventured , i have a draft apertura for your approval
two of our pawnshops have been sold and we have already spent the money from the sale , while the manager of the other pawnshop has run off with thousands of taels and we ’ re involved in another court case over that
when there ’ s good luck then enjoy it while you can
we heard the shouting , but couldn ’ t see anyone , and when we came to look , the things had already gone
the trouble is that behind our magnificent facade things are going from bad to worse
if she wants me , tell her i ’ ll be back directly
the inability to grasp the referential aspect of signification epitomizes the satanic perspective
henry jones puts it in the introduction to his edition of the english faust-book , what principally fuelled the public interest in faustus during this period was the climactic intensification of the german witch craze ( ) , and theodore ziolkowski concurs that the myth of faustus is at least partially a product of the trials for witchcraft
you can do hui-ming takes the letter from the western chamber
aroma would have done so too , but sky-bright drew her to one side and advised her against joining them
she turned to one of the maids : come on ’ now !
at this the mattress began to grow even more reckless in her incitements and jia lian to reveal the more disgusting of his sexual accomplishments
don ’ t feel bitter towards me !
xi-chun was now more miserable than ever
but to the usurer it becomes real
say that something has been lost and that no one can go out until it ’ s found
i ’ ve got red moon-flower
do you want me to kneel down again ?
when i get hack , i shall do my best to stop them
no , said the cousin ’ s wife , beginning to feel nervous
tears were welling in patience ’ s eyes
oh , that seems rather hard !
by this time patience was fast asleep and xi-feng herself was on the point of dropping off when she became dimly aware that qin-shi had just walked into the room from outside
our chief concern is that you may overtax yourself , embarking on such a strenuous journey at your age
in an alarum for usurers ( ) lodge distinguishes the usurer from other merchants on the grounds that he trades in nothing : but as among a trée of fruite there bée some withered fallings , and as among wholesome hearbes there growes some bitter colloquintida : so it can not be , but among such a number of marchaunts , there shoulde bee some , that degenerate from the true name and nature of marchaunts
xi-feng , on the other hand , dropped me shrewishness she had up to then been showing as soon as she saw them come and , breaking quickly away , ran weeping to grandmother jia
jia zheng took his leave
one way and another , we must have paid out at least thirty taels by now , and from what i can see , it was money down the drain
she ’ s only a bit of bought goods herself
this type of kidnapper specializes in kidnapping very young girls and rearing them until they are twelve or thirteen for sale in other parts of the country
the first person to venture out of the room was lady xing
and there we leave her
he sent someone to fetch various objects of his to give to jia huan as a reward and smilingly patted him on the head
as grandmother jia , clasping a little bundle of burning joss sticks with both her hands , knelt down for the incense-offering , the entire congregation of men and women , rank upon rank of them , close-packed as flowers in a flower-bed , knelt down in perfect time with her and proceeded to go through the motions of the great obeisance
white autumn ’ s sister stands beside the door ;
the date we ’ ve chosen is the fourteenth , said lai da ’ s wife hurriedly , before her mother-inaw had a chance to get under way again
uncle zheng has apparently been im¬peached by the viceroy !
that bird must have come here when the tree was in
because the implications of usury were so wide ranging , each tract or fictional treatment of the subject tends to discuss a variety of topics , march ,
that ’ s all very well , but i can ’ t do it just anyhow
i expect you ’ re making it up , but you may as well tell me
the deeds which appear to the magician to be effected by his signs and rituals are in actuality carried out by the devil , and to believe that such signs do things is to give oneself up to satan
the usurer admits that his arts and the broker ’ s are march ,
it ’ s shocking how people treat their friends nowadays , isn ’ t it !
after that the three of them settled down and went to sleep again
he threw the book down as jia yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming smile
this woman takes her money and then doesn ’ t treat her properly
this set them all off laughing
well i ’ m here on her old ladyship ’ s orders
resolved to end her own life at the first opportunity , she mounted a carriage and set off for home
we must get the young ladies ready as quickly as possible , and take them back to town
there ’ s no hope left then !
it sounded as if an outer casement had somehow come unfastened and fallen into the bamboos
now xue pan was very inconstant in his affections , always blowing east one day and west the next
just wait until i ’ ve won some of my money back !
zhang hua admitted that jia rong was the person in question , whereupon the censor , very much against his inclination , had to issue a summons for jia rong
if you get yourself thrown out of there , you needn ’ t think you can get in anywhere else , because you could easier fly to the moon than find another place like that
your good luck will shelter him from any such influ¬ences , now that he is here
presently she saw aunt xue and bao-chai arrive
fluttering like the wing-beats of a startled swan ,
where have you just come from ?
shall i have him called in now straight away , or shall i let him wait a bit ?
i have experienced it !
the charges in the indictment were dismissed and zhang hua was sentenced to be flogged and driven from the court
of course , everyone in the inner family will be expected to take part
don ’ t ask me about that , please !
the maxim nought out of nought assumes a natural economy , but in march ,
proceed on that basis , and declare whatever is in sir she ’ s compound
i am afraid this is just a trick to make us all drunk
she ’ s a caution all right , and no mistake !
it must be a maid from one of the apartments , thought bao-yu
we need have no fears , said jia she , resuming the pre¬vious topic of conversation
she was furious , of course : thought i was doing far too well out of it
she waited until they were about to get into their carriages on the morning of the fifteenth before revealing to her companions what their actual destination was to be
we must prepare the betrothal-card
what ’ s this lump here then ?
but she , on a tryst with eternity , brooking no coarctation has abandoned me , cruel , here in the dust to be ,
xi-feng dried her eyes
only xiang-yun was tactless enough to say anything :
i trust none of the facts and figures were wrong , aunt , said xi-feng
first of all , replied xi-feng , whether bao-yu knows anything yet or not , we let it be known that sir zheng proposes to betroth him to miss lin
seeing the way things were , the family now dared not pursue the matter any further even if they wanted to , and were obliged to digest in silence whatever they might feel of grief or anger
li wan then asked grandmother jia and lady wang to retire to the inner room , which they did , still weeping
i served miss lin for a long time , and as you know , ma ’ am , she treated me with a kindness that i shall never be able to repay
jia zheng turned a pair of wild and bloodshot eyes on him as he entered
let us turn instead to young xue , the man who purchased yingian and had feng yuan beaten to death
the contradiction sprang from the empirically observable fact that not all legal slaves were natural slaves , while many legally free people were
we two shan ’ t be drinking any wine , bao-yu said to the ladies
i hope you do pass !
after a long while she coughed up another mouthful of phlegm
very probably i shall die before you

the people at the yamen know how rich we are , ma ’ am , and master ke says we ’ ll have to use family con-nections here in the capital , and send another large bribe , if we ’ re to get a rehearing and a lighter sentence
he summarized the geopolitical impact of his work in a recent interview :
instead , it uses words to refer to and invoke a spirit
it wasn ’ t because of that i came ; it was just that i thought there might be something you needed me for

yours is also a fine aspiration
the fact that many activities considered usurious were legal , and indeed had been legal in some form in virtually all historical civiliza-tions , caused significant problems for the anti-usury campaigners
the drumming recommenced and the branch , starting from jia theng , began circulating again

this suite , she told bao-yu , is not like the music-dramas of your earthly composers in which there are always the fixed parts of sheng , dan , jing , mo and so on , and set tunes in the various northern and southern modes

cousin zhen and the other young male jias received a few words of exhorta¬tion , drank a farewell toast , and , together with a crowd of other friends and relatives , accompanied him as far as the hostelry of the tearful parting , some three or four miles beyond the city walls , where they bid their final farewell
if it had gone any further , not only would he have lost his job but the inherited family rank might have been forfeited as well !
li wan had sent warning of the doctor ’ s arrival both to the servants on the gate and the maids in the various apartments , so that his passage through the garden , both coming and going , was through an empty landscape in which not a single female was to be seen

usury was therefore a presumptuous , even blasphemous arrogation of ownership over the stuff of human life itself

the novel ubiquity of usury was an implicit reproach to the morals of society as a whole
san-jie first examined the scabbard
you don ’ t like me any more
i should have thought it was obvious enough , said bao- yu
unknown to her , bao-yu was listening to this recitation from the slope of the near-by rockery
bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself
there ’ s the kind that you ’ ve got , which has the flowers growing one above the other on the stem : that ’ s called brothers and sisters ; and there ’ s another kind like mine here , which has two flowers growing side by side at the top : that ’ s called a husband and wife orchid
it ’ s probably not as roomy here as your farmyard , but i expect we ’ ll manage to tuck you in somewhere

dai-yu saw him to the door , then returned to her chair and sat brooding to herself
when you spend day after day fooling around outside , sooner or later something is bound to happen ; and you are such a thoughtless creature , that when it does , people naturally suspect that you are the one to blame , even if you aren ’ t

aunt xue , now that she was in the garden , concerned herself only with the welfare of the cousins and disciplining of their maids ; in other domestic matters , however important , she was unwilling to intervene
officials all behave like that when they first arrive
nightingale gave her a quizzical smile

he was obliged to seek the advice of his pages and to promise them rich rewards if they could procure her for his pleasure
jia lian signalled with his eyes to er-jie that she should pick the handkerchief up , but er-jie continued to ignore him
xi-feng spat straight in the old - woman ’ s face and said harshly :
said one plaster wang
jia lian followed soon after
the mistress by her rosy-misted casement must seem most cruelly afflicted ;
i shall send you some pills that you can dissolve in hot ginger-water and give her to drink at bed¬time

he stood still and endeavoured to catch what the weeping girl was saying
if my mother finds out , she ’ ll flog me to death !
the satisfaction of learning that the guilty bearer of these objects was a hated enemy almost compensated wang shan-bao ’ s wife for the indignity of being slapped by tan-chun and taunted by tan-chun ’ s maid
today i received the things sent us by the zhen family
at this jin-gui started whacking the side of the kang and shrieked at the top of her voice :
when zhou rui ’ s wife had finished seeing off grannie liu , she went to lady wang ’ s place to report
aunt xue had now moved to a quiet , secluded apartment m the north-east corner of the mansion , and pear-tree court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges
byron ’ s own works also involve a complicated interweaving of faustian with donjuanian themes
i can ’ t believe that it was my fate to be so unhappy
of course , anti-usury campaigners pointed out that the whole point of parables is that they are allegorical , and that to take the story as justifying usury is a crassly literalistic reading
well , she died without giving birth to an heir ; she only ever had a daughter
said xue pan , it ’ s not so much the lies you keep telling about me
it was goethe , however , who gave a name and a personality to the seduced and abandoned woman , and the gretchen theme enters the myth along with sturm und drang and the cult of sensibility

an edict was issued in reply to this request , dismissing it as quite superfluous ; and jia zheng , his conscience a little placated , returned home and applied himself with devotion and zeal to his official duties
jia rui , who chanced to overhear him , called out from his bed :
have you quite recovered , cousin ?
truly this traffic in rents must be a sign and a symbol that the world , for its grievous sins , has been sold to the devil

at this he became so exasperated that he picked the kite up , threw it down on the ground again , and pointed his finger at it in anger
at about ten o ’ clock it began to take effect

i didn ’ t tell mother because i knew she was busy and not feeling very well , said tan-chun
tan-chun ’ s shoulders began to shake as she said this and she ended up by bursting into tears
ivory chopsticks with triple gold inlay , four bundles
dai-yu evidently had something on her mind that she wanted to say but was finding difficulty in expressing
i have to economize , she would say , to make up for what sir she wastes

bao-chai was about to elaborate , when a maid arrived to inform her that her presence was required at lady wang ’ s
i never heard of such a thing !
those of us who are in the master ’ s confidence daren ’ t say a word to upset the mistress ’ s boys ; but she can say or do whatever she likes to us
a speedy end was also predicted for xi-feng , since aunt zhao had named her as her own accuser in the nether world

somewhat puzzled by this request , cook liu pointed out that on this particular occasion the catering was all being done in the outside kitchen
i ’ m going straight over to see ying-chun about this , she
bao-chai now knew the full truth , and in her own mind blamed her mother for making a foolish decision
where are you going now , coz ?
she ’ d never have dared to otherwise
our story must leave them for the time being
i say this not because we are future sisters-in-law but because we are friends

it was left to bao-yu to make what conversation he could with the women as he continued to eat his lunch

what shall i do with flowers when i have no hair to stick them in ?
any irregularities reported to his superiors were discounted by them in view of jia zheng ’ s record for scrupulous honesty
why did it have to be us ?
do you believe in an after life ?
the self is split up the middle—
the receipt of this reply seemed to throw the jia family into an even greater frenzy of preparation than before , so that even its new year celebrations that year were somewhat scamped
if you ’ re afraid too , and think that a proper funeral will get us into trouble , then no one will dare to give her old ladyship her due
we can give it to them , if you like , before they go
she can marry her to whomever she likes

they said as he entered
isn ’ t it bao-chai ’ s birthday the day after tomorrow ?
this put xi-feng on her mettle
bao-yu spoke to me about this when he got back from his visit the other day
he calls the spectacle a specious form of the sacred ( ) and a visible negation of life
xue pan , elated by his success , sat with a cup of wine in one hand and his arm round the shoulders of one of the pretty pot-boys
you must inform mother immediately that her pres¬ence is required at once at the palace
after a good deal more advice to jia rong on how he was to conduct himself , cousin zhen went inside to see you-shi and
i tried asking her what the matter was , but she wouldn ’ t speak , just sat there crying
the brighter colours definitely wouldn ’ t do
you can ’ t if j won ’ t let you , said bao-yu
she was about to shed tears once more ; but just then her parrot , which had been perched aloft under the verandah eaves , seeing that his mistress had returned , flew down with a sudden squawk that made her jump
crimson came up to her :
there ’ s always another way out
lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife , thinking that there might be other stolen articles in the kitchen , ordered a thorough search , in the course of which the packet of lycoperdon was discovered
jia lian was released , while jia she ’ s domestic staff , men and women alike , were all taken away into public service
incidentally , i assume you know perfectly well where the criminal is hiding ?
a very earnest young woman offers
if she followed the path in the wrong direction , it will have taken her to our back courtyard
he found san-jie so altered on this visit as to seem almost a different person er-jie , too , showed herself so careful and competent in her manage¬ment of the little household that he could see there would be no need to worry about either of them while he was away
oh , he didn ’ t say anything , lied aroma
please , for your soul ’ s sake , earn a bit of merit : don ’ t try to make me do that !
dai-yu and the others added their entreaties to musk ’ s , and xiu-yan left with all speed for green bower hermitage
jia qiang knew quite well that it would be futile even to try ; he let a day go by and then gave a false report that lady wang had refused his request
the following day they went in a body and tendered their resignations to a bewildered jia zheng , who commented somewhat naively :
after thinking for a bit , cousin zhen turned to jia rong :
a piece of fresh lotus root , ever so crisp and crunchy , as thick as that , look , and as long as that ;
nannie li did not know whether to feel upset or amused
and burning nard the chamber purifies

when father and son met there was a tearful scene , which we need not describe in detail
xi-feng was at hand to lend her support
send this fellow in to see me , and find somewhere for him to stay
her only reply was to give orders that they should all be locked up again and remain so until cousin zhen could deal with them when he got back
so for this last year or two they ’ ve been really comfortably off
our narrative returns now to dai-yu
and fell at the old lady ’ s feet , hugging her by the knees
what about paragons of virtue ?
at last bao-yu could withdraw
just about everyone in this establishment nowadays seem to spend their time discussing my shortcomings
bedtime , said aroma firmly
i daren ’ t risk angering her old ladyship and upsetting the whole household
slipping from his horse , he ordered the servants to help xue pan to his feet
why don ’ t i give you a rub , and then maybe you ’ ll be able to have a little nap ?
in time to come , if we enioy your blessing and can once more regain his majesty ’ s favour , then we shall do our utmost to atone for past errors , to restore the family fortune and to support you into your hundredth year
this is a consequence of your refusal to study properly
who knows , you may even be right
it ’ s only just recently that you ’ ve begun to look a bit better
i suppose i too must look to my own sur¬vival , he said in the end
pleased to find you here , sir , said lai da
of course i ’ ll come and say good-bye to you , said xiang-lian
it ’ s not really a very good match , she said , but i don ’ t suppose it will show very much when it ’ s been darned
i should just push on , if i were you
it ’ s a poor gift , but it ’ s given with a warm heart !
you go back to sleep anyway
he is unable to read the visible signs of the universe as referring to an ulterior referent , and is therefore deprived of the consolation which the archangel offers to adam and eve : doubt not but in valley and in plain / god is as here , and will be found alike / present , and of his presence many a sign / still following thee ( – )
if anything needs doing , aunt xue , just let me know and i ’ ll do what i can
very well then , grandmother jia concurred
i don ’ t want them all making fun of me again
xi-feng too could not re¬strain herself from remarking cryptically :
aroma , when she heard , was over¬joyed , and brought her hands piously together in a prayer of thanks to lord buddha
and when we have anything special here , like pheasant or roebuck , we can always arrange for a share of it to be sent over to them
for these legends agree upon , and eventually unite around , the proposition that performative signification and the consequent objectification of the subject are the work of the devil
when i came to the capital from my old home on mount xuan¬-mu , i had hoped to make a name for myself
the fourth table was occupied by the remaining maids , nightingale , oriole , skybright , periwinkle and chess , sitting around it in no particular order
'they are small items in themselves , said patience , 'but i should think if you added them all together the total annual saving would be well over four hundred taels
she said i only refused out of laziness and unwillingness to learn
she stared at dai-yu , laughed and continued :
what makes you say that ?
he begins by considering a common defense of limited usury :
surely , you will say , a household as long established and highly cultivated as the jias ’ must have had several well-known talents at its disposal which it could have called upon for such important purposes as these ?
that ’ s more like it !
ne ’ er leave me , ne ’ er abandon me :
then , closing the door of the inner room carefully behind her and letting down the flower-patterned portiere~ she went out to wake snow-goose , taking the full spittoon with her
a deficiency of humour in the lungs would give rise to sudden attacks of giddiness , sweating at five or six in the morning , and a sinking feeling rather like the feeling you get in a pitching boat
you worry too much , mrs lai , said xi-feng
the relationship between symbol and thing , which is presented in part one primarily as the difference between word and concept , is represented [ in the paper money scene ] as the tension between coined or paper money and commodity

his immediate reac¬tion on reading the memorial was to ask for particulars of jia jing ’ s official rank
of him no more
when at last morning came , jia rui saw the gate at the east end open and an old woman pass through to the gate opposite and call for someone to open up
but before she could say any more , bao-yu cut in and hurriedly changed the subject
well , the waiter turned out to be a daring sort of rogue himself he stuck his head out and challenged mr pan to hit him
jia qiang hurriedly handed him a list of the pieces they had rehearsed , together with a brochure containing the stage names of each of the twelve players and some notes on the parts which each of them played
aunt xue spat at her , and cried indignantly :
to lady wang , too , this seemed the most likely explanation
my daughter ying-lian was , as you know , kidnapped when she was a little girl
if her grace should really need them again , we can always buy some more
having waited until noon , he inquired whether xi-feng was back yet , and being informed that she was , he wrote out a form of receipt , took it round to the lians ’ apartment , and sent in word that he had called for his tally
i don ’ t suppose anyone else will want that title
often in the past you ’ ve said to me , now i know how busy you are , feng , but your health is important : you ought to find means somehow or other of taking a rest
she was showing her out , when adamantina gave a little laugh and said :
wang xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable , which she wore about the house for warmth , fastened on with a pearl ¬studded bandeau
it was as though she were under some sort of spell
with a touch of the whip he was away once more , still talk¬ing to tealeaf over his shoulder as he rode ahead
how do you get these ideas ?
jia lian thought for a moment :
you have only to look at the way the servants ’ wives are already decking themselves out in all sorts of fancy gold and silver ornaments to know what ’ s been going on
the books , too , are spoiled , by the false interpretations they put upon them
he lay there tossing and turning , a thousand wild fancies running through his head , and only nodded off some time after three in the morning
the two ladies stood up , meanwhile , politely demurring :
and as the days are so long now , i was afraid you might be going to sleep after lunch and making yourselves ill i ’ m glad you ’ ve found a way of keeping yourselves amused - where ’ s aroma ?
he laid down his chopsticks and rose to go , but xi-feng put a hand out and detained him :
those in charge have felt encouraged to abuse their authority , until finally an appalling thing like this can happen an innocent young life cut off by violence
so shall the credle do ,
no , no , you can ’ t , said lady wang
promiscuous liberty granted the goldsmiths to trade in bullion has grown to that licentiousnesss , that they have for divers years presumed , for their private gain , to sort and weigh all sorts of money current within our realm , to the end to cull out the old and new monies , which , either by not wearing , or by any other accident , are weightier than the rest , which weightiest monies have not only been molten down for the making of plate , & c , but even traded in and sold to merchant-strangers , & c , who have exported the same , whereby the consumption of coins has been greatly occasioned , as also the raising of the silver even of our own monies to a rate above what they are truly current for
use value in favor of exchange value , like the hoarding miser , and it also fostered an unproductive conspicuous consumption that seemed akin to the behavior of hogs
do you think there was some unexplained mystery behind it ?
have you been quarrelling over the rice-cakes ?
there was only one way of escape left
and out she went
he followed their example by pillowing his head on the
he looked round and saw that it was dai-yu
she evidently thought she could take advantage of that
for the inscription on the stone we ought to have the hopeful sign
jia qin picked it up and read it
if anyone from any other apartment notices you , you are to tell them on no account to mention it at the naiad ’ s house
then suppose grandmother finds out ?
i thought that the fuss made when they found out that things were missing would die down in a day or two
patience had no sooner climbed down from the kang than she heard footsteps outside
his deeds are honourably reported
xi-feng said to him
the three of them mounted the bank and strode off into the snow
will you take your own sash off , please , so that i can put it on instead ?
the wood had a grain like areca palm and a fragrance suggestive of musk and sandalwood
don ’ t mind him ; just stay where you are !
but with our rong-guo cousins it ’ s different
on hearing jia lian ’ s words she became articulate once more :
he has taken a fancy to lady jia ’ s maid faithful and wants her for his concubine ; and he has given me the job of asking lady jia for her
it must be some jewel or precious stone
if it is a fake , give it to me !
well , cheer up , it ’ s not number serious as all that !
eternity in return for two dozen years of power ; the writer agrees to the ruination of his life and gains ( but only if he ’ s lucky ) maybe not eternity , but posterity , at least
she says it makes her uncomfortable
lady wang now addressed landscape and xi-chun ’ s other maids :
in fact , we in the west need to question the categorical distinction we make between
i ’ ve come to warn you , said magpie , addressing herself in an urgent whisper to bao-yu
from this point on , faust will habitually impose the eidolon that he has fetishized and mistaken for the ideal form of beauty onto the living women he encounters , thus dehumanizing them and replacing their subjective essence with an objective image
jia yun recognized the voice as bao-yu ’ s and hurried up the steps inside
between seventy and eighty taels of silver we ’ ve had out of him during this past year
suddenly it occurred to him :

i sent rong to draw it this morning , said you-shi
he terminated the interview by going into the inner room to change his clothes
after that she de¬parted with her mother , the latter indicating as they went , by many a sniff and sigh , the hatred that she dared net express more openly
jia zheng looked up
he does not shrink from confronting the logical problem posed by this state of affairs : a question may indeed be raised , whether there is any excellence at all in a slave beyond and higher than merely instrumental and ministerial qualities—whether he can have the virtues of temperance , courage , justice , and the like ; or whether slaves possess only bodily and ministerial qualities
the wretched girl , already half-dead with fright , now wept for terror and knocked her head repeatedly on the ground , entreating xi-feng for mercy
butler therefore opposes feminisms that seek to extend autonomous subjectivity to women , and advocates instead an assault on the notion of autonomous subjectivity per se : the identity of the feminist subject ought not to be the foundation of feminist politics
poor sapientia was so overcome with shame that she slipped away in the dark
since i ’ ve got such a bad reputation anyway , i might as well have something to show for it when i ’ m gone !
assuming that it must be aroma , he sat down on the edge of it and gave her a push
i didn ’ t like it at all
she will be coming over presently to say goodbye , ma ’ am
and tell them that we shall want lunch served in the garden tomorrow as well
the sudden appearance in their midst of xi-feng , bao-yu and qin zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one
the historical johann faust was a marginal , albeit intriguing , figure , but his boasting , clowning , and sexual misbehavior fitted him to fill a particular void in anti-magical discourse
well , here i am—and of course it ’ s exactly as i said it would be
if you deign to accede to my request , allow me to provide for you and accommodate you in my humble abode close by in the capital , that i may derive daily benefit from your wisdom
he says he is making a social call , and when i asked for his visiting card he told me there was no need for any such formality , as he was on the best of terms with you , sir
aroma pretended to scold
the words bao-yu had spoken to her that afternoon came flashing into her mind
tan-chun broke off as patience entered and indicated a low stool for her to sit on
and why couldn ’ t you have warned us in time ?
the metropolitan official referred to in censor li ’ s impeachment is in fact uncle she : which means that he is implicated in a miscarriage of justice - which is a serious offence
there are all sorts of objectionable things in the directions
but jia huan was in no position to act as his creditor , having himself never had a penny of his own , and having already squandered his mother ’ s savings
we told him he wasn ’ t ready for it , but he wouldn ’ t believe us
don ’ t take any notice of her !
and yet look at this calamity that ’ s befallen adamantina now - why couldn ’ t she have predicted that ?
word had already been sent to jin-gui ’ s family
that is strange , said bao-chai
i expect to live until i am at least a thousand
we shall be all right !
they had concluded their discussion in gathering dusk , and now moved back into the lamplit outer room and watched the ladies at their cards for a while
alas , this only reminded her that she had no real sister of her own and numberhe began to cry
at these words jia rui ’ s soul almost left its seat in his body
let me try looking into it as he says , and holding it up to his face he looked into the back as instructed and saw a grinning skull , which he covered up hastily with a curse :
don ’ t let ’ s stand here talking to the nasty creature , said a third
what a consolation that would be for your elder brother ’ s death , she went on , addressing bao-yu again
i ’ d forgotten she was at the party

in her last hour , when i might else have gone to her , i was called in haste from the garden by a father ’ s summons ; when , grieving , i sought to take leave of her abandoned body , i could not see it because it had been removed by a mother ’ s command ; and when i was told that her corpse had been consumed , i repented of my jesting vow that we should share the same grave-hole together , for that were now impossible , and that our ashes should commingle , for ash she is already become

xi-chun told her that adamantina had visited her , and that she had stayed on to play go and keep her company during the night

the other servants had returned to their master ’ s boat to find the cabin empty and were told by the boatman that jia zheng had gone on shore in pursuit of two monks and a taoist

yu-cun hurriedly took a sedan-chair to the palace
just then one of the maids came in to announce another arrival
what you have said exactly describes how it is with her ; there is no need for us to tell you anything more

the incense and paper-offerings for the ceremony , the wedding-feast and marriage-bed had all been made ready long before she arrived
but i don ’ t under-stand why she should want to hide things from me
notable among them was hermes trismegistus , a syncretic , mythical figure who would come to dominate the alternative , occult theories of divinity which christianity will label as magic

jia lian : where are the women who were supposed to be on night-duty in the inner apartments ?
is that all the thanks i get for helping to bring the two of you together ?
a little later two young lads came in , younger sons of stewards lai and lin
if you really don ’ t tell anyone about this stupid mistake of mine , i promise to honour you as if you were my mother
faithful knows the truth now , and she doesn ’ t hold mrs lian to blame any longer
yes , indeed , said yu-cun
so that ’ s what it is !
just at that moment , a diminutive page¬boy went flashing past
which is this : our exchequer has for a long time been completely empty - in fact , more than empty
gentlemen of the jia family !
after being carried for what seemed a very great length of time , she saw , on the north front of the east-west street through which they were passing , two great stone lions crouched one on each side of a triple gateway whose doors were embellished with animal-heads

and there was no master jin ’ when he saw him , either : it was jin !
why grieve to watch
it ’ s no good to me , said aunt xue , but i ’ ve an idea your grandmother may be going out now
if it hadn ’ t been for this little escapade of yours , our guests would have left long ago
xi-feng , seeing him , was herself deeply affected ; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make qin-shi even more distressed , whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up , she rallied him lightly on his tears
he got up to go
grandmother jia saw him come in and asked him :
jia zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently
who did you get this from ?
just as he was dropping off , skybright walked into the room looking exactly as she used to do before she was ill she came right up to the bed and spoke to him
bao-yu had been about to leave the room , but at xi-feng ’ s mention of fivey had stood there bemused
is this what you ordered ?
to give up either one would be unkind
is mrs lian in ?
i see , said bao-yu
most people keep a cat to keep down the mice for them
we only write for the fun of it ourselves , said tan-chun

she sat staring into the mirror
meanwhile , when not actually engaged in discharging ceremonial duties , he spent all the time on his own in a quiet , out-of-the-way corner of the mansion , in a state of incommunicado with the other members of the family
you really are the limit !
cousin xue , this time i think you do have to pay the forfeit
i read once more this sad lament ,
her husband lives nearby
now , if the grain is not going to be taken in and delivered on time , what ’ s the point of your being here at all ?
let me try to put it for you in a nutshell
i ’ d like to ask her where she got that child from
it sounds as if the blood-gate has burst
'the almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travel¬ling , he went on , addressing yu-cun again
lady wang meanwhile had finally concluded that she must inform jia zheng of xi-chun ’ s determination to shave her head and take holy vows
as they approached jin-gui ’ s apartment , they could hear the storm continuing unabated inside

bao-chai told aroma to take him some tea , and then decided to go out herself and join him , surmising that he was nervous of an impending confrontation with his father , when his failure to make any progress in his studies would be discovered ( and no doubt punished )
why don ’ t you run round to the kitchen and ask them to heat it up for her ? — nannie , she said , addressing the old woman , you

he peered closely at an embroidered purse that she was wearing and expressed a strong interest in one of her rings
mongolian suslik , twenty-four squares
since humour can not circulate , it has congealed into phlegm
once you start taking bird ’ s nest , you ’ ve got to keep it up , and it seemed to me that as cousin bao is really here as our guest , it would be rather boorish to keep asking her for more ; on the other hand it would be rather awkward to have to ask lady wang for it ; so i dropped a hint to grandma , and i rather think that she had a word on the subject with feng
her fur-clad master ’ s somewhat worse for wine ;
lovey took this message to you-shi , who proceeded to go through the list deciding how much should go to whom and making arrangements for the delivery
you really shouldn ’ t go to such lengths on young chai ’ s account
your timetable will be as follows :
they both agreed on this strategy , called on ladies xing and wang , and then went through the motions of trying to dissuade xi-¬chun , who was every bit as adamant as they had predicted
they probably won ’ t be free to come over , though
thank goodness she ’ s better !
now , it seems , you have got your muddy paws onto your wife 's own maid that she brought with her from her home
jia zheng had been sitting on a mat on the floor , and had asked master zhen on arrival to sit at a chair , an invitation that master zhen had ( very properly ) declined , since his senior was seated at a lower level
tell me , the old lady continued , how was qiao-jie when you went to see her yesterday ?
it was but yesterday that i painted those delicate smoke black eyebrows ; and who is there today to warm the cold jade rings for her fingers ?
we just need to choose an auspicious day to exchange presents in pro¬per style , and then set a date for the wedding itself , possible afterwards
jia lian had no choice but to escort the monk to the reception hall and then hurry over to inform jia zheng ; who was enormously relieved by the news , and sent for the monk straight away , bowing to him and expressing his profound thanks
he therefore opened up the gate in the outer wall of pear-tree court giving on to the passage-way between the two mansions which led into two dukes street
having sent his representative along well in advance with offerings for the departed spirit , he presently arrived himself , seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the streets before him , to present his offerings in person
so mrs zhu has given orders for all the paths to be cleared of leaves - that ’ s what all the shout¬ing was about
i ’ m not feeling well
you-shi predictably had a barbed comment to make :
you shouldn ’ t all take the old girl so seriously , said bao-yu
how could nightingale know that the mere mention of these homely names , intended to reassure and comfort , was enough to conjure up again the horror of the night¬mare ?
the story you ’ ve just been listening to is called falsehood exposed , or the tale of a grandmother
he asked for a tray and zhang guang handed him a tea¬tray of black lacquer , asking :
that ’ s why i came over
she said , i know it ’ s hard for you to refuse them , but even salt and soy sauce cost something , and we don ’ t want you to end up out of pocket
probably she dislikes skybright just for being beautiful

if he ’ s not going , it must be because he is still angry about yesterday ; or if it-isn ’ t that , it must be because he ’ s heard that i ’ m not going and doesn ’ t want to go without me
and i have a few jars of choice new wine of my own brewing
well , well an ingenious idea , i must say !
i must be on my way to see tan
none of the rest of us knows how it ’ s done
bao-yu hauled qin zhong from the room
it will be humiliating for her to discover that my prediction was right , and that will make her angry ; and then she ’ ll take it out on me—which won ’ t be very amusing
grandmother jia turned to the two women :
discussion of commodified religion is from areopagitica : a wealthy man , addicted to his pleasure and to his profits , finds religion to be a traffic so entangled , and of so many piddling accounts , that of all mysteries he can not skill to keep a stock going upon that trade
autonomous subjectivity is thus not only oppressive in itself , it is also a male preserve and , rather than extend to women the rights of subjectivity , it is preferable to deconstruct the subject/object binary altogether
keep an eye on him , said nannie li to the maids
one day when spring has gone and youth has fled ,
he ’ s sure to ask you to that
i forbid you to utter another word of such gloomy nonsense
grandmother jia and the others were now sobbing audibly and were much too overcome to reply
dai-yu sat motionless for a con¬siderable while , then finally began her morning toilet , negligently , her eyes still brimming with tears
it ’ s a good job there are so many of us working in the garden and no one can ever remember who is related to who , otherwise they might get the impression that the people in my family do nothing but quarrel all the time
why did you say that ?
the quantitative relation between them overrides their qualitative essences
a faint smile crossed the old man ’ s face
oh go on , nannie i ’ bao-yu pleaded good-humouredly
he ’ s a good-looking boy , though , and his grandmother ’ s favourite , so there ’ s not much his father and mother can do about it
how are you going to show your face anywhere when other people get to hear about it ?
- raise the blind a bit and see
they knelt manchu-style and did homage as her grace ’ s most hum¬ble servants ’ , before ushering the imperial delegation through the gateway and across the courtyard to the main reception-hall , where they begged them both to be seated
why make yourself miserable when you have got them ?
take your p earl for instance
what other mrs lian ?
you have , for a start , said aunt zhao
she wiped her eyes , curled the third and fourth fingers of her left hand back against the side of her mouth and with a supreme effort half bit half tore off the two two-inch lengths of scallion-like nail that projected from them
she turned away and began marching out , but xi-feng ran after and detained her
tomorrow i have to go to xing-yi , by the way
why aren ’ t you over there ?
some gaily-dressed maids were sitting on the steps of the main building opposite
she says there ’ s nothing wrong with her and that i ’ m trying to make her ill by talking about it
the presents distributed were as follows :
no sooner had he arrived at his new post than a case in¬volving manslaughter was referred to his tribunal
patience , whose gentle nature was easily overawed , at once left off , tearfully protesting that it was cruel of them to speak about her in such a way behind her back
oh , you ’ re so useless , you make me sick !
it would be just the same if you were to hear someone at my place complaining about me
now that you ’ ve all moved inside , of course , it ’ s rather out of their hands ; but they won ’ t give up
yes , replied lady wang
half angrily , half tearfully she begged jia lan :
how are you going to explain how you got to know about it ?
well , i ’ d better be going now
grannie will be very cross with you
it was only the ear-rings that gave her away
only in this instance i hope that now you ’ ve hit me you won ’ t from now on go around hitting other people
what are you doing ?
it was she , in fact , who had brought the embroidered bag to lady wang , and she had trailed along to xi-feng ’ s place out of curiosity , to see what she would do about the discovery
when he heard this , bao-yu threw aside his books and reverted to the drifting , aimless way of life that was customary with him
one was for corrupting the sons of noble families , encouraging them to gamble and that sort of thing
his attendants have already beaten the drum twice
i thought perhaps you might be able to tell me what they were
i don ’ t wonder the young ladies call you busybody , said aroma
the thieves came during the fourth and fifth watches , just after we finished duty
jia zheng went chasing after them along the slippery track , but although he could spy them ahead of him , somehow they always remained just out of reach
if i still mean anything to you , then the one thing i beg of you is to look after little qiao-jie when i ’ m gone
he led them round the gauze hangings of a summer-bed , then through a door into a garden full of rambler roses
what we really need is a sponsor to settle these matters for us
jia lian : why didn ’ t you tell uncle zheng about this , that one of the burglars was zhou rui ’ s adopted son , and that he had been killed by bao yong ?
i ’ ve got nothing at all of my own , absolutely nothing
xiu-yan hung her head and the reply she made was scarcely audible
it doesn ’ t look as if i shall ever get better
it was created in ancient times to help man purify himself and lead a gentle and sober life , to quell all wayward pas¬sions and to curb every riotous impulse
as he pursued this train of thought to its logical conclusion , a line from zhuang-zi came into his mind : this life , this insubstantial tissue of vanity , floats like a cloud on the wind !
with that he gave bao-yu a hefty shove
the little girl is suffering from a convulsive attack com¬plicated by an internal fever
if yoli look too close , the cupboard ’ s bare !
we must tell the ser¬vants not to go talking about this to everyone they meet
the girls looked at each other blankly , trying to remember
things mustn ’ t be allowed to go on like this !
who , world-disdainer , shares your hiding-place ?
bao-yu ’ s delight knew no bounds
we don ’ t need reminding how powerful your rong-guo relations are !
i was originally one of her old ladyship ’ s
bao-yu hurried over to li wan ’ s side and studied the dice : the red and green pips were symmetrically paired
stopping before this blind , the lady-in-waiting turned to bao-yu and said :
he was a regular waiter , replied li
this was certainly not the sort of answer aroma was used to getting
i haven ’ t felt like seeing anyone since that beating , he thought , and some excuse for getting away from every-body for a year or so is just what i ’ ve been looking for
all my life i ’ ve lived with her old ladyship , and now that she ’ s dead i ’ ve nowhere to turn
he read the lines through and thought of sticking them up on his wall
well i ’ ve got you now , and you won ’ t escape me !
bao-yu took this as confirmation of his hypothesis
their meeting can not have been coincidental
lin zhi¬xiao ’ s wife shoved her off impatiently
this mr cao smiled and said :

lady wang thought that bao-yu must at last have been found and rising from her bed she exclaimed with delight :
do all in your power to show that you are worthy of the trust
hurriedly he made his birthday kotow to xi-feng
at the end of the second month i intend to set you your maiden theme
the rich man ’ s fortune now all vanished ,
i would like to start a heart business , a market for human hearts , a shop for human hearts , a supermarket for human heart , permanent sale

she crossed bridges , she walked round each tiny mountain ’ , and every once in a while she stopped to look about her and admire the view
you should a taken a look at yourself in the mirror before you went inside , missus !
i ’ ve just had a look - she didn ’ t seem to be there , said amber
soon after this bao-chai dropped in
the young woman laughed
our ancestors could not escape their crude perceptions without falling into superstitions still more crude
well , let me consult you myself
jia lian duly came in and paid his respects to lady wang
i want everyone to enjoy themselves , he said
there is absolutely no need to go rushing off in person , shouting and hollering at them
the others all accepted this as a satisfactory conclusion of the performance
you know you ’ re the one the master trusts
i ’ ve still got lots of these things
but then your dice in the next line bring us back again to the banal
he needed no iron flute to teach him those arts
after thinking for a while , she produced the following
presently lunch was served for the ladies
we ought to start our lunch now
but given its omnipresence , one has to participate in it one way or another
it was nothing to do with you
they kept it up like this for some time
having made the decision , he thanked ni er with a smile :
they expect to be home by the end of the spring
the two of them had already written their poems out while bao-yu was still thinking
by now li wan and the three girls had also arrived for their evening duty , and when all had wished lady wang good night they departed to their different rooms
he records spies ’ s close connections with the ecclesiastical and secular governors of frankfurt , and claims that [ t ] he narrator took his role as a representative of the religious and secular authorities seriously , and he had no difficulty imagining what the authorities expected faustus to have experienced and felt
your honour used to be decisive enough in the old days , said the usher with a smile
the best present you could have brought aroma would have been a couple of those cheap agate rings like the ones you sent us the other day
with a shake of his sleeve shi-yin was gone
all right , we won ’ t tell
his greatest anxiety is always how not to offend them
trust you to know that !
these two sacks are the ones you brought the vegetables in when you came
i should only keep you awake
but to hear her talk now , she seems quite the same as ever
but can you really pull it off ?
i shall do my best to give satisfaction , sir , said bao er
adamantina picked up the brush and began , muttering and writing by turns , until , having knocked off some dozen or so couplets , all in the same apparently effortless manner , she laid the brush down again and handed the paper over for the other two to read
a couple of days and it will probably be all right again
she had the duck cradled in her right attn
but she never bore a grudge against me , countered xi-feng with a smile
come on , that ’ s ’ enough
he imagines that faust ’ s soul can be captured by physically pulling off its wings , a term he evidently understands in a myopically literal sense
they ’ ll get round to it in time
from a protestant perspective , such thinking misconceives of redemption in quantitative , financial terms , and this ultimately leads faustus into fatalistic despair
he is presented as a man for whom intention , or any other form of interior subjectivity , is non-existent
dai-yu picked up a writing-brush , i ’ ll write it down for you while you recite it , she said
how can she ever get better if she herself won ’ t face up to the fact that she is ill ?
yes , tomorrow ’ s her birthday , he said
i ran into them in the back courtyard , kissing each other and feeling arses as plain as anything
some said they would give one tael , others two
there are far too many of them
but it ’ s our only hope !
this is all your fault , mr rui , sir
ban-chai supplied two more without too much difficulty
you still have to make a couplet on this place
but if he does seem at all pleased at the news , it will make things rather more com¬plicated
ten , who was lounging complacently in a chair with one foot propped on his other knee and his chest puffed out , asked him what his business was with mr zhou
incidentally , you may not think it matters very much if the arrangements for other people ’ s winter clothing get put off , but what about the clothing for the girls ?
this is the new year holi¬days , when their ladyships and the young ladies are all en¬joying themselves

patience hurriedly wiped it off and fetched water for her to wash with
you have to decide which to bring into the foreground and which to push into the background , which to leave out altogether and which to show only in glimpses
he said tell her ladyship to try and get hold of some a bit fresher than this
still , it should be interesting
why don ’ t we part company here and each go about his own business ?
turning then , he had formally reproved parfumee for her belligerency and then sent her on an errand to the kitchen

no , the girl in that picture isn ’ t wearing a cape like that—and she isn ’ t half as pretty as qin , either
bao-yu and miss lin have been together ever since they were little , and this has never troubled me , as i have always thought of them as children
according to you i am to wait until mother ’ s anger has subsided and after that wait until a favourable opportunity arises for talking to grandmother ; but what makes you think that skybright ’ s illness will wait that long ?
the devil ’ s admonition is of no avail , and nor is helen ’ s own protestation that she is merely an idol
now that bao-yu and the other two had joined the company , it would hardly be right for them to sit on the floor with jia zheng ; nor on the other hand could they remain standing while master zhen , their contemporary , was seated below
i ’ ll come over to you
i ’ m afraid my knowledge of poetry is strictly limited , however , i happened to see a couplet on someone ’ s wall yesterday which has stuck in my mind ; and as one line in it is about something i can see here , i shall use it to finish my turn with

she could not tell whether he ever did rinse his mouth or not , as the next she knew he was giggling and asking her :
lady wang drew aroma towards her
between this hedge of trees and the lower slope of the hill was a rustic well , furnished with both well-sweep and windlass
things seemed more hopeful now , and relative calm was restored
and if you destroy your arcs and lines , throw away your compasses and set-squares and break the fingers of chui the cunning , people will begin to make proper use of their own skill…
san-jie shouted , half angrily and half in jest
it evidently seemed credible to baines that marlowe would aver [ t ] hat if there be any god or any good religion , then it is in the papistes because the service of god is performed with more cerimonies , as elevation of the mass , organs , singing men , shaven crowns & cta
jin-gui had intended to feign anger with her darling , but there was something so appealingly boyish about the flush on his cheeks and the slightly befuddled innocence in his eyes , that her heart melted and her feigned hostility fled to the distant land of java
the murdered man was my master , your honour
he plans to retire for a few years and leave everything in your hands , uncle
said jia lian—though not ill ¬humouredly
bao-yu glanced back at her :
then i watched you go into xi-chun ’ s courtyard
now it appears that you were in here , work¬ing yourself into a rage

this was followed by several blows
human figures are no problem , said dai-yu

during the past few months , she said , i ’ ve managed to save up another ten strings or so of cash

but before i have had a chance to do anything , you have to come along and start making things diffi¬cult for me

silly old fool , to scare me like that !
give her to me !
if you ’ ve something on your mind , then just go ahead and say it !
he turned to tealeaf : treacherous little beast i what are you still kneeling for ?
as a child she was always ailing and her parents paid for any number of proxy novices in the hope that she would get better ; but all was of no avail
my name was golden oriole originally , said oriole , but miss bao found it too much of a mouthful , so she called me just oriole for short , and now everyone else does

bao yong offers his humble respects , sir

he was shown to his temporary quarters by some of the servants , and there we must leave him
i wouldn ’ t expect you to remember the likes of us !
the buildings belonging to the garden of spices ’ she named all-spice court ’
you had an inside counter¬attack up your sleeve
who ’ s been upsetting you then ?
but who could bear a grudge against bao-yu ?
the primary principle of sympathy is similarity or imitation : like produces like , an effect resembles its cause
he made his way back to his apartment in a mood of profound depression , said not a word , did not even smile , but stared vacantly into space
then she thought to herself , of course !
credit here designates the economic credibility , or creditworthiness , that witgood has gained only by presenting an appropriate

xi-feng appeared to be thinking , and to be growing angrier and angrier the more she thought

thereupon he , forced him to the ground , and , with the utmost savagery , dealt him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo , after which he forbade him to eat and made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared the equivalent of ten days ’ homework
i don ’ t think we need be too strict about that , said jia zheng

but what you seem to have forgotten is that if their ladyships get to hear , the likes of us will be torn to shreds and ground to powder !

she fell back and collided with amber , who looked up in turn , screamed and stood rooted to the spot
and the play reprises all the now-familiar motifs of the legend
her affianced , now a young man of nineteen , was a gambler and a wastrel

a little smile played over bao-yu ’ s face and he nodded
see if you can tell me the answers
the others rose and invited her to be seated
how dare you talk such nonsense !
while she was speaking , the drumming began again
but as he was passing by the gateway of xi¬-feng ’ s courtyard , it happened that xi-feng herself was stand¬ing in her doorway with one foot on the threshold , grooming her teeth with an ear-cleaner and keeping a watchful eye on nine or ten pages who were moving potted plants about under her direction
you ’ re lucky then , said li wan
her silence only increased bao-yu ’ s own misgivings , and finally in some embarrassment he stood up and said :
i thought we hadn ’ t heard the last of that
at next day ’ s session a group of well-known associates of the wanted man were brought in and subjected by yu-cun to careful questioning
don ’ t be so stuffy , chai !
the doctor left and the ladies all returned to their apart¬ments in much improved spirits
why , we have fewer servants for lady jia ’ s funeral than we had for qin ke-qing ’ s !
is your mistress any better , patience ?
dai-yu picked up a hazel-nut
it was just my luck , he thought to himself ; to have been lumbered with this first prince !
still— ’ she turned to crimson , perhaps we ought to ask the party most concerned if she is willing
lady xing brought her a cup of ginseng tea , and she put her lips to it
midst odorous herbs the singer ’ s green fan hides ;
they , too , left in order of precedence and had not finally dispersed until around two o ’ clock
who it was and what she wanted will be revealed in the fol¬lowing chapter
there ’ s nothing like it for building you up if you have low vitality
cousin oaf and uncle dumbo , each with a partner , were playing six-dice grabs on the kang in the outer room
actually my idea is not to mention this to lady jia at first
nothing serious , i hope ?
and due gratitude show for the gift of a meal
first creditor : [ taking witgood aside ] do you hear , sir ?
what ’ s the matter with patience ?
the pool ’ s pink-petalled lotus crowns have gone ,
the palanquin passed through the gateway and into the first courtyard
and then there was miss lin , you must have heard about that
what if grand¬father did make a little bit of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment ?
now that he knew the kylin on the tray was like one that shi xiang-yun wore , bao-yu hurriedly picked it up and thrust it inside his jacket
when they returned , and when their master ques¬tioned them about the young lady ’ s provenance , they did not dare conceal the truth
she doesn ’ t play for the money , she just enjoys winning
is her life in danger ?
i ought to tell you that
the etymological root of avaritia in aveo , to crave , exerts its influence here
he ordered them to find one , but they were stumped too
cousin , i ’ ve come to pay you my respects !
friends and rel¬atives were all eager to celebrate , but he was not in festive mood
music is an apt medium through which to explore such shifts in the status of representation , for it is a non-referential or autonomous form of expression
these were drawn from greek philosophy and the bible , and it will help to examine the hellenic and the hebraic traditions separately , in order to see what they share in common as well as how they differ
finding that he could not go on , a sort of panic gripped him
bao-yu agreed , delighted that she had accepted , and hurried back to find aroma , head low and eyes to the ground , think¬ing about caltrop all the way
it was in this way that she first came to the attention of grandmother jia
there was an answering call from the women below , and presently a number of them came for¬ward bearing trays and boxes of various shapes and sizes which they handed up onto the kang
as soon as she caught sight of xiang-yun , she hurried down into the courtyard to welcome her , and taking her by the hand , led her into the house , animatedly exchanging news with her as they went
she wept as she spoke
after dinner , tea was brought in and feng ’ s page came in and murmured something in his master ’ s ear
satan openly admits his purely psychological status , arguing that , in the age of the hyper-real , physical nonexistence is no bar to earthly dominion
bao-chai ’ s absence caused a momentary depression in bao-yu ’ s spirits , which was however soon dispelled by the presence of dai-yu
some can be sold , some kept on , as seems most appropriate
caltrop murmured a reply and went off to make her calls , beginning with grandmother jia
and the members of the family bad themselves gradually died off until only yu-cun was left there were no prospect for him in his home town , so he had set off for the capital , in search of fame and fortune

after studying it , li wan , tan-chun and bao-chai sent one of the women to obtain the drugs from outside and to supervise the making-up and administering of the medicine
in anthropology , the performative is often described as a reflexive domain , in which the performer overtly engages in acts of self-fashioning
however good a person may be to start with , once they get into that profession , they ’ re ruined
after he had gone back to his seat , the game continued
to think they should have produced a bright little thing like this between them ! —how old are you ?
your soul must fly home to its own country
i never have any savings because as soon as i ’ ve got any money i spend it all
i noticed just now that the red plum in green bower hermitage is very fine
while the three of them were leaving , bao-yu stopped to have a word with adamantina
if you get up late , people will laugh at you
i recognize that kite , said bao-yu
saladin is spectacularly rewarded for his attitude by being physically transformed into the image of satan , complete with horns , tail , and cloven hooves

i heard you chanting
yuan-chun ’ s gifts , which were delivered to the mansion by eunuchs , were :
to the latter ’ s considerable surprise and mystification he found , on going outside to look , his sister ’ s young master waiting at the gate with a servant
i was just turning it for fun , to see how it works
amber did not dare utter a word
you can ’ t expect her to stand up to your teasing in the way that we can
ying-chun saw her out as far as the courtyard gate
i ’ d never have asked her if i ’ d realized
lady xing is your own grandmother , and with your father away she has every right to make these decis¬ions
they had gone no more than a few steps out of the courtyard gate when little tangerine came running after them and handed chess a silk purse , while with the other hand she wiped her streaming eyes

certainly , the accusa-tory voice of the devil has the power to enter ivan ’ s thoughts at will , without his own volition
nightingale went in to see how dai-yu was and found the quilt in the same crumpled heap as before
the reading of these words was greeted with general laughter
he had a look at the collected sheets himself
if it has to be like this now , he said , as if to himself ; it ’ s a pity it was ever like it was in the beginning
then the elements , fire and water , bona communia , and therefore gratis to be communicated to one another ( saith cicero ) might be let out or sold for money , because mediately they are very useful

xi-feng managed to struggle through the rest of that day and the next , and early in the morning of the first of the month she had her carriage made ready , and set out for the convent of the scattered flowers , accompanied by patience and a bevy of serving-women
i would want the best for any member of the family , and especially for qiao-jie , for her parents ’ sake
she turned to you-shi
you really mustn ’ t let servants get away with it like this
i can ’ t suddenly go altering them
like taylor , milton is convinced that a hireling will automatically be drawn toward idolatry , because the conception of labor as a thing for sale involves a process of objectification analogous to that by which divinity is identified with an icon
i have made you drunk with fairy wine
i shall report to her old ladyship and mrs lian
i say nothing of other families , but the jias of the ning and rong households used to be famous for the way in which they brought up their sons
when cousin zhen first made his request , her mind had at once consented ; and now , observing that lady wang appeared to be already half persuaded , she hastened to complete the process
aunt xue happened to be in bao-chai ’ s room and heard the terrible racket they were making
patience , go back and tell your mistress : i insist that these payments should be discontinued
if only nightingale would hurry up and come back !
my dear wan , can ’ t you see what a futile waste of time this all is ?
so who was it ?
bao-yu and the other guests arranged themselves on the kang , while the seven maids and parfumee , as hosts , sat on the row of chairs below , within reach of one or other of the tables
she smiled back , however , and did her best to oblige
she sent lady wang away and told bao-yu to bid his uncle she and cousin zhen farewell and to return immediately afterwards
monks and nuns always have the best-kept gardens , said grandmother jia , in smiling approval of what she saw
i find , he said , that it is not to be
because images were not naturally efficacious , any more than money is naturally fertile , any attempt to use images for objective effects was a violation of nature , and thus satanic
yet the sovereign deity
what an uncannily apt response on the part of the oracle !
then she read the gatha
that is what everyone has been told
grannie liu , surprised and delighted ( as she showed by her many pious ejaculations ) to be receiving these further presents in addition to what patience had shown her the night before , seemed eager to accede to this request
bao-yu would never let me come back , however half¬witted he may be
but i could not bear to leave without seeing you lust once more before i go
brave ma yuan to conquest and empire was born :
i call that most insulting !
beside them stood a silver spittoon

anyway , my sister seems very happy with the idea , but she says she will have to wait until pan comes home before saying any¬thing final

there ’ s nothing seriously wrong with lady jia , said dr wang when they were seated
she and little lan still spend their days quietly together
their conversation was interrupted by a burst of angry shouting from the direction of bao-yu ’ s room
faust ’ s students seem not to be sexually tempted by simulacra , whereas one only has to look around to see that twenty-first century men and women are perfectly capable of finding erotic stimulation in mere images
her rose-fresh beauty reminded him strongly of bao-chai , but there was also something about her of dai-yu ’ s delicate charm
she turned back , blushing to the tips of her ears , but not in tune to escape the notice of the other two
she had a gentle , sweet , reserved manner
both luther and melanchthon report devil-pacts that involve satan paying money for souls , and the huge market for devil-books as well as the instant popularity of the historia itself suggest that the threat of satanic magic seemed very serious
surely you know me better than that ?
that whole match was a blunder on my elder brother ’ s part
lady wang now proceeded to inspect bao-yu ’ s things
the card-game continued until dinner-time , and it was not until after dinner that the company finally broke up

it was a surprise to him , needless to say , to call with the other pages on his sick workmate and find fivey ’ s mother at the bedside

when they saw that the old lady was tired , they all went their separate ways home
look , i ’ m not just saying this to flatter you , said jia lian , but though i know plenty of other people who have a thousand taels ’ worth of stuff in their keeping , they none of them have your courage or intelligence
a lot of these rare plants are mentioned in li sao and wen xuan , particularly in the poetical descriptions of the three capitals by zuo si
how can i eat this horrible greasy stuff ?
grandmother jia , lady wang , jia lian , patience and aroma had cried themselves into a state bordering on prostration

our familiarity with this practice may have blinded us to its implications , but these were quite visible years ago , when it was still in its infancy
bao-yu surveyed the scene approvingly
first creditor : let none of them see it , i beseech you
this was an occasion for further tears
why don ’ t i just die and get it over with ?
he closed his eyes and was lost once more in his meditations
these two couches with a pair of tables each were for grandmother jia and aunt xue
and if you are short of anything , don ’ t behave like a little frightened mouse ; ask me straight out for it , without delay
many other plays feature jews or lombards march ,
losing a thing like this is much more serious
jin-gui , on the other hand , pursued him with an eagerness that made him feel most uncomfortable
most countries in the modern world were born in debt , and the former colonial powers have successfully cooperated to ensure that they remain in that condition
isn ’ t that bao-chai ’ s place ?
just the thing , your old ladyship , said elegante drily
when they arrived outside the ning-guo mansion , tealeaf told the cabbie to stop
yesterday a little devil on the bridge offered to murder lebyadkin and marya timofeevna to resolve the matter of my legal marriage once and for all and cover all traces
and a flood of passion allows evil spirits
of course , i realize that i shall never be able to do justice to the score
simultaneously another dicing game , driving the sheep , was being played by several players sitting round a large table on the floor below
she must behave prop¬erly , if she is to earn my love
it is hard to say how long the four of them might have remained there in this impasse had not a servant arrived at that moment and summoned them to dinner in grandmother jia ’ s room
they went inside together
that meant that quite apart from the fact that they didn ’ t have to find my keep any more , they were getting an additional four or five hundred cash each month that i managed to save out of my wages
there was little pretence or illusion that the rise of finance was somehow conducive to the general good ; on the contrary it is almost always portrayed as a zero-sum game , as in george whetstone ’ s the rock of regard ( ) :
lady jia gave instructions to slip her grace ’ s eight stems and branches in with some of the maids ’ , and to ask this man to tell their fortunes
i should worry less
bother your two heads are better than one !
as soon as he was up next morning , someone came in with a message to say that the melons and mooncakes he had ordered were now ready and it only remained for him to say who they were to be sent to
he was his grand¬father ’ s favourite
i remember it now
but the usurer generally takes for the bare use ; for hazard he will run none
but now we are older it is rather different
some minutes later xi-feng and you- shi sent a servant in to inquire whether the boys would like anything else to eat , adding that they had only to ask if they wanted anything
finally only skybright ’ s trunk remained
this was one of the reasons why she tended to keep aloof from bao-yu
i ’ ll be sending someone over later
xi-feng immediately sent someone in great secrecy to explain euergesia ’ s business to brightie
arriving at the naiad ’ s house , he could see the remains of incense smoke as he entered the courtyard gate
you ’ d better keep your voices down
xi-feng went back to see him
like ravening beasts , or swarming bees after the queen has flown –
too much of this might ruin her chances of being born again
a faint light burned in the duty-room and a sliver of moon half-way up the sky shed a feeble radiance from above
'when , during this past week or two , has moonbeam had the time to go inside your room ?
at that moment lin zhi-xiao ’ s wife came in :
went into its production
see the three of them back to their room now , said grandmother jia to her women
fetch it out at once and get on with it , my girl !
one wondered what the unfortunate girls had done to deserve being considered for such a fate
but none the less , it would look very bad for a girl from a family such as ours to enter a nunnery
in fact , i shan ’ t be content unless we do
your cousins are too young for these matters and i am too busy
would you be mrs xia , ma ’ am ?
i ’ ll tell a joke instead
i know not why my heart ’ s so strangely sad ,
dai-yu affected scorn , but was blushing hotly
you should have heard her last night
you don ’ t want oriole to get a telling-off
you would poke your nose in , wouldn ’ t you , and now you ’ ve got smut on it !
never mind that , said bao-yu airily
i ’ m sure if i had , it would all have been settled long ago
yet do these flowers , of hue so rich and rare ,
said dai-yu , endeavouring to tug one of his hands away from the door-jamb
don ’ t be such an idiot !
oh , it was nothing important , said bao-yu
you go to bed too , my dear
it wasn ’ t about poetry or painting that you came to see me : it was revenge for patience you were after
so from then on oriole was put in charge
she said , rising to her feet
she ’ s a regular camel-dealer , that one
those lions outside the main gate are solid jade , and they ’ ve a golden kylin in the garden - used to be two , till one was stolen !
child , have you heard the news ?
i did tell them to stop , said jia rui , but they wouldn ’ t listen
why , at the inquest the defendant himself admitted to assaulting zhang and deal¬ing the fatal blow with the cup , and you verified the admission yourself
i ’ ve got something nice for you here and i ’ ve been waiting for you to come so that i could give it to you
some went out¬side to admire the peonies or to lean on the balustrade at the edge of the lake and look at the fish swimming in the water below
the maids there told her that they were in tan-chun ’ s apartment with the others , so she retraced her footsteps and called in at autumn studio
we ’ ve certainly never had such a mountain in our garden , and one is not going to spring suddenly from nowhere

the reference to earlier forms of globalisation ( slave trade ) is now used in order to express and contest , in a witchcraft idiom , newer forms of globalisation , such as the differential access to consumer goods and post-colonial state power
bao-chai ’ s eye came to rest on the jade
though an imperial purveyor , he was wholly innocent of business skill and savoir-faire ; and though , for his father ’ s and grand¬father ’ s sake , he was allowed to register at the ministry and receive regular payments of grain and money , everything else was looked after for him by the clerks and factors of the family business
as they laughed and chattered together , the actors even¬tually finished performing the second of the two pieces xi¬-feng had selected , whereupon the wine was removed from the tables and rice served
she was to see how aroma was and urge her not to endanger her health by excessive weeping
i ’ ve been a bit better this last day or two , so mother brought me into the garden with her for a change of air
this was probably preordained because of something they did in their past lives
the words iron threshold ’ brought xi-feng back to her senses
much better make a clean sweep of these things , she said
xue pan , by the time he had three little cupfuls of wine inside him , was already beginning to be obstreperous
mrs xia had been in full spate when jia lian made his entrance
we ’ ve just been in to see her , miss , said ebony
that ’ s why caltrop was also there at the time of mrs pan ’ s death
but it ’ s a long story
how dare you answer me back !
he wrote out a prescription , and jia zheng , seeing that it contained nothing out of the ordinary , told one of the maids to brew the ingredients up and administer the decoction to grandmother jia
something no one would ever guess
xi-feng ’ s simple recipe ’ caused grannie liu to stick her tongue out and shake her head in wonderment

witches are modernity ’ s prototypical malcontents
( – ) both satan and raphael characterize the relation of creature to creator in terms of neoplatonic emanation , as opposed to aristotelian immanent entelechy , and they thereby introduce illegitimate aspirations into the minds of adam and eve
of course bao-yu isn ’ t going to upset himself over a little thing like that
now , now , that ’ s a foolish way to talk !
cousin zhen promised to see this done and added a sugges¬tion of his own :
so that a man may say his religion is now no more within himself , but is become a dividuall movable , and goes and comes near him , according as that good man frequents the house
delighted that everything bao-yu said was so clear and to the point , the prince observed to jia zheng that the young phoenix was worthy of his sire
turning once again , this time north-wards , he made his way swiftly towards pear tree court
and then she heard scribe repeat xi-feng ’ s words , that grandmother jia intended to marry bao-yu to one of his cousins , to one that lived in the garden ; and who could that be but herself ?
it ’ s such a well-known poem i can ’ t quite recall it at present , confessed bao-yu , smiling rather sheepishly
when the cousins arrived , they first of all read the notice on the wall and then read xiang-yun ’ s poem
how can you be so hopelessly naive ?

we both agreed that if you didn ’ t make yourselves a bit more accommodating , there were sure to be one or two explosions
a new type of witches who no longer eat their victims , but who transform them into a kind of zombie and put them to work on

soon they were playing guess-fingers and singing solos
and whatever did the monk say to that ?
all right , let it pass , said dai-yu
what makes you so optimistic ?
the usher smiled coldly
a fine mess you and your rather have made of things between yul i said at the time that no good would come of this
that means that the creditor could inflict all kinds of ignominy and torture on the body of the debtor , for instance , slice off the body as much as seemed appropriate for the size of the debt : —and this point of view early on and everywhere gave rise to precise , sometimes horrific estimates going into the smallest detail , legally established estimates about individual limbs and body parts
adamantina looked at her curiously for a minute
it was forced on me by grandmother and the rest
a pot of honeyed lychees is what i ’ ve been instructed by miss bao-chai to bring to you , miss lin , replied the old woman , her features relaxing into a smile
he first performed his duty and glanced through the state papers ( which spelled out his majesty ’ s displeasure with the state of the coastal defences ) , and then left the cabinet office at once to find jia zheng and to commiserate with him on his impeachment , expressing his relief that it was not too serious a charge , and asking if his journey to the capital had been a comfortable one
as it happened lady xing didn ’ t even think it a good match
the menfolk of both rong-guo and ning-guo house had taken courage from the presence of the priests , and were gathered in the garden to watch the demon-hunt

if this matter is delayed , it isn ’ t your negligence that will be blamed but our incompetence

surely you know better by now than to joke with him ?
say that miss lin and i send our regards to her and her mother , and ask her if her illness is any better and what she ’ s taking for it
we wouldn ’ t dream of going against mrs lian

the coast was now at last clear for grannie liu to come forward and take her leave

aunt xue exploded a mouthful of tea over tan-chun ’ s skirt

i think lady allspice dealt with her subject most effect¬ively , said tan-chun
most literate people in early modern england were hermeneutically sophisticated enough to conceive of two forms of judaism : the literal and the figurative
the practical consequences of this information need no elaboration , and are in themselves sufficient proof of the felix culpa

his mother didn ’ t carry him for twenty-four months before he was born

than consolidate her ascendancy over xue pan ; then , using her feminine charms to make him her instrument , she would extend her dominion over aunt xue ; and finally bao-chai too should be brought under her control
she pulled out the drawer in li wan ’ s dressing-box , took out two little vanity-brushes , primmed her hair at the mirror , then , hurriedly replacing everything , went back into the outer room , where the others were still laughing
it leads us to neglect our studies
i think you must have been hiding it from me

the efficacy of representation and the objectification of the subject are two aspects of one process , and the sixteenth-century campaign against magic , of which the faust myth forms a central element , was concerned to establish the fact that to put one ’ s faith in the performative sign is to bring about the death of one ’ s soul
